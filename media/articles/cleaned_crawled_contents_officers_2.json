      "text": "'Shocking and angering': Officers who defended Capitol on J6 slam Trump for debate remarks\n\nTwo U.S. Capitol police officers who battled insurrectionists on January 6, 2021 are condemning former President Donald Trump's response to moderators' questions about the Capitol riot.\n\nDuring a Friday interview with CNN , former Capitol police officers Harry Dunn and Sgt. Aquilino Gonell blasted the 45th president of the United States for his refusal to take responsibility for his part in fomenting the deadliest attack on the Capitol since the War of 1812. Dunn said that for him, the moment that stood out the most in Thursday night's debate was Trump refusing to say definitively that he would accept the results of the 2024 election regardless of the outcome.\n\n\"He eventually said he would accept it if it was fair, but over 60 courts ruled that it was fair and he still didn't accept it,\" Dunn said. \"So what is the category that defines it as fair? That's what was most shocking and angering about last night, because he's already planting the seeds that could lead to another January 6.\"\n\nSgt. Gonell said that he was struck by Trump's pivoting on the issue when moderators Dana Bash and Jake Tapper pressed him, saying the former president \"doesn't take responsibility for what happened, even though he's the one who incited the mob to the Capitol.\" When he was asked what he thought of President Joe Biden's poorly received debate performance, Gonell didn't waver, arguing Trump was a far bigger threat.\n\n\"I'm supporting somebody who doesn't send a mob to kill me and my colleagues at the Capitol, someone who is not dangling pardons for the people who assaulted police officers and somebody who is not trying to upend democracy,\" Gonell said.\n\n\"It's very upsetting that the people we risked our lives for, like Speaker Mike Johnson, about two weeks ago, received him with open arms like he was a hero,\" Gonell added. \"And the only reason why they are alive today is because of the actions of police officers like myself and my colleagues.\"\n\nBoth Dunn and Gonell - who are no longer with the U.S. Capitol Police Department - have been surrogates for Biden on the campaign trail throughout the 2024 cycle. They have both insisted that their experience doing battle with Trump supporters at the Capitol on January 6th has cemented their determination to keep the ex-president out of office.\n\nHowever, despite Republicans making their support for law enforcement a key plank of past campaigns, that hasn't always led to warm receptions for the two former Capitol police officers. During a visit to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives earlier this month, Republicans were heard booing Dunn and Gonell after they were officially recognized by the speaker.\n\nVoters will also have the events of January 6 in their minds as they cast their ballots in the 2024 election. A January 2024 poll by the Washington Post and the University of Maryland found that 55% of voters say the Capitol insurrection was an \"attack on democracy that should never be forgotten.\" That same month, a CBS News/YouGov survey found that 78% of respondents said they disapprove of the actions of the rioters who forced their way into the Capitol building.\n\nWatch Dunn and Gonell's remarks below, or by clicking this link ."

      "text": "PA House descends into chaos as Republicans boo Capitol police officers\n\nMultiple Republican members of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives walked out on and booed two former U.S. Capitol police officers who defended Congress during the January 6, 2021 insurrection.\n\nHarry Dunn and Aquilino Gonell  each served as Capitol police officers for more than a decade before leaving the force in 2023 and 2022, respectively. On Thursday, the Washington Post reported that Pennsylvania House Speaker Joanna McClinton (D) acknowledged Dunn and Gonell and invited members to welcome them to the chamber. While most members applauded and cheered, several Republicans were heard booing and jeering, while others left the chamber and refused to participate in honoring the two former law enforcement officers.\n\n\"I heard some hissing and I saw about eight to 10 of my Republican colleagues walk out angrily as they were announced as police officers from the U.S. Capitol on January 6,\" Rep. Arvind Venkat (D) told the Post . \"I was shocked and appalled.\"\n\nRep. Malcolm Kenyatta (D), who represents Philadelphia, confirmed in a post to his X/Twitter account that his Republican colleagues were disrespectful to Dunn and Gonell.\n\n\"A number of House Republicans literally booed, hissed, and walked off the floor,\" Kenyatta tweeted. \"There is no bottom.\"\n\nRep. Emily Kinkead (D) of Pittsburgh also noticed the booing from Republicans. She tweeted that she was \"dumbfounded\" that her fellow lawmakers \"disrespected these brave men by exiting the chamber during their recognition.\" Progressive activist J.J. Abbott said Republicans \" stormed off the floor \" and even called the officers who defended the U.S. Capitol from insurrectionists \"traitors.\"\n\nBryan Cutler, who is Pennsylvania's House Republican Leader, disputed the accounts tweeted by Democratic legislators, and accused them of politicizing law enforcement. He opined that they were inappropriately \"antagonizing members and inviting division and discord for their political and campaign purposes.\"\n\n\"I was on the House Floor yesterday and I personally spoke to both of the former officers at the Speaker's rostrum,\" Cutler told the Post . \"I and other members of our caucus also had their pictures taken with the former officers.\"\n\nRepublican caucus chairman George Dunbar also took issue with his colleagues' characterization of how Republicans responded to Dunn and Gonell, and said he personally had the \"deepest respect\" for law enforcement officers and the U.S. Capitol police.\n\nWatch the video of Dunn and Gonell's reception in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives below, or by clicking this link ."

      "text": "Pro-Trump police union shrugs off Trump's pardon of 'violent felons who assaulted cops'\n\nThe national Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), which endorsed President Donald Trump in the 2024 election, isn't interested in discussing the 47th president's mass pardons of insurrectionists who attacked the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nHuffPost White House correspondent S.V. Dáte reached out to the FOP after Trump announced he was pardoning roughly 1,500 people charged and convicted in relation to the deadly siege of the Capitol, in which roughly 140 police officers were injured while battling rioters. Those injured during the insurrection included both members of the U.S. Capitol Police Department along with Washington D.C. Metropolitan Police Department officers.\n\n\"We don't have a statement about that,\" the FOP told Dáte, who tweeted that he specifically asked the union its thoughts on Trump \"releasing HUNDREDS of violent felons who assaulted cops.\"\n\nTrump's pardons included both those convicted of lower-level offenses like unlawful parading, and those convicted of seditious conspiracy (the most serious charge). The rioters who have been released from prison include high-profile defendants like Guy Reffitt, who brought a gun to the Capitol, and who was turned in by his own son .\n\nSome of the officers who were attacked and testified publicly in the trials against insurrectionists received preemptive pardons from former President Joe Biden hours before Trump was sworn in. Sgt. Aquilino Gonell, who provided testimony to the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, was among those Biden pardoned. He recently shared a screenshot of his call log with former Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, which showed automated alerts from the Department of Justice letting him know that defendants he testified against have since been released from prison .\n\n\"The issuance of these pardons should not be mistaken as an acknowledgment that any individual engaged in any wrongdoing, nor should acceptance be misconstrued as an admission of guilt for any offense,\" Biden stated after issuing the pardons. \"Our nation owes these public servants a debt of gratitude for their tireless commitment to our country.\""

      "text": "Nearly all J6 defendants Trump wants to pardon assaulted police officers: security experts\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has lately leaned into rewriting the history of the January 6, 2021 attack on the US Capitol, and has promised on multiple occasions to pardon an unspecified number of defendants sentenced to prison for their participation in the deadly insurrection.\n\nAccording to New York University Law School's Just Security outlet, Trump has been in communication with Micki Witthoeft - the mother of deceased January 6 participant Ashli Babbitt - about January 6 defendants incarcerated in the Washington, DC jail. On March 22, Trump reportedly discussed \"setting these guys free when [Trump] gets in\" with Witthoeft, and told her to pass along a message to DC inmates \"that they're on his mind, and when he gets in they'll get out.\"\n\nJust Security reported that 27 of the 29 January 6 inmates held in Washington, DC are specifically there on charges of assaulting police officers during the insurrection. And of those 27, 19 have already been convicted, with 10 being convicted by juries and nine pleading guilty of their own volition. Eight are awaiting trial and may currently be negotiating plea deals with the Department of Justice.\n\n\"The January 6th DC inmates' assaults on law enforcement include some of the most disturbing acts of violence at the US Capitol,\" Just Security's Tom Joscelyn, Fred Wertheimer and Norm Eisen wrote. \"One convicted felon helped lead the assault on police guarding the Capitol's external security perimeter, an 'attack [that] paved the way for thousands of rioters to storm the Capitol grounds.' Another inmate allegedly threw 'an explosive device that detonated upon at least 25 officers,' causing some of the officers to temporarily lose their hearing.\"\n\nJust Security listed an FBI Special Agent's statement of facts that listed a litany of crimes committed by the DC inmates.\n\n\"Other January 6th inmates held in DC: ' viciously ripped off ' an Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) officer's mask; assaulted officers 'with an electro-shock device;' allegedly sprayed multiple police officers with a pepper spray; ' struck an MPD officer with a long wooden pole multiple times' and allegedly used a 'crutch and a metal pole' as 'bludgeoning weapons or projectiles against' a 'line of law enforcement officers,'\" the statement of facts read. \"Still others assaulted officers with their fists, stolen riot shields, makeshift weapons or in other ways.\"\n\nAmong the DC jail defendants, several also have known ties to violent, far-right and paramilitary groups. One is a member of the alt-right street gang The Proud Boys, and another is a member of the Wolverine Watchmen (the group that plotted to kidnap and murder Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer).\n\n\"[A]nother [inmate] stood in front of a gallows constructed outside the US Capitol and allegedly said that lawmakers 'need to hang from these motherf---ers,'\" wrote Joscelyn, Wertheimer and Eisen.\n\nTrump has promoted Micki Witthoeft's (Ashli Babbitt's mother) vigils for January 6 defendants outside of the DC jail on his Truth Social platform. His conversations with Witthoeft mark a change from his previous attitude toward Babbitt, as it was initially reported he had \" no reaction \" when hearing about Babbitt's death inside the US Capitol during the insurrection.\n\nDuring the attack on the capitol, Babbitt - a QAnon adherent who flew from San Diego, California to Washington, DC for the riot and broke past multiple police lines to get all the way to the speaker's lobby - was struck by a single bullet from an officer's gun after she leapt through a window toward members of Congress who were just feet away. She later died from her injuries."

      "text": "police brutality\n\nA law enforcement training company that held a summit attended by roughly 1,000 police officers nationwide has been accused of encouraging cops to adopt violent, discriminatory and unconstitutional behaviors, News From The States reports.\n\nInvestigators with the office of acting New Jersey Comptroller Kevin Walsh said that the training firm Street Cop - which held a 2021 conference in Atlantic City, New Jersey - promoted \"views and tactics that were wildly inappropriate, offensive, discriminatory, harassing, and, in some cases, likely illegal,\" according to the report.\n\nWalsh's office also called for a separate investigation by the state attorney general's office.\n\nPOLL: Should Trump be allowed to hold office again?\n\n\"The fact that the training undermined nearly a decade of police reforms - and New Jersey dollars paid for it - is outrageous,\" Walsh said in a public statement.\n\nIn the 43-page report , Walsh's office detailed how Street Cop instructors encouraged conference attendees to profile drivers when conducting vehicle stops, noting that many of their recommendations violated directives from the state attorney general and flew in the face of the Fourth Amendment. One instructor reportedly told session participants to \"be the calmest person in the room but have a plan to kill everyone.\" Another boasted that he was \"batting .500\" when shooting people in the line of duty, killing four people while shooting in eight in 13 recorded instances of excessive force. An Oklahoma sheriff leading one session said \"sometimes you have to shoot folks\" when talking about police officers having an affinity for firearms.\n\nStreet Cop founder Dennis Benigno initially sued to stop Walsh's office from investigating his firm, but lost in court. He told the New Jersey Monitor that he planned to \"impose stricter standards on colloquial and jocular language occasionally used by some instructors\" in future training sessions, and that some of the comments Walsh's office highlighted in his report were \"an attempt at humor.\"\n\n\"[T]here is not one single instance in the OSC Report where we have advocated any practice that is inconsistent with quality policing,\" Benigno said. \"Isolated excerpts taken out of context from a week-long training are not reflections of the overall quality of the education that Street Cop provides.\"\n\nWalsh said during a press conference that Street Cop is just one of several firms he wants to investigate, saying \"systemic risks seem to extend far beyond Street Cop, and Street Cop and this particular training provides an example of what can go wrong, and went very wrong there.\"\n\nThe full report is here .\n\nA new document released this week reveals first-hand accounts of a Portland police officer's racist remarks that led to his firing. But despite the disturbing comments documented in the newly revealed letter, he will still be getting a $100,000 settlement payout.\n\nThis article was produced in partnership with the South Bend Tribune , a member of ProPublica s Local Reporting Network . It was co-published with the New York Times.\n\nPolice outside of Charleston, South Carolina, don't believe that high school students should read about police brutality. So even though two books on the subject were assigned on a summer reading list for a high school freshman class, local police made sure to express their objections . The Hate U Give is a book about a teenage girl dealing with the shooting of her unarmed best friend at the hands of police. All American Boys chronicles the experience of a teenage boy who is wrongly accused of stealing and then is beaten by a police officer. Both are award-winning books that made it on to the New York Times bestseller list. Neither book is required-they are two on a list of eight and students are only asked to choose one to read.\n\nEphraim Casado was pulled over for littering in 2017. His lawyer says Miami-Dade authorities committed assault after Casado exited his vehicle with hands raised.\n\nPresident Donald Trump endorsed the demands of Chicago police officers in their conflict with the city's mayor in a tweet Friday night, saying they have \"have every right to legally protest\" - a sentiment seeming to conflict with his push to punish black athletes in the NFL who protest silently during the national anthem.\n\nA Louisiana woman was arrested on homicide charges after an off-duty police officer crashed into the car she was riding in and killed her baby daughter.\n\nWhat the public gets wrong.\n\nBaltimore City Police officers of the Gun Trace Task Force (GTTF) Evodio Hendrix, Maurice Ward , Daniel Hersl, Marcus Taylor , Wayne Jenkins, Thomas Allers, Jemell Rayam and Momodu Gondo are guilty of a plethora of crimes falling under their racketeering convictions, ranging from robbery and selling drugs to fraud. All eight men are currently awaiting sentencing.\n\nAs I've been following this case, listening to opinions and collecting information­, one common narrative I've heard is this: \"Those cops only targeted criminals. They had to use special tactics to keep up with the everyday evolving world of crime, and everyday citizens weren't affected by their actions.\" This claim is problematic for a number of reasons. Let's use the case of April Sims as an example.\n\nSims, a successful hair stylist in Baltimore, was targeted by the GTTF back in 2016. Her flashy car caught the attention of Jenkins, and he started watching her apartment, excitedly reporting suspicious activity to Gondo, according to the Baltimore Sun . Jenkins then crafted a plan to raid her home in search of cash and other goods. He told Gondo that only they and Hersl would be involved in this mission. He thought there would be $40,000 to $50,000 inside that the three could split. Hersl responded, \"I can use the money, I'm in the process of buying a house.\"\n\nThe officers were caught on tape entering her complex. They were denied access by security until Hersl came in with a piece of paper and some police gear. The trio found no cash; however, they did retrieve 390 grams of heroin, gel caps, a digital scale and a Chanel bag worth $5,000. They turned in the drugs, along with the rest of the paraphernalia, and Gondo gave the purse to a woman he was dating. Reporting the drugs wasn't an example of good police work - it was a petty attempt to make Sims pay for not having cash in the house for the police officers to steal.\n\nThe counterargument I'm hearing revolves around the 390 grams of heroin that came off of the street as a result of the officers' break-in; however, that neglects the fact that the officers were not looking for drugs. Finding heroin was not a part of their agenda. They were looking for cash and stumbled across the heroin by mistake during a botched robbery, while using their badges as a shield. There's also the question of where the drugs actually came from - they could have been planted in Sims' home, as the racketeering investigation proved the members of the task force had done so to frame others.\n\nRemember, finding drugs was never a part of their mission. That means that they were the bad guys, too. Actually, the GTTF are worse than the bad guys, because they stole after pledging to protect and serve the people of Baltimore. Meanwhile, our taxes paid their ridiculously high salaries and their fraudulent overtime .\n\nTrue police reform will never happen as long as we continue to make excuses for police officers when they break laws while celebrating every time they accomplish something they get paid to do. Our low standards are evident when we applaud cops reporting a drug bust, even after we find out their only true intention was to steal.\n\nOn Thursday, Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, with the support of four Democrats, recommended a Senate vote for Kurt Engelhardt, a district court judge in Louisiana who has been nominated by Donald Trump to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. That means Engelhardt will likely be up for confirmation very soon, despite his history of disturbing rulings on cases involving racial violence and injustice, as well as cases involving sexual harassment and workplace discrimination against women.\n\nThe linguistic gymnastics needed to report on police violence without calling up images of police violence is a thing of semantic wonder. Officers don't shoot, they are merely \"involved\" in shootings; victims are not victims, but \"suspects\" \"fleeing\"; human beings become premortem cadavers as bullets \"enter the torso\" rather than the chest of a person; guns and bullets act on their own as they \"discharge\" or \"enter the right femur,\" rather than being fired by autonomous individuals with agency and purpose. Headlines become 14-word, jargon-heavy tangles where a simple five-word description would suffice.\n\nIn September, Chicago Police Officer John Catanzara made headlines after posting on Facebook a picture of himself, in uniform, holding an American flag and a homemade sign that read, \"I stand for the anthem. I love the American flag. I support my president and the 2nd Amendment.\"\n\nProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom.

      "text": "'Slap in the face': Ex-Capitol policeman rips Trump over promised pardons of Jan. 6 rioters\n\nWhen he takes office on January 20, 2025, President-elect Donald Trump may follow through on his campaign promise to pardon scores of participants in the January 6, 2021 siege of the U.S. Capitol.\n\nThe potential wave of pardons is particularly offensive for former Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn, who told CNN host Boris Sanchez that it would be \"mind blowing\" if some of the more violent participants in the mob were freed. He particularly blasted the incoming president for referring to jailed January 6 rioters as \"hostages,\" and reminded CNN viewers that many of those who would be let out of jail assaulted law enforcement officers in an effort to violently overturn an election.\n\n\"You know, I followed the cases. I've testified in a few. I went to a lot of the sentencings. I stood by officers as they gave impact statements,\" Dunn said. \"Let's be clear: They broke the law.\"\n\nDunn clarified that despite personally confronting participants in the deadly riot that resulted in the deaths of police officers like Officer Brian Sicknick and injured roughly 140 others , he was on the side of criminal justice reform and that \"the punishment needs to fit the crime.\" However, he added that those who were found guilty of carrying out acts of violence on January 6 are fully deserving of their sentences.\n\n\"They were there unlawfully and they kept us from doing our job and securing the Capitol grounds that day,\" Dunn said, adding that he has \"no sympathy\" for people who attacked his colleagues.\n\n\"Even if they were there to protest a stolen election or they got caught up in the moment, that's no excuse for the crimes that they committed, and they need to be held accountable,\" he continued. \"It would be a slap in the face to me, to law enforcement, to the American people if Donald Trump would come in and just overstep the Justice Department, but it shows that he has every intention of doing so. And I don't think it's okay.\"\n\n\"Those people that committed those crimes that are sentenced to multiple years, they assaulted police. They conspired to overthrow the government. They impeded police while they were doing their job,\" he added. \"Those people, I believe they've been properly sentenced.\"\n\nTrump has specifically mentioned that he wants to pardon January 6 participants incarcerated in the Washington, D.C. jail. And as New York University's Just Security publication reported earlier this year , many of the rioters in the D.C. jail are there specifically for assaulting law enforcement officers. While some were found guilty by juries, others pleaded guilty of their own volition.\n\nSome participants in the insurrection have already changed their legal strategy in light of Trump's reelection. An attorney for defendant Christopher Carnell asked U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell last week to postpone a scheduled status hearing due to the \"expected scope of clemency\" from the president-elect.\n\nWatch Dunn's segment below, or by clicking this link."

      "text": "'Despicable behavior': Cop who arrested NFL star outside stadium on game day placed on leave\n\nJust before the Miami Dolphins' home opener on Sunday afternoon, star wide receiver Tyreek Hill was arrested just outside of the stadium as fans watched. Now, the officer at the center of the fracas is on desk duty.\n\nNBC News reported Tuesday that Officer Danny Torres, who has been with the Miami-Dade Police Department for 27 years, was placed on administrative leave after the body camera footage of Hill's arrest went public. Hill was ordered to lay facedown on the ground at roughly 10:40 AM on Sunday morning just outside of Hard Rock Stadium after he was pulled over for alleged careless driving and failure to wear a seat belt.\n\nInitially, police declined to release the body camera video from the confrontation, attributing their decision to an ongoing internal investigation. But the footage was finally released Monday , and it shows Torres growing increasingly irritated with Hill after the 2023 NFL MVP candidate rolled up his window while Torres was speaking and urging the officer to hurry up so he could get to the locker room.\n\n\"Just give me my ticket bro so I can go,\" Hill is heard saying from the driver's seat of his 2018 McLaren. \"I'm finna be late to the game. Do what you gotta do.\"\n\n\"Keep it down. Hey! Keep your window down!\" Torres yelled at Hill after the Dolphins' star wideout rolled up his window. \"As a matter of fact, get out of the car. Get out of the car now! We're not playing this game.\"\n\nThe video then shows police yanking Hill's door open, hauling him out of the driver's seat, and forcing him to the ground. Hill complained about the rough treatment by officers, telling them he had been through knee surgery and wouldn't be able to play that afternoon due to how he was being handled in police custody (Hill suffered an ankle injury in the 2023 season that sidelined him for one game).\n\n\"What a coincidence. Did you just have surgery on your ears when we told you to put your window down?\" One officer said in response.\n\nFellow Miami Dolphins player Calais Campbell was driving by the scene at the time of Hill's arrest. When he got out of his car to approach his teammate, officers also placed him in handcuffs. A third Dolphins player who pulled over at the scene was not arrested, though officers at the scene requested his driver's license. The Dolphins issued a statement accusing the arresting officer of \" despicable behavior .\"\n\n\"I'm just being Black in America, bro,\" Hill is heard saying while handcuffed.\n\nDespite Hill's arrest and complaints about his treatment at the hands of officers, he nonetheless managed to score a touchdown in the Dolphins' win over the Jacksonville Jaguars. That touchdown was the longest of his NFL career , in which Hill sprinted 54 yards after catching a pass from quarterback Tua Tagovailoa. Fellow wide receiver Jaylen Waddle participated in Hill's touchdown celebration, in which he mimicked cuffing Hill's hands behind his back and \"detaining\" him in the end zone."

The six former deputies, all of whom are white, called themselves the \"Goon Squad\" and have been linked to at least four violent attacks on Black men since 2019. Two of the men attacked and tortured by the group subsequently died. To discuss the case and the verdict, we're joined by Eddie Parker and attorneys Malik Shabazz and Trent Walker. \"Never have we seen this many police officers sentenced to this kind of time in one week,\" says Shabazz, who calls the verdict \"historic.\" Jenkins, Parker and Shabazz are currently suing the Rankin County Sheriff's Department over its track record of civil rights violations and racist targeting of Black residents.\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe end today's show in Mississippi, where six former law enforcement officers have been sentenced to between 10 and 40 years in prison each for raiding a home and torturing two Black men. The officers, all of whom are white, belonged to a group that described itself as the \"Goon Squad.\"\n\nIn January of 2023, the six officers burst into a home, then beat, handcuffed, waterboarded and tasered Michael Corey Jenkins and Eddie Terrell Parker. The officers also sexually abused them with an object while shouting racial slurs. One of the officers put a gun in Jenkins's mouth for a mock execution and pulled the trigger. The bullet lacerated his tongue, broke his jaw, exited through his neck. The officers then planted drugs at the scene in an attempt to cover up their act.\n\nThe attack occurred in the majority-white Rankin County, which is about 20 miles away from majority-Black Jackson, Mississippi. Some of the officers were also sentenced for their role in a separate assault just two weeks earlier, when another member of the Goon Squad repeatedly tased a man and put his genitals in his mouth. While the charges focused on these two cases, The New York Times and Mississippi Today have revealed that deputies in the Rankin County Sheriff's Department have for decades barged into homes, handcuffed people, tortured them for information or confessions.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland issued a statement Thursday saying, quote, \"The depravity of the crimes committed by these defendants cannot be overstated, and they will now spend between 10 and 40 years in prison for their heinous attack on citizens they had sworn to protect,\" AG Merrick Garland said.\n\nWe go now to Jackson, Mississippi, where we're joined by Eddie Parker, as well as his attorney Malik Shabazz, who is with Black Lawyers for Justice.\n\nMalik Shabazz, let's begin with you. Can you talk about the courtroom scene and the sentencing of these sheriff's deputies and police officers for what they did?\n\nMALIK SHABAZZ: Good morning to the Democracy Now! audience and Ms. Goodman.\n\nThe scene inside of this courtroom in the United States district court for the sentencing of the Goon Squad was absolutely incredible. And you wouldn't believe it if it was a movie. I mean, to see the big, bad, intimidating, murderous Goon Squad, to see all of them there, to see all of them in court, crying tears out of their eyes and begging the judge, begging Eddie and Michael, in this packed room, was absolutely incredible. But it was well deserved, because so many other families and victims have had to shed those tears and go to jail for a long time behind their crimes and lies. I mean, Amy, it was absolutely incredible. And never have we seen this many police officers sentenced to this kind of time in one week. And it was awesome.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Malik Shabazz, talk about how this self-described Goon Squad operated.\n\nMALIK SHABAZZ: OK. Well, they operate worse than criminals. I mean, they handcuff people, like they did to Eddie. When they handcuff, they don't use warrants. They beat, they tase, they take their private parts out of their pants on another victim. They used dildos on Eddie and Michael, at least attempted to use them on Eddie and Michael. They waterboard, like U.S. troops did in Iraq. They put guns to heads, guns in mouths. They shoot in mouths. I mean, they are - everything you have ever heard that police may do, they did. They throw down guns. They carry throw-down guns. They plant guns. They steal videotapes.\n\nAnd this is why they have received the longest and strongest sentences for any police brutality case in the history of the United States of America, and even the world. This week, the 132 years given to the Goon Squad defendants represent the longest criminal sentences ever given out, collectively and individually, to police officers in the history of the United States of America. And they deserve every day and hour of it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Eddie Terrell Parker, your feelings in the courtroom, after having been so seriously brutalized and tortured, to see these officers put away for years?\n\nEDDIE TERRELL PARKER: It was a moment in history. I mean, it was satisfying. I enjoyed every second of sitting and watching it all, you know, come to reality.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I wanted to turn to Michael Jenkins' mother, Mary Jenkins, who earlier in the week spoke outside the federal courthouse in Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That's Mary Jenkins, Michael Corey Jenkins' mother. Malik Shabazz, will Michael Corey Jenkins and Eddie Terrell Parker also civilly sue for - not only personally these men, but, clearly, one of the things that their lawyers argued, the lawyers for the sheriff's deputies and the officers, is that there was this permissive atmosphere that allowed them to operate in this way. Will they be suing the state or the city?\n\nMALIK SHABAZZ: No, we are suing Rankin County and its Board of Supervisors and Sheriff Bryan Bailey, who was supposed to be running a department that supervised and monitored its officers. Unfortunately, during the sentencing hearings, it came out that Brett McAlpin, who is the chief investigative officer, which is similar to internal affairs - the criminals ran the department in Rankin. And that's why they are facing a very large civil judgment and civil trial in this case. This is a pattern and practice of the Rankin County Police Department to routinely ignore constitutional rights violations.\n\nI want to say one thing, and then I want you to hear from Mississippi attorney Trent Walker. He's with me. He's from Rankin. But Eddie Terrell Parker gave the most powerful victim's testimony in these six days - I mean, these three days of sentencing these six defendants. He was very powerful. Mr. Mel Jenkins, Michael Jenkins' father, was very influential in these hearings. But I would like you to hear a further answer on your question from Mississippi attorney Trent Walker, who is from Rankin County. Here he is.\n\nTRENT WALKER: Good morning.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Hi, Trent Walker.\n\nTRENT WALKER: Hello.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: If you can - go ahead. If you can talk about the significance of what's happened? And does this open up hundreds of cases, going back decades?\n\nTRENT WALKER: It should open up hundreds of cases, going back decades, anything that these six have touched, in point of fact, given the testimony that they themselves gave. And they used terms like there was a \"culture of violence.\" More than one of them said that, and that violence and brutality was expected for you to work on the night shift, which they did not refer to as the night shift. They talked about it as the \"Goon Squad shift.\" And so, yes, anything that they touched should go back, be reexamined, and really, just as a matter of course, overturn, because when you find that they're willing to plant evidence and falsify reports - you know, they had Michael Jenkins charged with aggravated assault on a police officer and with possession of drugs. Michael could have been sentenced to up to 38 years in prison. And as a criminal law practitioner in Rankin County, I can tell you, he would not have been slapped on the wrist, and he would have served many years in prison for those charges that they falsified and put on him.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to go to U.S. Attorney Darren LaMarca speaking last year, announcing the federal charges against the former officers for the attack.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, I'm wondering if either Trent Walker or Malik Shabazz can talk about the state charges, also federal charges, what this means. We're talking about officers sentenced not only for the attack that we're describing today on Michael Corey Jenkins and Eddie Terrell Parker, but for two weeks before, when they barged into someone's home. I think this was Dedmon. And how has he been described? The judge said he committed the most \"shocking, brutal and cruel acts imaginable.\" Attorney Shabazz, you've described Dedmon as \"oppressive\" and \"sick.\" Talk about these acts that you know about that they did, that they were sentenced for in addition to the case of Michael and Eddie.\n\nMALIK SHABAZZ: Well, about a month before, they had targeted a person named [Alan] Schmidt. And [Alan] Schmidt allegedly had offended Dedmon because he had allegedly stolen something from one of Dedmon's friends. So, the Goon Squad gangsters, they had his tag, and they had the tag tracers, and they had an order out. They had an order out that if they found him driving anywhere, without any probable cause to stop him, that they were going to stop him and deal with him.\n\nThey found him one night. They called Dedmon, who came, off duty, on duty. And then Dedmon, who was on this night shift - now, I want to remind you that according to the sentencing hearings, you could not work the night shift in Rankin County Sheriff's Department without being a part of the Goon Squad. And overall, you could not rise or be promoted into the Rankin County Sheriff's Department without participating in violence and being violent at night with the Goon Squad. And every one of the defendants said that they were doing OK in their careers until they were inducted into this gang called the Goon Squad. OK?\n\nSo, Dedmon himself - it's so much sickness here. But any officer who you see that will whip out his private parts and attempt to put it in the mouth of a defendant -\n\nTRENT WALKER: On the side of the interstate.\n\nMALIK SHABAZZ: - on the side of the road, take his gun out, shoot it by the side of his head to make him believe he's going to be killed, pull his pants down while handcuffed - this came out in court - pulled the man's pants down while handcuffed, grabbed his genitals, told him how - the size of his genitals, then dry humped him. I say that it came out in court that Dedmon dry humped the man after they took him to a private house in another jurisdiction. I mean, you wouldn't believe it if you saw it in a movie, but I'm imagining it will be that one day. But, you know, in Mississippi -\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Well -\n\nMALIK SHABAZZ: I must give - I've got to say this. We have a Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, that is headed by a Black woman, and Kristen Clarke takes her job seriously. And her Southern Division attorneys have pursued and made history in this area. And Judge Thomas Lee - they thought that Judge Thomas Lee down here in Mississippi would not do justice. And, oh, how he has set a standard and put police officers on notice all over America that if you do the crime, you're going to do the time, just like anybody else.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Well, I just want to say, Eddie Terrell Parker, you and Michael Corey Jenkins, amazingly brave in coming forward and describing what happened to you, which seems to have broken open all of these investigations right now. I want to thank civil rights attorney Malik Shabazz and Trent Walker with Black Lawyers for Justice and Eddie Parker, who was tortured by the Goon Squad. Thank you so much, joining us from Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nAnd that does it for our show. Very happy belated birthday to Tami Woronoff. I'm Amy Goodman. Our website is democracynow.org. Thanks so much for joining us."

      "text": "Why Police Officers Rarely Change Jobs\n\nWhat happens when officers feel stuck in a department?\n\nSubscribe here: Apple Podcasts | Spotify | YouTube | Overcast | Pocket Casts\n\nIn 2020, the law professors John Rappaport and Ben Grunwald published an article called \"The Wandering Officer,\" where they found that police officers who had been fired earlier in their career were more likely to be fired again-and more likely to receive a \"moral character violation\" complaint. The research has informed the debate about police reform in the years since.\n\nFour years later, Rappaport-along with Jonathan S. Masur and Aurélie Ouss-has published another article , revealing that, on average, policing is a stagnant job, meaning that police officers very rarely move between jobs and departments. The researchers got access to 20 years of data and found that roughly 70 percent of Illinois officers in their sample had held just one job, and another 21 percent had held just two. And it's not necessarily that they're choosing to stay in one job. A lot of policies have made it costly to switch agencies.\n\nWhat the researchers found is that when police are stuck in the same law-enforcement agency, stuck with the same peers and commanding officer, they are also more likely to adhere to the \"blue wall of silence\"-an unwritten code to never implicate another officer of wrongdoing. As the authors write, \"Unlike in other professions, it is terribly difficult for police officers to quit in protest or even to object to the orders they receive. If the policies and priorities of senior law enforcement management are misguided, the entire law enforcement organization is stuck with them.\"\n\nIn today's episode of Good on Paper , Rappaport joins me to discuss both of his papers and the factors keeping police locked in place.\n\nThe following is a transcript of the episode:\n\nJerusalem Demsas: On July 6, Sonya Massey was shot and killed in her Illinois home by a Sangamon County police officer, Sean Grayson. Grayson and another police officer had come to Massey's home after she'd called 911 about a prowler . Once inside her house, Grayson asked Massey to remove a pot on the stove-an interaction which rapidly ended with him opening fire. He claimed to have feared for his life because of the pot of water. And, as a result, the 36-year-old mother of two is dead.\n\nThis is a horrible and all-too-common story. And in the weeks following Massey's death, one additional fact came to light: Grayson had held five jobs in four years, all at different police departments in central Illinois. Now he's been fired from a sixth. The AP reports that at one of those jobs, as a sheriff's deputy in Logan County, \"he was reprimanded for ignoring a command to end a high-speed chase and ended up hitting a deer.\"\n\nWhy do police officers like Grayson keep getting hired?\n\nPart of the answer comes from today's guest, UChicago law professor John Rappaport, whose research on \"wandering officers\" revealed the extent to which previously fired officers find jobs in new departments and the structural incentives of small departments to keep hiring them.\n\nBut Rappaport's newest paper complicates the thinking around police-labor mobility. While his earlier research shows that wandering officers are more likely to act improperly in their new roles, his new research reveals how other officers actually find it very difficult to move, exacerbating norms like the \"blue wall of silence\" that keeps police from reporting on each other.\n\nMy name is Jerusalem Demsas. I'm a staff writer here at The Atlantic , and this is Good on Paper , a policy show that questions what we really know about popular narratives. Today's episode explores how we should think about the problem of police-labor mobility. Are there ways that police are too stagnant? Would there be fewer instances of police brutality and misconduct if it was easier to leave one police job for another?\n\nAll right. Well, hi, John. Welcome to the show.\n\nJohn Rappaport: Hi to you. Thanks for having me.\n\nDemsas: Yeah, of course. So I feel like this paper is kind of interesting. I love talking about-in my reporting, I report about the law, I report about economics, and I report about political science. I feel like we found all three in one place. And so I'm really excited to have this conversation.\n\nBut I want to start with the paper you wrote four years ago. And the context of that paper is that often police officers who are credibly accused of heinous acts of murder or corruption are revealed to have been previously fired or let go from other agencies. Not always, but this happens at a level where it started to cause a lot of questions: How often is this happening? Is this something that really explains a lot of police misconduct or just the police has bad employees in these instances?\n\nSo you wrote a paper called \"The Wandering Officer,\" and you and your co-author published this at The Yale Law Journal . And I'm hoping we can start there, and you can walk us through that paper. How many wandering officers are there, and how did you find that out?\n\nRappaport: Sure. So we were using a statewide dataset from the state of Florida, and we had read, like a lot of other people, all sorts of anecdotal accounts about these wandering officers, and we were really curious just how common they were. And when we ran the numbers, we found that about 2 to 3 percent of all police officers in the state of Florida at any given time are wandering officers. That is about 1,100 officers, give or take.\n\nTo be clear, we defined wandering officer in the paper as an officer who's actually been fired before and then obtains another job. So that defined that way, we found about 2 to 3 percent.\n\nDemsas: Are there ways that you're worried Florida might be an outlier, or are there ways that you checked it against other states?\n\nRappaport: We're just starting to do that, actually, and work here in 2024. I'm starting to try to look at other states. The data is not as good, but maybe we can find out a little bit just to see whether Florida seems way out of line. And the preliminary results suggest that it's not way out of line. There's, of course, a range from state to state, but I don't think Florida is out of the mainstream in any respect.\n\nDemsas: So your main finding, as you said, is that, in any given year, roughly 1,100 officers who had been previously fired were working for Florida agencies. It seems like a substantial number, but you also say that's just 3 percent. How should we think about that? Is that a lot of people?\n\nRappaport: I think it's in the eye of the beholder. When we wrote the paper, we genuinely didn't know whether people would read it and think, Oh, they've just proven that this is not really a significant problem , or, They've just proven that this is a significant problem. And it seems to me, from the reception that the paper has received over the last few years, that people think it's a serious problem and that even 2 to 3 percent is way too many.\n\nDemsas: Well, what about you? What do you think when you see that number?\n\nRappaport: I mean, I think it's high if you think about 1,100 officers, and then you think about all the different interactions that any given police officer is going to have over the course of, say, a year. I think we multiplied it out somewhere in the paper and said, This is probably hundreds of thousands of civilian interactions in the year .\n\nAnd another important finding in the paper is that wandering officers go on to get fired or be subject to serious complaints of misconduct at about twice the rate of other officers. And so once you have that finding in mind, then you think, Eleven hundred sounds like a lot, and a couple hundred thousand interactions with people who are going to go on to get fired or commit serious misconduct at highly elevated rates is too much .\n\nDemsas: I've been at this job for a little over two-and-a-half years now. That's the longest job I've ever had in my life. And most of my friends who are either Millennials or younger, or even a little bit older than that, are very used to job switching. We're used to hearing adults and employers say in the media that job switching means that you're lazy or you're bad at your job. But that's not something we take, usually, very seriously. Why would that be different with police officers?\n\nRappaport: Well, I think it depends on what kind of labor mobility we're talking about here. To shade into the newer paper a little bit, I think we may have too much of the bad kind of mobility and too little of the good kind of mobility. So I agree; I think that changing jobs is not inherently a bad thing, but when we're looking at something like the wandering officer, it's a little bit different from your just typical, average Millennial.\n\nWe're looking at officers who've been fired. It's hard to fire a police officer, so if they've been fired, that already says something significant about them. And if they're then bouncing around in subsequent agencies, I think that looks a little bit different from you and your friends changing jobs.\n\nDemsas: You also find that officers who were fired tend to move to smaller agencies with fewer resources in areas with larger communities of color. Why is that happening? Why is that an easier place for them to find work?\n\nRappaport: I think there's just a greater demand and a smaller supply of officers in those areas. We've been hearing a lot in the news, especially over the last four or five years, about the hiring or the retention crisis in policing. I don't know how real that is or how ubiquitous that is, but I know there are a lot of places that don't have a ton of good applicants, and they're the ones that tend to be reaching to hire these wandering officers.\n\nDemsas: Should we expect to see in smaller agencies just higher rates of police misconduct? Is that what we see when we look at the literature?\n\nRappaport: That's a good question. I'm not sure that we really know the answer very confidently to that question. But it's a reasonable hypothesis based on what we do know.\n\nDemsas: One thing that got me thinking, especially when you were talking about the need that smaller agencies really have, is the trade-off that they might have to make, right? Because if you're a small, cash-strapped agency, and your choices are to hire a police officer that's been fired before-but maybe he seems fine in the interview, and you want to give him a chance-what's the risk of hiring that individual person versus the risk of not having an officer, which we know can often lead to also high rates of crime and victimization? How do we weigh those sorts of things?\n\nRappaport: Right. It's not an enviable position to be in, I think. Especially before the research came out, you might even think that some managers and small-town agencies would think that a guy who has been fired before is going to behave better because even though it's, in general, very hard to fire an officer, Here's one that got fired, so he knows he's not invincible, right? And he's going to fall in line when I hire him this time. And that's what he's saying to me in the interview , as you suggested. But now, after seeing the research and realizing that, at least on average, wandering officers get fired and receive serious misconduct complaints at twice the rate of other officers, it's hard to follow that line of thinking any longer.\n\nBut there are other trade-offs, as you say. You have to think about hiring this guy or hiring a rookie. Now, he may be more likely to commit misconduct than a rookie, but he might also be cheaper than a rookie because we have to train a rookie. It's going to be a long time before a rookie can be out on the streets by himself doing the same kinds of things that this veteran officer might be able to do.\n\nYou posited that we're a small, cash-strapped agency, so that's another trade-off I have to make. And then, as you say, there's even a third trade-off, which is: Should I hire this guy or hire nobody? And that's going to be, obviously, very context dependent, but there are situations in which you could imagine a reasonable manager concluding it's better to have somebody than nobody.\n\nDemsas: The main reason you're here is because you also wrote a new paper very recently. And when I first heard about \"The Wandering Officer\" paper from a few years ago, and it got a lot of attention-I don't really focus on criminal-justice reform as an issue I report on-but what I generally took away from it is that we should kind of be suspect, very suspect of any officer trying to get a job in a new area, any officer that's been fired before.\n\nAnd I don't know if I formed the strongest policy beliefs off of it, but it did feel like the main takeaway was that police mobility was bad. Is that how you saw it? Did you feel like others read your paper as sort of an indictment of police-labor mobility?\n\nRappaport: I think some people might have, but that's, maybe, over-reading the paper to some extent because we are talking about mobility just among a very small segment of the policing profession, rather than mobility of your average officer.\n\nDemsas: I'm hoping you can talk to us about this new paper, then. You have a new paper out. It's called, \"Labor Mobility and the Problems of Modern Policing.\" What's the top line of that? What are you trying to do? What did you find?\n\nRappaport: Well, first of all, we do a couple of things in the paper. There's an empirical part of the paper, and then there's a conceptual or theoretical contribution. In the empirical part of the paper, we wanted to just try to figure out: How much lateral mobility is there for police officers? I had heard, anecdotally, from someone in the policing world that, Hey, it's really hard to change jobs if you don't like your job in policing.\n\nAnd this was news to me, maybe partly because of the wandering-officer research. But this was news to me that there are these police officers who are at agencies, and they really don't like their job, but they feel like it's really hard for them to move.\n\nAnd so I wanted to figure out whether this was, first of all, accurate and whether it was a general phenomenon and, second of all, try to think a little bit about why that was the case and think about: What are the implications of that phenomenon if it turns out to be real? And so that's what we try to do in this paper.\n\nDemsas: How do you do it? I know you're looking at Illinois data now. Does Illinois also have a good dataset available? Or why'd you pick them?\n\nRappaport: Illinois has pretty good data. Actually, in an appendix of the paper, we replicate most of the results using the Florida data to try to stave off any concern that this is something unique to Illinois. There was one good thing about the Illinois data that's not true of the Florida data, which is that we can see officers' ranks-police officers, detective, sergeant, and so on. There's not really one specific way to measure labor mobility, so we look at it from a few different perspectives.\n\nThe first thing we do is just look to see, Well, how many different jobs do police officers in our dataset have? And it turns out that 70 percent of the officers in our dataset have only one policing job in Illinois, and another 21 percent have only two jobs.\n\nDemsas: Wow.\n\nRappaport: And this looks very similar in the Florida data. And so right away that tells you that most people are finding a job and they're staying put, or they're making one move in their career and that these officers who are bouncing around from agency to agency to agency are something of an anomaly.\n\nDemsas: Why aren't they moving? Why aren't they moving more?\n\nRappaport: This is a big question, right? This is a big part of the heart of the paper, is to try to figure out: What are the causes of this friction that keeps officers from changing jobs? And I think there's a lot of different reasons here. We sort them into what we call nonlegal and legal reasons. In terms of the nonlegal reasons, we're talking about all sorts of different things-like, for example, the fact that most police departments are natural monopsonies. They are the only game in town when it comes to policing.\n\nIf you work in a small city in Illinois, there's only one police employer in your city, which is very different from if you were a mechanic or you were a plumber or you worked in health care. There's probably lots of different jobs that you could get even in a small city. But with policing, there's very few, often only one option within your commuting zone.\n\nIt makes it really hard to change jobs, especially when you couple with that residency requirements that a lot of police departments have, that you have to live in the city where you work. Those might be a good thing for a lot of reasons, but they do make it harder to change jobs, because it means that changing jobs means you must move your home.\n\nDemsas: To me, there's obviously a lot of research and push to get police to live in the places they work, right? There's a lot of people who argue that it makes people more grounded in the communities that they're in, that it's really good if people have been there for a long time. There may even be domain-specific knowledge that they're getting, whether it's the knowledge that they're getting of walking that community, knowing the people, knowing what the hotspots are on their own, feeling comfortable in it, not feeling on edge.\n\nBut then also, even on just a more practical level, regulations might shift from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Is it the case that this sort of stability might outweigh the costs? Like, there are a ton of benefits that might be accruing that are, maybe, difficult to measure?\n\nRappaport: It is possible. We raise this as a potential concern. But we say in the paper that there are both costs and benefits to limited labor mobility for police officers, and we're not exactly sure which one to weigh out. We are concerned about the potential costs of low mobility. But there are benefits, as you say. You might attract a certain kind of candidate who wants to make a commitment to that neighborhood or that town.\n\nThere's actually research-Elizabeth Linos at Harvard has done some research about what kind of job announcements attract people into the policing profession. And she finds that people are more attracted by job announcements that talk about job stability than they are by announcements that talk about public service, and that this is especially true for women and people of color. So we don't dispute at all the fact that there are lots of potential upsides to having limited mobility in the profession. But there are some downsides, we think, too.\n\nDemsas: And what are those downsides? If you're staying in place, what is the big cost that's happening there? For some people, that feels like the dream, that you get to have a job that you get to stick in for a long time.\n\nRappaport: If you like it.\n\nDemsas: ( Laughs .) Yeah.\n\nRappaport: If you like your coworkers. If you like what you do. If you like your superiors.\n\nI think, again, there are multiple costs we could talk about. The first thing that comes to mind is just this question of stagnation-the idea that you may well have a lot of mismatch in your agency. You have a lot of officers who aren't necessarily well matched in terms of the skills that they're being asked to use, but they can't make that lateral move that would allow them to get a better match.\n\nThis kind of thing could lead to burnout. You could have officers who are unhappy on the job. They don't like their job. Maybe they don't like their coworkers. They don't like their partner. But it's very hard for them to move, and so they may burn out. They may decrease their effort. They might even start breaking the rules more often.\n\nI also think that-although it's true that job stability might attract certain candidates into the profession-limited lateral mobility might also deter other kinds of candidates from entering the profession. And maybe the type of people who want a career that's going to allow them to bounce around and be upwardly mobile-maybe those people are not entering the profession to begin with.\n\nDemsas: It feels like some of the things that you're talking about that are restraining police mobility seem almost just insurmountable. Like, the fact that there are going to be large gaps in distance between different police jurisdictions just seems like it obviously has to be that way. You can't really have a thick labor market for policing. You're not going to have the Chicago [PD], the Atlanta [PD], the LAPD all in the same spot for someone to be able to bargain between for jobs. So is this something that's just insurmountable? Or how much of it are factors that are just a part of policing's function and form in America?\n\nRappaport: Yeah. I think there are some factors, some sources of friction that are insurmountable, to use your word. But there are others that we didn't get to yet that I think are much more malleable. There's a whole set of laws, I think, that make it more costly for police officers to change jobs.\n\nThe first thing that comes to mind is the pension system. Unlike a lot of private-sector workers in this country, police officers don't have 401(k)s. They don't have defined-contribution retirement plans. They have defined-benefit plans, which are also called pensions, right? And pensions typically have a very long vesting period-could be something on the order of 10 years.\n\nIf you change your job-you start working at one agency. You don't like it. You want to change. If you change your job before the 10-year mark, then everything that your employer contributed to your pension is going to go up in smoke. It's just gone. You can't take your service credit with you, meaning if you start over at agency No. 2, you don't get credit for the hours that you put in at agency No. 1 toward your pension. You have to start over at zero.\n\nYou also are going to lose your rank. So if you're a sergeant at agency No. 1, and then you move to agency No. 2, you start back as a police officer. You're also going to lose your seniority. So seniority is a little bit different from rank. Seniority is usually governed by a collective-bargaining agreement, and it gives you access to benefits like vacation days and equipment and good shift assignments, right? Who takes the graveyard shift? That's determined by seniority. These kinds of things are legally created, and I think they are potentially changeable.\n\nDemsas: Why do these things exist, right? Why is it not possible to port your rank or to port your seniority or to bring your pension along? And you would imagine there might be a lot of variation across a country of 90,000 different localities. Why is there so much stagnation here?\n\nRappaport: Yeah. So here, too, I think there's a host of different reasons at play. One way to think about the question is: Why do police officers tolerate this limited mobility, right? They're thought to be politically powerful-they're a politically powerful lobby, politically powerful unions. And limited mobility is typically, all else equal, thought to be bad for employees. It's good for employers because it suppresses wages and it reduces turnover costs, but it's bad for employees because it suppresses wages. And so why do police officers put up with this?\n\nI think the first thing you have to see is that the very same rules that make it hard for an officer to lateral out of an agency also make it hard for other officers to lateral into the agency and compete with that officer for promotions, shifts, resources, and so on. And so these rules that restrict lateral mobility are fundamentally protectionist rules.\n\nNow, why would police officers want protectionist rules? I don't know exactly, but we can think of a couple of hypotheses. One is that maybe police officers think that they're unlikely to want to move. They think of themselves, like you say-they've found the dream. They've got a good public-sector job. They're serving the public. They have a pension coming to them if they stay put, and they think they're unlikely to want to move. If you think you're unlikely to want to move, then you don't really care about rules that make it hard for you to lateral out. You do still care about rules that make it easy for other people to lateral in and compete with you. And so you want to clamp down on that.\n\nBut even if it's not the case that cops believe they're unlikely to want to move, there's a sort of jurisdictional collective-action problem going on where I think police officers, in the aggregate, on the whole, would collectively be better off with more mobility because it helps to increase wages, among other things.\n\nBut for any given officer, the scope of her influence is really limited, meaning she can have sway, at most, over the rules that are in place at her agency or in her state. She could potentially put pressure on the relevant decision makers to change those rules. But she can't do anything about the rules in the neighboring agency or the neighboring state. There's no way that she can put pressure on them to try to make those rules more welcoming to potential transfers like her.\n\nAnd so when you're in this kind of scenario, it's in each individual police officer's interest to seek those protectionist rules that decrease external competition. And the officers in the other jurisdictions are all going to make the same decision. And so we end up with this sort of protectionist equilibrium that is understandable for any given officer but might be making officers, on the whole, worse off.\n\nDemsas: I want to throw another potential hypothesis at you, too, which is that: Is it possible that the police unions are not, maybe-there's a principal-agent problem here?\n\nThere may be some people-if you're already in the police union or the police union staff themselves are maybe more responsive to the people who have been there a long time, of course, they themselves feel seniority. The people who staff police unions or who are elected are going to be long-term players there too. And so they have an interest in maintaining their status as a player in local politics and also a player in maintaining power and bringing resources to people who have been there for a long time, and they're less interested in police officers as individuals or the larger labor sector or labor market of police officers?\n\nRappaport: Yeah. I think that's completely plausible. Maybe to restate it slightly would be to just say that the people who have the power in terms of lobbying and influence, that subset of people think they're unlikely to want to move, because they've got it made, right? And so maybe they're not thinking about what your typical officer in year three wants; they're thinking about what they want.\n\n[ Music ]\n\nDemsas: All right, time for a quick break. More with John when we get back.\n\n[ Break ]\n\nDemsas: One implication of your paper also plays into these questions about police misconduct, right? Because if you feel like you can't move, or you feel like you're probably going to be stuck at this agency for the rest of your life-and the people around you are going to be responsible for your promotions; how your day goes; what shifts you get; how great your everyday, day-to-day career feels-you're much less likely to report on your fellow officers. Did you find evidence of this? Or how do you think about that and the potential impact of keeping officers stuck in place?\n\nRappaport: We don't find empirical evidence of this. This is not something we were able to test with our data. But as a theoretical matter, I think it's very plausible that, when officers have limited mobility, they're basically, as you say, tied to their employer and their colleagues. And they take on a very strong, self-interested incentive not to rock the boat and to comply with whatever their superiors want and to conform with the norms that are created by their peers or the peers who came before them, right?\n\nAnd that's true even when those norms are pernicious and even when those norms look like the blue wall of silence, right? The blue wall of silence is a norm pursuant to which officers refuse to inculpate each other and potentially even lie to protect fellow officers from allegations of misconduct. Even if you join an agency and you think the blue wall of silence is a terrible idea, it is incredibly risky for you to push back against that norm. If you do, you might be ostracized. You might be put on the graveyard shift. You might have people not respond when you call for backup. And then you're stuck. There's nothing you can do about it, because it's so hard to change jobs and start over.\n\nDemsas: Yeah. And it seems like here is a place where there's an interplay between your first paper and this one, too, in that you also know that if you leave, there's a high likelihood that you're seen as a bad apple to other agencies. And so it actually kind of implicates you, too. Even though it is true that the average person who gets fired from a police station or is likely to have police-misconduct problems, people also might feel like, Oh, just leaving might give me that stench of being a bad apple , as well.\n\nRappaport: Yeah. That's exactly right, especially in a world in which it's difficult for potential future employers to really verify these things.\n\nDemsas: So what should the policy response be for someone reading both these papers? If you're a state legislator or maybe you're even the head of a police agency-you're chief of police-and you're hiring other officers, right? When you look at both of these papers, what sorts of things would you want people to be doing?\n\nRappaport: I think one potential reform that implicates both lines of research is improved information flow. As I said a few minutes ago, sometimes I think agencies hire a wandering officer because they don't even know that they're dealing with a wandering officer. Either they didn't have the resources to do a good background check, or the records that they were looking for weren't available, or maybe the officer is not technically a wandering officer, because he was allowed to leave voluntarily in the face of misconduct accusations rather than being fired. And it's really hard to know what's going on, because there's no centralized database that keeps track of police misconduct.\n\nI think if you had a centralized database at the state level or even at the federal level, this kind of information flow would do a couple of things. I think it would make it easier to identify wandering officers or officers who raise some of the same concerns as wandering officers, but it would also bolster confidence in agencies when they're looking to hire lateral transfers. Because right now, as you said a few minutes ago, we might assume that, Well, this person's on the lateral market. They must have done something wrong. Why else would they be leaving? But the more information we have-the more transparency there is-the more comfort we can take that we really know about this person's background.\n\nDemsas: I wonder, too-because I think you touched on this in one of your papers-about the efficacy of using a national database here. How much would it solve if you actually had a lot more information about why people were leaving? And is that something that would cut against the interests of a lot of these local players?\n\nRappaport: I think it depends on what's in your database. There is already one kind of national database, which is called the National Decertification Index. So something we haven't really talked about yet is the fact that police officers are a licensed profession, just like a lawyer is licensed or a barber is licensed. When you want to be a police officer, you have to be licensed in the state where you want to work. This is something that creates some friction on interstate moves because if you want to move to a new state, you have to get a new license.\n\nThere is a national database that keeps track of-or tries to keep track of-officers who have been decertified, meaning they've committed misconduct that's serious enough that they actually not only were fired but had their license pulled. So they were told, You can never be a police officer in the state of Florida again , right? That's put into a national database-sometimes-with the idea being that before Georgia, let's say, certifies that officer, they'll look in the database and see that the officer was decertified in a prior state.\n\nThat's not a lot of information, because not that many officers are decertified. That's really only the worst of the worst of the worst. And I think to achieve the kind of benefits that we're talking about here, you would need to have a more inclusive database that covers all terminations and maybe even misconduct that doesn't lead to terminations.\n\nDemsas: I'm curious here, again, about the demographics because, in your paper, you find that there's greater mobility for white officers and also for less-educated officers. And you say that those are principally attributable to voluntary rather than involuntary moves. Why would there be greater mobility for those two groups, and how does that fit into the story you're telling here?\n\nRappaport: We don't really know. And we suggest that those findings be interpreted with some caution because they don't exactly replicate in the Florida data. They're sort of directionally similar, but the magnitude of the results is different. You could tell a lot of different stories about why white officers or white-male officers have more mobility. They might just have more labor-market power in general. I don't know why less-educated officers would have more mobility. It's a mystery to me.\n\nDemsas: You've referenced this a little bit in your last couple answers here, but I've been thinking about how much of this is just a classic occupational-licensing story leading to declining mobility. We know that there are tons of jobs that require licensing-public-sector jobs but also private-sector jobs-and that's led to a serious decline in interstate mobility.\n\nFor me, I'm trying to think through because you're offering a lot of different reasons why you would find these frictions in the labor market for police. And I'm trying to think about how you would order your concerns, like which ones you would find to be most binding for police officers. Is this a classic occupational-licensing thing-if you were to just make it a lot easier for people to switch between jobs, and maybe you would have standardization across states about what the job was and the laws that exist across jurisdictions-to be standardized? Or is that a very subconcern that you have when it comes to the frictions that exist in this market?\n\nRappaport: My sense is that certification licensing is one of the smaller concerns. Partly, I get this from message boards. We spent a lot of time, when writing this paper, on police-officer message boards to try to figure out: What are police officers talking about? Either current police officers, prospective police officers, and especially police officers who are talking about changing jobs or thinking about changing jobs-what are they concerned with? What do they say is holding them back from changing jobs? And the thing is that certification really only comes up when you're talking about interstate moves. And I think the number of potential interstate moves is probably dwarfed by the number of intrastate moves. And things like pension portability and rank-and-seniority portability, those are implicated even for people who want to make intrastate moves, and I think those are probably more important on the whole.\n\nDemsas: Did you find anything else interesting from perusing those? Did you learn anything you didn't expect?\n\nRappaport: When we started reading them, it was all new to us, and so I think we didn't know what to expect.\n\nDemsas: What sorts of things are they talking about on there, mostly?\n\nRappaport: They're talking a lot about pensions and about rank and seniority, and using all sorts of metaphors like, Getting a job in policing is like being married; you should only do it once and expect it to last a long time , this kind of thing. Or, you know, My wife wants to move to Georgia, but I can't take my pension with me, so I'm going to veto that , right? This kind of thing. And so it was actually really satisfying confirmation of what I think the theory would predict.\n\nAs lawyers, we sat down, and we identified these sources of law that seem to be creating these frictions, and then to go onto the message boards and see that, Hey, this is the same stuff that the cops are talking about on these message boards , was really a nice confirmation of the real-world applicability of the theorizing we were doing.\n\nDemsas: So I write about local government a lot, and the main critique I've had about it is how local government's lack of accountability to the mass public has allowed interest groups to fill the void and basically set the agenda for local politics. There's a political scientist at Berkeley-her name is Sarah Anzia-and she finds that these local groups are very present and influential in local politics. For example, she finds that police and firefighters' unions' influence correlates with greater spending on their salaries, and cities with more politically active police unions are less likely than cities with less-active ones to have adopted body cameras.\n\nAnd, as you've laid out clearly, a lot of what's happening in policy governance here is happening at the local level, and police unions seem to play a large role here. Is a big part of the reform you would want to see to do with police unions? Is there something to do here with, maybe, moving a lot of the governance of policing up to the state level? Do you have thoughts on that?\n\nRappaport: That's a really good question. I have some other work about police unions, where we find that collective-bargaining rights increase the incidence of violent misconduct. That's a reason separate from all the others that I have concerns about police unionism.\n\nIt's a really good question whether it would be a good idea to move more of the governance up from the local to the state or even, you could say, federal levels. I think some things-it would make a lot of sense. For certain reasons, it would make a lot of sense to do that. I do think that greater standardization could help a lot.\n\nRight now, we have about 18,000 law-enforcement agencies in the country, and there's very little standardization in most states. So the type of paperwork that a police officer has to fill out when he engages in a certain kind of policing activity is going to differ from agency to agency to agency.\n\nThis also creates friction. It creates a drag because now if I want to change jobs, I go from Agency 1 to Agency 2, I have to relearn all of Agency 2's paperwork and all of their policies, which might look very different from Agency 1's, right? And so I do think that increasing standardization-it would reduce the value of this agency-specific knowledge and make it easier, less costly for officers to change jobs, which might have some of the benefits that we talked about earlier.\n\nSo I also think that we might think about siting responsibility for training at the state level or even federal level because one downside of mobility is that when there's more mobility, the employer is going to be less likely to want to invest a lot of resources into training, because they know they would be training an employee who might pick up and leave, right?\n\nAnd similarly, actually, from the employee's perspective, they're going to be less likely to want to invest a lot of resources into learning agency-specific knowledge if they know that they might pick up and leave in a few years.\n\nBut if training is orchestrated more at the state level or even the federal level, well then, the benefits of that training can be internalized within the entire state or within the entire country. And so you don't have to worry as much about employers and employees failing to invest in training.\n\nDemsas: Well, our last question always on the show is asking: What is an idea that you had that you originally thought was a great idea, but it turned out to only be good on paper?\n\nRappaport: Okay, so I do have something in mind, which is: floating.\n\nDemsas: Okay.\n\nRappaport: Have you ever done this?\n\nDemsas: No.\n\nRappaport: Do you know what I'm talking about?\n\nDemsas: You mean down a river?\n\nRappaport: ( Laughs .) No. It's a very specific kind of floating. This is a relaxation type of activity. Actually, what's especially bad is that my wife got it for me for my birthday. But you go to this place that looks kind of like a spa, and they have these pools of water that are highly salinic, so they're full of salt. You're very buoyant in the water, and they're body temperature.\n\nDemsas: Okay.\n\nRappaport: And then they turn out all the lights. And you get down in this pool of water, and you float on your back, and it's kind of like a sensory-deprivation thing, right? You're not seeing anything. You're floating. You feel weightless.\n\nDemsas: Yeah.\n\nRappaport: Turns out this sounded good on paper to me, but I thought the whole thing was terrifying.\n\nDemsas: Yeah.\n\nRappaport: I learned for the first time that I could be claustrophobic. I never thought of myself as someone who was claustrophobic. But when you lock me in a little room with no lights, floating in a tiny, little pool of water, I felt very claustrophobic. I ended up sitting up in the pool of water, just waiting for the session to be over.\n\nDemsas: ( Laughs .) How long were you in there?\n\nRappaport: It was an hour.\n\nDemsas: Oh my God. Are you able to just leave, or does someone have to let you out?\n\nRappaport: You could have, but I was playing mind games with myself and trying to-again, this was a birthday gift, so I was trying to find a way to appreciate it.\n\nDemsas: No. I do understand. I can totally see how someone gets me-I'm like, Oh, this is gonna be very fun. I'll lie in a pool . But I just feel like it would be better if the lights were on. Wouldn't it be nicer if there was some, like, lovely little light? Like, why is that better?\n\nRappaport: It's supposed to be meditative, you know. You turn out all the lights. You close your eyes. And a lot of people fall asleep, actually, while doing this. You're that buoyant that you could actually fall asleep. But yeah, it didn't work for me at all.\n\nDemsas: Well, hopefully John's wife is not one of our many listeners on Good on Paper .\n\nRappaport: Maybe for this episode she is. I don't know.\n\nDemsas: Well, thank you so much for coming on the show. We really appreciate it.\n\nRappaport: Thanks for having me. I appreciate it.\n\n[ Music ]\n\nDemsas: Good On Paper is produced by Jinae West. It was edited by Dave Shaw, fact-checked by Ena Alvarado, and engineered by Erica Huang.

      "text": "What Trump Did to Police Officers\n\nOn January 6, 2021, Trump's supporters attacked scores of law-enforcement officers as the president stood by.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSign up for Trump's Return , a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.\n\nFour years ago, scores of police officers were attacked only yards away from where Donald Trump will swear to defend the Constitution and faithfully execute the duties of his office. The scene, in the words of one officer, was \"a non-stop barrage\" with \"weapons and things being thrown, and pepper spray, and you name it ... You could hear them yelling. You could hear them, screams and moans, and everything else.\" One officer later said that he was certain he would die the moment he entered the crowd: \"You know, you're getting pushed, kicked, you know, people are throwing metal bats at you and all that stuff. I was like, yeah, this is fucking it.\"\n\nAll of this happened because Trump, according to Special Counsel Jack Smith's report, could not accept his loss in the 2020 election, and so he tried on January 6, 2021, to \"direct an angry mob to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification of the presidential election and then leverage rioters' violence to further delay it.\" The crowd that attacked the Capitol, Smith wrote, \"was filled with Mr. Trump's supporters, as made clear by their Trump shirts, signs, and flags,\" and they \"violently attacked the law enforcement officers attempting to secure the building.\"\n\nThe ensuing riot was one of the worst days for law enforcement since 9/11. More than 140 officers were injured on January 6, but we know only the names of some of the most famous victims of the mob, such as Officers Michael Fanone, Aquilino Gonell, Harry Dunn, and others who have testified to Congress or given interviews. Their injuries were severe. Fanone was beaten to the point of a concussion and a heart attack; Gonell was attacked by more than 40 rioters and assaulted with his own riot shield. He has since undergone multiple surgeries and suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\nIn his campaign for reelection, the man who conjured this violence against his own government-and then stood by as police from multiple jurisdictions were attacked-portrayed himself as the guardian of law and order. (One of the themes of the 2024 GOP convention was \"Make America Safe Again.\") This strategy worked: Trump yet again nabbed the endorsement of the National Fraternal Order of Police. The FOP vice president, Joe Gamaldi, said in November that police see Trump's victory as a mandate from voters who are \"tired of all the chaos and disorder we're seeing in our streets. We are tired of the 'defund the police' talk, and basically we're just tired of the crap.\"\n\nRead: Trump's empty promise of 'law and order'\n\nThe new president's supporters may be tired of what they mistakenly believe is a rise in crime in the streets, but they've memory-holed Trump's willingness to throw a swarm of raging insurrectionists against the same police forces that will be protecting him at today's inauguration. Nothing, however, should be allowed to erase the truth that the party of law and order is now led by not only a convicted felon, but one who callously looked on as outnumbered police officers did battle for hours to protect the lives of the members of the United States Congress.\n\nI understand the anger that some police officers feel when the public assumes that they're all corrupt bullies, potential killers no better than the men involved in the ghastly 2020 murder of George Floyd. My father and brother were both police officers (Dad in the 1950s, and my brother from the 1960s to the 1980s). Our next-door neighbor when I was a boy was a police officer, and I grew up among cops in my small New England city. Most of them became \"law and order\" Republican voters when Richard Nixon was able to turn riots-including the mess at the 1968 Democratic National Convention-into a campaign issue.\n\nTrump has done the same through his three presidential campaigns, depicting America as a lawless hellhole. At least Nixon, however, had the advantage of pointing to the other party, and to his political opponents, as the source of danger to Americans and their armed protectors. Trump has managed to erase from millions of minds the fact that the people who attacked the police on January 6 were his own supporters , acting on what they believed were his wishes.\n\n\"I would like to see January 6 burned into the American mind as firmly as 9/11,\" the conservative writer George Will said in 2021, \"because it was that scale of a shock to the system.\" But like so many of Trump's outrages and scandals, the attack on the Capitol has faded into the noise of the 2024 campaign. Trump today will likely thunder on about the return of law and order and swear to make America's streets safer, but American voters, no matter their party, should remember what actually happened to dozens of police officers because of Trump's own actions.\n\nPolice officers at the Capitol were being attacked with an assortment of weapons-bear spray, flagpoles, even their own equipment. (\"My helmet came down and felt like someone was on top of me and I couldn't see anything,\" the Capitol Police officer Winston Pingeon told ABC News in an October 2024 interview . \"And I remember just thinking, I have to protect my gun, because they stole my baton.\") During all of this, Trump, as usual, was tweeting: \"I am asking for everyone at the U.S. Capitol to remain peaceful. No violence! Remember, WE are the Party of Law & Order-respect the Law and our great men and women in Blue. Thank you!\" Meanwhile, the mob pressed on. One officer recounted that rioters dragged him into the crowd, where they beat and tased him while yelling things such as \"I got one!\" and \"Kill him with his gun!\"\n\nTom Nichols: Trump's dangerous January 6-pardon promise\n\nTrump now refers to many of the rioters who have been convicted and jailed as \"hostages.\" He has promised to pardon some of them upon taking office. \"Most likely, I'll do it very quickly,\" he said on Meet the Press last month, adding that \"those people have suffered long and hard. And there may be some exceptions to it. I have to look. But, you know, if somebody was radical, crazy.\"\n\nThe once and future president seems to have a forgiving definition of radical . On the campaign trail, he lauded a choir formed by some of the jailed insurrectionists. He even lent them his voice; their song, \"Justice for All,\" includes Trump reciting the Pledge of Allegiance, and Trump regularly played it at his rallies. \"Our people love those people,\" Trump said last May.\n\nFour of this \"J6 Prison Choir\" were charged with assaulting a law-enforcement officer. One rioter, Julian Khater , had already pleaded guilty to assaulting multiple officers before the song was recorded. He was sentenced to almost six years in prison. Another choir member, Shane Jenkins, was also sentenced to six years in prison after being convicted of seven felonies and two misdemeanors, including throwing makeshift weapons at the police. \"I have murder in my heart and head,\" he wrote to an associate in the weeks after the riot, according to the Justice Department.\n\nTrump has described January 6 as \"a day of love.\" The police who were there know better. Many of them live with physical and psychological scars. Four of them committed suicide within a year. \"Tell me again how you support the police and law and order when all these things are happening?\" Gonell asked last spring.\n\nSafely back in the White House, Trump will never have to answer that question. But every time he and other elected Republicans claim to be the party of law and order, Americans should remember the day that the 47th president was willing to sacrifice the men and women of the thin blue line on the altar of his own ambitions."

      "text": "How the Supreme Court Protects Police Officers\n\nIt's almost impossible to hold them to account.\n\nO n the afternoon of February 8, 2018, more than two dozen law-enforcement officers crowded into a conference room in the Henry County Sheriff's Office, on the outskirts of Atlanta. They were preparing to execute a no-knock warrant at 305 English Road, the home of a suspected drug dealer who had been under investigation for almost two years. The special agent leading the briefing told the team that 305 English Road was a small house with off-white siding and several broken-down cars out front, showed them an aerial photograph of the house, and gave them turn-by-turn directions to get there.\n\nWhen the officers arrived at their destination, the house described in the warrant-305 English Road, run-down, off-white, with cars strewn across the yard-was right in front of them. But they walked past it to a different house, a tidy yellow one, 40 yards away. The house at 303 English Road looked nothing like the house described in the briefing and in the warrant. Yet, less than a minute after getting out of their cars, the officers set off flash grenades and used battering rams to smash open all three doors of the home.\n\nInside, they found Onree Norris, a 78-year-old Black man who had lived there for more than 50 years, raising his three children while he worked at a nearby rock quarry. Norris was no drug dealer. He had never been in any trouble with the law; he'd never even received a traffic ticket.\n\nOnree Norris was watching the evening news in an armchair in his bedroom when he heard a thunderous sound, as if a bomb had gone off in his house. He got up to see what the commotion was and found a crowd of men in military gear in his hallway. Norris was more than twice as old as the target of the search warrant, but the officers pointed assault rifles at him anyway and yelled at him to raise his hands and get on the ground. When Norris told the officers that his knees were in bad shape, an officer grabbed Norris, pushed him down, and twisted his arm behind his back. Norris's chest hurt, and he had trouble breathing. He told the officers that he had a heart condition-he'd had bypass surgery and had a pacemaker put in-but they kept him on the ground for several minutes. Norris was eventually led outside in handcuffs. When the officers realized they had blasted their way into the wrong house, they turned their cameras off one by one.\n\nW hatever one believes about the job of policing-whether it's that well-intentioned officers often must make split-second decisions that are easy to criticize in hindsight, or that the profession is inherently corrupt-there is no doubt that police officers sometimes egregiously abuse their authority. The videos that have filled our screens in recent years-most recently the surveillance footage of officers in Memphis fatally beating Tyre Nichols -offer horrifying evidence of this reality.\n\nPeople who have lost loved ones or have themselves been harmed by the police often say that they want the officers involved to be punished and an assurance that something similar won't happen in the future. Yet justice for victims of police misconduct is extremely difficult to achieve.\n\nWhat happened in Memphis last week-the swift firing and arrest of the five officers who beat Nichols, and the murder charges they face-is highly unusual, a result of immediate public attention to an inconceivably barbaric attack. Although officers can be criminally prosecuted and sent to prison, they seldom are: Police are charged in less than 2 percent of fatal shootings and convicted in less than a third of those cases. Police departments rarely discipline or fire their officers.\n\nTypically, victims' only recourse is a civil lawsuit seeking money or court-ordered reforms. In 1961, the Supreme Court ruled that people could sue officers who violated their constitutional rights under a federal statute enacted 90 years earlier, during the bloody years of Reconstruction. That statute, known then as the Ku Klux Klan Act and referred to as Section 1983 today, was meant to provide a remedy to Black people across the South who were being tortured and killed by white supremacists while local law enforcement either participated in the violence or stood idly by.\n\nAfter that 1961 decision, the number of police-misconduct suits filed shot up. But so did concerns about the suits' potentially ruinous effects. Settlements and judgments would bankrupt officers and cities; no one in their right mind would agree to become a police officer; the very fabric of our society would become unwound. These claims were exaggerated, if not simply false. But they have nevertheless been relied upon by courts, legislatures, and government officials over the past 60 years to justify the creation of multiple overlapping protections for officers and police departments that regularly deny justice to people whose rights have been violated.\n\nThe best-known of these protections is \" qualified immunity .\" When the Supreme Court created qualified immunity, in 1967, it was meant to shield officers from liability only if they were acting in \"good faith\" when they violated the Constitution. Yet the Court has repeatedly strengthened the doctrine. In 1982, the Court ruled that requiring officers to prove good faith was too much of a burden. Instead, they would be entitled to qualified immunity so long as they did not violate \" clearly established law .\" Over the years, what constitutes \"clearly established law\" has constricted. The Roberts Court, invoking the importance of qualified immunity to \" society as a whole ,\" has emphasized that the law is \"clearly established\" only if a court has previously found nearly identical conduct to be unconstitutional. What began as a protection for officers acting in good faith has turned into a protection for officers with the good fortune to have violated the Constitution in a novel way.\n\nIt was qualified immunity that dashed Onree Norris's hopes of getting justice. In 2018, Norris sued the officers who had raided his home, seeking money to compensate him for his physical and emotional injuries. But in 2020, a federal judge in the Northern District of Georgia granted the officers qualified immunity and dismissed the case; in 2021, a panel of three judges on the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the ruling.\n\nThe three appeals judges recognized that officers who execute a search warrant on the wrong home violate the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution unless they have made \"a reasonable effort to ascertain and identify the place intended to be searched.\" In fact, the very same court of appeals that heard Norris's case in 2021 had ruled five years earlier that it was unconstitutional for an officer who executed a warrant on the wrong house to detain its residents at gunpoint-almost exactly what had happened to Norris. But that earlier court decision was not enough to defeat qualified immunity in Norris's case, because it was \"unpublished\"-meaning that it was available online but had not been selected to be printed in the books of decisions that are issued each year-and the Eleventh Circuit is of the view that such unpublished decisions cannot \"clearly establish\" the law.\n\nJ ust as George Floyd's murder has come to represent all that is wrong with police violence and overreach, qualified immunity has come to represent all that is wrong with our system of police accountability. But, over the past 60 years, the Supreme Court has created multiple other barriers to holding police to account.\n\nTake, for example, the standard that a plaintiff must meet to file a complaint. For decades, a complaint needed to include only a \"short and plain\" statement of the facts and why those facts entitled the plaintiff to relief. But in 2007, the Supreme Court did an about-face, requiring that plaintiffs include enough factual detail in their initial complaints to establish a \"plausible\" entitlement to relief.\n\nThis standard does not always pose a problem: Norris and his lawyer knew enough about what had happened during the raid of his home to write a detailed complaint. But sometimes a person whose rights have been violated doesn't know the crucial details of their case.\n\nVicki Timpa searched for months for information about how her son, Tony, had died while handcuffed in Dallas police officers' custody in August 2016. Department officials had body-camera videos that captured Tony's last moments, but they refused to tell Timpa what had happened to her son or the names of the officers who were on the scene when he died. Timpa sued the city, but the case was dismissed because her complaint did not include enough factual detail about those last moments to establish a \"plausible\" claim.\n\nWhen the Court set out the \"plausibility\" standard, it explained that, if filing a case were too easy, plaintiffs with \"a largely groundless claim\" could \"take up the time\" of defendants, and expensive discovery could \"push cost-conscious defendants to settle even anemic cases.\" But this rule puts people like Timpa in a bind: They are allowed discovery only if their complaints include evidence supporting their claims, but they can't access that evidence without the tools of discovery.\n\n(Timpa did eventually get the information she sought after she filed a public-records request and sued the city for not complying with it. Only with that information in hand could she defeat the motion to dismiss. But then her case was dismissed on qualified-immunity grounds because she could not point to a prior case with similar facts. That decision was overturned on appeal in December 2021, and Timpas's case is set to go to trial in March, almost seven years after Tony was killed.)\n\nThe Supreme Court has also interpreted the Constitution in ways that deny relief to victims of police violence and overreach. The Fourth Amendment protects against \"unreasonable searches and seizures.\" But in a series of decisions beginning in the 1960s, the Court has interpreted the \"reasonableness\" standard in a manner so deferential to police that officers can stop, arrest, search, beat, shoot, or kill people who have done nothing wrong without violating their rights.\n\nOn a July night in 2016, David Collie was walking down the street in Fort Worth, Texas, headed to a friend's house, when two officers jumped out of their patrol car and yelled for Collie to raise his hands. The officers were on the lookout for two Black men who had robbed someone at a gas station. Collie was at least 10 years older, six inches shorter, and 30 pounds lighter than the smaller of the two robbery suspects. But he, like the suspects, was Black and was not wearing a shirt on that warm summer evening. Collie raised his hands. Just seconds later, and while standing more than 30 feet away, one of the officers shot Collie in the back. The hollow-point bullet entered Collie's lung and punctured his spine. He survived, but was left paralyzed from the waist down.\n\nWhen Collie sued, his case was dismissed by a district-court judge in Texas, and the decision was affirmed on appeal. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals called the case \"tragic,\" and a prime example of \"an individual's being in the wrong place at the wrong time,\" but concluded that the officer had not violated Collie's Fourth Amendment rights, because he reasonably-though mistakenly-thought he had seen a gun in Collie's raised hand.\n\nThe Supreme Court has undermined the power and potential of civil-rights lawsuits in other ways: It has limited, for example, plaintiffs' ability to sue local governments for their officers' conduct and to win court orders requiring that departments change their behavior. Any one of the barriers, in isolation, would limit the power of civil-rights suits. In combination, they have made the police all but untouchable.\n\nE ven when people are able to secure a settlement or verdict to compensate them for their losses, police officers and departments rarely suffer any consequences for their wrongdoing.\n\nThe Supreme Court has long assumed that officers personally pay settlements and judgments entered against them. That is one of the justifications for qualified immunity. But officers' bank accounts are protected by a wholly separate set of state laws and local policies requiring or allowing most governments to indemnify their officers when they are sued (meaning that they must pay for the officers' defense and any award against them). As a result, vanishingly few police officers pay a penny in these cases.\n\nPolice departments typically don't feel the financial sting of settlements or judgments either. Instead, the money is taken from local-government funds. And when money is tight, it tends to get pulled from the crevices of budgets earmarked for the least powerful: the marginalized people whose objections will carry the least political weight-the same people disproportionately likely to be abused by police.\n\nOfficers and officials could still learn from lawsuits, even without paying for them. But most make little effort to do so when a lawsuit doesn't inspire front-page news or meetings with an angry mayor. Instead, government attorneys defend the officers in court, any settlement or judgment is paid out of the government's budget or by the government's insurer, and the law-enforcement agency moves on. In many cases, it does not even track the names of the officers, the alleged claims, the evidence revealed, the eventual resolution, or the amount paid.\n\nF undamental questions remain about what we should empower the police to do, and how to restore trust between law enforcement and the communities it serves. But no matter how governments ultimately answer these questions, they will almost certainly continue to authorize people to protect public safety. And some of those people will almost certainly abuse that authority. We need to get our system of governmental accountability working better than it does, no matter what our system of public safety looks like.\n\nThe fact that so many barriers to justice exist means that there is something for officials at every level of government to do.\n\nThe Supreme Court should reconsider its standards for qualified immunity, pleading rules, the Fourth Amendment, and municipal liability. But this seems unlikely, because a majority of the justices have demonstrated a durable hostility to plaintiffs in civil-rights cases.\n\nCongress could remove many of the obstacles the Supreme Court has devised. And at least some members of Congress have shown an appetite for doing so. A bill to end qualified immunity, among other reforms, was passed in the House soon after the murder of George Floyd. But following 15 months of negotiations in the Senate, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act was abandoned. Republican Senator Tim Scott described the bill's provision ending qualified immunity as a \"poison pill\" for Republican lawmakers.\n\nIn the face of intransigence at the federal level, states have stepped in. Since May 2020, lawmakers in more than half of the states have proposed bills that would effectively do away with qualified immunity; these bills would allow people to bypass Section 1983 claims altogether and, instead, bring state-law claims for constitutional violations where qualified immunity could not be raised as a defense. State legislatures have additionally proposed bills that would limit police officers' power to use force-prohibiting choke holds and no-knock warrants.\n\nA bill enacted by Colorado in June 2020 is, in many ways, the gold standard. It allows people to sue law-enforcement officers for violations of the state constitution and prohibits officers from raising qualified immunity as a defense. The law also requires local governments to indemnify their officers unless they have been convicted of a crime, but allows cities to make officers contribute up to $25,000 or 5 percent of a settlement or judgment if the city concludes that the officer acted in bad faith. And the law bans officers from using choke holds, creating a bright-line limit on police power. Similar bills have passed in New Mexico and New York City , and are on the legislative agenda in other states. But other police-reform bills have failed in California, Washington, Virginia, and elsewhere.\n\nI've testified in legislative hearings for bills in several states, and each has been frustratingly familiar. The people speaking against the bills threaten that if police officers cannot raise qualified immunity as a defense, they will be bankrupted for reasonable mistakes, and frivolous lawsuits will flood the courts. These assertions are just not true. Nevertheless, they have led lawmakers to vote against legislation that would take tentative but important steps toward a better system. Their inaction has left us with a world in which Onree Norris could receive nothing more than a few repairs to his doors after officers busted into his home and forced him to the floor; a world in which the Dallas Police Department could hide information about Tony Timpa's death and then argue that his mother's complaint should be dismissed because she did not have that information; a world in which David Collie could be shot and paralyzed from the waist down by a police officer, and require medical care for those injuries for the remainder of his life, but receive nothing, because the officer mistakenly thought Collie had a gun.\n\nWe need to stop being scared of unfounded claims about the dangers of too much justice, and start worrying about the people who have their lives shattered by the police-and then again by the courts.\n\nThis essay was adapted from the forthcoming Shielded: How the Police Became Untouchable.\n\nWhen you buy a book using a link on this page, we receive a commission.

      "text": "Of Course Presidents Are Officers of the United States\n\nTo think otherwise threatens the entire idea of a constitutional republic.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSign up for The Decision , a newsletter featuring our 2024 election coverage.\n\nLast week, Donald Trump's lawyers attempted to convince the Supreme Court that he was a 16th-century European monarch who cannot be disqualified from holding office, because he enjoys immunity from certain constitutional laws. Jonathan Mitchell, Trump's lawyer, began his argument before the Court by declaring, \"Trump is not covered by Section 3 [of the Fourteenth Amendment] because the president is not 'an officer of the United States' as that term is used throughout the Constitution.\"\n\nThis effort to avoid the designation \"officer of the United States\" smacks of a conclusion in want of a rationale. Neither Trump nor his defenders have found a single quotation from the 1860s declaring that the president is not an officer of the United States for purposes of Section 3. Proponents of disqualification, by comparison, have unearthed numerous assertions that Section 3 was meant to encompass all offices and all officeholders. Neither Trump nor his defenders have explained why the Constitution would permit a president who encouraged an attack on Congress to hold all offices in every state and the national government while disqualifying from every office a dogcatcher who was a foot soldier in an insurrection.\n\nNevertheless, this position has gained a bizarre amount of scholarly support among so-called originalists and textualists, and some justices may now be leaning toward this view. To find this argument persuasive requires an obsession with technicalities that forgoes any big-picture understanding of what made the American republic different from the monarchies that preceded it. Should the Supreme Court fail to grasp this difference, the resulting decision would threaten to vest presidents with the attributes of the monarchs rejected by Americans in both the First and Second Foundings.\n\nIn those regimes, some people made law but were not bound by or accountable to law. English kings, Henry VIII understood well, were not officers of England, but sovereign rulers of the land. To the extent that Henry VIII was an officer or held an office, he was an officer under God. No mere English officer was empowered to judge the conduct of the sovereign King. The Tudors and Stuarts appointed \"officers of the Crown.\" Such officers got their authority from the King and were answerable only to the King.\n\nBy contrast, Americans in 1787 and 1866 (when the Fourteenth Amendment was written) worked within a framework that sharply distinguished officeholders in a constitutional order in which the people were sovereign from officeholders in those other orders. In a constitutional regime, all persons who exercise government power are officers; as such, their authority is prescribed by law, and they are accountable to law. The Preamble to the Constitution of the United States recognizes that the people are sovereign in the United States. No person with governing responsibilities is above the law. The legal authority that all officers exercise is ultimately grounded in the Constitution and laws of the United States, not in the sovereign president, sovereign Congress, or sovereign Supreme Court. No one in the United States is an \"officer of the president\" or an \"officer of Congress\" or an \"officer of the Supreme Court.\"\n\nQuinta Jurecic: The Supreme Court is eager to rid itself of this difficult Trump question\n\nAmericans from the very beginning recognized that presidents in a regime in which the people were sovereign were officers of the United States. Andrew Johnson, who was president when the Fourteenth Amendment was framed, routinely referred to himself as \"the chief civil executive officer of the United States.\" Members of Congress consistently referred to the president as an officer of the United States. When Representative James Ashley in 1867 called for an investigation to determine whether \"any officer of the Government of the United States\" had committed an impeachable offense, both he and Representative John Bingham, considered the primary framer of the Fourteenth Amendment , agreed that the president was a civil officer of the United States subject to investigation. All exercises of power in America (presidential and otherwise) had to be authorized by law, and all power-holders were subject to law.\n\nMembers of Congress understood that one consequence of the transition from a regime in which a person or institution was sovereign to a regime in which the people were sovereign was some confusion at the use of the word officer in the Constitution. Representative James A. Bayard in 1799 acknowledged that the word office in the Constitution was \"incautiously used.\" Members of Congress also easily acknowledged that the president was not an officer for purposes of the commissions clause in Article II because the president did not commission the president. Many, not all, recognized that members of Congress were not civil officers under the impeachment clause because the Constitution provided for a distinct means for removing representatives and senators who committed misdeeds. Nevertheless, a consensus existed on officeholding. As articulated by both the prosecution and the defense in the impeachment hearings of Senator William Blount in 1799, presidents and members of Congress were officers of the United States unless the particular constitutional context made clear that a different treatment was warranted. Immediately after declaring that presidents and senators were not officers of the United States for purposes of the impeachment clause, Bayard insisted that the president, senators, and representatives were officers under the Constitution for purposes of the emoluments clause .\n\nThe Republican members of the 39th Congress who framed the Fourteenth Amendment consciously worked within the American understanding of popular sovereignty and officeholding. Members routinely referred to the president as an officer of the United States. Senator Benjamin Wade of Ohio, a Republican, maintained that the president was \"the chief executive officer of the United States.\" Senator James Guthrie of Kentucky, a Democrat, did the same. Less than a month after Congress sent the Fourteenth Amendment to the states for ratification, the House of Representatives approved a committee report that declared that the Constitution used the phrases \"officer,\" \"officer of the United States\" and \"officer under the United States\" indiscriminately, and that all officers should be considered officers of and under the United States unless the context makes clear that a more limited use was intended.\n\nTrump and his defenders do not comprehend the significance of denying that the president is an officer of the United States. Trump was a president bound by law, not a monarch above the law. As an officer of the United States, he engaged in an insurrection against the Constitution he swore to protect, preserve, and defend, and the laws of this nation-laws he is subject to, laws that prohibit any such person from officeholding ever again. Henry VIII would not understand, but George Washington and the men who drafted Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment would."

      "text": "Get Ready for Tesla Cops\n\nPolice officers are falling in love with electric cars.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nAt a rally this past April in Michigan, surrounded by a cadre of law-enforcement officials, Donald Trump suddenly began railing against electric cars. President Joe Biden's decision to support EVs, he decried , \"is one of the dumbest I've ever heard.\" Minutes later, he was back to praising the sheriffs behind him: \"We have to get law and order back. These are the best people in the world,\" he said to a smattering of applause.\n\nSupport for law enforcement and skepticism of electric cars both abound on the right. Police officers are more likely to identify as Republican than the communities they serve, and their unions widely endorsed Trump in 2020. Meanwhile, the Americans buying electric cars tend to be Democratic. And yet, more and more law-enforcement officers seem to be taken by EVs. When they \"get into and experience the [electric] cars firsthand themselves,\" Tony Abdalla, a sergeant with the South Pasadena Police Department, told me, \"they're like, Okay, I think I get it now .\"\n\nLast month, South Pasadena's police department became the first in the country with a fully electric police fleet, replacing all of its gas-powered vehicles with 20 Teslas. Four officers, after test-driving Teslas for the department, have already bought one for personal use, Abdalla, who leads his department's EV-conversion project, told me. South Pasadena is one among a growing number of law-enforcement agencies that are electrifying their fleets. About 50 miles south, the Irvine Police Department just became likely the country's first to purchase a Tesla Cybertruck. Departments in at least 38 states have purchased, tested, or deployed fully electric cars. Electric patrol cars are not yet legion and in many cities are likely less common than EVs among the general population, but their ranks are growing. They now prowl the streets in Eupora, Mississippi ; Cary, North Carolina ; and Logan, Ohio .\n\nThe nation's switch to battery-powered police cruisers isn't only, or even primarily, about the environment. In many cases, they are proving to simply be the best-performing and most cost-effective option for law enforcement. Police departments require vehicles that have rapid acceleration and deceleration; space for radios, sirens, and other special equipment; and extreme reliability for 24-hour emergency responses. When the South Pasadena police first looked into electrification, in the mid-2000s, no EVs on the market could handle the heavy workload that law enforcement demands. The last thing any police officer needs is to worry about their car running out of charge mid-shift. When Tesla unveiled the Model Y in 2019, Abdalla said, it \"perked us up.\" The model's range, safety, and power made it the first EV that appeared potentially suitable for the department.\n\nFive years later, the cars have gotten much better. New EVs can regularly drive upwards of 200 or 300 miles per charge, plenty for many officers. Multiple companies help modify Teslas with the necessary equipment to turn them into patrol cars, and both Ford and Chevy market EVs specifically for police use. And from a performance perspective, EVs are appealing for law enforcement because they are typically more powerful than gas-powered cars. The acceleration can verge on the absurd-an electric Hummer pickup truck, which weighs nearly 10,000 pounds, can go from zero to 60 miles per hour about as quickly as a Formula 1 race car. The reason is simple: Whereas combustion engines have to transfer energy from a series of explosions through the transmission and then to the wheels, electric motors instantly begin spinning the tires.\n\nRead: The electric Hummer is a paradox\n\nAn annual vehicle test by the Michigan State Police precision-driving unit, which is used by departments across North America to gauge a car's suitability for police use, found last year that the Chevy Blazer EV and the Ford Mustang Mach-E accelerated from zero to 100 miles per hour in roughly 11 seconds, about half the time of many popular gas-powered police cars. On a highway patrol, improved acceleration means catching up to other cars more quickly and risking fewer accidents, says Nicholas Darlington, the Michigan State Police precision-driving unit's commander. If a suspect is fleeing in a high-end EV, a gas-powered pursuit vehicle might just not be able to catch up : There are numerous videos of police cars struggling to keep pace with Teslas on real and controlled roads.\n\nAn EV is typically more expensive up front than a gas-powered car, but police departments offset those costs by not needing to fuel up. The South Pasadena PD expects to save $4,000 a year per EV on fuel alone, Abdalla said. EVs also require less maintenance than gas cars do, compensating for higher sticker costs. After factoring in maintenance and other savings, the operational costs of the city's Teslas could be half the price per mile driven. New York City, which has one of the largest police fleets in the world, now has roughly 200 EVs, and citywide has \"achieved probably 60 to 70 percent maintenance savings in our existing electric fleet,\" Keith Kerman, NYC's chief fleet officer, told me. The most expensive and time-consuming repairs, combustion-engine and transmission replacements, are wholly unnecessary for EVs, he added, meaning the cars can more consistently stay on the road and free up mechanics.\n\nTodd Bertram, the police chief in Bargersville, Indiana, told a local news site that the department's 13 Teslas are leading to roughly $80,000 in savings on fuel costs, freeing the agency up to hire two additional officers. \"For us, it was primarily an operational decision,\" Abdalla said. \"We got a much better-performing fleet that cost significantly less to maintain and fuel. It saves taxpayers money.\"\n\nEVs don't make the best police cars in every situation. Some departments that have piloted Teslas have determined that they are too small for regular police work. Range is another concern: South Pasadena is a relatively small municipality in which officers are unlikely to drive more than 60 miles in any given 12-hour shift, Abdalla told me. In New York City on a triple shift, an EV battery's range might not cut it, which is why the NYPD operates more than 2,000 hybrids, Kerman told me. Chargers are much slower than refueling a gas tank, and there are still not enough of them. EVs may not always be practical for state troopers or highway-patrol officers, who may have to drive long distances over roads without much of an EV-charging infrastructure.\n\nAs more officers are seen patrolling highways and parks, making traffic stops and arrests, and idling on street corners in Teslas, electric pickup trucks, and battery-powered SUVs, more Republicans may give EVs a chance. \"Given the high trust Republicans have in law enforcement, it's possible that those who were once skeptical of EVs could have a more favorable impression of these products once they see law enforcement using them,\" Mike Murphy, who runs the EV Politics Project, an advocacy group dedicated to getting Republicans to adopt EVs, told me over email.\n\nThat will not be the case everywhere-if police cars aren't labeled as electric, for instance, people may not notice them, Loren McDonald, an EV consultant, told me over email. In some places, the effect of electric police cruisers might even dissuade more drivers: \"Pushing for EVs using climate-change arguments ... would further alienate GOP politicians and voters who have a polarized and entrenched view on climate change,\" Murphy said.\n\nRight now, electric cars might actually be more divisive than law enforcement. Some recent polling suggests that Republicans and Democrats may be more closely aligned in their confidence in the police than in how they view EVs. GOP politicians might even prevent police departments, along with other government agencies, from buying EVs, as Republican legislators attempted to do in Kentucky earlier this year. Defunding the police is already a controversial idea; defueling the police may turn out to be as well."

      "text": "What I Learned at the Police Academy\n\nOfficers are trained to see the world as a violent place-and then to act accordingly.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSonya Massey was just holding a pot of water in her own kitchen when an Illinois sheriff's deputy, Sean Grayson, threatened to \"fucking shoot\" her in the \"fucking face.\" The body-camera footage from that night shows how quickly an interaction with a police officer can become deadly: In a matter of minutes, Massey's call for service turned into a murder scene. Throughout the interaction, Massey followed Grayson's commands. Despite her compliance, Grayson drew his pistol, aimed it at her, and shot her three times. At 36 years old, Sonya Massey became another Black American needlessly killed by the police. (Grayson has pleaded not guilty to charges of first-degree murder.)\n\nEach time the name of a new victim of police violence enters the public lexicon-Michael Brown, Sandra Bland, Eric Garner, Philando Castile, Breonna Taylor, George Floyd, and now Sonya Massey-there are questions about the officer's response. How could that officer have mistaken a cellphone for a weapon? Why did that officer shoot someone who was running away? Did that officer really have to shoot so many times? One answer to all these questions is that officers are trained to see the world as threatening and to respond accordingly.\n\nTheir training happens primarily at a police academy, where cadets spend months learning how to be a police officer. I studied this training at four large municipal police departments to gain a better understanding of what kinds of skills cadets learn, how they are evaluated, and why some cadets make it to graduation while others wash out. (As part of my agreement with the departments and my university's institutional review board, I cannot identify the specific departments.) This was in 2018, just four years after the uprising in Ferguson, Missouri, following the killing of 18-year-old Michael Brown and two years before the Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd by kneeling on his neck for nearly 10 minutes. I, like so many others around the world, wanted to know why the names and stories of Black Americans killed by police just kept coming, and I thought that finding out who was allowed to be an officer and how they were trained to do their job could help answer that question.\n\nSue Rahr: The myth propelling America's violent police culture\n\nI observed and participated in the academy training myself, which meant that, alongside the cadets, I woke up early, sat through hours of dense lectures, ran miles in formation, learned basic drill commands, did push-ups, lifted weights, shot guns, and learned how to punch, kick, use pressure points, apply handcuffs, and take someone to the ground. (All of the academies knew that I was there as a researcher, and I introduced myself as such when meeting cadets and officers.) I had a front-row seat to academy training, and what I saw was cause for concern. As I later wrote in my book, Before the Badge , violence was everywhere I looked. The result, I found, was that many of those who made it into the institution, through the training, and out onto patrol were competent in, and eager to use, violence.\n\nMy study of police training practices was, of course, not exhaustive. It is certainly possible-and, indeed, I hope this is the case-that some academies are doing things differently. And many of the officers and trainees I met aspired to join police departments because they wanted to help the vulnerable and serve others. But in my experience from studying these academies, the weight of the training tilted strongly toward violence, again and again.\n\nTo even gain admission to the academy, applicants needed to demonstrate a willingness to engage in violence by recounting prior physical altercations to the hiring officers. I observed parts of the hiring process at all four departments, and watched the full application and interview portion at two. At these two departments, the interview included a question explicitly asking whether the applicant had ever been in a physical confrontation and, if so, to describe what happened. The preferred answer to this question was Yes, I've been in a fight, but I did not initiate it . When candidates responded that they had no experience fighting, the hiring officers expressed intense anxiety and wariness about their suitability for the job. In one interview, for example, after a 43-year-old white applicant said he had never been in a fight, the sergeant told her colleagues that she thought he would \"crawl into himself and disengage\" if a fight presented itself, adding, \"He's gonna have to get angry.\"\n\nOnce they got into the academy, cadets were bombarded with warnings about the dangers they would face on the job. There was a war on cops, instructors insisted, making policing more dangerous now than ever before. Although empirical evidence shows that policing has actually gotten safer over time, the academy instructors repeated these warnings, often vividly, showing disturbing, graphic videos of officers being brutally beaten or killed. On several occasions, instructors designed morbid exercises requiring that cadets envision their own violent death. On the very first day at one academy, a commander encouraged the cadets to study the wall of honor located in the main hallway of the academy building, where portraits hung of every officer at the department who had died in the line of duty, along with a description of how they died. Reading their stories, he explained, will \"keep you alive.\" At another academy, following a tactical exercise, the instructors directed any cadet who had lost their gun during the fight to write their own obituary. \"For all those who got your gun taken,\" the instructor explained, \"you have to write your own obituary ... write about everyone you're leaving behind.\" A war was being waged, the cadets learned, and the stakes could not be higher.\n\nSurviving this war, instructors stressed, depended on cadets' ability to adopt a warrior's mentality, which demanded hypervigilance, heightened suspicion of others, and a willingness to do whatever it took to make it home at the end of each shift. Equally important was the ability to identify their enemy: \"bad guys,\" who were described as ruthless, malicious, immoral, and unpredictable. Although ostensibly race-neutral, the \"bad guys\" concept was steeped in language that invoked race. Instructors told cadets that although they should never racially profile, they should absolutely profile \"criminality,\" discerned through clothing, cars, mannerisms, gait, and neighborhood. \"We do not racially profile,\" one instructor explained during the multiculturalism class, but they do profile based on \"body language, appearance, and mannerisms.\" \"If you can't profile someone who wants to hurt or kill you,\" he explained, \"that's a problem.\" Racial profiling, he continued, is a form of discrimination, and police \"don't do that.\" Police officers at their department do not profile based on \"skin color, gender, or language,\" he clarified, \"but if [someone looks] like a burglar, then that's good profiling.\" These discursive gymnastics enabled instructors to officially condemn racial profiling while simultaneously encouraging it under a different name.\n\nFrom the July/August 2021 issue: The authoritarian instincts of police unions\n\nOnce they learned whom to fear, cadets trained themselves to react to these threats, spending hundreds of hours practicing techniques designed to control, incapacitate, hurt, and kill other people. These skills did not necessarily come naturally, and learning how to use the appropriate amount of force required practice. Cadets sometimes used too much force, and sometimes too little. These two mistakes, however, were treated very differently in the academy setting, where instructors calmly acknowledged when cadets used too much force but became irate when cadets used too little. During a tactics drill at one academy, for example, when multiple cadets used lethal force in a scenario against their unarmed partner, the instructors were not visibly upset and did not punish the class. In contrast, during a different tactics exercise, in which three cadets lost their gun, re-holstered it, and reengaged in a physical struggle with their opponent, one instructor threw his face guard in the air and screamed, \"What the fuck!\" Following the exercise, another instructor repeatedly pressed the cadets, asking them why they hadn't shot, reminding them that in this scenario, \"it's you or him or her, and we want it to be you.\" If they were going to make a mistake, cadets learned, it should be the one where they walked away alive.\n\nEven in classes focused on techniques meant to mitigate violence, such as de-escalation, the instructors still underscored the importance of remaining vigilant, prepared for violence, and prioritizing officer safety above everything else. During the de-escalation class at two different academies, the instructors shared the 1998 video of Laurens County Sheriff's Office Deputy Kyle Dinkheller's murder. The three-and-a-half-minute video shows a traffic stop gone wrong that culminates in Dinkheller's guttural, panicked screams and strained breathing as he dies at the side of his patrol car. Before playing the video, one instructor explained, \"Even though we're talking about de-escalation today, I'm not watering down officer safety. Do not drop your guard.\" After the video was over, another instructor warned, \"I hate going to funerals. Don't make me go to your funeral because you were using your words when you shouldn't be.\" Although using words was great where possible, these lessons highlighted, if used incorrectly, they could be your last.\n\nBy the time the cadets reached graduation, they had spent hundreds of hours hearing that they are at war, that the \"bad guys\" should be identified through profiling, and that gaining competence in violence is the only way to survive. Cadets' bodies are physically conditioned to assume that everyone is armed, to act swiftly and decisively, and to shoot as soon as they perceive a deadly threat. Given this training, it is not hard to understand why some police officers end up shooting unarmed civilians who run away, turn around suddenly, or reach into their pocket to grab a phone or wallet; that is what they were trained to do."

      "text": "America Is Losing Its Black Police Officers\n\nAfter decades of gains, departments face a wave of retirements.\n\nWhen Ray Kelly was appointed commissioner of the New York Police Department, in 1992, he announced that his No. 1 priority was to recruit more Black officers to the force. \"Without these actions, there will be increased tension between the communities and the police,\" Kelly told The New York Times . \"Tension leads to hostilities and that will lead to more cries of racism in the department.\"\n\nKelly was not alone. The same year, Willie Williams became the first Black chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, which since 1980 had been under court order to produce a force that looked more like the city it patrolled-and which had been roiled by the beating of Rodney King in 1991. Williams promised to hire more Black officers. So did mayors such as Marion Barry of Washington, D.C., and Chicago's Richard Daley, who in 1995 said, \"You have to have a diversity, and that diversity includes everyone.\"\n\nThese diversification efforts were largely successful. American police forces became far more representative of their communities, adding women, Black officers, and members of other minority groups. But some of America's largest police forces are suddenly-and quickly-getting less diverse, as two trends converge: A wave of Black officers is reaching retirement age, and recruitment efforts to replace them are sputtering.\n\nThe NYPD has seen a 14 percent drop in Black officers since 2008, from a high of 4,162 to 3,598 this September. Black employment in the Philadelphia Police Department has fallen 19 percent since 2017. The number of Black officers in the Chicago Police Department has dropped by 12 percent since May 2019. Even Washington, D.C., long a leader in minority-police recruitment, has had a 25 percent decrease since 1998 , when two-thirds of officers were Black, to 50 percent today , though the city also got whiter over that time period. The LAPD has seen a 24 percent drop in Black officers, from 1,175 in 2010 to 885 today, though the department's ranks have also shrunk.\n\nGathering a complete national view of demographic changes is effectively impossible. The United States has more than 18,000 police departments, many of them tiny and all with their own practices for collecting and releasing data. But the data from the big departments all point in the same direction and match anecdotal reports: America's police forces are getting less Black, and some are getting whiter.\n\nAs recently as the 1960s, some cities had no Black officers; others didn't allow them to carry guns or arrest white suspects. But many departments have made major improvements on minority hiring, through a combination of court-ordered changes, political pressure, and the occasional visionary leader. Surveys from the federal Bureau of Justice Statistics found that the percentage of Black officers nationwide rose steadily from 1987 (9.3 percent) to 2013 (11.9 percent). There was a particular influx in the '90s, fed by a growing political focus on diversity combined with the 1994 crime bill, which provided federal funding to hire 100,000 new police officers around the country.\n\nThose unusual gains, however, sowed the seeds of the impending collapse in Black-police ranks. \"In the late '80s and early '90s, there was a big hiring push,\" says Captain Aaron McCraney, who leads the LAPD's recruitment and employment division. \"Consequently, especially when it comes to African Americans, a lot of those people are at the point in their careers where it's a natural attrition. It's naturally occurring because of that hiring surge.\"\n\nMany members of the cohort of officers who joined the force in the '80s and '90s are now reaching retirement age. By 2016, the most recent year for which Bureau of Justice data are available, the proportion of Black officers had dipped to 11.4 percent.\n\nThe available data suggest that what McCraney is seeing in Los Angeles is happening in large departments across the nation-deepening the pre-2016 trends. A survey by the Police Executive Research Forum this summer found a 45 percent annual increase in retirement rates at responding agencies, including a 27 percent increase in departments with at least 500 officers. Agencies also reported a significant jump in officers resigning preretirement. (The reasons for this phenomenon are not well understood.)\n\nThis exodus couldn't come at a more difficult moment. Following the murder of George Floyd last year and other high-profile instances of police violence, American cities erupted in the largest protests in generations, if not ever . Police departments are facing new political pressures , and relationships between departments and Black Americans are at a low point-which makes reversing the demographic trend both more pressing and more challenging.\n\nAdam Serwer: The authoritarian instincts of police unions\n\n\"When we don't have the right face, you can't get the right results,\" Captain Frederick Thomas, the president of the National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives, told me. \"You've got to have the right face in the right community.\"\n\nCivilian and police leaders have long argued that departments that don't look like their communities are less effective and more likely to produce tensions. Racism remains an enormous problem in American policing, including the overpolicing of Black communities, disproportionate killings of Black civilians , and internal racial tensions within departments . In 2020, according to Gallup , just 19 percent of Black adults had confidence in the police, a number that rebounded somewhat in 2021 but is still an atrocious 27 percent.\n\n\"We know based on our own observations, as well as the various empirical studies, that we serve a very pivotal position in the creation of good, solid police-community relations,\" Charles P. Wilson, the chairman of the National Association of Black Law Enforcement Officers, told me. \"We police differently than our [white] counterparts do. There's no question about that. We come on the job for a different reason than they do. When we're on the street, we treat people differently.\"\n\nIn the LAPD, McCraney told me, Chief Michel Moore has set a priority of getting Black officers on the streets. Even with the recent drop, the LAPD's percentage of Black officers matches the demographics of the city it polices, but McCraney, who is Black, noted that when officers are spread out across a large area, Black citizens may still not see officers who look like them.\n\n\"It's bigger than just being equal,\" he said. Moore \"is looking to address some of the past ills that have occurred in the perception of the relationship between the African American community and the LAPD. The chief has made a big move to maybe overrepresent in areas such as African Americans to help to improve relationships and connections in the city.\"\n\nRetirements are a normal challenge for police departments. The problem is that departments are also struggling to recruit young Black officers. Philadelphia officials said in July that Black recruits accounted for 31 percent of the latest class, lower than the proportion of Black people in the department (34 percent, including nonuniformed staff) and Black residents in the city population (44 percent). Current NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea said at a press conference in May that recruiting Black officers was one of his top priorities, and acknowledged that the combination of COVID-19 and Floyd's murder had made the task more difficult.\n\nPart of the recruiting problem is a long-standing one: Recruiting and training processes have historically drawn in fewer Black applicants and bounced a disproportionate number out. A Chicago inspector general's report this summer found that the Chicago Police Department \"has a disproportionately high attrition rate for Black candidates, especially Black female applicants, which contributes to the low number of Black officers hired.\" Black candidates are 37 percent of the applicant pool in Chicago, but just 18 percent of those invited to attend the police academy. In May, Shea celebrated a steep increase in the number of Black applicants to take the NYPD test, but historically only one in nine applicants who passes the test is hired as a cop.\n\n\"We have a real big problem with recruiting. We've got to do a better job of marketing policing,\" Thomas said. \"In the minority community, it's real hard right now because you don't have a lot of trust from the community.\"\n\nMoreover, Tracie Keesee, the senior vice president of justice initiatives at the Center for Policing Equity and a former NYPD deputy commissioner for equity and inclusion, warns that departments need to examine their culture , not just their demographic statistics, to move forward.\n\n\"This is an old thing that is experienced by a lot of folks of color,\" she told me. \" Why do you want me so badly? Is it so you can say you have the numbers, or is it for you to put me somewhere so I can reflect the community at the moment, to buy you some time? What is the experience going to be for me? \"\n\nThose questions are especially pointed right now, not only because of skepticism about the police but also because of rising concerns about the growth of white-supremacist and far-right sentiments within departments. The FBI has warned for years that extremist groups have worked to infiltrate law enforcement, and in a 2019 article , the Georgetown law professor Vida Johnson found nearly 200 instances of police officers using racist slurs, belonging to white-supremacist groups, and other troubling cases of bigotry, a number she believes is an undercount. On September 30, New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio announced an investigation after records showed several NYPD officers on the rolls of the Oath Keepers, a group under scrutiny for its role in the January 6 insurrection.\n\nDavid A. Graham: George Floyd's murder changed Americans' views on policing\n\n\"The failure of federal, state, and local law enforcement agencies to aggressively respond to evidence of explicit racism among police officers undermines public confidence in fair and impartial law enforcement,\" Michael German, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice and a former FBI special agent, wrote in 2020 .\n\nRacist sentiments among some police officers are not new, of course. When Williams was hired to lead the LAPD, the department was grappling with widespread internal bigotry , and Williams's predecessor Daryl Gates had refused to condemn racism among cops. The boom in Black-officer hiring that followed in Los Angeles and elsewhere shows that forces can improve their demographic diversity. If they don't do so now, and departments become more white and racism more entrenched, reversing course later will be harder, leaving Black communities policed by forces that include white racists-a magnified version of the untenable circumstances that led to the current moment.\n\nMorgan Ome contributed reporting."

      "text": "The Long History of Black Officers Reforming Policing From Within\n\nBlack Lives Matter and Donald Trump's agenda are inspiring some police to more vocal advocacy. But their project-ending racial bias in the profession-is a decades-old one.\n\nWhen it comes to law enforcement in America, there are two culture wars under way.\n\nOne has been championed at the federal level by the Trump administration: an effort to rigorously defend police and shift public policy away from punishing officer misconduct. But the second, less visible-and, in some ways, opposite-war has been ongoing at the local level for over a half-century, with African American officers working to mitigate racial bias and abuse of power from within the profession.\n\nPresident Trump and other tough-on-crime advocates argue they are \"backing the blue.\" This obscures the fact that many law-enforcement leaders openly share activists' concerns. Although not all black officers back criminal-justice reform, and many who do are not black, African Americans have a long history of advocating for change in their own departments. Despite the current cultural and governmental challenges facing policing reform, some of the biggest obstacles are not particular to the Trump era, leaders told me. Rather, they are much older conflicts that aren't easily influenced by federal politics.\n\nAfter decades of being ineligible for top positions, some black law-enforcement leaders today try to shape how officers think about racism and inequality. The history of black Americans' integration into law enforcement shows how this internal resistance has developed over time. Historian W. Marvin Dulaney details this progression in cities across the country in his book Black Police in America. During slavery and Reconstruction, a few cities and states in the South hired black officers to fill undesirable positions or increase departments' size, but their brief tenures often ended in backlash from white citizens. (During slavery, the officers were freedmen.) In the North and Midwest, newly elected mayors appointed some of the first African American police as a reward for black votes in the late 1800s and early 1900s. States in the Deep South that had previously outlawed black police officers during Reconstruction didn't hire them again until the 1930s or 1940s, after protests from African American communities.\n\nAcross the country, more black officers joined during the Jim Crow era, and they were commonly assigned to patrol only black neighborhoods. \"They were often denied promotions and transfers to other divisions. In some cases they were not allowed to wear their uniform to or from work for fear of some altercation that could occur with a white citizen,\" said Alan Thompson, a University of Southern Mississippi criminal-justice professor.\n\nTheir treatment of minorities was shaped by social norms and growing up in segregated communities; through the early 1900s, black officers were often aggressive toward minorities. But by the 1930s and 1940s, there were new cohorts of black police who actively adopted a more respectful posture toward people of color and began building ties to black community organizations like the NAACP. Some of them were energized by the community outcry that led to their hiring, others by their growing numbers.\n\nDespite pushback from white leadership, local black police unions began popping up in cities across the country, and their members sometimes criticized policies that harmed minorities. Thompson said that in the social upheaval of the 1960s-as departments had to \"back away from explicit practices\" segregating police-some started relying on black officers to deescalate tensions between police and black communities, and to improve their own reputations. As the first black mayors of major cities were elected in the late 1960s and early 1970s, some of them appointed their cities' first black police chiefs.\n\nStill, their ascendancy didn't always translate to more progressive departments: Black chiefs who avoided battles over minority representation in their hiring practices, for example, were celebrated by white colleagues for having an evenhanded approach. Some of the first black officers integrated into majority-white precincts found that openly calling out racial bias could threaten their careers. Donald Jackson, a sergeant within the Los Angeles Police Department, told The New York Times in 1988 that a \"fellow officer, who was white, [told] me that if he calls blacks 'niggers,' it shouldn't offend me because I'm blue, not black.\" Jackson said that when he spoke out against such slurs, he was ostracized within his department.\n\nFormer New York homicide detective, Bernard Edwards, started his career in 1956 as one of four black officers patrolling Manhattan's Chelsea neighborhood. He told me the work was \"sometimes ... very frustrating\":\n\nBlack people never fully understood black cops were looking out for them because we didn't advertise it. You had to be impartial. I wouldn't say, \"I don't like the way you treated that black guy.\" I would say \"I don't like the way you treated Harry Brown.\" But cops are smart and they'll put two and two together. ... Everybody who comes into the department wants to advance. Before you go anywhere, someone's going to ask your sergeant, \"What kind of guy is that?\"\n\nNow, black police leaders can be more forthcoming on race in policing, though African Americans are still a distinct minority in the field, representing just 9 percent of officers in 1987 and 12 percent in 2013. Some I spoke with told me they've felt more motivated to advocate for reform since the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement and since Trump's inauguration.\n\n\"I think we can't make changes if we're not part of the system,\" said Jefferson County Sheriff Zena Stephens, the first African American female sheriff elected in Texas. \"If I have a skillset that can prevent this misunderstanding or this trainwreck that seems to be happening in society, then I think I have a responsibility to do so.\"\n\nOfficers are still targeted for being black. Last year, as Stephens was standing outside her campaign headquarters, a man drove by and shot into its glass front door. Almost 20 years before, Orange County Sheriff Jerry Demings, the president of the Florida Sheriffs Association, was sent threatening letters when he became the first African American chief in Orlando in 1998. His \"white colleagues have different priorities as leaders,\" he told me, \"but some of us can't shift away\" from the way some minorities feel about police.\n\nAt the Congressional Black Caucus Foundation's annual conference in September, a panel of black sheriffs and police chiefs was asked who they identify with more after incidents where a police officer has shot a black person. Patrisse Andrews, the chief in Morrisville, North Carolina, described her thought process:\n\n\"Every time I see any shooting, I'm a mother first. ... Second, I identify as being a black woman, daughter of a civil-rights pioneer. I physically weep before I go to work. And then as I drive to work, I say, \"Pull yourself together, because you're chief. You can't be walking in there teary-eyed.\" And then I may break down when I get there and my officers see me weep. And I'm okay with that because they see that I'm human. ... The way I get through it is, I own it. I'm a mom and a proud black woman, and I'll never trade any of those things for law enforcement. Never, ever.\"\n\nIn some cases, colleagues' racial biases motivated officials to pursue leadership positions. Mitchell Davis, the police chief in Hazel Crest Village outside of Chicago, gave me an example from early in his career. During his initial training, when a higher-ranking officer shadowed him on a night shift, Davis stopped a white drunk driver and was instructed to call the offender's relative to pick him up. He later stopped a black drunk driver and was instructed to tow his car and arrest him. \"Now, I was in training, so I couldn't not do it. But it was a gesture saying, 'I'm going to show you how we treat these people,'\" Davis said. \"I've seen instance after instance where these things happen.\"\n\nAs part of reforming their organizations' culture, some officials have tried to de-stigmatize the Black Lives Matter movement. At the CBC panel, Andrews said she's sympathetic to the activist group, in part, because her daughter identifies with it. \"When I posted [a photo] on Facebook about being proud of my daughter, I didn't even realize she was wearing a Black Lives Matter shirt and I was wearing a police shirt,\" Andrews said. She tells her colleagues to avoid belittling the movement as a passing phase and encourages them to \"take a seat at the table.\"\n\nMultiple officials I spoke with share some of the same grievances as Black Lives Matter. For example, they unanimously disapprove of police unions protecting officers who are fired for misconduct. Indeed, \"we've all been sued [by police unions],\" Davis said, referring to cases where he's been challenged for firing employees he alleged behaved unfairly toward minorities.\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police, the largest police union in the United States, promotes a defend-at-all-costs culture, some suggested. \"When something controversial goes on with the police in Chicago, the media interviews the union president-who's not even part of the administration of the police department,\" Davis lamented. In recent years, the FOP has offended some of its black members by investing in the defense fund for Darren Wilson, the Ferguson, Missouri, officer who shot Michael Brown in 2014; hiring Jason Van Dyke, the Chicago officer who was fired for shooting Laquan Mcdonald 16 times in 2014; and endorsing Trump's candidacy.\n\nPolice unions' opposition to reform well predates Trump ; as a New Yorker writer noted last year, \"most of them were formed as a reaction against public demands in the 1960s and 1970s for more civilian oversight of the police.\" In that sense, the administration doesn't change what has never given way. During the Obama administration, the FOP butted heads with members of the Presidential Task Force on 21st Century Policing and publicly opposed measures like Barack Obama's executive order curtailing police access to military weapons. In August, the FOP cheered as Attorney General Sessions announced Trump would nullify the directive.\n\nAnd policing at the local level is not as tied to the federal government's agenda as a layperson might think. The officials suggested the law-and-order Trump era has put a strain on their personal relationships with white colleagues, but insist it doesn't affect their leadership strategies. For example, the president making it easier for police to acquire military-grade weapons doesn't mean each chief or sheriff will choose to do so.\n\nPolice leaders have varying degrees of autonomy, but none are directly beholden to the White House or the Justice Department. It's local officials that matter most. \"The Orlando Police Department was a community-policing agency before I became chief, and my goal was to take it to the next level,\" Demings said. \"Having the mayor and city council support me in my endeavors was monumental because all of these things have a price tag.\" Trump's \"policies haven't caused any problems for me yet,\" Stephens said. \" The people who work for me know my mindset and my expectations.\"\n\nWhile African Americans in law enforcement have gained a considerable amount of traction in the short time they've had access to the profession's higher ranks, they still bump up against their colleagues' discriminatory practices and points of view. That's just the essence of the \"chess game\" black officers play as they try to influence how policing is done, as Demings put it at the CBC panel. And that'll continue into the next administration, too. \"Day to day, [black law-enforcement leaders] are putting out fires. But those with a long-term vision are trying to do what others did for them, which is bring along the next generation,\" Thompson said. \"They're slowly chipping away at the stone.\"\n\nThis article is part of our project \"The Presence of Justice,\" which is supported by a grant from the John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation's Safety and Justice Challenge."

      "text": "Regular and Volunteer Officers\n\nIT is pleasant to see how much the present war has done towards effacing the traditional jealousy between regular officers and volunteers. The two classes have been so thoroughly intermingled, on staff-duties and in the field,- so many regular officers now hold in the volunteer service a rank higher than their permanent standing, - the whole previous military experience of most regulars was so trifling, compared with that which they and the volunteers have now shared in common,-and so many young men have lately been appointed to commissions, in both branches, not only without a WestPoint education, but with almost none at all,-that it really cannot be said that there is much feeling of conscious separation left. For treating the two as antagonistic the time, has clearly gone by. For judiciously weighing their respective services in the field the epoch has not come, since the reign of history begins only when that of telegrams and special correspondents has ended. It is better, therefore, to limit the comparison, as yet, to that minor routine of military duty upon which the daily existence of an army depends, and of which the great deeds of daring are merely exciting episodes.\n\nAt the beginning of the war, and before the distinction was thus partially effaced, the comparison involved very different elements. In our general military inexperience, the majority were not disposed to underrate the value of specific professional training. Education holds in this country much of the prestige held by hereditary rank in Europe, modified only by the condition that the possessor shall take no undue airs upon himself. Even then the penalty consists only in a few outbreaks of superficial jealousy, and the substantial respect for any real acquirements remains the same. So there was a time when the faintest aroma of West Point lent a charm to the most unattractive candidate for a commission. Any Governor felt a certain relief in intrusting a regiment to any man who had ever eaten clandestine oysters at Benny Haven's, or had once heard the whiz of an Indian arrow on the frontier, however mediocre might have been all his other claims to confidence. If he failed, the regular army might bear the shame ; if he succeeded, to the State-House be the glory.\n\nYet there was always another party of critics, not less intelligent, who urged the value of general preparations for any duty, as compared with special,-who held that it was always easier for a man of brains to acquire technical skill than for a person of mere technicality to superadd brains, and that the antecedents of a frontier lieutenant were, on the whole, a poorer training for large responsibilities than those of many a civilian, who had lived in the midst of men, though out of uniform. Let us have a fair statement of this position, for it was very sincere and had much temporary influence. The main thing, it was argued, was the knowledge of human nature and the habit of dealing with mankind in masses,-the very thing from which the younger regular officers at least had been rigidly excluded. From a monastic life at West Point they had usually been transferred to a yet more isolated condition, in some obscure outpost,- or if otherwise, then they had seen no service at all, and were mere clerks in shoulder-straps. But a lawyer who could manoeuvre fifty witnesses as if they were one, - a teacher used to governing young men by the hundred, - an orator trained to sway thousands, - a mastermechanic,- a railway-superintendent,- a factory - agent, - a broker who could harness Wall Street and drive it, -a financier who could rule a sovereign State with a rod of (railway) iron, - such men as these, it was plausibly reasoned, could give an average army-officer all the advantage of his special training, at the start, and yet beat him at his own trade in a year.\n\nThese theories were naturally strengthened, moreover, by occasional instances of conspicuous failure, when volunteer troops were intrusted to regular officers. These disappointments could usually be traced to very plain causes. The men selected were sometimes men whose WestPoint career would hardly bear minute investigation, - or who had in civil pursuits forgotten all they had learned at the Academy, except self-esteem, - or who had been confined to the duties of some special department, as quartermasters or paymasters, and were really fitted for nothing else,-or who had served their country by resigning their commissions, if not by holding them, - or who had contrived, first or last, to lose hopelessly their tempers or their digestions, or their faith, hope, and charity. Beyond all this lay the trouble, that the best regular officer from the very fact of his superior training was puzzled to know how much to demand of volunteer troops, or what standard to enforce upon them. It was a problem in the Differential Calculus, with the Army Regulations for a constant, and a raw volunteer regiment for a variable, and not a formula in Davies which suited the purpose. Unfortunately, these perplexities were quite as apt to end in relaxation as in rigor, so that the regiments thus commanded sometimes slid into a looseness of which a resolute volunteer officer would have been ashamed.\n\nThese were among the earlier results. Against them was to be set the fact, that, on the whole, no regiments in the field made progress so rapid, or held their own so well, as those placed under regular officers. And now that three years have abolished many surmises, and turned many others into established facts, it must be owned that the total value of the professional training has proved far greater, and that of the general preparation far less, than many intelligent observers predicted. The relation between officer and soldier is something so different in kind from anything which civil life has to offer, that it has proved almost impossible to transfer methods or maxims from the one to the other. If a regiment is merely a caucus, and the colonel the chairman,- or merely a fire-company, and the colonel the foreman,-or merely a prayer-meeting, and the colonel the moderator,-or merely a bar-room, and the colonel the landlord,-then the failure of the whole thing is a foregone conclusion. War is not the highest of human pursuits, certainly ; but an army comes very near to being the completest of human organizations, and he alone succeeds in it who readily accepts its inevitable laws, and applies them. An army is an aristocracy, on a three-years' lease, supposing that the period of enlistment. No mortal skill can make military power effective on democratic principles. A democratic people can perhaps carry on a war longer and better than any other; because no other can so well comprehend the object, raise the means, or bear the sacrifices. But these sacrifices include the surrender, for the time being, of the essential principle of the government. Personal independence in the soldier, like personal liberty in the civilian, must be waived for the preservation of the nation. With shipwreck staring men in the face, the choice lies between despotism and anarchy, trusting to the common sense of those concerned, when the danger is over, to revert to the old safeguards. It is precisely because democracy is an advanced stage in human society, that war, which belongs to a less advanced stage, is peculiarly inconsistent with its habits. Thus the undemocratic character, so often lamented in West Point and Annapolis, is in reality their strong point. Granted that they are no more appropriate to our stage of society than are revolvers and bowie-knives, that is precisely what makes them all serviceable in time of war. War being exceptional, the institutions which train its officers must be exceptional likewise.\n\nThe first essential for military authority lies in the power of command, - a power which it is useless to analyze, for it is felt instinctively, and it is seen in its results. It is hardly too much to say, that, in military service, if one has this power, all else becomes secondary; and it is perfectly safe to say that without it all other gifts are useless. Now for the exercise of power there is no preparation like power, and nowhere is this preparation to be found, in this community, except in regular army-training. Nothing but great personal qualities can give a man by nature what is easily acquired by young men of very average ability who are systematically trained to command.\n\nThe criticism habitually made upon our army by foreign observers at the beginning of the war continues still to be made, though in a rather less degree, - that the soldiers are relatively superior to the officers, so that the officers lead, perhaps, but do not command them. The reason is plain. Three years are not long enough to overcome the settled habits of twenty years. The weak point of our volunteer service invariably lies here, that the soldier, in nine cases out of ten, utterly detests being commanded, while the officer, in his turn, equally shrinks from commanding. War, to both, is an episode in life, not a profession, and therefore military subordination, which needs for its efficiency to be fixed and absolute, is, by common consent, reduced to a minimum. The white American soldier, being, doubtless, the most intelligent in the world, is more ready than any other to comply with a reasonable order, but he does it because it is reasonable, not because it is an order. With advancing experience his compliance increases, but it is still because he better and better comprehends the reason. Give him an order that looks utterly unreasonable, - and this is sometimes necessary,-or give him one which looks trifling, under which head all sanitary precautions are yet too apt to rank, and you may, perhaps, find that you still have a free and independent citizen to deal with, not a soldier. Implicit obedience must be admitted still to be a rare quality in our army; nor can we wonder at it. In many cases there is really no more difference between officers and men, in education or in breeding, than if the one class were chosen by lot from the other ; all are from the same neighborhood, all will return to the same civil pursuits side by side ; every officer knows that in a little while each soldier will again become his client or his customer, his constituent or his rival. Shall he risk offending him for life in order to carry out some hobby of stricter discipline ? If this difficulty exist in the case of commissioned officers, it is still more the case with the non-commissioned, those essential intermediate links in the chain of authority. Hence the discipline of our soldiers has been generally that of a town-meeting or of an engine-company, rather than that of an army ; and it shows the extraordinary quality of the individual men, that so much has been accomplished with such a formidable defect in the organization. Even granting that there has been a great and constant improvement, the evil is still vast enough. And every young man trained at West Point enters the service, with at least this advantage, that he has been brought up to command, and has not that task to learn.\n\nHe has this further advantage, that he is brought up with some respect for the army-organization as it is, with its existing rules, methods, and proprieties, and is not, like the newly commissioned civilian, disposed in his secret soul to set aside all its proprieties as mere \" pipeclay,\" its methods as \" old - fogyism,\" and its rules as \"red-tape.\" How many good volunteer officers will admit, if they speak candidly, that on entering the service they half believed the \" Army Regulations \" to be a mass of oldtime rubbish, which they would gladly reëdit, under contract, with immense improvements, in a month or two, and that they finally left the service with the conviction that the same book was a mine of wisdom, as yet but half explored ! Certainly, when one thinks for what a handful of an army our present military system was devised, and with what an admirable elasticity it has borne this sudden and stupendous expansion, it must be admitted to have most admirably stood the test. Of course, there has been much amendment and alteration needed, nor is the work done yet; but it has mainly touched the details, not the general principles. The system is wonderfully complete for its own ends, and the more one studies it the less one sneers. Many a form which at first seems to the volunteer officer merely cumbrous and trivial he learns to prize at last as almost essential to good discipline ; he seldom attempts a short cut without finding it the longest way, and rarely enters on that heroic measure of cutting red-tape without finding at last that he has entangled his own fingers in the process.\n\nMore thorough training tells in another way. It is hard to appreciate, without the actual experience, how much of military life is a matter of mere detail. The maiden at home fancies her lover charging at the head of his company, when in reality he is at that precise moment endeavoring to convince his company-cooks that salt-junk needs five hours' boiling, or is anxiously deciding which pair of worn-out trousers shall be ejected from a drummer-boy's knapsack. Courage is, no doubt, a good quality in a soldier, and luckily not often wanting ; but, in the long run, courage depends largely on the haversack. Men are naturally brave, and when the crisis comes, almost all men will fight well, if well commanded. As Sir Philip Sidney said, an army of stags led by a lion is more formidable than an army of lions led by a stag. Courage is cheap; the main duty of an officer is to take good care of his men, so that every one of them shall be ready, at a moment's notice, for any reasonable demand. A soldier's life usually implies weeks and months of waiting, and then one glorious hour; and if the interval of leisure has been wasted, there is nothing but a wasted heroism at the end, and perhaps not even that. The penalty for misused weeks, the reward for laborious months, may be determined within ten minutes. Without discipline an army is a mob, and the larger the worse ; without rations the men are empty uniforms ; without ammunition they might as well have no guns; without shoes they might almost as well have no legs. And it is in the practical appreciation of all these matters that the superiority of the regular officer is apt to be shown.\n\nAlmost any honest volunteer officer will admit, that, although the tactics were easily learned, yet, in dealing with all other practical details of army-life, he was obliged to gain his knowledge through many blunders. There were a thousand points on which the light of Nature, even aided by \" Army Regulations,\" did not sufficiently instruct him; and his best hints were probably obtained by frankly consulting regular officers, even if inferior in rank. The advantage of a WestPoint training is precisely that of any other professional education. There is nothing in it which any intelligent man cannot learn for himself in later life; nevertheless, the intelligent man would have fared a good deal better, had he learned it all in advance. Test it by shifting the positions. No lawyer would trust his case to a West-Point graduate, without evidence of thorough special preparation. Yet he himself enters on a career equally new to him, where his clients may be counted by thousands, and every case is capital. The army is a foreign country to civilians; of course you can learn the language after your arrival, but bow you envy your companion, who, having spoken it from childhood, can proceed at once to matters more important!\n\nYet the great advantage of the regular army does not, after all, consist merely in any superiority of knowledge, or in the trained habit of command. Granting that patience and labor can readily supply these to the volunteer, the trouble remains, that even in labor and patience the regular officer is apt to have the advantage, by reason of a stronger stimulus. The difference is not merely in the start, but in the pace. No man can be often thrown into the society of regular officers, especially among the younger ones, without noticing a higher standard of professional earnestness than that found among average volunteers; and in this respect a West-Point training makes little or no difference. The reason of the superiority is obvious. To the volunteer, the service is still an episode ; to the regular, a permanent career. No doubt, if a man is thoroughly conscientious, or thoroughly ambitious, or thoroughly enthusiastic, a temporary pursuit may prove as absorbing as if itwere taken up for life; but the majority of men, however well-meaning, are not thorough at all. How often one hears the apology made by volunteer officers, even those of high rank, - \" Military life is not my profession ; I entered the army from patriotism, willing to serve my country faithfully for three years, but of course not pretending to perfection in every trivial detail of a pursuit which I shall soon quit forever.\" But it is patriotism to think the details not trivial. If one gives one's self to one's country, let the gift be total and noble. These details are worthy to absorb the whole daily thought, and they should absorb it, until more thorough comprehension and more matured executive power leave room for larger studies, still in the line of the adopted occupation. If a man leaves his office or his study to be a soldier, let him be a soldier in earnest. Let those three years bound the horizon of his plans, and let him study his new duty as if earth offered no other conceivable career. The scholar must forswear his pen, the lawyer his books, the politician his arts. An officer of whatever rank, who does not find occupation enough for every day, amid the quietest winter-quarters, in the prescribed duties of his position and the studies to which they should lead, is fitted only for civil pursuits, and had better return to them.\n\nWithout this thoroughness, life in the army affords no solid contentment. What is called military glory is a fitful and uncertain thing. Time and the newspapers play strange tricks with reputations, and of a hundred officers whose names appear with honor in this morning's despatches ninety may never be mentioned again till it is time to write their epitaphs. Who, for instance, can recite the names of the successive cavalry-commanders who have ridden on their bold forays through Virginia, since the war began ? All must give place to the latest Kautz or Sheridan, who has eclipsed without excelling them all. Yet each is as brave and as faithful to-day, no doubt, as when he too glittered for his hour before all men's gaze, and the obscurer duty may be the more substantial honor. So when I lift my eyes to look on yonder level ocean-floor, the fitful sunshine now glimmers white on one far-off sail, now on another; and yet I know that all canvas looks snowy while those casual rays are on it, and that the best vessel is that which, sunlit or shaded, best accomplishes its destined course. The officer is almost as powerless as the soldier to choose his opportunity or his place. Military glory may depend on a thousand things, -the accident of local position, the jealousy of a rival, the whim of a superior. But the merit of having done one's whole duty to the men whose lives are in one's keeping, and to the nation whose life is staked with theirs,-of having held one's command in such a state, that, if at any given moment it was not performing the most brilliant achievement, it might have been, - this is the substantial triumph which every faithful officer has always within reach.\n\nNow will any one but a newspaper flatterer venture to say that this is the habitual standard in our volunteer service ? Take as a test the manner in which official inspections are usually regarded by a regimental commander. These occasions are to him what examinations by the School Committee are to a public-school teacher. He may either deprecate and dodge them, or he may manfully welcome them as the very best means of improvement for all under his care. Which is the more common view ? What sight more pitiable than to behold an officer begging off from inspection because he has just come in from picket, or is just going out on picket, or has just removed camp, or was a day too late with his last requisition for cartridges ? No doubt it is a trying ordeal to have some young regular-army lieutenant ride up to your tent at an hour's notice, and leisurely devote a day to probing every weak spot in your command,-to stand by while he smells at every camp-kettle, detects every delinquent gun-sling, ferrets out old shoes from behind the messbunks, spies out every tent-pole not labelled with the sergeant's name, asks to see the cash-balance of each companyfund, and perplexes your best captain on forming from two ranks into one by the left flank. Yet it is just such unpleasant processes as these which are the salvation of an army; these petty mortifications are the fulcrum by which you can lift your -whole regiment to a first-class rank, if you have only the sense to use them. So long as no inspecting officer needs twice to remind you of the same thing, you have no need to blush. But though you be the bravest of the brave, though you know a thousand things of which ho is utterly ignorant, yet so long as he can tell you one tiling which you ought to know, lie is master of the situation. He may be the most conceited little popinjay who ever strutted in uniform; no matter; it is more for your interest to learn than for his to teach. Let our volunteer officers, as a body, once resolve to act on this principle, and we shall have such an army as the world never saw. But nothing costs the nation a price so fearful, in money or in men, as the false pride which shrinks from these necessary surgical operations, or regards the surgeon as a foe.\n\nIt is not being an officer to wear uniform for three years, to draw one's pay periodically, and to acquit one's self without shame during a few hours of days of actual battle. History will never record what fine regiments have been wasted and ruined, since this war began, by the negligence in camp of commanders who were brave as Bayard in the field. Unless a man is willing to concentrate his whole soul upon learning and performing the humblest as well as the most brilliant functions of bis new profession, a true officer he will never become. More time will not help him; for time seldom does much for one who enters, especially in middle life, on an employment for which he is essentially unfitted. It is amusing to see the weight attached to the name of veteran, in military matters, by persons who in civil life are very ready to exchange a veteran doctor or minister for his younger rival. Military Seniority, though the only practicable rule of precedence, is liable to many notorious inconveniences. It is especially without meaning in the volunteer service, where the Governor of Maine may happen to date a set of commissions on the first day of January, and His Excellency of Minnesota may doom his contemporary regiment to life-long subordination by accidentally postponing theirs to the second day. But it has sufficient drawbacks even where all the appointments pass through one channel. The dignity it gives is a merely chronological distinction,-an oldest-inhabitant renown, - much like the university-degree of A. M., which simply implies that a man has got decently through college, and then survived three years. But if a man was originally placed in a position beyond his deserts, the mere lapse of time may have only made him the more dangerous charlatan. If he showed no sign of military aptitude in six months, a probation of three years may have been more costly, but not more conclusive. Add to this the fact that each successive year of the war has seen all officers more carefully selected, if only because there has been more choice of material; so that there is sometimes a temptation in actual service, were it practicable, to become Scriptural in our treatment, and put the last first and the first last. In those unfortunate early days, when it seemed to most of our Governors to make little difference whom they commissioned, since all were alike untried, and of two evils it was natural to choose that which would produce the more agreeable consequences at the next election-time,-in those days of darkness many very poor officers saw the light. Many of these have since been happily discharged or judiciously shelved. The trouble is, that those who remain are among the senior officers in our volunteer army, in their respective grades. They command posts, brigades, divisions. They preside at court - martinis. Beneath the shadow of their notorious incompetency all minor evils may lurk undetected. To crown all, they are, in many cases, sincere and wellmeaning men, utterly obtuse as to their own deficiencies, and manifesting (to employ a witticism coeval with themselves) all the Christian virtues except that of resignation.\n\nThe present writer has beheld the spectacle of an officer of high rank, previously eminent in civil life, who could only vindicate himself before a courtmartial from the ruinous charge of false muster by summoning a staff-officer to prove that it was his custom to sign all military papers without looking at them. He has seen a lieutenant tried for neglect of duty in allowing a soldier under his command, at an important picketpost, to be found by the field-officer of the day with two inches of sand in the bottom of his gun, - and pleading, in mitigation of sentence, that it had never been the practice in his regiment to make any inspection of men detailed for such duty. That such instances of negligence should be tolerated lor six months in any regiment of regulars is a thing almost inconceivable, and yet in these eases the regiments and the officers had been nearly three years in service.\n\nIt is to be remembered that even the command of a regiment of a thousand men is a first-class administrative position, and that there is no employer of men in civil life who assumes the responsibility of those under his command so absolutely and thoroughly. The life, the health, the efficiency, the finances, the families of his soldiers, are staked not so much on the courage of a regimental commander as upon his decision, his foresight, and his business-habits. As Richter's worldly old statesman tells his son, \" War trains a man to business.\" If he takes his training slowly, he must grow perfect through suffering, - commonly the suffering of other people. The varied and elaborate returns, for instance, now required of officers, - daily, monthly, quarterly, annually, - are not one too many as regards the interests of Government and of the soldiers, but are enough to daunt any but an accurate and methodical man. A single error in an ordnance requisition may send a body of troops into action with only twenty rounds of ammunition to a man. One mistake in a property-voucher may involve an officer in stoppages exceeding his yearly pay. One wrong spelling in a muster-roll may beggar a soldier's children ten years after the father has been killed in battle. Under such circumstances no standard of accuracy can be too high. And yet even the degree of regularity that now exists is due more to the constant pressure from head-quarters than to any individual zeal. For a large part of this pressure the influence of the regular army is responsible,-those officers usually occupying the more important staffpositions, and having in some departments of service, especially in the ordnance, moulded and remoulded the whole machinery until it has become almost a model. It would be difficult to name anything in civil life which is in its way so perfect as the present system of business and of papers in this department. Every ordnance blank now contains a schedule of instructions for its own use, so simple and so minute that it seems as if, henceforward, the most negligent volunteer officer could never make another error. And yet in the very last set of returns which the writer had occasion to revise, - returns made by a very meritorious captain,- there were eight different papers, and a mistake in every one.\n\nThe glaring defect of most of our volunteer regiments, from the beginning to this day, has lain in slovenliness and remissness as to every department of military duty, except the actual fighting and dying. When it comes to that ultimate test, our men usually endure it so magnificently that one is tempted to overlook all deficiencies on intermediate points. But they must not be overlooked, because they create a fearful discount on the usefulness of our troops, when tried by the standard of regular armies. I do not now refer to the niceties of dress-parade or the courtesies of salutation : it has long since been tacitly admitted that a white American soldier will not present arms to any number of rows of buttons, if he can by any ingenuity evade it; and to shoulder arms on passing an officer is something to which only Ethiopia or the regular army can attain. Grant, if you please, (though I do not grant,) that these are merely points of foolish punctilio. But there are many things which are more than punctilio, though they may be less than fighting. The efficiency of a body of troops depends, after all, not so much on its bravery as on the condition of its sicklist. A regiment which does picketduty faithfully will often avoid the need of duties more terrible. Yet I have ridden by night along a chain of ten sentinels, every one of whom should have taken my life rather than permit me to give the countersign without dismounting, and have been required to dismount by only four, while two did not ask me for the countersign at all, and two others were asleep. I have ridden through a regimental camp whose utterly filthy condition seemed enough to send malaria through a whole military department, and have been asked by the colonel, almost with tears in his eyes, to explain to him why his men were dying at the rate of one a day. The latter was a regiment nearly a year old, and the former one of almost two years' service, and just from the old Army of the Potomac.\n\nThe fault was, of course, in the officers. The officer makes the command, as surely as, in educational matters, the teacher makes the school. There is not a regiment in the army so good that it could not be utterly spoiled in three months by a poor commander, nor so poor that it could not be altogether transformed in six by a good one. The difference in material is nothing, - white or black, German or Irish ; so potent is military machinery that an officer who knows his business can make good soldiers out of almost anything, give him but a fair chance. The difference between the present Army of the Potomac and any previous one, - the reason why we do not daily hear, as in the early campaigns, of irresistible surprises, overwhelming numbers, and masked batteries, - the reason why the present movements are a tide and not a wave,-is not that the men are veterans, but that the officers are. There is an immense amount of perfectly raw material in General Grant's force, besides the colored regiments, which in that army are all raw, but in which the Copperhead critics have such faith they would gladly select them for dangers fit for Napoleon's Old Guard. But the newest recruit soon grows steady with a steady corporal at his elbow, a well-trained sergeant behind him, and a captain or a colonel whose voice means something to give commands.\n\nThis reference to the colored troops suggests the false impression, still held by many, that special opposition to this important military organization has been made by regular officers. There is no justice in this. While it is very probable that regular officers, as a class, may have had stronger prejudices on this point than others have held, yet it is to be remembered that the chief obstacles have not come from them, nor from military men of any kind, but from civilians at home. Nothing has been more remarkable than the facility with which the expected aversion of the army everywhere vanished before the admirable behavior of the colored troops, and the substantial value of the reinforcements they brought. When it comes to the simple question whether a soldier shall go on duty every night or every other night, he is not critical as to beauty of complexion in the soldier who relieves him.\n\nSome regular officers may have been virulently opposed to the employment of negroes as soldiers, though the few instances which I have known have been far more than compensated by repeated acts of the most substantial kindness from many others. But I never have met one who did not express contempt for the fraud thus far practised by Government on a portion of these troops, by refusing to pay them the wages which the Secretary of War had guarantied. This is a wrong which, but for good discipline, would have long since converted our older colored regiments into a mob of mutineers, and which, while dishonestly saving the Government a few thousand dollars, has virtually sacrificed hundreds of thousands in its discouraging effect upon enlistments, at a time when the fate of the nation may depend upon a few regiments more or less. It is in vain for national conventions to make capital by denouncing massacres like that of Fort Pillow, and yet ignore this more deliberate injustice for which some of their own members are in part responsible. The colored soldiers will take their own risk of capture and maltreatment very readily, (since they must take it on themselves at any rate,) if the Government will let its justice begin at home, and pay them their honest earnings. It is of little consequence to a dying man whether any one else is to die by retaliation, but it is of momentous consequence whether his wife and family are to be cheated of half his scanty earnings by the nation for which he dies. The Rebels may be induced to concede the negro the rights of war, when we grant him the ordinary rights of peace, namely, to be paid the price agreed upon. Jefferson Davis and the London \" Times \"-one-half whose stockin-trade is \"the inveterate meanness of the Yankee will hardly be converted to sound morals by the rebukes of an administration which allows its Secretary of War to promise a black soldier thirteen dollars a month, pay him seven, and shoot him if he grumbles. From this crowning injustice the regular army, and, indeed, the whole army, is clear ; to civilians alone belongs this carnival of fraud.\n\nIf, in some instances, terrible injustice has been done to the black soldiers in their military treatment also, it has not been only, or chiefly, under regular officers. Against the cruel fatigue-duty imposed upon them last summer, in the Department of the South, for instance, must be set the more disastrous mismanagements of the Department of the Gulf, - the only place from which we now hear the old stories of disease and desertion,- all dating back to the astonishing blunder of organizing the colored regiments of half-size at the outset, with a full complement of officers. This measure, however agreeable it might have been to the horde of aspirants for commissions, was in itself calculated to destroy all self-respect in the soldiers, being based on the utterly baseless assumption that they required twice as many officers as whites, and was foredoomed to failure, because no esprit de corps can be created in a regiment which is from the first insignificant in respect to size. It is scarcely conceivable that any regular officer should have honestly fallen into such an error as this; and it is very certain that the wisest suggestions and the most efficient action have proceeded, since the beginning, from them. It will be sufficient to mention the names of Major-General Hunter, Brigadier-General Phelps, and Adjutant-General Thomas; and one there is whose crowning merits deserve a tribute distinct even from these.\n\nWhen some future Bancroft or Motley writes with philosophic brain and poet's hand the story of the Great Civil War, he will find the transition to a new era in our nation's history to have been fitly marked by one festal day, - that of the announcement of the President's Proclamation, upon Port-Royal Island, on the first of January, 1863. That New-Year's time was our second contribution to the great series of historic days, beads upon the rosary of the human race, permanent festivals of freedom. Its celebration was one beside whose simple pageant the superb festivals of other lands might seem but glittering counterfeits. Beneath a majestic grove of the great live - oaks which glorify the South-Carolina soil a liberated people met to celebrate their own peaceful emancipation. They came thronging, by land and water, from plantations which their own self-imposed and exemplary industry was beginning already to redeem. The military escort which surrounded them had been organized out of their own numbers, and had furnished to the nation the first proof of the capacity of their race to bear arms. The key-note of the meeting was given by spontaneous voices, whose unexpected anthem took the day from the management of well-meaning patrons, and swept all away into the great currents of simple feeling. It was a scene never to be forgotten : the moss-hung trees, with their hundred - feet diameter of shade ; the eager faces of women and children in the foreground ; the many-colored headdresses ; the upraised hands; the neat uniforms of the soldiers; the outer row of mounted officers and ladies ; and beyond all the blue river, with its swift, free tide. And at the centre of all this great and joyous circle stood modestly the man on whose personal integrity and energy, more than on any President or Cabinet, the hopes of all that multitude appeared to rest,-who commanded then among his subjects, and still commands, an allegiance more absolute than any European potentate can claim, - whose name will be forever illustrious as having first made a practical reality out of that Proclamation which then was to the President only an autograph, and to the Cabinet only a dream, - who, when the whole fate of the slaves and of the Government hung trembling in the balance, decided it forever by throwing into the scale the weight of one resolute man, - who personally mustered in the first black regiment, and personally governed the first community where emancipation was a success, - who taught the relieved nation, in fine, that there was strength and safety in those dusky millions who till then had been an incubus and a terror, - BrigadierGeneral Rufus Saxton, Military Governor of South Carolina. The single career of this one man more than atones for all the traitors whom West Point ever nurtured, and awards the highest place on the roll of our practical statesmanship to the regular army."

The jury found Indianapolis police officers Adam Ahmad and Steven Sanchez not guilty on all counts of involuntary manslaughter, reckless homicide and battery. In April 2022, Whitfield's parents called 911 to ask for help as their son experienced a mental health crisis in their home. The officers found Whitfield without clothes on and bleeding from the mouth. Instead of helping him, they attacked the 39-year-old with a stun gun and then restrained him. Whitfield's death was later ruled a homicide."

      "text": "DC Police Officers Convicted In Black Man's Death Rehired After Trump Pardon\n\nBreaking News Reporter, HuffPost\n\nTwo Washington, D.C., officers who were convicted in the 2020 death of 20-year-old Karon Hylton-Brown have been reinstated to the city's police force after being pardoned by President Donald Trump .\n\nThe reinstatements of Metropolitan Police Officer Terence Sutton and Lt. Andrew Zabavsky were confirmed by a police spokesperson to HuffPost on Tuesday. The spokesperson declined further comment, reasoning that it's a personnel matter.\n\nBoth officers were charged with improperly chasing Hylton-Brown in a police vehicle and then conspiring to cover up their actions and the severity of his resulting, fatal injuries. They were pardoned by Trump just days after he took office in January.\n\nBoth will need to go through extensive retraining before their assignments are determined, a police source told CNN .\n\nHylton-Brown was riding a moped on a sidewalk without a helmet when he was chased by the two men. Such offenses are considered traffic infractions and are not to be pursued by police , according to the department's official policy.\n\nHylton-Brown crashed his scooter into a car while coming out of an alley ahead of the officers' vehicle on Oct. 23, 2020. He died two days later from his injuries.\n\nSutton, who was behind the wheel, was convicted of second-degree murder, conspiracy to obstruct and obstruction of justice in the crash. He was sentenced to 66 months in prison last September.\n\nZabavsky, who was supervising Sutton at the time of the crash, was convicted of conspiracy to obstruct and obstruction of justice and was also sentenced in September to 48 months in prison. Both men have been out on bail while appealing their convictions.\n\nProsecutors said the officers drove at unreasonable speeds and at one point drove in the wrong direction down a one-way street during their pursuit of Hylton-Brown, who was unarmed. After the crash, the officers turned off their body-worn cameras, allowed the driver that struck Hylton-Brown to leave the scene, and discussed how to cover up what had happened as Hylton-Brown lay dying of his injuries in the road.\n\nNeither officer notified the city's major crash unit and they submitted a false account of what happened, with Zabavsky falsely suggesting that Hylton-Brown was driving the moped while intoxicated, the Justice Department said .\n\nSutton's attorney Kellen Dwyer, in a statement praising Trump's pardon back in January, had argued that the conviction would have been reversed in the D.C. Circuit because Sutton was acting on a tip that Hylton-Brown was involved in a gang-related altercation. This detail, he said, was kept from the jury.\n\nThe D.C. Police Union, reacting to news of their pardons in January, called their convictions \"glaring miscarriages of justice.\"\n\n\"These officers - men of integrity and dedication - were targeted by corrupt prosecutors who weaponized the legal system against them,\" the union said.\n\nHylton-Brown's mother, Karen Hylton, had begged Trump in a letter not to pardon both men upon hearing of his consideration.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "'Uber With Guns' App Contracts With Police Officers Accused Of Misconduct\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nHad slain UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson hired an armed guard through Protector - a new private security app billed as \"Uber with guns\" ― he might still be alive, the company posited in a video reenactment of the killing.\n\nIn that reenactment, the \"Protector,\" identified by HuffPost as Los Angeles Police Department officer James Zourek, describes how he looks for \"pre-incident indicators\" to detect threats. These, according to Zourek, include \"inappropriate clothing for the environment or weather conditions, unusual gait or lack of arm-swinging, indicating they're concealing a weapon, and frequent checking of pockets or waistband.\"\n\nThe video shows Zourek shooting the suspect as he approaches Thompson, \"eliminating the threat,\" as Zourek puts it.\n\nProtector promises to \"empower individuals\" with \"access to elite protection.\" It delivers military expertise \"from the frontlines to your front door,\" according to its promotional materials.\n\nBut what happens if a Protector gets it wrong? What if the sweatshirt-clad man swinging his arms insufficiently as he walks toward the customer isn't a threat, but a loved one who runs cold and has stiff joints? Tucked into the fine print of Protector's terms of use agreement is language waiving the company of any responsibility if, for example, your armed guard accidentally shoots your dad.\n\nProtector, the company claims, is \"act[s] solely as a technology platform facilitating connections between users and independent security professionals\" and \"cannot guarantee specific security outcomes or the performance of any individual agent.\" The armed guards available through Protector \"operate as third-party providers, and we do not control, direct, or assume liability for their actions,\" the Terms of Use agreement states.\n\nThe app was launched in February by former Facebook product designer Nick Sarath. It allows users to select the number of cars in their \"motorcade\" and the number of so-called Protectors, who can be outfitted in Business Formal (a jacket and a tie), Business Casual (no tie), Tactical Casual (performance polo shirt and cargo pants), and Operator (SWAT cosplay), although the latter is currently unavailable.\n\nBookings start at $100 per hour with a five-hour minimum and require a $129 annual membership, according to the company. (When HuffPost opened the app to make a reservation with one car and a single Protector, the cost was $1,500.)\n\nAfter Protector initially launched in Los Angeles and New York City, HuffPost asked regulators in both places whether the company had obtained permits to operate as a rideshare or black car business. The California Public Utilities Commission confirmed that Protector did not have a Transportation Network Company permit and that the agency was investigating whether one was required. Protector is also not licensed as a Private Patrol Operator, California's Department of Consumer Affairs told HuffPost. By Thursday, Protector's services were pulled from Los Angeles. Nikolaj Leszczynski, an account manager at the PR firm hired by Protector, confirmed on Friday that \"L.A. is down\" but did not respond to multiple questions about the reason.\n\nNew York City's Tax & Limousine Commission told HuffPost that Protector was a private security company and, therefore, not part of the agency's regulatory jurisdiction.\n\nLast year, a similar armed rideshare service called BlackWolf quietly suspended operations in Phoenix and Scottsdale after Axios reported that it failed to acquire the Arizona state permit required for rideshare companies.\n\nEvery Protector is a current or former member of the military or law enforcement, according to the company. The company's LinkedIn features flashy videos with close-up interviews of Protectors listing their military and law enforcement credentials, with photos of them heavily armed in warzones scattered throughout.\n\n\"This app is an attempt to gamify warfare,\" Mohammad Tajsar, a senior staff attorney at the ACLU of Southern California, said in an interview. \"It's the perfect Silicon Valley gimmick. Take a fake problem - rising crime - offer a fake solution that you only find in video games, dress up your own squad of goons and roll it out to a crowd of internet-brained pseudo wealthy people who want this kind of dystopian future.\"\n\nWhen I first reached out to the company in February, Leszczynski initially indicated a willingness to schedule an interview with Sarath, the company's founder, and a ridealong so I could get \"the Protector experience.\" But Leszczynski later backtracked and said that Sarath \"and his Protectors are extremely swamped\" and could only respond to questions over email.\n\nThe company then declined to respond to a detailed list of questions about its policies, vetting and training practices, and the past conduct of its contractors. Instead, the company said in an emailed statement, \"We are simply offering a new innovative option in the traditional personal security space - immediate access to the protection you want without the usual red tape, hassle, and confusion.\"\n\nAlthough the app refers to the drivers by their first names, HuffPost identified at least four Protectors who, as of March 7, were also working as Los Angeles Police Department officers, according to the agency: Zourek, Royce Burroughs, Nicholas Cho and Andrew Rea, none of whom responded to requests for comment. (SWNS reported that Zourek retired in January; neither Zourek nor Protectors answered an email seeking clarification.)\n\nLAPD's employee manual allows officers to hold secondary employment after the department reviews the proposed job and determines it is not \"incompatible\" with LAPD employment. The manual states that LAPD officers cannot take on secondary jobs that involve using the \"badge, uniform, prestige or influence\" of their position for private gain or advantage. LAPD did not respond to an email asking if officers advertising their status as LAPD officers to promote their private security work violated the department's policies.\n\nLAPD declined to disclose whether Zourek, Cho, Rea or Burroughs have disciplinary records with the department, so HuffPost filed public records requests under California's Right To Know Act . Although that records request is still pending, publicly available court records, as well as one of the Protectors' public statements, provide some information about the conduct of the police officers hired by Protector.\n\nZourek, who is prominently featured in Protectors' promotional materials, has been with LAPD since 1997. A self-described \"knuckle dragger,\" Zourek has also worked as a Marine Corps Scout Sniper in Iraq, a federal prison guard and a firearms instructor. In December 2023, while head of LAPD's union, Zourek gave an hour-long interview on a podcast called \"The IA Guy\" about his treatment by the police department's internal affairs division, which investigates allegations of misconduct.\n\n\"One hundred percent of the job\" of an internal affairs investigator should be protecting cops, Zourek said, stating that it's a \"detriment\" to the police department for an officer to \"feel like you've been run through the ringer.\"\n\nEarly on in his career, Zourek was given a 22-day suspension \"for unnecessarily extending a lawful detention,\" he said on the podcast. One of the lessons he learned from that incident was the importance of being honest during the internal investigation - up to a point. \"Look, if you got a body buried in the backyard, roll the dice, don't tell them about it,\" he said.\n\nIn 2004, Zourek put an unarmed man suspected of removing property from a stolen vehicle in a carotid restraint, or a chokehold, causing the suspect to lose consciousness, court records show.\n\n\"The LAPD ridiculously, they consider a carotid restraint, or a chokehold, they consider it a lethal use of force,\" Zourek said on the podcast, relaying the incident. \"If that's true, then every night in jiu jitsu, I'm committing attempted homicide.\"\n\nLAPD suspended the use of carotid restraints in 2020 after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis. California lawmakers banned the practice later that year.\n\nZourek took the case to LAPD's disciplinary appeal board, which found him guilty and recommended a five-day suspension. Zourek filed a writ of mandate in Los Angeles County Superior Court, arguing that his conduct was reasonable based on the information he had at the time, and that his punishment was inconsistent with LAPD's past practice. In 2007, a judge granted Zourek's petition and directed LAPD to rescind the suspension and reimburse Zourek for lost wages, with interest.\n\nZourek has \"zero lessons learned\" from that incident, he said on the podcast. \"I will do it every day, all day, I don't care about the five-day suspension,\" he said of the chokehold. \"I'll do it tonight if I go out there. Because I'm 100% in the right.\"\n\nAfter the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, Zourek wrote in a group text, \"I haven't seen the democrats this mad since we freed their slaves,\" LAPD watchdog William Gude reported on X. Zourek was initially suspended for the text, but was later cleared of wrongdoing by the disciplinary board.\n\nHuffPost asked Protector if the company has a use of force policy, offers deescalation training to its Protectors, has a mechanism to review allegations of unnecessary force and if it reviews LAPD disciplinary records before hiring officers. In response, Protector said that with \"rigorous vetting and extensive training,\" their team members follow all laws. \"They adhere to the highest standards of professionalism, safety, and integrity, with extensive expertise in de-escalation tactics to ensure peace of mind for all.\"\n\nAnother LAPD officer who works with Protector, Royce Burroughs, is currently a named defendant in a civil suit brought by a woman who alleges that he was part of a team of LAPD officers who, while responding to a hostage situation, blew up a door and wall of her apartment while she was inside, stormed through the hole in her wall, and pointed guns at her while she frantically tried to keep her kittens from running away. The woman went on to suffer from symptoms of traumatic brain injury, as well as anxiety, depression, back pain and a sensitivity to loud noises, she said in the complaint.\n\nBefore Protector launched, Burroughs and fellow LAPD officer/Protector Nicholas Cho operated their own private security company called Delta Special Operations Corp , where they advertised being active members of LAPD's SWAT Team, offering private services starting at $150 per hour.\n\nA name search of Cho and Rea in LA's Superior Court database did not produce any court cases with allegations of misconduct.\n\nIt's not clear who Protector is intended for. Ultra-wealthy people with an ongoing use for private security will simply hire their own security detail. The service is too expensive for most people and it's hard to imagine many scenarios in which someone would have a one-time use for private security that doesn't involve committing a crime.\n\nThe company's terms of use prohibit specific behavior, including hate speech, harassment, stalking, defamation and child sexual exploitation, but does not include a blanket ban on unlawful activity, like buying drugs. It's also not clear how the company would prevent its services from being used to carry out the activity it purports to ban. What's to stop an abusive man from hiring a Protector to lurk around his ex-girlfriend? Asked how it would prevent such use of its services, Protector said, \"Protecting lives is a grave responsibility, and it's one we take very seriously. Any attempt to exploit our services in any way will result in immediate suspension and account termination.\"\n\nProtector plans to soon launch a companion app called Patrol, which would allow residents of neighborhoods in Los Angeles to crowdfund professional neighborhood security patrol. Like Protector, Patrol provides private citizens with the ability to hire current law enforcement officials for their personal security whims.\n\nThe presence of apps like Protector and Patrol \"create the fear the apps claim to respond to,\" Tajsar, the ACLU lawyer, said. \"If the apps exist, it creates the sense that there must be crime, and we must need private security,\" he said, noting that crime levels are, in fact, declining .\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Officers Were Caught On Video Punching A Deaf Black Man. The Police Union Says They Were Attacked.\n\nAssociate reporter\n\nAfter widespread outrage over videos showing two police officers beating a deaf Black man, the police union responded again that the officers were defending themselves ― and claimed media coverage of the incident amounted to a \"smear campaign.\"\n\nTyron McAlpin, a 34-year-old who also has cerebral palsy, was punched and shocked with a Taser by two Phoenix Police Department officers on Aug. 19 as they tried to stop him in connection with a reported assault. But McAlpin had nothing to do with any assault, his attorney told HuffPost, adding that witnesses described the white man who accused him as behaving bizarrely. Then this week, the release of surveillance and body camera footage brought new scrutiny of the officers' actions, and the Maricopa County Attorney announced that all charges against McAlpin would be dismissed based on what the videos showed.\n\nHe had spent 24 days in jail.\n\nDespite the prosecutor's decision, the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association, the union that represents about 2,200 officers, continues to defend the actions of officers Benjamin Harris and Kyle Sue.\n\n\"It is unfortunate that a narrative was created accusing these officers of targeting Mr. McAlpin due to his race and disabilities,\" the police union said in a statement to the broadcasting group Arizona's Family . \"This is completely false and an inaccurate portrayal of what occurred in real time as the officers encountered Mr. McAlpin.\"\n\nThe beating of McAlpin comes just months after the Department of Justice found \"overwhelming statistical evidence\" that Phoenix police discriminate against Black, Hispanic and Native American people and use excessive force. In a letter, Phoenix city officials denied they need federal oversight but said they are committed to ongoing efforts to reform the police department.\n\nOn Aug. 19, McAlpin had walked to a Circle K convenience store to pick up a drink for his partner while she worked from their nearby home and looked after their infant son, McAlpin's attorney, Jesse Showalter, told HuffPost.\n\nA white man walked into the Circle K saying that he had been in a fight and demanded that employees call police, Showalter said. Multiple store employees told an investigator working for the law firm that the man in the store was \"behaving bizarrely,\" Showalter said, describing him as a \"troubled person.\"\n\nAccording to Showalter, employees said the man was aggressive toward their customers, refused to leave and at one point was lying on the floor.\n\nOfficers were then called to the store, and the man told them that he had been punched in the face after trying to stop a thief from stealing a bike, according to a police report.\n\nThe accuser was wearing a gray T-shirt and shorts covered in what appeared to be \"old dark blood stains,\" according to the report. When officers asked if he could describe the person who assaulted him, the man reportedly said he was a Black man and pointed at McAlpin.\n\nSurveillance footage taken from a nearby Dollar Tree store shows McAlpin walking on the sidewalk looking at his phone as Officer Harris quickly pulls up in front of him in a police truck, blocking his path. Harris' police lights were not on at the time. McAlpin's partner later told officers they were video-chatting and using sign language when police tried to stop McAlpin.\n\n\"Hey buddy, stop where you're at,\" Harris said while still inside the truck, seconds before coming out and grabbing McAlpin with both hands, according to body camera footage reviewed by HuffPost.\n\nShowalter said it's unclear whether anybody could have heard the officer's command from inside the police truck.\n\nIn his police report, Harris wrote that McAlpin \"took a fighting stance\" and \"engaged in active aggression by swinging punches\" at Harris' head.\n\n\"He was not simply assaulting me in order to get away, but engaging in assaults to cause me harm and injury,\" Harris wrote.\n\nShowalter told HuffPost that police tactics such as those Harris used on McAlpin during the stop only escalate the situation. He added there was no way for McAlpin to respond that wouldn't have resulted in officers claiming more force was justified, describing the situation as \"a pop quiz that nobody can pass.\"\n\n\"If your hands go up, they claim that you are entering into a fighting stance. If your hands go down, they claim you're reaching for a weapon. It's a lose-lose proposition, and the claim that Tyrone went into a fighting stance is just outrageous,\" Showalter said.\n\nThe police union did not immediately respond to HuffPost's request for comment but said in the statement to Arizona's Family that \"at no time did Mr. McAlpin convey to [the officers] that he was hearing impaired or suffered from cerebral palsy. Our officers defended themselves against the attack of Mr. McAlpin.\"\n\nThe statement added that the union was appalled by the county attorney's decision to drop the charges against McAlpin.\n\nBut what officers described as a \"fighting stance\" was actually McAlpin \"gesturing in surprise,\" Showalter said, possibly pointing to his ears to indicate to the officers that he is deaf. Showalter added that McAlpin was ducking the punches being thrown at him. A review of Harris' bodycam footage shows McAlpin ducking multiple times.\n\nOfficer Sue then arrived at the scene and helped Harris force McAlpin down to the ground, the video shows. Harris can be heard telling the deaf man multiple times to put his hands behind his back as both officers take hold of him.\n\nMcAlpin does not say a word as both officers can be seen in Harris' bodycam video hitting him multiple times, including in the back of his head, before Harris pulls out his Taser and shocks McAlpin while he's on the ground. McAlpin can be heard screaming while Sue continues to punch him and Harris delivers more shocks.\n\nMcAlpin's partner arrived at the scene about three minutes after the beating began and explained to officers that McAlpin is deaf and has cerebral palsy , according to the bodycam footage . Police did not make any mention in their report of McAlpin's disabilities.\n\n\"How is he deaf if he's been on the phone,\" Harris can be heard in the video asking McAlpin's partner. She replies that they were communicating through sign language and that she had been on the phone with him since he left Circle K. She told officers that someone was bothering McAlpin at the convenience store before he left.\n\nA black cellphone, which police claimed in their report belonged to the man who'd accused McAlpin of assault, was dropped on the ground during the beating. But, according to Showalter, the phone belonged to McAlpin, which his partner told officers at the scene, pointing to the lock screen photo of their son and showing that it was logged into McAlpin's Facebook account. Still, he was charged with theft.\n\nMcAlpin was also charged with assault with intent, two counts of aggravated assault of an officer and resisting arrest.\n\nShowalter told HuffPost that as of Thursday, McAlpin had still not gotten his phone back, even though the charges had been dismissed.\n\nMcAlpin's arrest brought national attention to the necessity of training police on how to interact with people who are deaf or hearing impaired. The police union on Thursday said in its statement that officers do receive that training.\n\n\"The Phoenix Police Department provides training on how to interact with community members, victims and suspects, who are hearing impaired and/or disabled, however, we are also trained on how to defend ourselves if faced with a violent individual intent on hurting us,\" the statement said.\n\nHowever, during a preliminary hearing earlier this week, ABC affiliate KNXV-TV in Phoenix reported that both officers testified they don't recall much training on how to handle people who have hearing impairments.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Police Officers Who Defended Capitol From Trump's Mob Blast His Mass Pardon Of Rioters\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON ― Current and former police officers who defended the U.S. Capitol from President Donald Trump 's mob on Jan. 6, 2021, were outraged Monday by Trump's mass pardon of the rioters.\n\n\"Today is another dark day in American history and a continuation of the stain that January 6th left on our nation,\" former U.S. Capitol Police officer Harry Dunn said in a statement. \"I am infuriated, but not surprised in the slightest. We can't pretend to be shocked because Trump has fulfilled his longstanding promise to pardon the criminals he incited to attack me and my fellow officers.\"\n\nThe Justice Department charged more than 1,500 people with crimes for attacking the Capitol that day, including hundreds for interfering with or assaulting law enforcement. Dozens of officers suffered injuries that day; five officers died afterward, one from a stroke and four by suicide.\n\nOn Monday, in one of his first acts as president, Trump offered clemency to all involved, commuting the sentences of 14 offenders who orchestrated the storming of the Capitol and offering \"a full, complete and unconditional pardon to all other individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021,\" according to a release from the White House .\n\n\"This is a miserable miscarriage of justice and erases accountability for the criminals who have done irreparable damage to our nation,\" Former Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell said in statement. \"The scars of January 6, 2021 are seared in my mind and body, and I will never truly recover from the events of that day.\"\n\nDunn and Gonell have been outspoken critics of Trump for inciting the riot and pledging to pardon members of the mob. Dunn left the Capitol Police for an unsuccessful bid for a U.S. House seat in Maryland; Gonell said he left due to injuries sustained on Jan. 6, including to his shoulder and foot. Both have partnered with a liberal group called Courage for America to warn against Trump's embrace of political violence.\n\nCurrent D.C. police officer Daniel Hodges offered a more understated reaction to the pardons Monday evening.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Grand Jury Recommends Abolishing Police Department After Indicting 5 Officers\n\nAssociate reporter\n\nAn Alabama grand jury recommended that a local police department be \"immediately abolished' after indicting a local police chief, four officers and an officer's spouse as part of a corruption investigation, Cullman County District Attorney Champ Crocker announced Wednesday.\n\nThe grand jury alleged that the \"rampant culture of corruption\" within the Hanceville Police Department meant that it \"operated as more of a criminal enterprise than a law enforcement agency department,\" Crocker read aloud from the grand jury recommendations.\n\nThe department, which stands accused of compromising evidence in numerous cases, has \"abused public trust by its failure of oversight, lack of leadership and negligent training and hiring,\" Crocker continued.\n\nThe charges against department employees were made public months after Hanceville police dispatcher Christopher Michael Willingham, 49, was found dead in his office in August last year, according to WBMA-LD . Coroners found that he had died from an accidental overdose of drugs including fentanyl, gabapentin, diazepam, amphetamine, carisoprodol and methocarbamol.\n\nNo officers were charged in direct connection to Willingham's death, but the grand jury concluded that his death was a direct result of the department's negligence, Crocker said.\n\nWillingham had access to the unsecured police evidence room on his last day at work before his death, according to Crocker.\n\nHe added, \"I'll just say nothing was secure about the evidence room, and when Mr. Willingham was discovered, there was evidence in his office.\"\n\nThe \"anything but secure\" evidence room was one of the most concerning discoveries made during the investigation, according to Crocker. The evidence room was allegedly accessed routinely by people who were not authorized to do so, with staff using a broomstick to open the door through a hole in the room's exterior wall.\n\nHanceville Police Chief Jason Shane Marlin, 51, was charged with two counts of failure to report ethics crimes and tampering with evidence, according to Crocker. Three of his officers, Cody Alan Kelso, 33, Jason Scott Wilbanks, 37, and William Andrew Shellnutt, 39, were also charged with tampering with evidence.\n\nOfficer Eric Michael Kelso, 44, and his wife, Donna Reid Kelso, 63, were also charged with four counts of unlawful distribution of a controlled substance and two counts of conspiracy to unlawfully distribute a controlled substance.\n\nCody Kelso and Wilbanks each face additional charges of computer tampering, using an office for personal gain and solicitation to commit a controlled substance crime, according to Crocker.\n\nAll charges are felonies except tampering with physical evidence and computer tampering, which are misdemeanors.\n\nJohn C. Robbins, a lawyer for Cody Kelso, told The New York Times that he had \"not seen any evidence that supports these charges.\" It was not immediately clear if the other people charged had attorneys.\n\nCrocker also read out that the grand jury recommended \"that the Hanceville Police Department be immediately abolished,\" calling it an \"ongoing threat to public safety.\" The jury recommended that another state or local law enforcement agency be tasked with protecting the people of Hanceville.\n\nIn a statement posted on the police department's social media page, Hanceville Mayor Jim Sawyer responded to the grand jury's findings in a press release, saying the department has \"fallen short in its mission to serve the people.\"\n\n\"It is unfortunate that the actions of a few have tarnished our city's good name,\" Sawyer said. \"Those entrusted with serving and protecting our community must be individuals of integrity and honor.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear if the charged officers are still employed by the police department.\n\nSawyer noted that he had spoken with Crocker and has agreed to have the police evidence room audited by the appropriate authorities.\n\n\"While the vast majority of police officers and deputies are dedicated public servants, the misconduct of a few casts a shadow on the profession,\" said Sawyer. \"Such individuals must be held accountable without delay. We will uncover the truth, and justice will be served.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Officers Who Beat Tyre Nichols Went Against Training Protocol, Lieutenant Testifies\n\nSocial Justice Reporter\n\nMEMPHIS - Memphis Police Department Lt. Larnce Wright said Thursday that three former officers charged in the death of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, did not follow department policy when they beat him in January 2023 - testimony that contradicted the argument presented by defense attorneys earlier in the week.\n\nNichols died three days after being beaten by Memphis police officers following a traffic stop. Two of the officers involved, Emmitt Martin and Desmond Mills Jr., have already pleaded guilty to federal charges related to the incident. The trial for three others who face federal conspiracy and civil rights charges - Tadarrius Bean, Justin Smith and Demetrius Haley - began this week.\n\nIn the courtroom, prosecutor Kathryn Gilbert played body camera footage from the night of Jan. 7, 2023, which showed officers beating Nichols. She paused the video and asked Wright if the use of force displayed in the footage was consistent with Memphis police training.\n\n\"No, ma'am,\" replied Wright, who has been training Memphis police officers for seven years. \"It is not consistent with our training.\"\n\nWright listed physical techniques all Memphis police recruits are taught during their training academy, including open- and closed-hand strikes and two types of kicks - all of which Wright said officers would only be authorized to use if a civilian posed a threat.\n\nBut Nichols never posed a threat, Wright said. More than that, he noted, officers continued to strike Nichols while one of his arms was being held by officers and he was nearly defenseless, which was a violation of departmental policy.\n\nWright said the footage showed Martin kicking Nichols in the head as officers took turns beating him while placing him in handcuffs. Bean and Smith held Nichols' arms.\n\nHaley then kicked Nichols in his upper torso.\n\n\"They should have stopped him after the first kick,\" Wright told Gilbert, referring to Martin. \"They probably should have pulled him to the side.\"\n\nGilbert asked Wright if kicking is the kind of force officers are advised to use when handcuffing someone.\n\nWright responded: \"No, ma'am.\"\n\nJohn Keith Perry, an attorney representing Bean, said during opening arguments on Wednesday that the officers had worked a dangerous job in one of the most dangerous areas of the city. He argued that officers had followed their training during their interaction with Nichols.\n\nMichael Stengel, an attorney representing Haley, made a similar argument, saying that officers were trained to kick and punch in the police academy.\n\nThis argument is typical of defense attorneys in such cases, experts told HuffPost.\n\nAdante Pointer, an attorney who represented the family of Oscar Grant , a Black man who was killed by a police officer in Oakland, California, in 2009, called it \"a disingenuous argument.\"\n\n\"When it came to trial, all of those officers said, 'This is the way we are trained. This is a common defense theme that officers use.' Oscar Grant was one,\" Pointer said. \"In every one of those cases, they'll have an expert come and say that. For all of these cases, you can see the flip side of the coin.\" (Johannes Mehserle, a former Bay Area Rapid Transit officer, was convicted of involuntary manslaughter after fatally shooting Grant.)\n\nThe argument also speaks to a power dynamic between police and the people they are supposed to serve.\n\n\"They claim to follow some parts of training but ignore others,\" Pointer said. \"You are supposed to adjust the amount of force you are using based on the level of resistance. If someone is defenseless or passively resisting, that does not allow you to escalate the use of force all the way to deadly force.\"\n\nAnne Bremner, who represented a Tacoma, Washington, police officer in the case of Manuel Ellis , a Black man who was killed by police in March 2020, said it was unusual for officers to testify against each other. But it is becoming more common, especially in cases like Nichols' - where, as Bremner said, deadly use of force \"clearly wasn't warranted.\"\n\n\"I think the blue line has changed,\" she said. \"There is a change in charging officers and there is change in officers testifying.\"\n\n\"If what the [Nichols] prosecution claims is true, this is terrible, reprehensible conduct.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Jury Acquits 2 Officers Of Violating Tyre Nichols' Civil Rights But Convicts Them On Other Charges\n\nSocial Justice Reporter\n\nA federal jury acquitted two former Memphis police officers on Thursday for violating the civil rights of Tyre Nichols , a 29-year-old Black man, in January 2023 during a traffic stop just minutes away from his parents' home. They were convicted of witness tampering, and a third officer was convicted of violating Nichols' civil rights, though on a lesser charge.\n\nTadarrius Bean and Justin Smith were acquitted on the civil rights charges while Demetrius Haley was found guilty of violating his civil rights causing bodily injury ― but Haley was acquitted of violating Nichols' civil rights causing death.\n\nThe mixed verdict was delivered before federal Judge Mark Norris in the city's Odell Horton federal courthouse. Defense attorneys for Bean and Haley rested their case last week. Smith's attorney argued his case on Monday .\n\nJurors began deliberations Thursday.\n\nCivil rights attorneys Benjamin Crump and Antonio Romanucci said the jury's verdict sends a powerful message to police officers.\n\n\"Tyre's family is relieved that all three officers were found guilty and taken into custody for their loved one's death. Tyre should be alive today, and while nothing can bring them back, today's guilty verdicts bring a measure of accountability for his senseless tragic death,\" their statement said.\n\n\"We hope this moment serves as a reminder that our fight for justice for Tyre is far from over. We will continue to push for justice in the state criminal case and civil case, so that no family has to endure this heartache again. Our thoughts are with Tyre's family as they continue to navigate this painful journey.\"\n\nAll three officers' attorneys argued that Memphis police policies taught officers to use the type of force they did against Nichols on the night of Jan. 7, 2023, which included punches and kicks.\n\nProsecutors argued against that notion two weeks before the defense's argument after several witnesses who were former Memphis police officers condemned the actions of the officers that night.\n\nMemphis police Lt. Larnce Wright, who trains officers in the police academy, said officers did not follow the training they were taught. He also said Nichols never posed a threat to officers during the fatal encounter.\n\n\"It is not consistent with our training,\" Wright told prosecutors in September.\n\nEmmitt Martin and Desmond Mills, two other former officers who were involved in the beating, had pleaded guilty to civil rights violations and conspiracy charges before the trial started.\n\nMills is the only officer to plead guilty to state-level offenses. The other four officers face state murder charges in Nichols' case.\n\nNichols died in a hospital three days after the violent interaction with the five former police officers. When his parents arrived at the hospital last year, they saw his eyes swollen shut and several bruises on his face, which made them question the legitimacy of the police's account of what occurred that night.\n\n\"All three former Memphis Police Department officers were convicted of federal felonies for their role in Tyre Nichols' death,\" Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division said in a statement Thursday.\n\n\"They join two additional former officers who had already pled guilty. With these convictions, all five of the former officers involved in the death of Mr. Nichols have been convicted of federal felonies. Tyre Nichols should be alive today. We extend our condolences to the family and loved ones of Mr. Nichols. We hope this prosecution provides some measure of comfort as the law enforcement officers tied to his death have been held accountable.\"\n\nThe case sparked national outrage and protests, drawing comparisons to the violent beating of Rodney King decades ago in California.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Wandering Police Officers Big Impediment To Reform: Report\n\nST. LOUIS (AP) - Timothy Loehmann wanted to be a police officer like his father. He got a job in Independence, Ohio, but it didn't go well. His supervisors allowed him to quit after he suffered a \"dangerous lack of composure\" during firearms training. The department concluded he would \"not be able to cope or make good decisions\" under stress. The deputy chief wrote Loehmann \"could not follow simple directions, could not communicate clear thoughts nor recollections, and his handgun performance was dismal.\"\n\nCleveland Police did not check on Loehmann's history in Independence before hiring him. And Ohio law required a felony before an officer would lose his badge. So it was Loehmann who responded in the fall of 2014 to the Cleveland park where 12-year-old Tamir Rice was playing with what turned out to be a toy gun. Loehmann shot him dead.\n\nThe Cleveland department's failure to check on Loehmann's background is an example of one of the biggest roadblocks to police accountability - \"wandering cops\" who lose their jobs in one place only to be rehired and to engage in misconduct in another. The problem of wandering cops continues to haunt police accountability amid piecemeal reforms that fall short of fixing the problem, experts say.\n\nThere is a straightforward solution, experts say:\n\n- a national database open to the public with the names of all officers who have engaged in misconduct;\n\n- a requirement that all law enforcement agencies consult that database before hiring.\n\nBut that solution has proved elusive. Most states keep the names of disciplined officers secret and the vast majority of departments do not fully investigate the background of an officer they are hiring. Police chiefs, who have found it difficult to rid their departments of problem officers, generally support stronger laws. Police unions oppose them, arguing that past allegations - many of them denied - shouldn't follow officers through their careers.\n\nDerek Chauvin's prosecution for the death of George Floyd illustrates that officers who come to public attention in abuse cases often had a string of prior allegations of abuse. Chauvin had 18 prior complaints in the Minneapolis Police Department, two of which led to discipline, according to CNN . Eric Stillman, the Chicago officer who shot and killed a 13-year-old Chicago boy last month - as the boy appeared to raise his hands - had 3 complaints and 4 use of force reports in his 6-year record, according to a watchdog group, the Invisible Institute.\n\nOften an officer with a prior history of complaints is forced out of a department, either fired or allowed to resign like Loehmann. Many find other police jobs in their state or other states and continue to have disciplinary problems, research shows.\n\nA study of wandering officers in the Yale Law Journal last year provided the first systematic look at how prevalent wandering officers are. The answer: Wandering officers are prevalent and often run into disciplinary problems after they are rehired, according to authors Ben Grunwald, an assistant professor at Duke Law School and John Rappaport, assistant professor at the University of Chicago Law School.\n\nThe professors studied data in Florida, a state that took important steps to impose accountability on police officers after the Liberty City riots of 1980 left 18 dead. Those riots followed the acquittal of officers prosecuted for the death of Arthur McDuffiie, a 33-year-old Black salesman beaten by police after they chased him for traffic violations on his black and orange Kawasaki motorcycle. Four officers who were tried had 47 previous citizen complaints against them.\n\nPartly as a result, Florida enacted a strong police decertification law in 1980 to prevent officers with discipline problems from moving from department to department\n\nDespite the decertification law, many officers fired in one department are rehired and again run afoul of police discipline, the Yale study found. It concluded:\n\n\"In any given year over the last three decades, an average of roughly 1,100 full-time law-enforcement officers in Florida walk the streets having been fired in the past, and almost 800 having been fired for misconduct, not counting the many who were fired and reinstated in arbitration. These officers...are subsequently fired and subjected to 'moral character' complaints at elevated rates relative to both officers hired as rookies and veterans with clean professional histories.\"\n\nNATIONAL DECERTIFICATION INDEX\n\nThe International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training, an Idaho-based non-profit, has created a national response to the problem of wandering cops - the National Decertification Index (NDI). Forty-five states provide records of misconduct on 30,172 officers so that states can check the NDI database to see if an officer applying for a job has had previous problems.\n\nBut the NDI database is badly flawed, experts say. For one thing, most departments don't check it before hiring. For another, the names in the database are not public. For a third, some of the biggest states in the country are not in the system.\n\nThe NDI database has another flaw. It omits police misconduct that is not serious enough for an officer to be decertified. In many states, only conviction of a felony leads to decertification. So serious misbehavior short of a felony is not included in the database.\n\nThe nation takes a much more rigorous approach to its regulation of healthcare practitioners, who also deal in life and death but don't carry guns, says Roger Goldman, a professor emeritus at Saint Louis University Law School and expert on police licensing. The Congressionally mandated National Practitioners Data Base is truly national and far more informative. It contains malpractice judgments, loss of hospital privileges and adverse medical board actions. The police database should be as informative Goldman argued in a 2016 research paper.\n\nThe President's Task Force on 21st Century Policing, commissioned by President Barack Obama after a series of police killings in 2014, called for the federal government, through the Department of Justice, to follow Goldman's recommendation to partner with and beef up the NDI database, making it truly national. Police unions, however, opposed this recommendation as unfair to officers who face false allegations. The reform hasn't happened.\n\n\"It's a real mess for chiefs of police departments,\" says David A. Harris, a law professor at the University of Pittsburgh and a police expert. \"You go to any chiefs of police conference and every table has the same discussion: 'I fired this guy and we got him back because it was overturned in union arbitration.'\"\n\nRed states such as Florida and Georgia lead the way in decertifying officers with past problems, while there is no decertification in two of the bluest and biggest in the country - California and New Jersey, accounting for about 15 percent of the U.S. population. Rhode Island also lacks decertification. Hawaii has a decertification law but doesn't fund it. And Louisiana has a law but has had only half a dozen decertifications over the past decade.\n\nThe bluer states have lagged because their police unions are so strong and oppose expanding the database into a comprehensive repository of police misconduct, Goldman says.\n\nThe NDI database publishes a public brochure illustrating the potential of an effective database. It features the case of Sean Sullivan who was caught in 2004 kissing a 10-year-old girl on the mouth in Coquille, Oregon. He was convicted on two counts of harassment and ordered to surrender his Oregon police officer certification and never work as a police officer. Oregon entered his name in the NDI database.\n\nThat didn't stop Sullivan from his sexual attacks as a law enforcement officer. First he tried to get a job in Klawock, Alaska, claiming he never was convicted of a crime. Then he not only got a job as a police officer but as police chief in Cedar Vale, Kan. In Cedar Vale he was investigated for a relationship with a 13- or 14-year-old girl. The girl refused to cooperate with the investigation and Sullivan eventually was convicted of lesser charges of burglary and criminal conspiracy. When the NDI database record from Oregon came to light, Sullivan was fired from police work. He later ended up in prison in Washington State for drug crimes.\n\nIn two cases from the Midwest, police departments hired officers they knew had previously been fired by other departments.\n\nKansas City, Mo. fired Officer Kevin Schnell in 2008 after he refused to obtain emergency medical care for a woman who pleaded for help more than a dozen times during a traffic stop because she was having a miscarriage. \"You can go to the hospital when we're done with you, because you're obviously not telling us everything here,\" Schnell told her, according to court records. He said the woman from Sudan \"was just giving me a long line of excuses\" because she had \"jailitis.\"\n\nInstead of sending her to the hospital, he sent her to jail where she passed a blood clot and had a miscarriage the next morning. Kansas City fired Schnell for failing to call emergency medical aid. He went to court in 2010 contesting the firing. He said his comments were not discourteous and that the department was violating his due process rights. The court disagreed. But the two other police departments, including Independence, hired Schnell anyway.\n\nIn 2019 the police chief of Strawberry Point, Iowa, asked the city council to hire Jeremiah Owens even though he later acknowledged that he knew Owens had been fired three years earlier by the Laramie, Wyo. police department. Owens had made homicidal threats on his cell phone and failed to report his brother's involvement in a burglary. The chief and the city council in Strawberry Point went ahead with the hiring. But after Owens was on the job for 11 months, the Iowa Law Enforcement Academy denied him a certificate when it found out about the Laramie firing. Owens has gone to court claiming his due process rights have been violated.\n\n\"SECOND CHANCE\" PD - McFARLAND, California\n\nSixty-two years ago, California became the first state in the nation to take away the licenses of police officers who engaged in misconduct. Now, California finds itself as one of the last four states (the others being New Jersey, Rhode Island, and Hawaii) without a way to take a badge from an officer. A bill to reinstate decertification failed in the face of police union opposition last year but is back before the legislature.\n\nThe consequences of lacking decertification are evident in the short history of the McFarland Police Department, 25 miles north of Bakersfield. The department has become a second chance, sometimes last chance for officers fired or forced out elsewhere. That included two chiefs.\n\nThe extent of the problems in McFarland became clear when California passed SB 1421 in 2018 requiring the release of records for officers convicted of habitual sexual abuse and use-of-force violations. A media consortium found that 80 officers in the state had been convicted of crimes. All told, 630 people who had been officers since 2008 had criminal convictions.\n\nMcFarland epitomized the problem.\n\nBy two years after the department was created in 2009, it had hired 13 officers who had been forced out of previous jobs across the country. Chief David Oberhoffer, a veteran of the San Francisco department, hired most of them, including Ron Navarreta. Navarreta had been fired from the Inglewood department because of a child pornography investigation. Police records showed he admitted to viewing pictures of naked children, but his computer could not be located and no charges were filed.\n\nChief Oberhoffer said he knew about the investigation when he hired Navarreta, but wasn't convinced by the evidence and thought Inglewood might have had a grudge.\n\nOther officers hired in McFarland included an officer accused of having sex with a teen police explorer scout, an officer accused of threatening to put women in jail if they didn't have sex with him, an officer involved in a Los Angeles Police Department burglary ring, an officer who filed a bogus insurance claim for a car dumped in Mexico and an officer convicted of pulling a gun on a stepdaughter's friends.\n\nAfter Oberhoffer, the city promoted Gregory Herrington, who had been hired in McFarland despite a DUI conviction in Georgia and having been fired for dishonesty in Banning, a Riverside County department. Herrington, a former Marine, came in vowing to improve the department's reputation which, he described as in the \"toilet bowl.\" But he ended up hiring three buddies from Banning also involved in dishonesty.\n\nLeonard Purvis, the police chief who had cleaned out Banning, couldn't believe eight of his dishonest officers ended up in McFarland, two as chief. He wrote to the toothless state Peace Officers Standards and Training office. It replied: \"The decision whether to appoint an individual as a peace officer rests with the agency head. Differences of opinion can exist regarding whether or not an individual should be appointed as a peace officer.\"\n\nTHE MUNI SHUFFLE - ST. LOUS TO ST. ANN, MISSOURI\n\nIn St. Louis, wandering police are so common that there is a name for the phenomenon - the Muni-Shuffle.\n\nSt. Ann, a small suburb of about 14,000 near Lambert Field, is the refuge for many officers who have shuffled their way out of bigger departments in St. Louis and St. Louis County.\n\nOne was Eddie Boyd III who as a St. Louis officer pistol-whipped a 12-year-old girl in the face in 2006. He said it was an accident. In 2007 he struck a child in the face with his gun and handcuffs before falsifying a police report, according to Missouri state decertification records. Boyd faced a state decertification order, but a jury ruled in his favor in a lawsuit involving one of the pistol-whipping incidents and he was allowed to keep his badge.\n\nSt. Ann hired Boyd. From there Boyd shuffled his way to nearby Ferguson in 2012 and was on the force leading up to the 2014 death of Michael Brown. A Ferguson woman sued Boyd saying he arrested her for asking for his name at the scene of a traffic accident. He also was an officer cited by the Justice Department in its finding of a pattern of unconstitutional policing. He issued nine citations to Fred Watson, an employee of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency. Watson had just finished playing basketball and gotten into his car when Boyd arrived to charge him with not wearing a seat belt and a host of other unfounded violations. Watson said Boyd drew his gun and pointed it at his head for using his cell phone. Ferguson police responded it only hired officers after they \"undergo extensive investigation.\"\n\nAnother St. Louis police officer who found refuge in St. Ann was Christopher Tanner who shot a former Black St. Louis officer Milton Green at Green's home in 2017. A police chase sped into Green's neighborhood while he was off-duty working on his car in his driveway. A first white officer ordered Green to the ground and forced him to drop his service revolver. No sooner had that officer allowed Green to get up and retrieve his gun but Tanner arrived, told him to drop the pistol and immediately shot him. Green sued the city in 2019.\n\nTanner soon was joined in St. Ann by Jonathan Foote, who resigned from the St. Louis Police Department after a traffic stop led to a crash where a bystander was killed. And there was Christopher Childers, fired from the St. Louis department after assaulting another officer by firing a stun gun at her in her patrol car. He also had initiated a chase that resulted in the death of a bystander. St. Ann fired Childers last month for overdosing on opiods.\n\nSt. Ann's elected Police Chief Aaron Jimenez also hired officer Ellis Brown after he was forced out of the St. Louis Police Department and his state certification suspended. Brown lied about a 2016 incident where he tailed a car, which accelerated, crashed and started burning. Brown left the scene instead of calling for help and then claimed in a report that he hadn't been there. Brown also was one of two officers who had shot Kajieme Powell to death in St. Louis after a shoplifting complaint in 2014. He said he acted in self-defense because Powell had a knife. Also, 19 of Brown's questionable search warrants were thrown out because he used the same language in each.\n\nThen in 2017 St. Ann hired Mark Jakob, one of two St. Louis County police officers fired for lying about a high-speed chase that ended in two deaths. The officers at first claimed not to have been involved in the chase, but an activist group released video showing they were.\n\nChief Jimenez's department favors aggressive tactics such as police chases. Despite its small size, St. Ann police conduct as many high-speed chases as the nearby St. Louis and St. Louis Police Departments that are 20 times bigger. Jimenez has said publicly he checks on officers' backgrounds but hired officers like Tanner and Brown because they hadn't been fired.\n\nThere is one chase a week in St. Ann and one crash every two weeks, sometimes with deadly consequences, the Post-Dispatch reported.\n\nFinally, St. Ann hired ex-Iraqi war veteran Joshua Daniel Becherer, a member of the St. Louis Police Department SWAT team that killed Isaiah Hammet in a controversial no-knock raid in 2017. Becherer resigned from the St. Louis department in 2017 after his arrest for domestic assault for pointing a loaded rifle at a woman's face and threatening to kill her.\n\nBecherer is a good example of how an officer's past misdeeds are kept secret from the public.\n\nNone of this information about Becherer was released by the Police Officer Licensing and Training (POST) office in Missouri. In fact, the only things that are open to the public about police officers under Missouri's Sunshine law is the name of officer, license status, and commissioning or law enforcement agency where the officer is employed.\n\nA LIFELONG CRUSADE\n\nGoldman, the veteran law professor, has weighed in on the muni-shuffle in St. Ann, the abuses in McFarland, Cleveland's mistake in hiring Loehmann - all during a four-decade crusade against wandering cops. The 2014 Black Lives Matter protests after Ferguson and the 2020 George Floyd uprisings have redoubled the attention to the problem of wandering cops and that leads people to Goldman' doorstep.\n\nGoldman's crusade began 41 years ago this past March, when two bullets from Joseph Sorbello's revolver tore through the body of an alleged car thief, Roy Wash, in a parking lot behind a store at 7170 Manchester Boulevard in Maplewood, Mo. The shots killed the alleged thief, but they triggered an epiphany for the still youthful law professor.\n\nGoldman, now 79, read the March 21 1980 account in the St. Louis Post-Dispatch of Wash's shooting the day before. The story reported Sorbello as saying that after he surprised the alleged thief in the act of stealing his car, Wash had reached inside his waistband as if for a gun, but no gun was been found. It also reported that the .45 caliber weapon Sorbello had used to kill Wash had been his by dint of his employment as a part-time officer in the police force of Bridgeton Terrace. Finally, it reported that Sorbello had been fired in 1977 from his full-time job at the Maplewood Police Department after allegations that he had lied to a grand jury, tampered with evidence and brutalized prisoners.\n\nSorbello's own former colleague had testified he had seen him stick the muzzle of his gun in a prisoner's mouth and order him to suck on it. While questioning at least two other prisoners, one a 16 -year-old boy, Sorbello had allegedly pointed his gun at their heads and pulled the trigger in a one-way game of Russian Roulette. Later, another Maplewood police officer engaging in the same sport shot another prisoner, Thomas Brown, to death in the headquarters.\n\nHow was it, Goldman wondered, that Bridgeton Terrace would have hired someone with that kind of record? How could he have still been certified to be a policeman under Missouri law? Other professions, Goldman knew - from medicine to the law to cosmetology - took steps to decertify bad actors. Yet the police, who have life and death power over all of us, did not?\n\nChecking Missouri law, he found, no, they did not. Once someone had been certified or licensed - the two terms are synonymous ― to be a policeman in Missouri, the state had no law that provided for the withdrawal of that license, even if the person had subsequently committed a felony.\n\nGoldman realized he was on to something. He went to Florida, which did decertify police officers for misconduct, and began to dig. He wrote a law journal article concluding, \"Decertification offers perhaps the best chance for states to take responsibility for removing unfit police officers from the profession.\"\n\nGoldman started his legislative campaign in his home state. Clarence Harmon, a former head of Internal Affairs for the St. Louis Police Department and later chief and mayor, testified that as many as 90 percent of officers who leave the St. Louis department under a cloud simply get new jobs with municipalities in St. Louis County.\n\nThe new Police Officer Standards and Training (POST) Law passed and took effect in 1988.\n\nSince 1988, Goldman estimates, Missouri has decertified over 1,000 officers. In 2015, according to figures from a survey conducted by a Seattle University researcher, Missouri revoked 53 licenses ― more than all but seven other states in the country that year. Despite that record, Goldman says, the Missouri law still needs work, including an expansion to cover not only police officers, but also prison guards, probation and parole personnel, and other corrections officers.\n\nGoldman next went to Illinois and then Indiana, both of which passed laws.\n\nA current police decertification dispute in Texas - the latest Goldman has weighed in on - is a reminder that decertification is no panacea. In Texas officers who engaged in wrongdoing used their police licenses to bargain themselves out of prison time. They surrender their license for reduced charges or probation.\n\nAn investigation by KXAN found that in 245 cases from 2015-2018, officers had \"used their licenses to leverage a lesser sentence in a plea bargain. More than 30 officers surrendered their licenses in lieu of prosecution or to halt an investigation.\"\n\nOne was Larry Linley, a DA investigator in Fort Bend County. He originally was charged with four counts of sexual assault for repeated instances of improperly touching an 11-year-old while taking pornographic videos. In 2017 he pleaded guilty to a reduced charge of one count of injury to a child in return for surrendering his license. He got no additional jail time.\n\nLegislation designed to give the Texas decertification board more power has been introduced in the legislature but the strongest proposals are bottled up. The Combined Law Enforcement Associations of Texas, CLEAT, testified against the bills stating, \"All of the legislation we see this session is a direct attack on working cops and is punitive in nature.\"\n\nGoldman responds to criticisms such as CLEAT's by saying, \"My work is not anti-cop. It's pro-good cop.\" And because of that, both law enforcement organizations and civil liberties groups can find common ground.\n\nIf the state can take away the license of a barber for misconduct,\" Goldman said in a recent interview, \"surely it should be able to do so for a police officer.\"\n\n___\n\nFreivogel and Wagman are former reporters for the St. Louis Post-Dispatch who covered the death of Thomas Brown in the Maplewood Police Department headquarters in 1977.

      "text": "Officers In Breonna Taylor Case Indicted Again After Judge Dropped Charges, Blamed Boyfriend\n\nAssociate reporter\n\nFederal prosecutors filed new indictments on Tuesday against two police officers in Louisville, Kentucky, who allegedly used false information to obtain the search warrant that led to the fatal shooting of Breonna Taylor in 2020.\n\nThe superseding indictment against former Sgt. Kyle Meany and former detective Joshua Jaynes of the Louisville Metropolitan Police Department comes months after U.S. District Court Senior Judge Charles Simpson III said the 26-year-old's death was legally caused by her boyfriend firing at police, not the warrant that authorized the raid at her home.\n\nOn March 13, 2020, officers breached the door of Taylor's apartment with their guns drawn. Believing it was an intruder, Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired one shot with his handgun and struck an officer in the leg. Officers responded with a barrage of gunfire, killing Taylor. Her death resulted in nationwide protests, and ultimately the city of Louisville paid $12 million to her family and promised to reform its police practices, including how warrants are handled.\n\nBut according to the new indictment, Jaynes and Meany lacked probable cause to obtain the warrant in the first place and obtained it only because of false, misleading and out-of-date information in their affidavit.\n\n\"If the judge had been aware that key statements in the affidavit were false and misleading, she would not have approved the warrant for Taylor's home and there would not have been a search at Taylor's home,\" prosecutors said in the new indictment.\n\nJaynes and Meany had been investigating a drug trafficking suspect who previously dated Taylor, The Associated Press reported . As part of their investigation, they obtained search warrants for four properties about 10 miles from where Taylor lived.\n\nThe officers then also obtained a warrant for Taylor's home, falsely stating that the suspect was receiving packages there and making \"frequent trips\" between the four properties and Taylor's home, the indictment said. These statements were disproved, according to the indictment.\n\nAlthough police SWAT officers were assigned to the four properties, prosecutors said Meany assigned non-SWAT officers to execute the warrant at Taylor's home, according to the indictment. Prosecutors added that neither Meany nor Jaynes informed the SWAT unit about the search at Taylor's home.\n\nAccording to the indictment, both Meany and Jaynes had knowledge that Walker had a concealed weapons permit, but they failed to inform the officers executing the warrant. None of the officers at Taylor's home had reviewed a risk report, which would have informed them of a handgun inside her home, the indictment said.\n\nTaylor and Walker were asleep when several officers lined up at the door after midnight on March 13, 2020. The two were in a room farthest from the front door and did not hear officers announcing themselves, the indictment said. Taylor was behind Walker as police opened fire and was struck at least six times. Walker was not hit.\n\nMeany and Jaynes were both charged in August 2022 with deprivation of rights under color of law. Jaynes was further charged with conspiracy and falsification of records in a federal investigation. Meany was charged with making false statements to federal investigators.\n\nThe judge, however, dismissed the most serious civil rights charges last August, a decision that prosecutors have appealed. The superseding indictment, with its additional details on the allegations, would also seek to revive the charges.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Mississippi 'Goon Squad' Officers Sentenced On State Charges For Torture Of 2 Black Men\n\nSocial Justice Reporter\n\nA judge on Wednesday sentenced six Mississippi law enforcement officers on state charges for the torture of two Black men during a no-warrant home raid.\n\nThis comes after a federal judge in March sentenced the officers to prison terms ranging from 10 to 40 years . They had pleaded guilty in both their federal and state cases last summer.\n\nThe six men - five former Rankin County sheriff's deputies and a former Richland Police Department officer who belonged to a self-styled \"Goon Squad\" - tortured Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker in 2023 at a home in Braxton, Mississippi.\n\nThe officers kicked in the door of the home, shouting racial slurs at Jenkins and Parker as they beat the men and shocked them with stun guns . One Rankin County deputy shot Jenkins in the mouth.\n\nThe judge read the officers their sentences one by one Wednesday, with the sentencing ranging from 15 to 45 years.\n\nBrett McAlpin, a deputy with Rankin County, was sentenced to 20 years in state prison, described as one of the main leaders of the Goon Squad who told officers what to do during the beating. Christian Dedmon, another Rankin County deputy, was sentenced to 25 years.\n\nDaniel Opdyke, another former Rankin County sheriff's deputy, was sentenced to 20 years on state charges of conspiracy to hinder prosecution.\n\nDedmon was also sentenced on burglary and home invasion charges. McAlpin, Middleton and Opdyke were sentenced on charges related to hindering prosecution.\n\nHunter Elward, the ex-Rankin County deputy who shot Jenkins in the mouth, was sentenced to 45 years on charges of aggravated assault, burglary/home invasion and conspiracy to hinder prosecution.\n\nJoshua Hartfield, the former Richland police officer, was sentenced to 15 years on state charges of hindering prosecution and conspiracy to hinder prosecution.\n\nAll state sentences will run concurrently with federal sentencing, the judge said in the courtroom Wednesday.\n\nCalls for the resignation of Rankin County Sheriff Bryan Bailey have intensified as residents and activists continue to protest against him remaining in office.\n\nJenkins and Parker filed a $400 million lawsuit against Bailey and the sheriff's office last year, alleging that Bailey was complicit in the criminal acts of the deputies he oversaw.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nWhen police unions have widened their gaze beyond issues like compensation and working conditions, it's been almost exclusively to conservative ends.\n\nA police parade in New York City in 1915. Bain News Service / Library of Congress\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nTheir profession is heavily unionized. Culturally, they have more in common with bus drivers than business executives. Many come from working-class backgrounds.\n\nYet on the beat, police come in contact with - to question, to arrest, to brutalize - the most disadvantaged. This presents a problem for radicals. If the Left stands for anything, it's worker emancipation and labor militancy. But police and others in the state's coercive apparatus, workers themselves in many respects, are the keepers of class society. Their jobs exist to maintain social control and protect the status quo.\n\nThe introduction of unions to this portion of the state raises additional concerns. Can \"coercive unions\" ever advocate for the broader working class, rather than members' narrow self-interests? Or are police unions irredeemably reactionary?\n\nIt's easy to focus on the individual over the institution. Not a few police officers are drawn to the profession out of a desire to \"serve the public.\" Many genuinely want to serve, and take great pride in their chosen occupation. Police don't have to enjoy breaking up protests; they don't have to be racists or hate homeless people. But once they decide to do their jobs, institutional exigencies overwhelm personal volition. When there's mass resistance to poverty and inequality, it's the cops who are summoned to calm the panic-stricken hearts of the elite. They bash some heads, or infiltrate and disrupt some activist groups, and all is right in the world again.\n\nSuch is the inherent defect of law-enforcement unionism: It's peopled by those with a material interest in maintaining and enlarging the state's most indefensible practices.\n\nIt's hard to imagine how it could be any different. Chicago teachers, exemplifying the kind of social-movement unionism that defends the working class broadly, organized the community before their strike by trumpeting a vision of equitable education. The Left cheered. How could anything similar be achieved by prison guards? A police strike would appear to signal an incipient authoritarianism, cops untamed by democratic dictates. How could empowering police - increasingly militarized and shot through with a culture of preening brutality - yield anything but stepped-up repression? How could the traditional socialist goal of worker self-management result in anything but a dystopia of metastasizing prisons, imperious cops, and Minuteman-esque border-patrol guards? The best we can hope for from police, it seems, is passivity.\n\nAs Kristian Williams documents in Our Enemies in Blue , professionalized policing arose in the United States amid urbanization in the 1820s and 1830s. Controlling \"dangerous\" classes (principally of the industrial working variety), more than ameliorating any pronounced spike in crime, was the reason for its formation. The institution had its roots in slave patrols, which were established to control the behavior of slaves - the \"dangerous\" classes of that day.\n\nIn the late 1800s, when more workers bandedtogether to improve their situation, elites once again blanched. Police broke up strikes, confiscated pro-labor newspapers, and arrested radicals. States like Pennsylvania set up forces to deal with labor stoppages. Free speech and free association were subordinated to private property.\n\nIn this respect, little has changed. The activist who is doing anything of value expects to be under surveillance, and is on the lookout for agents provocateurs . Where capital is concerned, cops are custodians, and the First Amendment is flotsam.\n\nOther subtler - primarily ideological - forms of policing have long existed. The police officer, border patrol guard and corrections officer only step in when abstract injunctions need to be made tangible. When all attempts to modify citizens' behavior have failed, they appear - to intercept undocumented immigrants forced from their home countries by Global North-favoring trade agreements, to watch over incarcerated drug dealers from deindustrialized wastelands. When they exercise their power, it's far from subtle; they are the state's monopoly on violence incarnate. And they have a vested interest in seeing their power increase unchecked.\n\nWhen police unions have widened their gaze beyond issues like compensation and working conditions, it's been almost exclusively to advance conservative ends. \"Police,\" as Williams puts it, \"organize as police , not workers.\"\n\nThey've bitterly opposed civilian review boards (and, if established, have sought to undermine them). They've fought the placement of names and badge numbers on officer uniforms. They've resisted rooting out police misconduct. \"The modern police union movement,\" criminologist Samuel Walker argues , \"originated largely in reaction to the civil rights movement and its criticisms of police conduct during the 1960s. . . . Any local unions originated or at least became more militant in response to specific police-community relations initiatives in the 1960s.\"\n\nAnd police unions aren't even the worst actors.\n\nIn the hovel of coercive unionism, the California prison guards union (the California Correctional Peace Officers Association) is the leader. The organization has long defined itself as separate from the mainstream labor movement. Politically, the California prison guards aren't wedded to the Democratic Party, and institutionally, they're not affiliated with either of the nation's labor federations. The association has proven its ability to parlay mass incarceration into increased political power, membership, and dues. They bankroll \"victim's rights\" groups, they fight anti-incarceration referenda, they funnel millions to Democrats and Republicans who adopt law-and-order stances.\n\nWhen tougher sentencing became the new norm several decades ago, the organization was small - membership totaled about five thousand, and their budget didn't crack a half a million dollars. They now represent more than thirty thousand correctional officers. In 2008 alone, they spent nearly $5 million to elect sympathetic candidates and, more importantly, to defeat a ballot measure seeking to reduce the prison population through treatment instead of incarceration. Other prison-guard unions have benefited from the prison boom, but none have been able to capitalize on the carceral state as well as the CCPOA. The union looks at the marginalized and sees an opportunity for enrichment.\n\nTwo of the CCPOA's ideological cousins are the National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) and the National ICE Council. Unlike the CCPOA, the two are inhabitants of the House of Labor - they're member unions of the American Federation of Government Employees, which is affiliated with the AFL-CIO. On immigration, however, they've bucked the federation's pro-reform line (a line that has already conceded far too much to the Right).\n\nAbove all, both organizations are interested in more enforcement - despite the Obama administration's deportation of undocumented immigrants at a faster rate than any previous president. The two groups' preferred term for undocumented immigrants is \"illegal aliens,\" of course. ICE Council President Chris Crane, the New York Times wrote in June, has been \"the most frequent witness on Capitol Hill during this year's immigration debate and the favorite expert of conservative critics of the Senate measure.\"\n\nOn top of trying to scuttle any path to citizenship, the border-patrol union has resisted efforts to restrict its violent mandate. \"If you don't throw rocks at Border Patrol agents,\" the NBPC's charming vice president said in November , \"you won't be shot.\"\n\nThere are counterexamples - including, ironically, among police in apartheid-era South Africa.\n\nIn the 1980s, black police officers in that country were enforcers of their own subordination. Internally, they were mired in low-level positions and lacked collective-bargaining rights; externally, they couldn't arrest whites, yet had to quell unrest that threatened to topple the racist Afrikaner government. Economically desperate and typically lured from rural areas by the promise of a paycheck, some, having coarsened once on the force, patrolled restive townships unsympathetically.\n\nRevolutionary organizations and community members urged black police to join the struggle for liberation. In September 1989, they got their aggrieved dissident - Gregory Rockman, a slim, mustachioed lieutenant in a Cape Town suburb. The thirty-year-old lambasted the riot police - \"a pack of wild dogs,\" in his estimation, that \"feasted on the people\" - and said he sought \"a whole new era of police in South Africa [and] to assure the public they are not enemies but protectors.\"\n\nThe next month, Rockman presided over the establishment of the Police and Prisons Civil Rights Union (POPCRU) - the first real trade union in South Africa, according to the sociologist Monique Marks.\n\nTheir first demonstration resulted in the arrest of Rockman and twelve others. Membership mushroomed, but so did management repression. Cops who tried to join were suspended or fired, meetings were broken up by tear gas, and members were bludgeoned with batons. With resistance came solidarity. \"The sight of policemen in uniform singing freedom songs and shouting anti-apartheid slogans touched off popular demonstrations of support,\" scholar Gavin Cawthra wrote in his 1993 book Policing in South Africa .\n\nIntimately linked to the African National Congress, conceived in the crucible of anti-apartheid struggle, the POPCRU's infancy was a study in social-movement unionism. On their website, they still trumpet their devotion to \"advancing the working-class struggle within the criminal justice system.\"\n\nBut there's cause for skepticism. Can an established amalgamation of police and prison guards really advance the working-class struggle? Collective bargaining has been won, apartheid has been vanquished. No longer is the POPCRU, in Marks' words, a \"dissident grouping.\" What, then, distinguishes this \"civil rights union\" from a standard US police union? For Marks, this seems to be the wrong comparison. Just as the POPCRU functions as a \"watchful eye\" that propels the attenuation of police authoritarianism, so too can black political associations drive reform.\n\nThe US equivalent group would be the National Black Police Association . They oppose the death penalty, support affirmative action, and condemn police brutality. They aim to \"to be the conscience of the criminal justice system, and to enhance the quality of life in the African-American community.\" But the group does not unequivocally oppose the unconscionable War on Drugs, a caging frenzy so colossal that the US now imprisons a larger percentage of its black population than South Africa during apartheid .\n\nFounded in 1972, just a year after Nixon launched the War on Drugs, the NBPA has been an anemic force for pacification. Over the same decades, the war has ravaged communities of color, the number of racial minorities and women on the beat has increased substantially, and the NBPA has been the \"conscience of the criminal justice system.\" That the increased presence of women and minorities on the force - laudable, no doubt - hasn't fundamentally lessened the country's system of social domination should sober enthusiasts of police reform.\n\nTo its credit, the AFL-CIO staked out a strong position against mass incarceration this year. In September, at the federation's quadrennial convention, federation president Richard Trumka called it \"a betrayal of the American promise.\" He said, \"the practice hurts our people and our communities, it keeps wages low, it suppresses democracy, and we can't afford to imprison so many people. Nor can our families, our communities, or our country afford the loss of productivity of these people.\" Trumka's forceful statement, and the related resolution, were notable in that the federation's largest union, AFSCME, counts prison guards among its members. No doubt mindful of this tension between social justice and narrow self-interest, the resolution chiefly indicted the private prison industry, charging \"our nation's profit-driven justice system [with] producing a level of mass incarceration that is anything but just.\"\n\nAdmirable as the resolution was, it's likely purely rhetorical, at best a suggestion that locals linked to the prison industrial complex change their tack. The AFL-CIO's organizational structure is such that the federation has about as much power to compel an obdurate affiliate to change its behavior as a parent does with a grown child. As the AFL-CIO's constitution states , member unions \"are affiliated with, but are not subordinate to, or subject to the general direction and control of, the Federation.\" The late journalist Robert Fitch believed this inscribed corruption in the very structure of organized labor. Corrupt or not, the independence of locals unquestionably constricts the federation's ability to steer coercive unionism in a more constructive direction.\n\nSocialists, recognizing the contradictions of the democratic capitalist state - by turns securer and seizer of freedom - can simultaneously love Medicare and loathe the NYPD. We recognize that, through struggle, workers have secured the occasional spot on what Marx called the executive committee of the bourgeoisie. Pro-labor liberals are in more treacherous territory. Unable to navigate the nuances and paradoxes of the public sector, their anti-austerity message is, \"Don't cut the jobs of teachers, firefighters, and police officers.\" For them, the function of all three occupations is identical: to serve the public good.\n\nPro-labor liberals see a revanchist Tea Party and cuts in food stamps, and crouch to defend a monolithic state. They see a dying labor movement in which the number of union workers in the public sector now eclipses those in the private sector, or some cops standing against GOP attacks on collective bargaining rights, and they believe the police are their natural allies.\n\nBut they overlook whose class interests are served when police are dispatched, as compared to other government workers. Teachers teach, cops serve capital. The homeless man arrested for public intoxication has been treated more punitively than the Wall Street trader whose avarice breeds homelessness. This is the system the police, prison guards, and the border patrol maintain.\n\nBecoming agents of progressive change would require that unions in these occupations negate their own power, that they work toward their own abolition. Absent this development, parochialism seems to be the only model that's realistic in the here-and-now. Bargain for decent salaries and benefits. Accept the constraints that communities and elected officials impose. Act as professional associations, constituted strictly to advance member interests rather than social change or class struggle. Meanwhile, workers and organizers under the same union umbrella - AFSCME, primarily - can place internal pressure on their coercive counterparts in the hopes of smoothing out their worst traits.\n\nBut allies? Hardly. The cop who rallies for collective bargaining today will be protecting Goldman Sachs tomorrow.\n\nShawn Gude is Jacobin 's associate editor.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But with the police force and army so entwined - both in terms of personnel and weaponry - demilitarization won't be easy.\n\nA person holds flowers as demonstrators clash with police near the Seattle Police Department's East Precinct shortly after midnight on June 8, 2020 in Seattle, Washington.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nCalls for the demilitarization of police have gained new prominence in the light of the latest wave of anti-police brutality protests sweeping the United States. But in a country where one-fifth of the police force is ex-military - including George Floyd's killer in Minneapolis, Derek Chauvin, and Robert McCabe, one of the two officers responsible for knocking down Martin Gugino, the seventy-five-year-old protester in Buffalo - demilitarization won't come easy.\n\nMany police officers are themselves former members of the military who picked up a career in policing after returning from war zones. But this isn't the only problem. Loaded down with cast-off gear from the Pentagon - body armor, bayonets, automatic rifles, grenade launchers, armored vehicles, and surveillance drones - police officers are more likely to regard peaceful protestors as enemy combatants, particularly when the Pentagon's own top official refers to their protest scenes as \"battlespace.\"\n\nBut getting police officers out of the business of being an occupying military force -whether perpetually or in times of crisis - will also require much closer screening of job applicants who are veterans and elimination of their favored treatment in police department hiring.\n\nPolicing is the third most common occupation for men and women who served in the military. It is an option widely encouraged by career counselors and veterans' organizations like the American Legion. As a result, several hundred thousand veterans are now wearing a badge of some sort. Though veterans comprise just 6 percent of the US population, veterans now working in law enforcement number 19 percent of the total force. Their disproportionate representation is due, in part, to preferential hiring requirements, mandated by state or federal law. In addition, under the Obama administration, the Department of Justice provided local police departments with tens of millions of dollars to fund veterans-only positions.\n\nAs noted by the Marshall Project in its 2017 report , \"When Warriors Put On the Badge,\" this combination of hiring preferences and special funding has made it harder to \"build police forces that resemble and understand diverse communities.\" The beneficiaries have been disproportionately white, because 60 percent of all enlisted men and women are not people of color.\n\nJustice Department officials, particularly under President Donald Trump, have shown little interest in tracking the later job performance of recently hired veterans or how their military background might affect their behavior vis-à-vis the public. As former Department of Justice (DOJ) official Ronald Davis put it in his response to the Marshall Project's report, \"I reject the notion that a returning veteran, who has seen combat, should cause concern for a police chief. I would even hire more if I could.\"\n\nThe International Association of Chiefs of Police did its own report in 2009, which raised some concerns about \"the integration of military personnel\" into law enforcement in the wake of 9/11. According to this study, \"veterans returning from the Vietnam War could easily distinguish their combat environment - mostly jungle, farm, or open terrain - from their urban or suburban policing environment. In the case of returning combat veterans from Iraq or Afghanistan, their combat environment and their policing environments may appear surprisingly similar.\" The report warned that past deployments in the Middle East \"may cause returning officers to mistakenly blur the lines between military combat situations and civilian crime situations, resulting in inappropriate decisions and actions, particularly in the use of less lethal or lethal force.\"\n\nCosponsored by the DOJ's Bureau of Justice Assistance, the report also noted that combat veterans who suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and related \"depression, anger, withdrawal, and family issues\" may have \"a low tolerance for civilian complaints\" and greater propensity for the \"inappropriate use of force.\" Some police chiefs interviewed reported that veterans under their command came back \"ill prepared for the civilian world\" because their PTSD left them with \"exaggerated survival instincts.\"\n\nVeterans of, course, got high marks for their physical fitness, weapons-handling experience, habituation to discipline, and leadership qualities. Yet the report notes that some had trouble \"readjusting to receiving rather than giving orders, trusting others, and changing the rules of engagement.\" According to 14 percent of chiefs surveyed, more citizen complaints are reported against veteran officers than other officers, 28 percent reported psychological issues, and 10 percent saw excessive violence.\n\nA study by researchers at the University of Texas School of Public Health that focused on the Dallas Police Department found that officers with military experience used their guns while on duty more than nonveterans. During a ten-year period, nearly one-third of all 516 cops involved in a shooting incident were veterans. Those who had been deployed overseas were nearly three times as likely to have fired their weapon; those who had not been deployed were still twice as likely to be involved in a shooting. The study concluded that some veterans employed by the Dallas police department lacked \"critical thinking skills\" when confronted with \"high stress scenarios.\"\n\nSimilar findings were reported by the Marshall Project after it studied use-of-force complaints and fatal police shootings in several cities. In Boston and Miami, officers with military experience generated more civilian complaints of excessive force. Nearly one-third of the Albuquerque officers involved in a total of thirty-five fatal shootings between January 2010 and April 2014 were veterans. One of the officers sued after killing an unarmed motorist was an Iraq War veteran whose PTSD caused flashbacks, nightmares, and blackouts. Nevertheless, as the Marshall Project discovered, he was \"assigned to patrol a high-crime area of town known as 'the War Zone.'\"\n\nMarshall Project researchers cited the need for clear and consistent police department policies to \"evaluate employees' mental and physical fitness . . . to ensure public safety and guarantee a stable, reliable, and productive workforce.\" Yet police department screening practices are far from standardized or effective. \"Some agencies employ the use of administrative interviews and psychological evaluations to assess how veteran officers will perform the essential functions of their position, while other agencies revert to their department medical officer, or lack any policy at all.\"\n\nA major cause for concern is that veterans who end up in policing are even more vulnerable to its well-known occupational hazards, involving alcohol or drug abuse and attempted suicide. As Blue Health, a mental health advocacy group for police officers and their families, reported in January , far more cops died by their own hand (228) last year than were killed in the line of duty (132).\n\nOne of the many veterans that we have interviewed for a forthcoming book is a former deputy sheriff who returned from Iraq with severe PTSD. After his wife threatened to leave him unless he gave up his new career, he sought residential treatment twice and was finally forced to choose between his family and his job, which left him angry, irritable, and often volatile. \"I don't like gray areas,\" he confessed. \"If I'm in for a penny, I'm in for a pound. What that means is I can play cop, or I can play family man.\" With vocational rehabilitation help from the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA), he became a skilled construction worker instead.\n\nOther veterans, well known for their criticism of \"forever wars\" and the harm they've done to ordinary soldiers, are joining the fight against militarization of public safety. Common Defense, the progressive veterans' group, has announced the launch of a \"No War In Our Streets\" campaign. Among those involved is Kyle Bibby, a former Marine Corps infantry officer, Annapolis graduate, and co-founder of the Black Veterans Project. According to Bibby, who served in Afghanistan, veterans have unique credibility as critics of putting of $7 billion worth of military hardware in the hands of local police departments. \"It was our equipment first,\" he says. \"We understand it better than the police do ... It's important that we have veterans ready to stand up and say: 'These weapons need to go.'\"\n\nTougher to tackle is the issue of ex-military personnel being over-represented in the ranks of domestic law enforcers. When you leave the service, says Danny Sjursen, a West Point graduate who fought in Iraq and Afghanistan, \"there's no de-programming...They just load you up on meds and then you go straight to the police academy.\" According to Sjursen, \"military-style of policing is based on notion that high-crime areas should be treated like occupied countries.\" So the \"military-to-police pipeline\" increases the chances \"that a guy comes back to Baltimore, Camden, or Detroit and functions the same way we did when occupying Kabul or Baghdad.\"\n\nAmong those also at risk when that happens are fellow veterans; since 2018, at least six African-Americans who served in the military have died in police shootings, including a troubled young Air Force veteran killed in Indianapolis last month.\n\nRetired Army colonel Andrew Bacevich, a distinguished military historian who served in Vietnam, argues that, in the past, it might have made \"all the sense in the world for us to vector vets toward the police force.\" But that was before the post 9/11 generation of veterans returned home with such high rates of PTSD, substance abuse, and suicide. \"To the extent that we've got a bunch of damaged young people,\" Bacevich says, \"then maybe the last thing we want to do is put them in a job where they carry a gun in an environment that's going to make things worse.\"\n\nSuzanne Gordon is the author of several reports and books on veterans' health care, including Wounds of War .

Rather than treating the incident as an opportunity for introspection, French police have rebelled against all attempts to be held accountable.\n\nFrench police officers stand at the entrance of a courtroom in Aix-en-Provence on August 3, 2023, during an appeal on the pretrial detention lodged by a police officer suspected of having beaten up a twenty-two-year-old man on the night of July 1 to 2 in Marseille.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhat if the state of the French police is but a reflection of the profound malaise engulfing the rule of law in the country as a whole? Just over a month after the death of Nahel Merzouk, a seventeen-year-old boy shot down by the police, France now confronts seditious inclinations within its law enforcement ranks.\n\nThe increasing prevalence of protests across France in recent years has emboldened the country's police. This is because their ability to ensure law and order is the basis on which parties from the center and Right have sought to legitimize themselves to the conservative sections of the electorate. French police have thus felt able to assert themselves, rebel, and seek to operate outside the boundaries of the law.\n\nOn July 24, the director-general of the National Police (DGPN) stated publicly that he opposed the idea of placing a police officer in pretrial detention - a stance endorsed by the prefect of police in Paris and validated by the Ministry of the Interior itself, which found no fault in the DGPN's remarks. Within the French political landscape, the right wing rejoices at the country's drift toward authoritarianism: Senator Valérie Boyer of Les Républicains believes that prisons should be reserved for those who pose a threat to society, thus concluding that the guardians of law cannot, by definition, be arrested for misconduct. Meanwhile, some officers resort to sick leave as a form of protest and have even organized demonstrations outside the home of a judge who ordered pretrial detention for one of their colleagues. How did it come to this?\n\nThree years ago, through the \"global security\" law, French police gained the right to carry their firearms off duty, even in public spaces. The decision indicated the political establishment's complete and unflinching loyalty to the police force, solidified by the series of terrorist attacks that have struck France in the last decade - Charlie Hebdo, the Paris and Nice attacks, among others.\n\nAlthough the center and Right have embraced the institution of the police, the Left has been less willing to do so. The Left condemns police killings and racism and calls for profound reform, while the Right denies police violence and insists that since the police are \"republican,\" accusations of racism are baseless (the invocation of republicanism is a common tactic with which French chauvinists dismiss their country's racism).\n\nThe controversial Article 24 - struck down by the Constitutional Council - sought to prohibit the filming of police officers, a right long established by American jurisprudence, which views it as integral to the very core of the First Amendment: a right deemed essential both for holding government officials accountable and for safeguarding against abuses of power.\n\nFiercely defended by the current administration, the police know that they can push the limits and assert their will through force. The government, facing growing moments of public distrust (the Yellow Vest movement , pension reform protests , suburban riots ), cannot afford to be without them. However, when trust is so strong that even the fundamental principles of the rule of law can be questioned without any reaction from the executive, does it not provide evidence that the French republic is tilting toward an increasingly authoritarian regime, showing less and less regard for fundamental liberties?\n\nIn May, the Hérault prefecture took down a banner adorned with the acronym ACAB, All Cops Are Bastards, boasting a \"zero tolerance\" policy for \"hate speech\" directed at law enforcement. The interpretation of ACAB as hate speech rather than a critique of the police as an institution raises questions, especially in a country that embraces \"liberty\" in its motto. In 2020, the police union Alliance demonstrated its profound respect for freedom of expression when it filed a complaint against singer Camélia Jordana. The reason for the legal action was that Jordana had the audacity to say publicly what many thought privately, that \"thousands of people do not feel safe in the presence of a cop, and I am one of them.\"\n\nThe ban on criticizing the police is causing ripples even in the realm of freedom of association: since the enactment of the \"act reinforcing the principles of the republic,\" associations seeking public subsidies must now sign a binding \"contract\" committing them to uphold the \"values of the republic.\" The determination of what constitutes these \"republican values\" appears to rest entirely within the executive's discretion: recently, Minister of the Interior Gérald Darmanin asserted that the Human Rights League, a century-old association, wrongly labeled France as a \"police state.\" Consequently, its public subsidies could now be subject to reconsideration. The precedent this sets, according to which public funding is reserved for associations that refrain from criticizing the government, is deeply worrying.\n\nThis unprecedented succession of events has raised concerns among numerous international organizations: last month, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights urged France to address \"deep issues of racism and discrimination in law enforcement.\" Amnesty International, on its part, highlighted numerous instances of racial and religious discrimination and the excessive use of force by the police. These concerns were swiftly dismissed by France, which deemed all such accusations as \" groundless .\" For the \"Land of Enlightenment,\" there can be no systemic racism within its police forces, regardless of the fact that these forces overwhelmingly vote for the far right .\n\nAmid the aftermath of the tragic death of Nahel Merzouk, French president Emmanuel Macron is now contemplating an extraordinary measure - \" shutting down \" social media during riots - in response to violent unrest. This move, if implemented, would place France alongside undemocratic nations like China, Russia, and Belarus, prompting apprehensions about the state of democracy in the country. The president had pledged to \"appease\" the nation within a one-hundred-day timeframe following massive demonstrations against pension reform. However, instead of fostering a climate of peace, each passing day appears to be eroding the very foundations of democracy and republicanism.\n\nThe words of US Supreme Court justice William Brennan in the 1987 case of City of Houston v. Hill resonate powerfully in this context: \"The freedom of individuals verbally to oppose or challenge police action without thereby risking arrest is one of the principal characteristics by which we distinguish a free nation from a police state.\" France should give serious consideration to the potential implications of its illiberal drift. Preserving the rights of citizens to voice their dissent without undue repression is essential to upholding the values of a truly democratic society.\n\nSébastien Natroll is a freelance journalist based in Paris.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

The NYPD slowdown has proven the opposite.\n\nSpencer Platt / Getty Images\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhat happens when the police go on strike? Over the past two weeks, the New York Police Department (NYPD) has done its part to answer that question. Officers have been on a particular kind of strike called a slowdown: they come to work, but don't do their job as quickly or fully as usual.\n\nWhile police union officials have denied officers are working at a slower pace, arrests in all categories are down more than 50 percent. The decline in traffic violations and minor incidents, like public urination, has been especially pronounced: where arrests for major felonies have dropped by about 20 percent, summonses for low-level crimes and parking and moving violations have decreased by more than 90 percent.\n\nAccording to a New York Times article this past week, \"In Coney Island, the precinct covering that neighborhood did not record a single parking ticket, traffic summons or ticket for a low-level crime like public urination or drinking, the statistics showed.\" This decline in arrests and summons has spilled over into the courtroom :\n\nOne arraignment courtroom instead of two. Clerks watching \"Batman\" on their computer screens and playing with their cellphones as they wait for something to happen. And Manhattan's night court shutting down an hour early because there are no more cases to call.\n\nThose were scenes from the city's arraignment courts in the third week of a precipitous drop in arrests by the New York Police Department . The usual chaotic bustle of the courts - the odd mix of transgressors, from murderers to fare-beaters - has given way to unusual scenes of tranquil inactivity.\n\nThe NYPD has effectively suspended its notorious \"broken windows\" policy, characterized by heavy policing of small-time misdemeanors and minor infractions in the name of preventing more serious crimes. The effect of this practice, under normal conditions, is the over-policing of poor, especially minority, neighborhoods. The homicide of Eric Garner began with police accosting him for illegally selling a few loose cigarettes.\n\nNormally the point of a strike is to halt production to show society, or at least your employers, that they need you. Stopping work imposes costs on others - lowering employers' profits, reducing politicians' legitimacy, increasing consumers' needs - but it only does so because the work that workers do is essential. The work cannot be done without them. This is why employers hire replacement workers, or seek court injunctions to force employees back to work.\n\nIt is also why strikers risk becoming unpopular with the public - the absence of the goods they are producing or the services they provide can become a serious inconvenience. And it is why workers often take care to build public support for their strike, with the hopes that the public attributes those inconveniences to the causes of the stoppage instead of to the strikers themselves.\n\nA perfect example is the 2012 Chicago Teachers Union strike , which shut down the first days of school. This caused some headaches for working families and their children, but because of the union's pre-strike community organizing, those families largely supported the teachers against city government. The strike proved how important the teachers were, and why they deserved more respect than they received.\n\nThe irony of the NYPD strike is that it has demonstrated the opposite. When police do not do their jobs, at least as defined under current policy, the costs are low. There is no dramatic damage to public safety. Relative to the precipitous drop in policing, there have been very minor increases in violent crime. Nor are the other costs, such as the decline in revenue from fines and tickets, particularly significant. Meanwhile, the benefits to (formerly) over-policed neighborhoods is large.\n\nWith their slowdown, New York police officers have shown that most of their activities are inessential. Society is better off when they are not engaging in broken windows, quality-of-life harassment of poor neighborhoods. The next logical step is to simply normalize the present. In the infamous words of one former vice president, this should be the \"new normal.\"\n\nAlex Gourevitch is an associate professor of political science at Brown University and the author of From Slavery To the Cooperative Commonwealth: Labor and Republican Liberty in the Nineteenth Century .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

(Matthew West / MediaNews Group / Boston Herald via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nTyre Nichols was just two minutes away from his house when a group of Memphis police officers from the city's so-called Scorpion unit pulled his car over. When Nichols was taken out of his vehicle, his protest was simple. \"I didn't do anything,\" he can be heard saying in police body camera footage.\n\nLess than an hour later, Nichols was en route to the hospital, having suffered a police beating that would ultimately claim his life. In the aftermath of Nichols's death, the Memphis Police Department disbanded the Scorpion unit that was designed to target crime in the city's poorest neighborhoods.\n\nIt is also, now, considering limiting how and why police can make traffic stops - a familiar municipal response to a brutal episode of police violence in a country where, according to data from Mapping Police Violence, police have killed more than eight hundred people following traffic stops since 2017. The victims of that violence have, like the victims of all police violence in the United States, been disproportionately black. In the aftermath of particularly high-profile police killings, like that of Patrick Lyoya in Grand Rapids, Michigan, Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, and Nichols in Memphis, media outlets like the New York Times and the BBC have run stories asking the same basic question: What is it about traffic stops that causes them to turn deadly?\n\nThere are several possible answers. Police officers and criminologists, for example, often blame the prevalence of violence following traffic stops on police training that frames those stops as inherently unpredictable and dangerous for officers. The notion that traffic stops are especially dangerous for officers isn't conclusively backed by data: an estimate published in the Michigan Law Review three years ago pegged the rate at which officers are assaulted during routine traffic stops at just one in every 6,959 stops, and the rate at which they're feloniously killed at just one in 6.5 million stops. But police trainings haven't adjusted.\n\nAnother view is simply that police interactions are always dangerous, particularly for people of color, whether at traffic stops or anywhere else. Traffic stops just happen to be the primary way the general public interacts with police officers. \"Traffic stops turn violent because the act of policing is rooted in force and violence,\" Woods Ervin, communications director for Critical Resistance, told Jacobin .\n\nThe police officers who beat Nichols have been charged with second-degree murder, but they're anomalies. The New York Times surveyed four hundred cases in which a police officer killed an unarmed motorist; of all those cases, only five officers were ever convicted of a crime - even though the Times found that police officers making traffic stops all too often unnecessarily escalated confrontations with motorists and then shot them in \"self-defense.\"\n\nTraffic stops have long played an outsize role in American policing. Akhi Johnson, director of the Reshaping Prosecution Initiative at Vera, told Jacobin that this is no coincidence.\n\n\"Not only are police trained that those are stressful situations, they are also trained to use them as investigative tactics to try to ferret out evidence and that traffic stops are this incredible public safety tool,\" Johnson said.\n\nJohnson, a former assistant US attorney, said that traffic stops fall into two categories: what police officers describe as \"must-stop\" situations, where a person is driving recklessly or endangering the safety of other people on the road, and \"can stop\" situations, where a person is not endangering anyone's safety but an officer decides to pull them over anyway for a reason often tenuously related or completely unrelated to public health.\n\nPretextual stops, in which officers pull over drivers for a minor traffic-related infraction in order to investigate them for an unrelated offense, fall into the latter category - and it's those stops that disproportionately impact people of color and low-income neighborhoods. A study of fourteen years of traffic stop data in North Carolina found that black drivers were 95 percent more likely than white drivers to be pulled over and 115 percent more likely than white drivers to be searched during a stop, even though searches of white drivers more often uncovered contraband.\n\n\"The real damage in that is if you're a driver, and you were speeding way over the limit and you get pulled over, you get it - you know you weren't supposed to be doing it [and] it doesn't tend to impact your perceptions of law enforcement,\" Johnson said. \"When you aren't doing anything wrong and you get pulled over time and time again, it erodes your trust in law enforcement, it erodes your trust in government, and that makes all of us less safe.\"\n\nJohnson's claim has empirical backing. A recent study conducted in Tampa found that getting stopped by police makes a person less likely to vote - a point that Ervin argues underscores how policing, like the rest of the carceral system, is used as a method of exerting social control and effectively excluding certain groups of people from the democratic process.\n\nIn few places was that clearer than in Ferguson, Missouri, in the lead-up to the killing of Michael Brown. A study conducted by the St Louis nonprofit Better Together found that court fees made up a quarter of Ferguson's budget, giving police officers an effective imperative to pull drivers over in a scheme that former St Louis alderman Antonio French described as \"taxation by citation.\" In 2013, the year before Brown was killed, 86 percent of police stops in Ferguson and 92 percent of searches were of black people.\n\nThere is an emerging consensus in major cities that these \"can stop\" traffic stops aren't doing anything to improve public safety. San Francisco is one of a number of cities that have recently moved to limit the circumstances under which officers can make pretextual stops - banning officers from making stops for low-level offenses like driving without working taillights or driving with an item hanging from a mirror. The San Francisco order also limits when officers can ask to search a person's vehicle or ask investigatory questions following a stop to when they have concrete evidence of criminal activity.\n\n\"The overall goal is to be smart about how we use the limited law enforcement resources that we have,\" Max Carter-Oberstone, vice president of the San Francisco police commission, told Jacobin . \"A huge volume of our stops are for low-level offenses that don't pose any threat to people on our roadways, and for which we are not recovering guns, drugs, or making arrests. These stops are just a horribly inefficient use of our law enforcement resources.\"\n\nPhiladelphia and Pittsburgh have also passed laws limiting the use of pretextual stops. Minneapolis two years ago began exploring the creation of an unarmed Traffic Safety division that would take traffic law enforcement away from the city's police department following public safety logic popularized during the 2020 Black Lives Matter uprising; Berkeley has attempted to institute a similar plan but has thus far been stopped by California state law.\n\nA handful of national politicians are beginning to pick up the picture as well - a bill introduced in the US House by Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York would establish a $100 million annual grant program for cities that reassign traffic law enforcement to unarmed officers or technology. The fact that police unions in Pittsburgh and Philadelphia are fighting limitations on their traffic stop powers suggests in itself that the stops serve a purpose aside from public safety.\n\nWhether or not reassigning the work of policing away from police would make a decisive long-term impact remains to be seen. But if limiting the police officers' ability to make arbitrary stops is important because it limits their ability to spin those stops into other charges and fines, it's also important because there is scant evidence that any other sort of police reform measure effectively cuts down on police violence. The officers who beat Nichols were all black. They wore body cameras. They were armed, but they didn't use their guns.

But troubling incidents - including fatal shootings by police officers in the state - during her time as California's \"top cop\" suggest that wasn't always the case.\n\nWhen Kamala Harris was California's attorney general, she did not investigate the fatal shootings of two unarmed men by the same Anaheim police officer less than a year apart.

The new bill was named for George Floyd, who was killed in May 2020 by Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who had previously used fatal force and had a history of misconduct complaints. Among other things, the legislation would create a grant program for state attorneys general to assist them in conducting independent investigations in police misconduct cases.\n\nIn the lead-up to the vote, Vice President Kamala Harris, who spearheaded similar legislation in the Senate with Cory Booker in June, lauded the bill on Twitter.\n\n\"The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act represents an important step towards ensuring more accountability and transparency in policing,\" she tweeted. \"I join [President Joe Biden] in encouraging Congress to pass this legislation and get it to the President's desk.\"\n\nBut Harris was not always so eager to scrutinize officers' behavior or push for attorney general reviews of police misconduct when she was California's top law enforcement official, documents reveal.\n\nThe Daily Poster has found that when Harris was California's attorney general, she did not investigate the fatal shootings of two unarmed men by the same Anaheim police officer less than a year apart, despite calls from the city's mayor and members of the public following the second. Instead, she left the task up to the Orange County District Attorney's office, which was embroiled in a misconduct scandal and notorious for letting officers off the hook.\n\nAt the time, Harris suggested her office would review the findings of the district attorney's office, but the Daily Poster found no evidence that a serious review of the DA report ever took place. The Anaheim police officer, Nick Bennallack, remained on the force for years - and went on to kill again.\n\nThe City of Anaheim has already had to spend several hundred thousand dollars in lawsuit payouts over Bennallack's conduct; a civil rights lawsuit filed late last year over his latest killing is still ongoing.\n\nHarris has enjoyed a trailblazing career in politics. In January, the Los Angeles Times even started a beat dedicated to her historic rise to the White House. The fifty-six-year-old politician of Jamaican and South Asian descent has already written herself into the history books as the first woman to serve as San Francisco district attorney, California attorney general, and now vice president of the United States. She was also the first black person to have represented California in the US Senate. Now, she is one heartbeat away from the presidency and could be a serious future presidential contender, too.\n\nBut as remarkable as Harris's career is, it has not been without controversy. During her 2020 presidential run, Harris attempted to paint herself as a progressive prosecutor, but critics pointed out that she had embraced the mantle of California's \"top cop\" and done little as DA or attorney general to challenge law enforcement power structures, instead pursuing low-level offenses like truancy and drug possession .\n\nHer reluctance to push for more police accountability appears to have extended to failing to investigate an officer with a troubling record at a time when doing so could have prevented killings down the line.\n\n\"She neglected a lot of cases in California,\" says Genevieve Huizar, the mother of Manuel Angel Diaz, one of the men subsequently killed by Bennallack. \"Why she didn't get involved in these shootings, I don't know.\"\n\nThe first unarmed man in Anaheim that Officer Bennallack killed was Filipino-American father Bernie Villegas.\n\nVillegas had been shooting a Red Ryder Daisy BB rifle in the parking lot of his West Ball Road apartment complex with a friend on January 7, 2012. He had bought the toy as a present for his fourteen-year-old son, who was inside. A neighbor had called the police, warning about a suspected drug dealer loitering with a gun. Bennallack was one of the responding officers. When they arrived, they found Villegas leaning against the gun, holding it from the barrel.\n\nThe officers ordered him to show his hands. Villegas complied but did not let go of the barrel of the BB gun. Bennallack unloaded five rounds without warning . Officers would say they thought the toy was a shotgun.\n\nSeven months later, Bennallack killed again.\n\nHe and another officer were on patrol in Anaheim near the 700 block of North Anna Drive on July 21, 2012, when they found twenty-five-year-old Manuel Diaz leaning into a car window in an alleyway. Bennallack did not recognize Diaz , court records say.\n\nThe officers ordered everyone to stop what they were doing, but Diaz fled. The officers would later say they suspected criminal activity based on his baggy clothes, location, and behavior. Bennallack gave chase briefly before drawing his service weapon and shooting Diaz twice - once in the buttock, once in the back of the head - outside a nearby apartment complex. Video shows that as the young man lay dying on the ground, Bennallack applied handcuffs rather than administer aid. Diaz later died at the hospital.\n\nThe Orange County DA noted in its report that Diaz was a \"self-admitted\" gang member with prior gun and drug convictions, and had drugs in his system at the time, but the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals would later decide in a lawsuit on the matter that such information had \"marginal, if any\" relevance to liability and damages in the case.\n\nThe report also noted that the incident occurred in a so-called \"Safety Zone.\" The City of Anaheim was in the controversial practice of issuing \"gang injunctions,\" designating whole blocks as quarantine zones where even mundane activities were restricted. Officers were also empowered to add names to a database of supposed gang members without oversight. Civil liberties advocates pointed out that removing names from that list was nearly impossible and that black youth, in particular, were targeted.\n\nHuizar, Diaz's mother, described the hole his death left in her family, noting it stripped her of her youngest child and only son. She cannot talk about what happened without tears nine years later.\n\n\"He's laying on the ground and they turn him over with a bullet in his head and they handcuff him,\" she says.\n\nBennallack would later claim that he saw Diaz reaching for his waistband and throwing an object nearby during the chase that he thought had been a gun. The only item found near the scene was a cell phone. The next day, another Latino man, Joel Acevedo, was fatally shot by Anaheim police. The two killings were the latest in a string of fatalities by police in Anaheim, a city probably best known as the home of Disneyland. The deaths sparked widespread protests and riots in the city, some of which were met with force by law enforcement.\n\nIn the wake of the turmoil, Bennellack earned a pejorative nickname: \" Backshot .\"\n\nIn 2011, Harris became California's attorney general. She'd run on her bonafides as San Francisco district attorney prosecuting violent crimes and crimes against children, and focused on her past as the daughter of two civil rights activists who \"spent full-time marching and shouting about this thing we call justice.\" Harris would tell reporters that the heroes for her of the civil rights era were the lawyers.\n\nHarris had a chance to seek justice the next year.\n\nThe July 2012 shootings and subsequent unrest sparked a scramble for accountability in Anaheim. While the Office of the Orange County District Attorney would investigate the incidents, as was routine for police shootings, the Anaheim city council asked the Office of the US Attorney and the FBI to conduct independent investigations into the matter and hired the Office of Independent Review (OIR), a contractor that looks into police departments, to examine its police force.\n\nAnaheim mayor Tom Tait also asked Harris's office to conduct an independent review of the most recent two shootings. At the time, Tait told the press , \"Whatever the truth is, we will own it.\" The national Latino advocacy group Presente.org echoed Tait's appeal to Harris in a petition with more than seventeen thousand digital signatures.\n\nTait and the public had valid reasons for asking Harris's office to get involved. In 2000, California became the first state to grant its attorney general the authority to intervene in law enforcement misconduct cases. Legal experts say such interventions can offer a greater level of scrutiny and objectivity than other kinds of police audits.\n\nReviews by local district attorneys are often seen as unreliable since the attorneys work closely with law enforcement in ways that could create conflicts of interest. And while the Department of Justice has authority under the 1994 crime bill to conduct reviews of potential systemic police abuses, such investigations have limitations . The agency lacks the power to subpoena internal documents from local police departments and has been hobbled by chronic underfunding.\n\nCalls mounted, therefore, for Harris to investigate. Protesters gathered outside her Sacramento office. Huizar was among them, demanding justice for her son.\n\nAt first, the efforts appeared successful. In July 2012, four days after Tait's request, the mayor told the Orange County Register that the attorney general had agreed to investigate the shootings.\n\nBy October, however, Harris's office suggested the investigation might not happen.\n\n\"We are advised that the Orange County District Attorney's office is conducting a thorough examination into all of these incidents. Once that review is completed we can best evaluate what if any involvement by this office is appropriate,\" her office's press secretary Lynda Gledhill said .\n\nSpeaking to the New York Times in August 2020, Tait recalled receiving a phone call from Harris two days after he asked her to intervene, denying his request.\n\nIn March 2013, the district attorney's office released its report on the shootings, finding Bennallack was justified in shooting Diaz.\n\nEvidently, Harris's office was satisfied with the DA's findings. A Daily Poster public records request with the California Office of the Attorney General turned up no records of any investigations or findings related to the Villegas, Diaz, or Acevedo shootings. Nor did it turn up any communications related to the shootings between the attorney general's office and the Anaheim Police Department, the local DA, or the Office of the US Attorney.\n\nAdditionally, a public records request to the Orange County DA's office yielded no records of communications between them and Harris's office.\n\nSimilarly, the FBI declined to conduct a full investigation into the shootings, telling OC Weekly that it planned on merely reviewing the DA's report. The Daily Poster 's public records request to the DA turned up no records of communications with the Office of the US Attorney over the killings.\n\nThe OIR's report , released in 2015, recommended several changes to Anaheim Police Department policy, including shortening the forty-eight-hour waiting period to interview officers after shootings and updating rules regarding police pursuits.\n\nDiaz's family, meanwhile, filed a lawsuit against the city and the police department over his shooting. After the DA's office released its report allowing Bennallack to remain on the force, the attorney representing the family, Dana Douglas, told reporters she believed the officer would likely repeat his behavior.\n\n\"Unfortunately someone like Nick Bennallack, with a nervous disposition and a quick trigger finger, can get onto the Anaheim Police Department and nothing happens, said Douglas. \"He's out there today ready to shoot a third victim.\"\n\nTwo years after the Diaz killing, Bennallack, who had been moved to the SWAT team, was involved in a third fatal police shooting. He was of five officers who shot and killed Steen Thomas Parker. Parker was white and engaged in a firefight with officers. Parker had previously been arrested for rape , according to the Orange County DA report, which cleared Bennallack and his colleagues of any wrongdoing in the shooting.\n\nIn April 2019, after Harris had moved from attorney general to US senator, Bennallack fatally shot another unarmed Latino man. Thirty-year-old father Daniel Ramirez III had been at a garage where Irvine police were attempting to serve a search warrant for theft of guitars and amplifiers from a vehicle. The situation had led Ramirez and another man to barricade themselves in an attic. That's where they were when members of the Anaheim SWAT team - including Bennallack - arrived.\n\nBody cam footage released by the Orange County DA shows that Ramirez and the other man initially refused to come down while officers fired pepper balls into the attic. The men threatened to shoot back, but soon Ramirez's colleague surrendered to police without incident.\n\nAfter a twelve-minute standoff, Ramirez relented and descended from the attic, pleading with the officers not to shoot him. While he was out of view of the officers' body cameras, according to the district attorney's later review of the incident, Ramirez then refused to surrender and instead turned to run deeper into the garage. At that point, an officer fired a nonlethal round that struck Ramirez in the right lower back. In the footage, Ramirez is heard screaming in pain. Seconds later, Bennallack is seen firing four live rounds in rapid succession. After a brief pause, he fired a fifth time.\n\nParamedics attempted to revive Ramirez, but could not save him. He was unarmed, although two loaded weapons were found elsewhere in the garage according to the Orange County DA.\n\nFor Ramirez's younger stepbrother Levi - who asked to be identified as Levi Ramirez Dixon because \"he's my step-brother but he feels like blood\" - the killing is raw and unforgivable.\n\n\"Everyone in our family is missing a part of their heart because they've lost Daniel,\" he says.\n\nDixon acknowledges that Ramirez struggled as he got older, and had done time in jail. He says he once saw Ramirez with a gun, but never thought of him as dangerous. He says Ramirez loved his daughter \"more than anything,\" and the six-year-old girl has taken the loss of her father hard.\n\nLast June, Dixon and his family marched on the Anaheim Police Department. Dixon had hoped to talk to Bennallack, but when they arrived, the building was barricaded and nobody came outside.\n\n\"It was almost like a second death,\" he says.\n\nDixon says he has lost complete faith in law enforcement and does not want to call the police for help again.\n\nOnce again, the Orange County DA's office cleared Bennallack for killing Ramirez. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, who succeeded Harris and is now Biden's nominee for Health and Human Services secretary, did not appear to investigate the matter, as his office told the Daily Poster it had no records regarding any investigation.\n\nIn each of Bennallack's three killings of unarmed individuals over eight years, the local district attorney's office cleared him of all wrongdoing, and the attorney general's office never once got involved.\n\nWhen state legislation came up in 2014 that would have required the attorney general's office to conduct independent investigations into police shootings, Harris spoke out against the bill on the grounds that it took prosecutorial power away from local district attorney offices.\n\n\"I don't think it would be good public policy to take the discretion from elected district attorneys,\" she said .\n\nBut in the case of Orange County, the district attorney's office might not have deserved Harris's deference.\n\nAt the time, the office was helmed by Tony Rackauckas , who was described in 2018 by ACLU attorney Brendan Hamme as \"one of the most scandal-ridden and criticized government figures in California.\"\n\nThose scandals included a systematic jailhouse snitch scheme and the practice of routinely withholding evidence from defense attorneys.\n\nThe jailhouse-snitch revelations came to light in 2011, causing a judge to recuse the entire DA's office from the death penalty case of Scott Dekraai, the man behind Orange County's worst mass shooting - a decision Harris's office unsuccessfully appealed . As OC Weekly put it , the scandal led to at least twenty felony cases in the office being tainted by the hint of corruption. Harris's office would eventually launch a probe into the scandal in 2015. That ended four years later under Becerra without explanation .\n\nOne of the figures at the center of the affair, Dan Wagner, was the same assistant district attorney who twice helped clear Bennallack of wrongdoing, first by signing off on the Villegas shooting report , then by authoring the subsequent Diaz shooting report . In December 2019 , Wagner left the DA's office amid further scandal. Internal whistleblower complaints alleged he had engaged in covering up misconduct .\n\nThe 2019 shooting report clearing Bennallack in the death of Ramirez fell to a different assistant district attorney: Andrew Bugman. He, too, has been caught up in the controversy. Bugman defended the concealment of impeachment materials related to the jailhouse-snitch scandal by Rackauckus's successor, DA Todd Spitzer.\n\nIn 2017, a jury awarded Diaz's family $200,000 over his death, finding that Bennallack had used excessive force in the shooting. A year later, however, in a lawsuit brought by the family of the first man Bennallack killed, Bernie Villegas, a jury found in favor of the police.\n\nFederico Sayre, the attorney who represented Villegas's family in that case, told the Daily Poster that the Orange County DA's office \"always\" clears police officers in shootings and that it's very difficult to get a jury to rule in favor of victims' families.\n\nA review by the Daily Poster of 253 incident reports listed on the Orange County DA's website in which someone was either shot by police or died while in police custody between January 2010 and March 2020 found that prosecutors cleared the law enforcement personnel involved every time.\n\nBennallack is no longer employed by the City of Anaheim, according to Sgt Shane Carringer. Carringer said he could not provide other information about Bennallack, but noted the separation occurred months ago.\n\n\"I don't think it's quite been a year,\" Carringer said.\n\nMoving forward, all incidents similar to those in which Bennallack had been involved will be investigated by the state's top prosecutor. In September 2020, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill into law requiring the state attorney general to investigate all fatal police shootings of unarmed individuals.\n\nBecerra, like his predecessor Harris, opposed the idea. He called an early version of the bill \"untenable and unreasonable\" due to the monetary cost to his office.\n\nThe same month the bill was signed, Ramirez's family filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against Bennallack, the City of Anaheim, and the City of Irvine over his death. Dale Galipo, the lawyer behind the case, was the same civil rights attorney who represented Diaz's family.\n\nResponding to an inquiry whether or not he felt the state's justice system had failed Diaz and Ramirez, Galipo gave a one-word answer: \"Yes.\"\n\nHuizar, Diaz's mother, works to find strength in family and religion. But she says she will bear the pain of losing her son for the rest of her life.\n\n\"You kinda have to live life without him, but he was a really good son,\" she says, her voice breaking. \"He was just the light of our family.\"\n\nHuizar usually avoids politics and never considered Harris particularly responsible for her family's pain. But given Harris's lack of response to her son's killing when she was attorney general, the vice president's recent posturing as an advocate for police accountability strikes her as hypocritical.\n\nHarris, she says, \"should have done a better job.\"\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Daily Poster , here .\n\nWalker Bragman is a journalist and JD whose work has been featured in Paste Magazine , the Intercept , HuffPost , the Independent , Salon , Truthout , and the Hill .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

The show vividly captured the failures of American policing that would animate the George Floyd protests 20 years later.\n\nStill from The Shield . (FX)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAmericans love cop shows. In fact, about 20 percent of all scripted network TV shows are about law enforcement. And while most of these programs follow the same tired premise of honorable characters doing their best to catch the bad guys while balancing the stressors of family life, there is one cop show that stands out from the rest.\n\nOriginally aired in 2002, FX's The Shield turned the boilerplate cop show on its head. Unlike the prestige television show The Wire, a more pensive and high-brow offering that premiered the same year on HBO, The Shield followed the format of shows like Law & Order and NCIS - except instead of unquestioningly valorizing police work, it centered on Detective Vic Mackey and his corrupt, anti-gang \"Strike Team\" as they rampaged through the streets of Los Angeles. What made The Shield different from its contemporaries was its explicit focus on the dark side of policing. Throughout the show, Mackey breaks every law on the books, including but not limited to drug dealing, torture, planting evidence, illegal searches and seizures, and murder.\n\nThough twenty years old, the Emmy-winning series shines a light on two facets of modern America that still plague the country today: our punitive and ineffective policing model, and the authoritarian hysteria of the \"war on terror.\"\n\nThe Shield was inspired by the illicit actions creator Shawn Ryan saw while shadowing the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) for his much rosier cop show, Nash Bridges. \"What I saw [during the ride-alongs] was much darker,\" Ryan told Entertainment Weekly in 2017.\n\nRyan's pilot script was based on the Rampart scandal , which the Los Angeles Times called \"the worst corruption scandal in L.A.P.D. history.\" In September of 1999, Officer Rafael Pérez was caught stealing a million dollars of cocaine from an evidence locker. He agreed to a plea deal and began to reveal widespread corruption throughout the department. When the dust settled, Pérez had fingered close to seventy police officers in crimes such as bogus arrests, false confessions, perjured testimony, the planting of evidence, and more. According to Pérez, these practices were most frequent among the city's anti-gang units, the inspiration for Mackey's Strike Team.\n\nMembers of the Strike Team torture suspects, plant evidence, deal drugs, are openly racist, have sex with suspects, and steal with absolute impunity. The Shield's title card - the theme song \"Just Another Day\" playing over an image of a fractured police badge - leaves little room for interpretation. The show's perspective is that violent and often extralegal control of Los Angeles's minority and poor neighborhoods is routine for the officers of the LAPD. The show's second episode, titled \"Our Gang,\" poses a side-by-side comparison of the funerals of a gang member and a police officer, drawing explicit parallels between the lawbreaking groups.\n\nIn addition to portraying flagrant disregard for civil liberties and procedural justice, The Shield illustrates the inherent inability of American policing to solve the problems it claims to - indeed, how the cops often make things worse. In one of the most memorable scenes of the show, the new police captain gives a speech to her officers, stating: \"We can't solve poverty, we can't solve addiction. But we can distinguish between the criminals and the citizens.\" Such words echo the viewpoint of activists critical of policing, who have long claimed that armed police are unable to solve the actual underlying problems that cause crime.\n\nNot long after this speech, The Shield shows officers seizing cars and houses from suspected (but unconvicted) criminals to fund the hiring of more cops and the purchase of military-grade weaponry for Mackey's Strike Team. When a black officer protests that taking a single mother's house will put her and her children onto the street where they are destined for a life of crime in order to survive, the captain dismisses him, saying, \"I don't care what skin color you are. But you're either blue or you're out.\"\n\nThe Shield also captures the widespread fear of the post-9/11 years, and demonstrated how it was weaponized by the state both at home and abroad. Though it is exclusively set in Los Angeles, there's no shortage of references to the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. In a later season, the Strike Team gains a member nicknamed \"Army,\" who teaches the others abusive tactics he learned \"going door to door in Baghdad.\"\n\nThe pilot episode shows Mackey torturing a suspect in an interrogation room under the watch of his captain. It only escalates from there, as he burns, beats, and threatens to send suspects to prisons where they will be raped and killed by other inmates. He even has a secret remote torture site where victims are suspended from chains, an image strikingly similar to those seen in the American torture camps at Abu Ghraib and Guantanamo Bay.\n\nOn this point, however, The Shield errs. The portrayal is stomach-turning, but the problem is that in the world of the show - unlike in real life, where confessions extracted under torture are often false - it actually works. Like many other American films and series of the time, it seems to suggest to America that torture, while perhaps immoral, is at least a viable method for \"getting the bad guys,\" whether they're low-level drug dealers or high-level al-Qaeda operatives.\n\nNevertheless, The Shield captures the hysteria of the war on terror period, showing how rational thinking and proportionate responses were dismissed in favor of groupthink and maximal force. In one episode, a minor gang member claims affiliation with al-Qaeda, bringing the Department of Homeland Security on to the case, demonstrating the broad reach of the post-9/11 anti-terror apparatus.\n\nAgain, however, the show reveals its limitations. In the final seasons, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) makes an appearance as the cutting-edge face of federal law enforcement, offering an alternative to the brutal tactics of the LAPD. One wonders whether the writers would have shaped that storyline the same way today, after mass protests against ICE have convinced many that it's not a necessary agency, but is instead a heavy-handed expression of American xenophobia and anti-immigrant paranoia.\n\nIt's not clear that Ryan himself really understands the implications of The Shield. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly , Ryan claimed that \"98 percent of the time Mackey is doing the right thing.\" This will come as a surprise to anyone who watches the show, as 98 percent of every episode consists of Mackey's Strike Team breaking the law. In other interviews, it seems that Ryan was setting out to dramatize the warts on an otherwise noble project to \"protect and serve.\"\n\nBut whatever its creator's own intentions, The Shield vividly captured the depravity and brokenness of American policing. In the aftermath of the George Floyd protests of 2020, it looks less like a case for tossing bad apples than a condemnation of the entire enterprise.\n\nJoe Mayall is a writer from Denver, Colorado.

While two of the officers managed to wrestle the other person to the ground after she picked up a police baton, Robinet - who was by then lying on his back and being punched by officers near his tent where the initial altercation began - is shot seconds after someone is heard shouting, \"Drop the gun!\" No gun was recovered.\n\nAlready LAPD officials are making the claim that Robinet \"reached for the officer's gun.\" However, witnesses are challenging that familiar narrative, arguing that the incident, which the LAPD says was initiated because of a robbery/battery call, could have been handled differently.\n\n\"He [did not] have [a] weapon - they just shot him,\" Yolanda Young, a witness to the killing, told FOX 11. \"They could have wrestled him down and took him to jail, but they shot him five times.\"\n\nRobinet, who residents say told them that before settling on Skid Row he had been released from a psychiatric facility after ten years, was frequently harassed and told to move his possessions.\n\nCeola Waddell, another witness, told the Los Angeles Times that \"Africa\" would sit in the same spot \"every day.\" He also said that cops began the confrontation with the homeless man by shaking his tent \"like a rag doll\" while he was still inside.\n\nLAPD harassment of Skid Row's homeless population, which includes excessive ticketing, impounding of property, and sometimes destruction of belongings, is well documented and known to both residents and local activists. The Los Angeles Community Action Network (LA CAN) has sued the city for \"unlawful seizure of property\" and has fought back against gentrifying efforts, which have accelerated since the 2009 opening of the LA Live entertainment complex and the construction of the Staples Center, both located near Skid Row.\n\nThe Safer Cities Initiative (SCI) task force, established in 2006 while current New York Police Deartpment Commissioner William Bratton was LAPD chief, is another version of the discredited and racist law enforcement pseudo-science known as the \"broken windows\" theory, whereby cops come down with an iron fist on minor violations, in order to prevent more serious crimes. Needless to say, SCI has benefited private developers while criminalizing the area's homeless population.\n\nThe constant harassment of LA's homeless population, along with the killing of Robinet, isn't happening in a vacuum. The LA City Council is considering anti-vagrancy laws and ordinances, which are supposed to address the \"storage of personal property in public places.\" One proposed ordinance is so vague and far-reaching that even the cop-friendly Los Angeles Times opposes it.\n\nAs far as California - home to the nation's largest homeless population - criminalizing homelessness isn't exclusive to LA. A recent study released by the Berkeley Law School's Policy Advocate Clinic examined municipal codes in fifty-eight cities throughout the state and found that among other goals, the laws had the effect of making the unhoused \"someone else's problem.\"\n\nOver-policing and criminalizing the unhoused, many of whom suffer from mental illness, is a classic, misguided case of attacking the symptoms while ignoring the root socioeconomic causes. Instead of cities such as LA diverting and earmarking disproportionate amounts of funds to further militarize the police, these resources would be better spent on constructing mental health facilities, subsidized housing, and a myriad of other social welfare programs.\n\nNothing less than a mass movement, guided by self-mobilization and organization along with the understanding that the capitalist system lies at the heart of systemic problems like police terror and homelessness and must be uprooted, will stop the killings of people like Robinet.\n\nMichael Brown is a Socialist Worker contributor.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Cities are pledging to shift money from cops to public services, violent officers are being disciplined and fired, and a wave of left victories came in last week's primaries.\n\nProtesters march on Hiawatha Avenue while decrying the killing of George Floyd on May 26, 2020 in Minneapolis, Minnesota.\nStephen Maturen / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWelcome to the uprising. We're beginning to learn that we can take on the ruling class - and its deranged, murderous servants - and win.\n\nProtest doesn't accomplish much if you only do it once or twice a year. That's why, in ordinary times, most people don't bother. But these are not ordinary times. All over the country people have been flooding the streets, every day and night for some two weeks, protesting the racist murder of George Floyd by a Minneapolis police officer. In the past, protests would have raged for a few days, and most often, homicidal police officers would not only have walked free, but kept their jobs.\n\nBut this isn't the past. Four officers have been fired and charged in Floyd's murder. An astonishing number of police officers have been disciplined, fired and even charged in violence against protesters. In Louisville, where police shot and killed a black man over a curfew violation on June 1, the police chief has been fired.\n\nOnce, each of these triumphs might have been big news. But the movement isn't satisfied, and the preliminary victories haven't even stopped there. Statues beloved by racists, honoring racists - Frank Rizzo in Philadelphia, Confederates throughout the South - are coming down. New York City ended its unjust and authoritarian curfew, which was only an excuse to arrest peaceful protesters at the expense of public health. The New York and Minneapolis City Councils have banned the use of chokeholds. As many also protested the death of Breonna Taylor, a Louisville EMT who was murdered by police in her own home last March, cities have also been abolishing \"no knock\" warrants.\n\nInstitutions are quickly changing, too, as Americans begin to understand the extent to which the working class, especially blacks, immigrants and young people, are grotesquely overpoliced. Portland and Minneapolis are ending the use of police officers in public schools. The Minneapolis Parks and Recreation Department also ended its relationship with the police department. Even more surprisingly, calls to abolish and defund the police are rapidly gaining traction. The Minneapolis City Council seems ready to disband its police department. Los Angeles is already making cuts to its police budget to fund other social needs. Until now, New York City's truculent mayor has genuflected pathetically to a police department that despises him. He has been like a bullied kid trying to be liked by a gang of sadists who will only bully him more. Yet even he, faced with this uprising, has agreed to cut the police budget and divert the money into youth services.\n\nOf course, many details of these plans remain murky, and every reform - especially at the national level - will be vigorously contested by the police unions, President Trump, and many Democrats, but it is astonishing for the movement to have come so far after not even two weeks of protest.\n\nWe are winning electoral victories, too. Not long ago, if even one socialist ran for City Council and beat the machine, we'd be elated. That did happen last week: Jeneese Lewis George, in Washington, DC, won decisively after her opponent sent out flyers \"warning\" that she'd fire police - perhaps voters liked the sound of that! But she wasn't alone. Last week's primaries were remarkable. In Philadelphia, Nikil Saval, a Democratic Socialists of America (DSA)-backed writer who supported decriminalizing sex work and ending stop and frisk, also decisively won his primary for the state senate, beating an incumbent, while another DSA candidate, Rick Krajewski, is ahead at the time of this writing, with more absentee ballots to count. DSA member and Our Revolution-backed Summer Lee, the first black woman to represent Southwestern Pennsylvania in the state senate, won reelection with 75 percent of the vote. Six Our Revolution-backed Berniecrats won primaries in Montana. Even the Republican primaries did not fail to spark joy: racist Iowa Republican Congressman Steve King lost his seat.\n\nWe continue to fill the streets, and act ungovernably, while also ejecting those governing who have failed the people. We're also calling our friends and neighbors, telling them how to vote by mail, and explaining why they should vote for socialists and other left-wing candidates. We are building our institutions: DSA has now reached over 70,000 members.\n\nAnd we're just getting started. This movement will take specific forms and directions we couldn't have predicted and, sometimes, wouldn't have chosen; perhaps some demands haven't even been part of our imaginary because they weren't possible in our youth, or even last month. Many new to the movement will have to try new things that are uncomfortable. All of us are having to quickly acquire skills we don't yet have. It's time to pay close attention, listen carefully, and ask what we can do to help. We must also claim and celebrate every win.\n\nLiza Featherstone is a columnist for Jacobin , a freelance journalist, and the author of Selling Women Short: The Landmark Battle for Workers' Rights at Wal-Mart .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

But powerful police unions have closed ranks behind the killer, in a backlash that shows French cops' refusal to accept even basic accountability.\n\nFrench riot police officers stand guard next to a burned-out trash bin during a demonstration against police in Marseille, southern France on July 1, 2023. (Clement Mahoudeau / AFP via Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThis Tuesday, Nahel, a seventeen-year-old of Franco-Algerian origin, was shot and killed by a police officer during a traffic stop in the Paris suburb of Nanterre. The young man's death - and footage of the scene that looks to many like an execution - has set off a powder keg nationwide. For the last few days, major urban areas and small regional cities alike have seen a wave of protests, rioting, and looting. Many commentators are comparing the events to the 2005 uprising that followed the death of two men of color as they were chased by police north of Paris. On Thursday, thousands attended a march in Nanterre alongside Nahel's family and anti-police violence activists. As of Saturday, upward of two thousand people have been arrested, with hundreds of police officers injured in the clashes.\n\nKicked off by Nahel's killing, this has morphed into a revolt against policing and its role in the broader exclusion faced by minorities in France. It's feeding off the accumulated experience of many forms of harassment and daily violence by the police, from cheap verbal abuse (of which just about everyone I spoke to at Thursday's march seemed to have a story) to the industrialized use of minor-offense fines against working-class communities of color. France's strict laws regulating statistics make it very difficult to collect concrete information on the effects of racism. But a 2017 report from France's Rights Defender, a public watchdog, suggests that young men perceived as black or Arab are twenty times more likely to be stopped for an ID check than French people perceived as white.\n\nThese are the facts. Yet it's difficult to get past the impression that France is woefully ill-equipped for confronting the death of a young man like Nahel - or the unavoidably political meaning of the revolt that has resulted from it.\n\nQuick to condemn the actions of the officers caught on videotape in the hope of calming tensions, Emmanuel Macron and his government have just as rapidly acceded to the Right's calls for swift clampdown. Upward of forty-five thousand police officers were deployed across France on the night of June 30 to July 1, and the interior ministry is starting to deploy forces trained to engage with anti-terrorist interventions. Some of these units have been seen wielding live-action weapons like shotguns.\n\nThe government has so far resisted these calls, but Marine Le Pen is calling for a nationwide state of emergency. This would effectively ban protests and gatherings and authorize measures like curfews, stay-at-home orders, and special detentions of individuals. In certain suburbs, curfews have already been put in place, while parts of the transport network in the Paris area have been closed earlier in the evening than usual.\n\nThere's nothing surprising about intolerance for rioting, of course. But what's revealing is the speed with which a social revolt has been buried beneath the trappings and rhetoric of another right-wing civilizational battle. Macron has spoken of the nefarious effects of violent video games.\n\nThere's also a second force at play: France's powerful and restless police unions, who have turned this crisis into a test of loyalty for Macron and his government. After footage of Nahel's killing contradicted initial claims of self-defense by the officer who fired the lethal shot, police unions were up in arms over the critical statements coming from Macron and his ministers.\n\n\"Our colleague was strung up to the whipping post in order to buy peace and calm rioters who are attacking the republic,\" Davido Reverdy of the National Police Alliance union told Le Monde . He also criticized the fact that the officer was detained, and the announcement by prosecutors that he had been placed under investigation for homicide.\n\nBut this dissent radically escalated on June 30. On the eve of the fourth night of action, the National Police Alliance and the National Union of Autonomous Trade Unions (UNSA) released an inflammatory press statement threatening the \"wild hordes\" and \"pests\" taking to the streets - and an unconcealed warning to government officials.\n\n\"All means need to be deployed to restore the rule of law as quickly as possible,\" the two unions declare:\n\nNational Police Alliance and UNSA Police assume their responsibilities and want to alert the Government that once this is behind us, we will be mobilized and that without concrete measures of legal protection for the Police Officer, an appropriate penal response, and consequential resources, Police Officers will be the judge of the level of consideration that ought to be given in return.\"\n\nSome elements of this are very cryptic - others less so. \"Today, the police are engaged in combat because we are at war,\" the communiqué concludes. \"Tomorrow, we'll be in resistance and the government needs to be aware of that.\"\n\nAre the police unions demanding that the government bury any criminal charges against the officer who shot Nahel? Are they claiming the right to use forms of lethal force beyond the tear gas, rubber bullets , and other forms of officially nonlethal dissuasion usually deployed?\n\nThe two organizations have walked back on their claims, suggesting that it has been blown out of proportion, but critics on the Left have read in this bombastic message a shot at the justice system and France's elected government. But for now, Macron and Interior Minister Gérald Darmanin have sought to downplay it all, dependent as they are on these forces to get through the coming days and weeks. \"I'm not here to squabble,\" Darmanin said on TF1 in response to a question about the open letter. \"These are not my words.\"\n\nBut these are not the isolated ramblings of a fringe faction within the police ranks. Union elections held in late 2022 had the bloc formed between the National Police Alliance and UNSA Police emerging as leading representatives of a profession that boasts a massive, 90 percent unionization rate.\n\nAnd neither is it the first example of police restlessness. In May 2021, France's police unions organized a large rally in front of the National Assembly in Paris, demanding more resources for the police forces and an end to what they deemed the laxity of the justice system. \"The police's problem is with the justice system,\" said National Police Alliance secretary Fabien Vanhemelryck before the thousands of officers and supporters at the rally. During the 2022 election season, the unions were behind a push to consecrate a presumption of \"legitimate self-defense\" for officers who make use of force. When Macron deigned to speak of the problem of racism and violence in French policing in late 2020, they called for a boycott of ID checks and searches .\n\nPart of what's driving today's revolt is the outsized role that the police forces have acquired in French life. This addiction took root well before the current presidency, but Macron has come to depend on it more than perhaps any of his predecessors. And the horrifying irony now is that he's falling back on forces openly calling to warp the separation of powers and act over the heads of elected officials.

It's a point George Washington University extremism expert Luke Baumgartner made in recent comments to Military.com .\n\n\"Now that some of these folks and the more prominent leaders within the Oath Keepers and other militias are out and no longer under the jurisdiction of federal law enforcement, I think that it will probably provide them an opportunity to reconstitute,\" he said.\n\nSeveral active-duty members who stormed the Capitol have already returned to their military jobs . And others could join them. After all, Pete Hegseth, Trump's defense secretary nominee, has already signaled his disinterest in rooting out political extremism in the military. That could make it far easier for military members with fresh pardons to rejoin the ranks. And pardoned insurrectionists who were working as police officers when they stormed the Capitol could also return to their jobs now that their records have been expunged.\n\nEven if they don't want to take official government roles in the military or their local police force, pardoned rioters could just as easily join extremist militias, which have been known to recruit veterans and others with military experience .\n\nLast April, I wrote about the disturbing trend of Republican leaders looking to civilian-led militias to help with law enforcement, which I suspect will only ramp up in the months and years ahead.\n\nExtremism expert Timothy Snyder warned about this on Monday's episode of \"The Rachel Maddow Show.\" Snyder, who authored the book \"On Tyranny: Twenty Lessons from the Twentieth Century,\" said Trump's pardons may lead to some militia groups assuming pseudo-governmental roles to aid some of the Trump administration's policies, like immigration enforcement.\n\n\"The next step is that you're going to see, I'm afraid, these people be deputized for tasks like deportation. Or these people to be regularized - normalized - as part of the way we get used to violence being deployed in our country,\" he said. \"And then we're no longer pretending that we're a country of law.\"\n\nWe're already seeing militia groups prepare for the pseudo-governmental roles Snyder spoke of. In November, Wired reported that militia groups, including some with veterans as members, rushed to the border in anticipation of aiding Trump's mass deportation efforts. These are the kinds of groups that could seek to enlist pardoned Capitol rioters, many of whom bonded together in the so-called p atriot w ing of the jail in Washington, D.C., where they were held.\n\nWatch Snyder's warning below:\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

During the campaign, for example, he called for \"one real rough, nasty\" and \"violent day\" of police retaliation to eradicate crime \"immediately.\"\n\nTo that end, his Wednesday pardon of Metropolitan Police o fficers Terence Sutton and Andrew Zabavsky didn't garner the level of attention as Trump's Jan. 6 pardons or even his pardon of convicted drug dealer Ross Ulbricht - but it's arguably just as egregious and foreboding.\n\nAs NBC News reported :\n\nTrump granted clemency to Metropolitan Police Department Officer Terence Sutton, who was sentenced in September to more than five years in prison. He faced a District of Columbia charge of second-degree murder, and federal charges of conspiracy to obstruct and obstruction of justice in the October 2020 unauthorized pursuit that killed Karon Hylton-Brown, 20. Sutton was the first D.C. police officer to be convicted of murder for conduct while on duty. The same jury that found Sutton guilty also convicted Andrew Zabavsky, a lieutenant who supervised Sutton, of conspiracy to obstruct and obstruction of justice. Zabavsky was sentenced to four years in prison. He was not accused of the more serious charge of second-degree murder. Trump granted Zabavsky clemency.\n\nAs NBC News goes on to note, Trump claimed this deadly police chase involved the pursuit of an \"illegal\" immigrant, but Hylton's mom says he is an American citizen. So Trump appears to have made a knee-jerk assumption about the victim's citizenship to protect a convicted murderer and his accomplice.\n\nThe broader implications of these pardons seem dire. Trump has threatened to \"take over\" Washington, D.C., as president and run roughshod over local officials, based on dubious claims conservatives in Congress have used to portray Washington, D.C., as a den of crime due to local leadership's policies.\n\nThe pardons of Sutton and Zabavsky come mere days after Trump selected a former advocate for violent Jan. 6 insurrectionists, activist Ed Martin, to serve as the U.S. attorney to Washington, D.C., which would give Martin legal authority to prosecute local and federal crimes in the district. The pardons also send a message to police in the nation's capital that they can break the law and reasonably expect the president to come to their defense.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

The victim was not identified by name, and neither was his business partner, a woman who was identified only as unindicted co-conspirator 1, a \"wealthy Chinese national,\" the U.S. attorney's office said.\n\nSteven Arthur Lankford, 68, of Canyon Country, California; Glen Louis Cozart, 63, of Upland, California; Max Samuel Bennett Turbett, 39, of Australia, who is a United Kingdom citizen; and Matthew Phillip Hart, 41, of Australia, are charged in a superseding indictment with one count of conspiracy to commit extortion, one count of attempted extortion, one count of conspiracy against rights and one count of deprivation of rights under color of law, the office said.\n\nLankford is a retired Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy who stopped working for the agency in 2020 and owns a Santa Clarita-based process service company, Cozart is also a former county sheriff's deputy who owns a private investigation and security services company, Turbett is a former member of the British military who owns a private investigation and asset recovery business, and Hart is a former member of the Australian military who owns a management service business, prosecutors said.\n\nThe four defendants are scheduled to be arraigned Monday afternoon. Their attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n\"It is critical that we hold public officials, including law enforcement officers, to the same standards as the rest of us,\" U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said in the statement. \"It is unacceptable and a serious civil rights violation for a sworn police officer to take the law into his own hands and abuse the authority of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.\"\n\nIf convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for each extortion-related count and up to 10 years in federal prison for each count related to deprivation of rights, prosecutors said.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the victim and his business partner had a yearslong dispute over their ownership in the rubber chemical manufacturer. The disagreements led to at least three lawsuits in China and one in Atlanta, prosecutors said.\n\nIn December 2018, the unindicted co-conspirator allegedly contacted Turbett to help with her business dispute. She said the long and costly litigation had not been \"the smart way\" to handle her dispute and asked Turbett to find a different \"solution to finish the problem,\" prosecutors said. She promised Turbett that if he helped her, \"we can both retire,\" authorities said.\n\nTurbett and the unindicted co-conspirator drafted purported settlement agreements calling for victim 1 to transfer assets - including about $36,972,386 in cash, as well as lucrative shares in Jiangsu Sinorgchem - to the unindicted co-conspirator, prosecutors said.\n\nThat move led to a chain of events that led to the faux raid on June 17, 2019. Before then, prosecutors alleged, Turbett hired Cozart to find victim 1 and assemble a team to get victim 1's signature on the settlement agreements.\n\nCozart, in turn, hired Lankford, then a sheriff's deputy, who, against department policy, searched victim 1's name and date of birth in the National Crime Information Center database. Law enforcement databases are not to be used for personal reasons, prosecutors said.\n\nTurbett and Hart flew from Australia to Los Angeles, where they met with Cozart and Lankford to plan out the sham raid, prosecutors said.\n\nDuring the hoax raid, the defendants forced the victim and his family into one room, authorities said. Their phones were taken away, prosecutors said, and they were prevented for leaving for hours. The businessman was also choked, slammed into a wall and threatened with deportation for him and his wife, as well as possibility of permanently separating from their 4-year-old son, prosecutors said.\n\nThe victim then signed the settlement agreements, authorities said. Although the victim was told not to contact the police, when the defendants left, he reached out to Irvine police, prosecutors said.\n\nLankford falsely told police that he had been at the businessman's home for a legitimate law enforcement purpose, that the businessman consented to all parties being in his home and that no force was used, prosecutors said.\n\nBy November 2019, all defendants had been paid for their work coercing the businessman to sign the settlement, authorities said.\n\nThe unindicted co-conspirator paid Turbett's company about $419,813 and emailed Turbett to thank him for a \"very good job,\" prosecutors said.\n\nI am an award-winning journalist lucky enough to work in some of the greatest news towns in the country: Las Vegas, Boston, Long Island and New York City.

In a flurry of 11th-hour pardons, the then-president extended protections to a variety of people whom Biden feared might be targeted unfairly by his Republican successor.\n\nAmong the notable beneficiaries: the U.S. Capitol and D.C. Metropolitan police officers who testified before the bipartisan Select Committee to Investigate the Jan. 6th Attack on the United States Capitol, better known as the House Jan. 6 Committee. Biden similarly pardoned the panel's members and investigators.\n\nDonald Trump was not pleased. Just a couple of hours before his presidential inauguration, the Republican texted NBC News' Kristen Welker and described the pardons as \"disgraceful.\" He went on to suggest that those who received the pardons are undeserving because, as he texted, \"Many are guilty of MAJOR CRIMES!\"\n\nHours later, after delivering his unfortunate inaugural address, Trump delivered unscripted remarks for over a half-hour to the overflow crowd in Emancipation Hall, and again insisted that Jan. 6 committee members were \"very, very guilty of very, very bad crimes.\"\n\nAs Inauguration Day neared its end, Jan. 6 remained on the new president's mind, but in a very different context: Trump issued roughly 1,500 pardons and commuted the sentences of 14 of his supporters in connection with the insurrectionist attack on the Capitol. NBC News reported :\n\nTrump commuted the sentences of individuals associated with the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, who were convicted of seditious conspiracy. He then issued \"a full, complete and unconditional pardon to all other individuals convicted of offenses related to events that occurred at or near the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021,\" a category that included people who assaulted law enforcement officers.\n\nThe developments captured the state of American politics in a nutshell: The outgoing Democratic president pardoned Jan. 6 officers, while the incoming Republican president pardoned Jan. 6 criminals - including those who violently attacked law enforcement personnel.\n\nAfter signing the pardons and commutations, a reporter asked Trump about his decision. The newly inaugurated president claimed that \" outside agitators \" were involved in the assault. He added , \"And obviously the FBI was involved.\"\n\nIn other words, just hours into his new term, Trump agreed to let violent criminals who attacked their own country's seat of government back onto the streets, and then peddled discredited conspiracy theories and lies about the attack, as part of a larger effort to rewrite the story of what actually happened.\n\nBut let's also not brush past the new president's choice of words: In the morning and afternoon, when referring to those who investigated the Jan. 6 attack, Trump made absurd claims about \"MAJOR CRIMES\" and \"very, very bad crimes.\"\n\nOf course, by this reasoning, the Republican necessarily concluded that Jan. 6 criminals, including those who violently attacked the police, didn't commit \"major\" or \"very bad\" crimes.\n\nIt's going to be a long four years.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Aquilino Gonell, and current Metropolitan Police Department Officer Daniel \"Danny\" Hodges will be showing their support for Harris and presumptive vice presidential nominee Tim Walz in the coming days, joining up with the Democratic campaign for the first time since President Joe Biden dropped off the top of the ticket less than three weeks ago.\n\nDunn and Hodges will be in Michigan this week, visiting Grand Rapids, Flint and Detroit, and members of the group will travel elsewhere soon, including to North Carolina and Georgia, the Harris campaign told NBC News. During the trips, the Harris-Walz campaign said, the officers would meet with elected officials as well as community leaders to underscore what they call the urgent and immediate threat that Trump poses to democracy.\n\nDunn told NBC News that his message won't change since Biden dropped out, but that he's excited to be campaigning for Harris, who Dunn knows from his time on the job at the Capitol.\n\n\"She would always talk to us, her being a former prosecutor. She liked law enforcement, so she would always talk to the Capitol Police officers,\" Dunn said.\n\n\"Donald Trump, as a felon himself, is looking to pardon other felons,\" Dunn said, referring to Trump's conviction on 34 felony counts, for which he'll be sentenced as soon as Sept. 18. \"The fact that he's running against a prosecutor, that just couldn't be more storybook-ish.\"\n\nHodges, who will be back on duty after he returns to Washington after his Michigan trip, told NBC News that as a veteran was \"really cool\" to get a fellow former enlisted man like Walz on the ticket.\n\n\"I'm glad to see all this energy and positivity in the Democratic Party. I think that the Harris-Walz ticket is really strong,\" Hodges said. \"The stakes are incredibly high in this election, and Donald Trump is still an enemy to democracy and really to the United States, and our best chance for defeating him is voting for Harris and Walz.\"\n\nHodges, who was brutally assaulted inside the lower west tunnel of the Capitol complex on Jan. 6, called Harris and Walz \"powerful forces for good\" in the country, saying they would be the right people to vote for even if they weren't up against Trump. He said he was thankful for Biden's work and was glad to see that the transition between Biden and Harris was so smooth.\n\n\"I'm incredibly grateful for everything Biden has done for this country, and I know that it was not an easy decision for him to make,\" Hodges said. \"But it seems to be going well, and I sincerely hope that we can keep the energy going.\"\n\nTrump continues to cling to his false claims about the last election even as many of his own supporters who are facing criminal consequences for their actions on Jan. 6 have told federal judges they now feel like \"idiots\" who were duped and manipulated , regretting that they lacked the IQs or critical thinking skills to see through the lies.\n\nOthers still believe Trump's false claims - including a MAGA-hatted rioter who shouted \"Trump won!\" after he was sentenced for driving a stun gun into the neck of former D.C. Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone - and plenty more counting on Trump's election in November to avoid criminal culpability for their actions. Fanone's mother, too, was targeted in May after Fanone spoke outside Trump's New York trial, referring to the former president as \" an authoritarian \" with \" a violence fetish .\"\n\nDunn said that on prior trips, it was clear that even some local reporters he spoke with didn't have a full understanding of what happened on Jan. 6.\n\n\"Honestly, everybody doesn't know. We would assume that people know, living here, but in middle America, the average American, the regular voter, [it's about] getting them to understand that Donald Trump is a biggest threat to our democracy,\" Dunn said. \"People really don't understand what happened on that day, and to be able to tell them as a firsthand witness, it's kind of refreshing and it's encouraging that people are willing to be receptive.\"\n\nMore than 1,400 defendants have been charged in connection with the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol, and prosecutors have secured more than 1,000 convictions. Hundreds of defendants have received probationary sentences, but more than 500 have been sentenced to periods of incarceration that have ranged from a few days behind bars to 22 years in federal prison.\n\nI cover the Justice Department and federal law enforcement for NBC News.

One of the officers takes out a Taser and keeps the bystanders at bay while two other officers struggle with the man in between two parked vehicles. At one point, the man appears to swing at one of the officers.\n\nA New York Police Department spokesperson said that at about 9:34 p.m. on July 4, officers tried to stop a person from lighting fireworks and pointing them at apartment windows. According to police, the person fled and a 27-year-old man whom they identified as Shaquan Davis prevented police from pursuing the person by stepping in their path and pushing an officer. When the officer attempted to arrest Davis, police allege, he resisted arrest by \"pushing, shoving, wrestling, flailing his arms and punching the officer.\"\n\nDavis, who lives in Brooklyn, was arrested on charges of assault of a police officer, resisting arrest, obstructing governmental administration, assault with intent to cause physical injury, disorderly conduct and harassment. He is due in court on Oct. 7. His attorney, Jonathan Fink, said Davis was released on his own recognizance and denies any wrongdoing. His position is that he was assaulted by police, Fink said.\n\nA spokesperson for Adams referred NBC News to remarks he made on a radio show Wednesday morning.\n\nWhen asked about the video by radio host Tarsha \"Miss Jones\" Jones of 94.7 The Block's \"Jonesy in the Morning,\" Adams said he had seen it and that Police Commissioner Edward Caban had \"immediately placed\" the officers on a modified assignment. A modified assignment typically means an officer has been stripped of their firearm and assigned to a nonenforcement role.\n\n\"They're going to do a thorough investigation and find out what happened,\" Adams said. \"Everyone must be held accountable, because when you have the power and authority to take away someone's freedom, there's a lot of obligation and oversight that should come with that, and I have a lot of faith in Commissioner Caban because he came up through the ranks, and his dad was a strong advocate for diversity in the Police Department.\"\n\nHe added: \"We're going to look into this, and it's going to be investigated appropriately, and if those officers are found to have done something improper, they're going to be held accountable. We do not play the game. We're going to support our police, but our police must support the people that they are policing.\"\n\nJones asked him why, if police knew they were being recorded by bystanders, they felt \"so comfortable\" and \"so empowered\" to act as they did.\n\n\"That's a great question, and I think it's a combination of things. Adrenaline is real, people are caught up in the adrenaline, and that's what we're constantly trying to train people that you've got to take a step back,\" Adams said. \"You get caught up in the emotion of policing and you start just reacting and not thinking and you make those errors and mistakes.\"\n\nThe police department also faced criticism this week over a five-second video posted to X by a city councilman on Tuesday that showed an officer punching a man in the face while his hands were behind him and apparently restrained.\n\nThat video was recorded in Brooklyn. A police spokesperson said a man was stopped \"in regard to an amplified sound from a portable speaker\" at approximately 3:42 a.m. Friday. He was warned multiple times to turn off the speaker and did not comply, according to police. When officers confiscated the speaker, he became disorderly, stepped in front of them and attempted to grab it from them, police said. According to police, officers gave him multiple warnings to remain on the sidewalk and to stop interfering with police, and when they tried to arrest him, he resisted. The man in the video, Lamark Wyche, 44, of Brooklyn, was arrested on charges of obstructing governmental administration and unreasonable noise, which Wyche said have been dropped. His attorney did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nThe NYPD did not identify the officers in either video.\n\n\"Residents and community leaders in Coney have worked very hard over many years to build up trust and respect between the cops and the community,\" said Justin Brannan, the councilman who shared the video on X. \"Our community is pro-public safety. Punching people in the face when their hands are behind their backs isn't public safety and being anti-police brutality doesn't mean you are anti-cop. Incidents like this have a ripple effect and set everything back.\"\n\nA City Hall spokesperson said: \"We hold the men and women of the NYPD to the highest standards, and we are reviewing the incident.\"\n\nI am a national reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

He also said smaller departments, which account for 80% of agencies nationwide, were underrepresented in the responses PERF received.\n\nMany larger departments have increased officer pay or started offering incentives such as signing bonuses for experienced officers who are willing to transfer, something smaller departments can't really compete with. At least a dozen smaller departments have disbanded , leaving the municipalities they once served to rely on state or county help for policing.\n\nBut even some of the highest-paying large departments are still struggling to get new hires in the door.\n\n\"I don't think it's all about money. I think it's about the way people perceive their job and feel they are going to be supported,\" Wexler said. \"You have West Coast departments that are paying six figures, but still seeing major challenges in hiring.\"\n\nIn addition to pay and bonuses, many agencies are reexamining their application requirements and hiring processes.\n\nWexler believes some of those changes make sense, including allowing visible tattoos, reweighing the importance of past financial issues and processing applicants' background checks faster. But he cautioned that PERF does not support lowering standards for training or for applicants.\n\nMaria \"Maki\" Haberfeld, chair of the Department of Law, Police Science and Criminal Justice Administration at John Jay College of Criminal Justice, says departments have been too focused on officer numbers. She worries some are lowering education requirements and other standards to bolster numbers instead of trying to find the best people to police their communities.\n\n\"Policing is a real profession that requires more skills and more education than people can understand,\" she said. \"It's not about tattoos or running a mile in 15 minutes. It's really more about emotional intelligence, maturity and making those split-second decisions that don't use deadly force.\"\n\nHaberfeld also cautioned that any staffing gains made through incentives could easily be erased, especially as officers, including some in riot gear, have been seen breaking up protests against the Israel-Hamas war at universities across the country.\n\n\"In policing, it takes decades to move forward and a split second for the public attitude to deteriorate,\" she said.\n\nPERF's survey showed a more than a 20% drop in resignations overall, from a high of almost 6,500 in 2022 to fewer than 5,100 in 2023. They are still up over early pandemic levels in 2020, however, when a few more than 4,000 officers resigned across all responding departments.\n\nAs with the hiring increases, the rate of decrease in retirements tended to depend on the size of the departments. There were fewer retirements in 2023 than in 2019 at large departments, slightly more retirements at medium departments and elevated retirements at small departments. The survey found a steep drop in resignations at large agencies with 250 or more officers and medium-size agencies with between 50 and 249 officers.\n\nIn addition to pay and benefit increases, the improved retention can be partly attributed to a shift in how some public officials view their public safety departments, Wexler says.\n\n\"We went from having public discourse about defunding the police just a few years ago to public officials waking up to the fact their workforce is leaving,\" he said. \"I don't think there's any question that there has been a sea change among political leaders.\"\n\nI cover early morning U.S. breaking news, everything from severe weather to crime.

The bill that authorized the honor required lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the Capitol to approve the process - two Democratic sources and a Republican source said House Republicans are to blame for the hold-up.\n\nRepublicans on relevant committees responded to requests for comment on the delay by referring NBC News to the office of House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. A spokesman for Johnson said the office \"is working with [architect of the Capitol] to get the plaque mounted\" but did not provide a date for when the plaque would be installed or share a reason for the delay.\n\nIn response to questions about the delay, the architect of the Capitol's office said it is \"working with the Speaker's office to get the plaque mounted.\"\n\nPresumptive Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump is considering pardoning hundreds of Capitol rioters who took part in an attack that injured 140 police officers. Members of the House Republican majority continue to downplay the events of Jan. 6. Johnson, who played a key role in efforts to overturn the 2020 election results, introduced a Trump-backed bill last week that plays on much of the same misinformation about election security that led to the attack.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., a former member of the House Jan. 6 committee, asked Johnson in a new letter for information about the delay.\n\n\"I am deeply concerned about the delay in installing the plaque, which was mandated by law to be placed on the western side of the Capitol building by March 2023,\" Lofgren wrote in a letter to Johnson. \"As you may recall, the Fiscal Year 2022 omnibus, passed in March of 2022, included provisions requiring the Architect of the Capitol to obtain an honorific plaque listing the names of all officers from various law enforcement agencies who responded to the violence on January 6, 2021.\"\n\n\"It is deeply troubling that this memorial has not been installed, particularly considering the significance of honoring those who faced violence and assault while safeguarding our Capitol,\" she wrote.\n\nThe 2022 government funding bill, which became law on March 15, 2022, when Democrats still controlled the House, gave Congress one year to create and display a plaque honoring officers from the Washington Police Department, as well as officers from federal, state and other local law enforcement agencies and protective entities, \"who valiantly protected the United States Capitol, Members of Congress, and staff on January 6, 2021.\" A group of congressional offices was instructed to compile the names that should go on the plaque, including those offices of the top Republican and Democrat on the House Administration Committee, the Senate Rules Committee and the House and Senate Appropriations subcommittees that allocate money to the legislative branch. The architect of the Capitol was given the responsibility of obtaining the plaque and finding it a permanent home on the western front of the Capitol.\n\nMultiple people involved in the process could not say how much had been completed.\n\nSen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, questioned whether the delay can be chalked up to the slow pace at which the architect of the Capitol completes work on the Capitol grounds. Romney, who was sworn in to the Senate in 2019, cited a set of elevators in the Dirksen Senate Office Building that have \"been under repair now the entire time I've been here.\"\n\nThe office of the architect of the Capitol, which maintains and preserves the buildings and the grounds of the Capitol complex, has undergone turmoil in recent months after President Joe Biden fired Architect of the Capitol J. Brett Blanton in February 2023 in the wake of a report that said he had abused his authority and misused taxpayer money. The role has been filled in an acting capacity ever since.\n\n\"You know, I have maybe come to accommodate the speed with which the architect of the Capitol works,\" said Romney, who voted to convict Trump in his Jan. 6-related impeachment trial. \"So the fact that we haven't gotten the plaque probably should have alarmed me, but I've been here so long I'm getting used to it.\"\n\nThe deadline to install the plaque passed while former Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., was still speaker of the House. Johnson was elected to the job in October, after McCarthy was ousted.\n\nThis week, Johnson is scheduled to host a prayer vigil and a flag-laying ceremony at the Capitol to honor law enforcement officers who have been killed in the line of duty as part of National Police Week, an annual event.\n\nAfter the attack, some lawmakers, like Romney, had asked officials to leave some of the damage in the building as a reminder that \"it was not a tourist event, it was a brutal assault on the temple of the democracy.\" But officials in the Capitol quickly cleaned up the damage the rioters left on Jan. 6, replacing broken windows, repairing doors and cleaning a bust of President Zachary Taylor, which had blood smeared on it during the riot, and putting it back without a trace of its having been defaced.\n\nThe plaque would not be the only public reminder of the actions officers had to take that day to prevent rioters from overtaking the building and disrupting the counting of the electoral votes in Biden's 2020 victory over Trump. In 2022, Congress awarded the Congressional Gold Medal , its highest civilian honor, to officers who responded to the attack, and a display case showing the medal and a plaque naming law enforcement agencies that responded sits in the Capitol Visitor Center, where tours of the Capitol originate.\n\nA permanent memorial to officers who sacrificed while defending the Capitol is not unprecedented. A plaque is already in the Capitol to honor two officers who were fatally shot when they encountered a gunman in 1998. That plaque, which honors Capitol Police Detective John M. Gibson and Officer Jacob J. Chestnut Jr., was installed on the wall inside the door they were defending, which is also the door the House speaker typically uses to enter and exit the building.\n\nFormer Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell told NBC News that if Republicans want to hold themselves out as supporters of law and order, they need to show respect for the officers who protected them from the rioters that day and put up the plaque as laid out in the law. Gonell, who has been pushing for answers about the plaque, said he does not think bureaucracy alone can explain the delay, and he called for Johnson's office to speed up the work.\n\n\"On Jan. 6, we protected Kevin McCarthy and Mitch McConnell just as much as we protected Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer,\" Gonell said, adding that Johnson \"should approve installing the plaque immediately and Capitol Police Board should make it accessible so the American people understand the danger we faced and the magnitude of our sacrifices protecting our elected leaders, our Capitol, our democracy.\"\n\nFormer Washington Police Officer Michael Fanone was viciously assaulted by multiple rioters on Jan. 6, including with a stun gun, and he suffered a heart attack and a traumatic brain injury that day. He said it was important to recognize that officers \"made significant sacrifices, some of them career-ending, as a result of their defense of the Capitol that day.\"\n\nBut Fanone said that awards and acknowledgments are worth only the value you place on the people bestowing them and that he feels \"betrayed by both sides of the political aisle,\" especially given that Democrats voted to save Johnson from far-right Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's effort to oust him last week.\n\n\"I understand it as politics, and I'm not naive, but at some point in time, at this moment, somebody's going to have to take a stand on principle and do the right thing,\" Fanone said, adding that Johnson lent his credibility as a member of Congress to Trump's lies about the 2020 election .\n\n\"Police officers went to the Capitol that day to stop a mob, a mob that was attacking the Capitol building, destroying property and assaulting police officers,\" Fanone said. \"If you can't acknowledge that, f--- you.\"\n\nFanone left the police department in late 2021 and is still trying to put his life together in the aftermath of the attack, which he said took something he cannot get back: a career in law enforcement. He has struggled to find a job; he recently applied to be a loss prevention coordinator at Cabela's, he said, but he was rejected.\n\nFrank Thorp V is a producer and off-air reporter covering Congress for NBC News, managing coverage of the Senate.\n\nRebecca Kaplan is a producer and off-air reporter covering Congress for NBC News, managing coverage of the House.\n\nKyle Stewart is a field producer covering Congress for NBC News.\n\nI cover the Justice Department and federal law enforcement for NBC News.

Kelley Manley reported from Aurora, Colo.\n\nA few days before Christmas, a jury in Washington cleared three Tacoma police officers of criminal charges in the death of Manuel \"Manny\" Ellis, a 33-year-old Black man who died in police custody in 2020 after pleading that he could not breathe.\n\nThe next day, on Dec. 22, a jury in Colorado convicted two paramedics of criminally negligent homicide in the death of Elijah McClain , a 23-year-old Black man who died in police custody in 2019 after officers subdued him and medics injected him with the powerful sedative ketamine.\n\nIn the three years since the murder of George Floyd , whose death in police custody ignited a national movement against police brutality, prosecutors have charged the police and emergency medical workers in a number of high-profile cases.\n\nThe result has been a mixed bag of verdicts: convictions, acquittals and in one case, a mistrial. Civil rights activists and legal experts say the different outcomes reflect a country still struggling with how to view cases of police use of lethal force, and shifting public sentiment on law enforcement and safety.\n\n\"Police accountability is still up for debate. Even with actual evidence, even with body cam footage, we're still in a place where we cannot be certain that an officer's conviction for wrongdoing will take place through our judicial system,\" Charles Coleman Jr., a civil rights lawyer, former Brooklyn prosecutor and MSNBC legal analyst, said in an interview in October.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "The Law Enforcement Officers With Surprising Power\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nGuest Essay\n\nBy Maurice Chammah\n\nMr. Chammah, a staff writer at The Marshall Project, is the author of \"Let the Lord Sort Them: The Rise and Fall of the Death Penalty.\"\n\nFour years ago I drove to a small town in rural Missouri to meet the parents of Billy Ames, who were suing the St. Francois County Sheriff's Department over his death. An autopsy said the cause was a meth overdose, and jailers admitted they had strapped Mr. Ames to a restraint chair. While reporting on the case for The Marshall Project , I learned that other facilities had banned restraint chairs, medieval-looking devices that experts say can make it harder to spot a medical crisis.\n\nI visited the jail and it felt like a dungeon, with moldy walls and little sunlight. The man in charge, Sheriff Daniel Bullock, once joked that this place was his personal bed-and-breakfast. He denied wrongdoing and said if I published anything false I shouldn't come back. I watched my speed as I drove out of town.\n\nSt. Francois County has about 67,000 residents, and soon after my story came out Sheriff Bullock won his 2020 Republican primary with 6,185 votes and cruised to re-election. The Ames family ended up settling for $1.8 million, and former detainees brought a class-action lawsuit over the jail conditions. Then, this past August, Mr. Bullock lost in the primary, after more than three decades in power, with just 1,981 votes. The winner received 3,800.\n\nThose numbers reflect voters' typical disinterest in sheriff elections. But we ignore sheriffs at our peril. They wield tremendous power over investigations, arrests and policies that can mean the difference between life and death. A CBS News investigation found that in 2022, more than 27 people died in the custody of sheriffs for every 100,000 arrested, compared with fewer than 10 in the custody of the police.\n\nSo it's worth your time to look up your local sheriff and see whether he or she is up for re-election this year. Given how many people ignore these races, your vote may have outsize influence over how all sorts of policy questions play out in your community. Consider that Mr. Bullock won his first primary race in St. Francois County, in 1992, by just 22 votes.\n\nPolice chiefs are usually appointed in cities, while sheriffs are often elected in counties to be chief law enforcement officers. They can have a vast range of roles, from running the jail to patrolling the streets and securing the courthouse. \"In rural areas they are often medics, marriage counselors and coroners,\" writes the journalist Jessica Pishko in her recent book, \"The Highest Law in the Land.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Officer Sutton was the first D.C. police officer to be convicted of murder for actions on duty.\n\nThe other pardon recipient, Lt. Andrew Zabavsky, was sentenced to four years in prison not directly for the killing of Mr. Hylton-Brown, but for conspiring with Mr. Sutton to cover up the deadly police chase. The two had been free pending the outcome of their appeals.\n\nIssuing the pardons was not the first high-profile act of clemency during Mr. Trump's first week of his term, and was one that now involves him in a case that incited backlash against the police department operating just outside the White House.\n\nJust two days after he issued clemency to all of the nearly 1,600 people charged in connection with the attack on the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021 - including some accused of assaulting or impeding law enforcement officers - Mr. Trump used his power to give a reprieve to the officers convicted in Mr. Hylton-Brown's death.\n\nOn Tuesday, he had hinted at the pardons, which prevent any punishment associated with the convictions.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

On Tuesday, the phones of U.S. Capitol Police and D.C. police officers were buzzing nonstop.\n\nFor Aquilino A.

But some schools are eliminating them amid a clamor from students after George Floyd's death.\n\nBy Dana Goldstein\n\nThe national reckoning over police violence has spread to schools, with several districts choosing in recent days to sever their relationships with local police departments out of concern that the officers patrolling their hallways represent more of a threat than a form of protection.\n\nSchool districts in Minneapolis , Seattle and Portland, Ore. , have all promised to remove officers, with the Seattle superintendent saying the presence of armed police officers \"prohibits many students and staff from feeling fully safe.\" In Oakland, Calif., leaders expressed support on Wednesday for eliminating the district's internal police force, while the Denver Board of Education voted unanimously on Thursday to end its police contract .\n\nIn Los Angeles and Chicago, two of the country's three largest school districts, teachers' unions are pushing to get the police out, showing a willingness to confront another politically powerful, heavily unionized profession.\n\nSome teachers and students, African-Americans in particular, say they consider officers on campus a danger, rather than a bulwark against everything from fights to drug use to mass shootings.\n\nThere has been no shortage of episodes to back up their concerns. In Orange County, Fla., in November, a school resource officer was fired after a video showed him grasping a middle school student's hair and yanking her head back during an arrest after students fought near school grounds.

      "text": "My 5-Year-Old Is Way Too Obsessed With Police Officers\n\nCare and Feeding is Slate's parenting advice column. Have a question for Care and Feeding? Submit it here or post it in the Slate Parenting Facebook group .\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nMy lovely, outgoing son is 5 years old. For the past year or so, he has been absolutely obsessed with police officers. He loves their uniforms, cars, and dogs. He tells everyone he wants to be a policeman when he grows up, and whenever he sees a police officer, he runs up to them and says hi. In our overwhelmingly white suburb, this is always well received; cops are usually idle and don't mind letting him touch their cars or look at their outfits.\n\nI'm a little conflicted about this obsession, for obvious reasons. I know my son views police officers as friendly heroes because we are white and well-off-and he loves Paw Patrol- and I'm struggling to decide how to expose him to the reality that for many people, they are anything but heroes. I have been neutral toward his obsession so far: When he says he wants to be a police officer, I try to bring up other jobs where you can help people (like an ambulance driver!), and rather than let him dress up as a policeman for Halloween last year, I made an alternate suggestion and he went with it. Nevertheless, I'm wondering whether it's time to have a serious conversation with him about the role of the police and, if so, if you have any advice about doing that.\n\n-Sound the Alarm\n\nDear StA,\n\nIf you have not started talking to your child about social inequities, specifically those related to race, class, and gender, now is the time to begin that dialogue. For him to understand what's wrong with policing, he has to know why they function as they do in the first place.\n\nOnce you've explained the ways that racism, classism, and sexism define the world we live in, you can tell your son how police function to uphold those inequities. Instead of saying that police are not viewed as heroes by all, explain that it is actually quite rare that police are heroic. The harassment, abuse of power, and violence are essentially written into the laws that they are sworn to uphold; for police, bad behavior is not a bug but a feature. Study after study has shown that police are woefully ineffective when it comes to preventing and solving crime, and we do a disservice to our children by pretending that it's the \"bad cops\" alone who are the problem.\n\nAsk your little one what it is about police that he admires so much; he's likely to mention some virtues that theoretically should define an institution that is designed to protect communities. Continue to nudge him toward people and groups who actually represent those values, such as firefighters, nurses, and teachers, while also explaining that there are bad actors in those roles as well but the difference between a \"bad\" firefighter and a \"bad\" cop is that the job of being a firefighter was not created in order to do harm to vulnerable people.\n\nThis may sound like a lot for a 5-year-old, but I assure you that he can handle it. Remember: Black children, poor children, and many others don't have the privilege of learning these lessons later in life in the service of protecting their innocence, or because it's so hard to talk about in what feels like age-appropriate terms. I'm heartened by the fact that you're even contemplating this conversation. Please keep going!\n\nHelp us keep giving the advice you crave every week. Sign up for Slate Plus now .\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI have a 6-year-old first grader doing all-online remote learning. It's been two weeks, and she is having a really hard time with it. One day she was getting frustrated and started crying; she got up because she was upset, and the teacher promptly called her out by name to sit back down, which made her cry harder. I actually went on camera to tell the teacher that she was crying and needed a break. But on top of this, I'm getting burned out by this new normal.\n\nWe have numerous daily assignments that I find difficult to do during the workday. A few of us parents have asked the teacher if it's possible to release the assignments early, but she said that wasn't possible. So in between doing my own work and trying to keep my kid from having a meltdown, I'm also trying to do math homework and scavenger hunts. To complicate matters, I also have an 8-month-old I'm pretty much ignoring except when he's hungry or needs a diaper change. (Because I'm a terrible parent, I've been letting him have obscene amounts of screen time, so he's usually keeping himself entertained.)\n\nDo you have any advice? Or just words of comfort that I'm not a screw-up? My kid hates school, my team is getting annoyed with me, my baby's rotting his brain on crappy YouTube videos, and I'm pretty sure I'm already that annoying parent who's grating on the teacher. Help!\n\n-Losing It\n\nDear LI,\n\nYou are me, and we are you-all of us, every parent, everywhere. Remote school sucks. Working from home while being expected not merely to keep our children distracted so they don't bother us but to actively engage in their \"learning\" process sucks. Everything sucks right now, and that's not your fault.\n\nYou've got two very young children and a job, all needing your attention at once. It sounds to me like you're doing the absolute best you can, and you should give yourself some grace.\n\nYou can and should be empathetic to the challenges that your child's teacher is faced with as she tries to teach a group of ostensibly wiggly and weary 6-year-olds, but not to the detriment of your child. While none of us want to be \"that annoying parent,\" there are times when we can and must speak to our children's teachers on their behalf. If multiple parents are having a problem keeping up with the pacing of this particular classroom, then it very well may be the case that the teacher needs to make some adjustments in order to allow families to effectively participate. Request a meeting and speak to her at length about your concerns. Encourage other parents to do the same. If you find she is unwilling to work with you all to make things work, you may need to have a conversation with the principal.\n\nAs far as your infant goes, make sure you're choosing educational videos that both delight him and help to sharpen his little brain. Schedule short periods, five minutes or so, throughout the day when you're pausing to give him some cuddles and affection-and don't forget to make time to lavish your 6-year-old with a little extra TLC as well. (Hopefully she's getting periodic breaks from class; consider aligning your downtime with her schedule if you can.)\n\nNone of this is your fault; we are all floundering right about now. Just do your best to keep your babies upbeat-even if that means explaining for the first time that teachers are not always right-and grounded by the fact that they have a parent who loves them and is doing what they can.\n\n• If you missed Tuesday's Care and Feeding column, read it here .\n\n• Discuss this column in the Slate Parenting Facebook group !\n\nDear Care and Feeding\n\nThis year has created a lot of divides, and my family is no exception. I come from a mixed political family (Dad's a Republican, and Mom's a Democrat). While they don't agree, they are logical moderates and have had a happy 40 years of marriage. I was taught that politics was not an appropriate topic at family gatherings since my aunts are extremists and childhood rivals, and their fights never end well. (Example: A brick was once thrown through a window after Thanksgiving dinner.)\n\nI am married to an amazing man who shares my political views, but his family is the polar opposite. Before we met, he was estranged from them for years due to their extremist views. However, he is very passive-aggressive about it; he makes fun of them with friends but never confronts them. We have a 4-year-old daughter. I have kept the peace with my in-laws for the sake of family and my daughter having a relationship with her grandparents, but last Christmas, my husband's extended family thought it would be funny to teach my daughter the phrase \"Make America Great Again\" and have her say it at the dinner table! I was shocked; I have made my views clear and cannot get over them trying to bring my little one into this since she is the only reason we tolerate their politics. (In reality, it is their white supremacy that I abhor.)\n\nThe coronavirus created a great excuse for space, but now my in-laws are looking for \"granddaughter time,\" and I just can't seem to get past this. I have endured insults regarding my own political views and tried to keep my husband from his passive-aggressive retaliation, but I really don't want to make an effort anymore. My daughter has a great relationship with my parents, and my husband adores my dad (another sticking point with his father). Can I cut off contact with this side of the family, or do I have to stick it out for my daughter to have a relationship with her grandparents?\n\n-Is Family More Important?\n\nDear IFMI,\n\nI'm speaking from my heart, and I hope you can receive this.\n\nYou aren't the first, or the last, Democrat who has pondered whether to cut themselves off from such loathsome relatives. Alas, far too many white Americans have chosen their relationship with their loved ones over doing the right thing, and that is one of the reasons we are in this predicament: living under a bigoted, misogynist president who grossly mishandled a pandemic to the point of hosting what may be categorized as a superspreader event, a man who has encouraged white supremacist organizations and counts known white supremacists among his most trusted advisers.\n\nThese in-laws do not just stand diametrically opposed to what you believe in-they have made a spectacle of exposing your child to their nonsense. What value do they offer to your daughter? Family is so often associated with legacy and love; however, they are not the only sources of those things. Your daughter can understand who she is and where she comes from without having to be exposed to white nationalists who very well may plant seeds in her mind that may be difficult to destroy. She has your non-MAGA relatives to dote on her. Friends and community members can stand in the gap for the cousins and aunts or Pop Pop whom she may \"miss out\" on knowing if you and your man do the right thing and cut these losers off for good.\n\nTalk to your husband and let him know you'd prefer to have little to no contact with these people, and that goes for your child as well. Fuck your in-laws. They did this to themselves. Perhaps if there were more social consequences for bigotry, it wouldn't be so popular. Good luck, and I hope you do the right thing for you and your little girl.\n\nDear Care and Feeding,\n\nI've been struggling with depression and anxiety for about a year now, and the pandemic has made it worse. I won't go into detail, but it's pretty bad. I don't have any friends at my high school (my best friends moved away, then there are the COVID protocols, and my dislike of direct eye contact, my introverted nature, and my poor conversation skills have made it very, very difficult to make new friends) so school is no longer enjoyable. Home isn't much better. If I try talking to my parents about depression or anxiety, I get responses like \"just be less sad/nervous,\" or \"pray more\" (I've tried, with mixed results), or \"focus on your interests.\" (When I try to talk about my interests I get shut down with comments like \"Why would you waste that brilliant mind of yours learning about that?\") If I tell them I'd like to see a mental health professional or a therapist or something, they'll say that they will call the doctor, but then nothing happens.\n\nI don't know what to do. We've incurred some unexpected expenses recently, so I'm afraid of being a financial burden on my family, but I cannot keep living like this. I want to feel supported by my parents, not shut down. Do you have any advice?\n\n-I Know They Love Me, But ...\n\nDear IKTLMB,\n\nFirst, let me say that I am so, so proud of you for recognizing you need some support that you aren't receiving and for taking steps to try to figure out what to do to change that. I hope you can be proud of yourself for that as well.\n\nThere are a number of free and low-cost therapy apps and sites that will allow you to speak to a professional from the safety of your home. (I found a great list with some options here .) Pick out one or two that seem like a good fit for you and present the idea to your parents. Hopefully they will recognize that you have taken this step because this is a serious matter to you, and hopefully they will be supportive; perhaps knowing that therapy does not have to be a major expense will help them get past their hesitation to get you into some sort of treatment.\n\nI would also recommend speaking to your teacher or another trusted adult who may be able to speak to your parents on your behalf. It is very important that they come to understand you are fighting a difficult battle, and you deserve their support.\n\nPop culture often depicts teenagers as being sullen, dramatic, and moody for a punchline, or as if misery is merely a component of that time in one's life that cannot be avoided. But while the discomfort of shifting hormones and social complications are practically a given for kids your age, the level of unhappiness you are experiencing right now is not the toll you pay for being a high school student. Furthermore, many families lack experience when it comes to dealing with matters of mental health; unfortunately, that leads some adults to disregard their children's feelings, or suggest that prayer and good intentions alone can \"fix\" things.\n\nI'm not making excuses for your parents, nor am I suggesting that they are simply unable to do better than they have. Rather, I just want you to understand that it isn't a failure to articulate your needs, or a lack of urgency behind them, that has led your parents to disregard your feelings. The world does not encourage adults to listen to children for understanding, and that is a serious problem. I hope you know that you are both heard and understood in this moment, and that I am rooting for you. Do not give up on yourself, and do not give up on feeling better-you can, and you will! Please keep us posted.\n\n-Jamilah\n\nMy kid is 15 months old and has discovered he can make himself vomit by sticking his finger down his throat. He only does this when he is in a high chair or car seat. If I try to stop him from doing it, he enjoys the attention and will escalate the behavior, so I'm thinking I need to let it happen, but it's pretty hard to be chill when your kid is covered in vomit.

      "text": "The Blurred Blue Line\n\nPhoto illustation by Slate . Images by Romaniaboy/Thinkstock, moodboard/Thinkstock, and Jupiterimages/Thinkstock.\n\nThe debate over law enforcement that's been raging in America for the past two years has naturally focused on the decisions police officers make when they're working-not what they do after they punch out for the day. But a new paper by law professor Seth Stoughton, posted online this week in draft form , makes the argument that we've been ignoring an important aspect of policing-namely, the massive amount of moonlighting that cops do for private companies when they're off duty.\n\nFor Stoughton, who teaches at the University of South Carolina School of Law, this is a consequential oversight-particularly because, as he learned when he was a police officer in Tallahassee, Florida, and did moonlighting work for nightclubs and other private entities, officers who take these kinds of gigs typically wear their official police uniforms, further blurring the public's understanding of whether they are on duty or off and whether that matters.\n\nStoughton sent survey questions to about 400 police agencies at the state, county, and city levels, asking them about their policies regarding off-duty work and the amount of time their officers spend doing it. Stoughton got answers from 162 of the agencies, which in total employ about a fifth of the nation's police officers.\n\nI talked with Stoughton about why it's so troubling to think of police officers selling their law enforcement authority to private companies, how prevalent the practice is, and how off-duty opportunities affect the salaries that police departments pay their cops. The conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nBefore I read your paper, I had no idea that police officers were allowed to do off-duty work for private employers while wearing their uniforms and carrying their service weapons. And I had no idea that, as you report in the paper, some agencies require officers to wear their uniforms while working off-duty for private employers.\n\nWhere do you live?\n\nNew York.\n\nOh, yeah-New York does it.\n\nIt just strikes me as crazy, though I'm not sure I can totally explain why. You've thought about this for longer, so maybe you can tell me: What is it that feels intuitively wrong about this?\n\nI've gotten this reaction a lot while talking to people about this phenomenon. I think people react negatively because we think of policing as a public good. It's counterintuitive and incongruous to think of a public police officer who is being paid by, and working on behalf of, a private employer. It's just not what they do, right? Fundamentally it doesn't line up with our intuitive conception of what policing is.\n\nI knew officers sometimes took off-duty gigs, working as bouncers or security guards. But the idea that they'd be in uniform is shocking to me. Does that mean that off-duty officers doing freelance work are allowed to do all the same stuff they can do when they're on duty, like arrest people and search them and use force on them?\n\nYeah, absolutely. In fact, part of the reason why private employers hire them is that they're perceived as more official than private security guards. The police officer who's working off-duty for a private employer represents the state. They're in uniform, they have a badge, they have a gun belt. They may have a marked police vehicle with them. So in a very real sense they represent the arm of the state.\n\nIt seems unfair that someone can just rent out that kind of authority. Like, could a bunch of wealthy people who live in a neighborhood pool their money and hire a cop to patrol their streets? It seems like police resources shouldn't be allocated based on who can afford to pay for them.\n\nRight. Well, that's exactly what happens. In fact, one of the stories I open the article with is about an officer who was paid by a security company that had been hired by a neighborhood. Policing is typically thought of as inherently redistributive. The neighborhoods that pay for most of the policing in a given city are not the neighborhoods that are on the receiving end of most police services. The higher-income neighborhoods that have a higher tax bracket pay more, but most of the policing happens in the lower-income neighborhoods. So when you have private businesses, neighborhoods, even potentially private individuals hiring police, it cuts against that general approach of police as a public good that serves all of the citizenry without regard for anyone's ability to pay.\n\nWhat kind of work are most of these officers doing when they're hired by private companies?\n\nMy survey wasn't that specific, but my sense is most of it is security work. Some of that might be bouncing at a nightclub, but some of it might just be standing by at a party. If there's a large public event, they might have an officer just standing by in case there are any problems. And that happens not just at nightclubs and parties, it happens at pharmacies, grocery stores, department stores, big box stores, at strip malls. That's generally the emphasis-security.\n\nThere's also something called a \"courtesy officer,\" which is a police officer who lives at an apartment complex or condo building and provides some security or law enforcement services in exchange for reduced rent. This might include responding to noise complaints in the apartment complex. It might require the officer to park their police car in a visible spot near the front of the complex, just to provide that sense of police presence. It might require them to take reports of crimes that occur in the apartment complex when they're available to do so, so instead of sending an on-duty officer to deal with a noise complaint or a vehicle burglary report, the off-duty courtesy officer is called and sent instead. It also provides the apartment complex management and other residents with a police contact, so instead of calling the police department to complain about a noise problem, residents might be given the courtesy officer's phone number and encouraged to call him or her instead.\n\nThis is in exchange for reduced rent? I'm imagining my landlord giving a police officer moving into my building a discount in exchange for parking his cruiser out front like a scarecrow.\n\nI originally had a part of this paper that tracked the history of what I call the blurred blue line -the difficulty of distinguishing private and public policing. If we go all the way back to the original modern police force in the 1830s and '40s, officers commonly got paid through private sources for doing their public work. One scholar, a historian, published a paper about English police services in the 1830s, and it described the officer's salary as a \"retaining fee.\" It wasn't really where the officers made their money-where they made their money was someone would call in a burglary and say, \"my stuff has been stolen\" and the officer would say, \"well, how much are you offering to recover it?\" And then the officer would collect that reward. That's totally foreign to our modern conception of policing. But in some ways, it's the same idea of officers trading on their public authority. Because, again, it's not just their skills they're being hired for. It's not because they're better trained and better equipped than someone else. A private employer hires an off-duty officer because of their public authority, not just because of their personal characteristics or their qualifications.\n\nYou did some of this work when you were a police officer in Tallahassee. What were your reasons for doing it?\n\nI did it because it was a good way to make extra pocket money. I think that's why most officers do it.\n\nHow lucrative is it? How much were you making when you were doing it?\n\nIt can be extremely lucrative. There are some stories cited in my paper of officers working in New Orleans and making six figures just on their private off-duty employment-more than doubling their public salary. When I left the police department, I was making right around $45,000 a year. Breaking that down by hours, my public salary was just under $22 an hour, plus benefits and all that other stuff. When I did work for a private employer I don't think I ever made less than $30 an hour. And sometimes I could get paid much more than that. There was a particularly large event every year in Tallahassee, [ Florida A&M U niversity]'s homecoming. Lots of people, something like 60 or 80,000 people come into Tallahassee for that, and officers' days off all get canceled and you work a lot of overtime for the city. And then after your overtime for the city, if you have a gig like I did, you'd go to the nightclub afterwards. So you'd get released from your public job and you would go to your private job. And I think on FAMU homecoming I was making 75 or 95 dollars an hour.\n\nIs it common for an officer's off-duty income to be a significant chunk of what he or she is bringing home?\n\nYes, it absolutely can be.\n\nIn most places, are police officers taking this work to line their pockets, or are there places where the public pay is so low that this is really the only way to earn a decent living?\n\nBoth. Officers are absolutely using off-duty employment to make extra money, but it's also true that officers are, in many places, pathetically underpaid. Police at some agencies, particularly smaller, rural departments, might start their careers with a salary of $30,000 or less; officers in agencies like that might turn to off-duty work as a necessary way to pay the bills.\n\nThere's some tension here and some unanswered questions. It may be the case that [the allure of] off-duty employment attracts higher-quality officers than the police could otherwise hire. But it could also be the case that off-duty employment decreases officer wages because the agency doesn't need to pay officers as much to attract the level of applicants it wants.\n\nIs it your sense that most people who are doing this kind of work on the side are doing it at the expense of sleeping or their weekends? Where do they find the time to have a whole separate income stream?\n\nIt runs the gamut. There are officers who work a day shift and get off at, say, 5 p.m., then they go home for a little while and then go work five or six hours at their off-duty jobs in the evenings. For me, I would get off work at 2 o'clock in the morning on Friday or Saturday nights and then I'd go work for two hours at the nightclub as it was closing down.\n\nAnd how common is this? Can you tell from your research how widespread the practice is?\n\nSo I want to reinforce the caveat that this wasn't a rigorously representative sample. I think it's a good sample-the agencies that responded employ just under 20 percent of the entire state and local police force in the country-but I don't want to extrapolate from it too much. The sense that I get from the research is that it's pretty common. Most departments allow off-duty employment. The statistics from the agencies that responded to this survey suggest that around 80 percent of agencies allow officers to work in uniform while off-duty for private employers. That's consistent with the numbers we have from earlier research, which is very limited-there was research in the mid-'80s where one criminologist and a group of academics who were studying the private security industry tried to identify the extent of off-duty employment. And they found roughly the same 80 percent number.\n\nSo that's agencies that allow it. Do you have a sense of what percentage of officers actually do it, and how much time they're spending on it relative to their normal jobs?\n\nThe short answer is no. We don't have good local or national data on how many officers are engaged in off-duty employment or how many hours they're working. What I can give you is the data from my survey. And one of the takeaways from this paper is how few agencies actually track the number of officers who work for private employers and the number of hours that officers spend working for private employers. Of all the agencies that responded-I had 162 agencies respond to the survey-130 of them allow off-duty employment. And 62 of those, almost 50 percent, do not track the number of officers who do it. Two-thirds-87 of the 130 agencies that permit off-duty employment-don't track the number of hours that officers work for private employers.\n\nSo while the information that I have is a good start toward understanding how big this phenomenon might be, the takeaway is we actually don't know.\n\nFrom your paper it also sounds like there aren't rules or even conventions for who is held responsible when an off-duty police officer working a private gig does something to get sued.\n\nThere's a tremendous amount of variation and very little consistency here. Some states put the liability for an off-duty officer's actions squarely on the private employer. Other states tend to suggest the opposite approach-they say the private employer is not liable. As a matter of policy some departments have private employers sign indemnity agreements with the agency before the officer is allowed to work with them. So even though the employment contract is only between the private employer and the officer, in order to approve the off-duty employment, the agency wants to be indemnified so if the officer does get sued, the private employer will pick up the tab.\n\nLiability is a huge issue. And the key question is whether you conceive of the off-duty officer as being a police officer who works for a public agency or whether you conceive of them as working for the private company. Most plaintiffs are probably going to sue both, because there can be ambiguity. For example, if a private employer has a dress code that has racial implications-like, no gold chains, no hats turned backwards, no baggy shorts, no basketball jerseys. These dress codes exist at nightclubs and other places in this country. Can the nightclub have the officer enforce those dress codes? And what happens when the officer does enforce those dress codes and gets sued for discrimination? How much of that is on the officer, how much of that is on the city or the county that employs the officer, and how much of that is on the private employer?\n\nWoof. That introduces a whole other issue, doesn't it? If these guys are working for a private employer, and they're being paid to enforce the private employer's rules by using their authority as law enforcement agents, aren't they kind of turning those rules into ... pseudo-laws?\n\nYeah. Not to get too theoretical, but if you believe that \"law\" is what happens on the ground, then yes-the private employer's rules become de facto law.\n\nThat seems bad.\n\nI tend to agree. This piece did not identify and did not try to identify best practices. I think that, and developing more information about how agencies are handling off duty employment, is the next step.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Police Officers Killed Six People in the 24 Hours After Chauvin Verdict\n\nThe guilty verdict in the murder trial former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin shone a spotlight on killings by law enforcement officers. But the vast majority of police killings across the United States go largely unnoticed. To exemplify that fact, the Associated Press details how at least six people died at the hands of the police in the 24 hours after a verdict was reached in the Chauvin trial. Some of those deaths led to even more calls for accountability, while others have remained so under the radar that the name of the person who was killed isn't even known. \"In several cases, little is known about the lives of those killed and what happened in their final moments,\" notes the Associated Press.\n\nShortly before the Chauvin verdict was read, officer Nicholas Reardon in Columbus, Ohio killed Ma'Khia Bryant, a 16-year-old Black girl. Authorities say Reardon opened fire to protect a girl that Bryant had lunged at with a knife. Bodycam footage of the incident was released and the death led to protests in Columbus, with many wondering why the officer apparently didn't hesitate to open fire on such a young girl. Even the White House commented on the killing. \"The killing of 16-year-old Ma'Khia Bryant by the Columbus police is tragic,\" White House press secretary Jen Psaki told reporters Wednesday . \"She was a child.\" In contrast, the president of the National Fraternal Order of Police said the officer's actions were \"an act of heroism.\"\n\nIn San Antonio, Texas, two men were killed in separate incidents. First, two police officers confronted a man on a bus who was allegedly armed. Shots were fired, the man, who remains unidentified, was killed. Later in the day, police were met with fire while responding to a call that a man had killed a person. They returned fire and killed the suspect, who also hasn't been identified.\n\nIn the same evening, a 31-year-old man in Worcester, Massachusetts called 911, claiming he had a bomb and would set it off. Law enforcement officers tried to negotiate with Phet Gouvonvong, who was wearing body armor and appeared to have a rifle. An officer opened fire when Gouvonvong moved toward police .\n\nThe next morning, police in Elizabeth City, North Carolina killed Andrew Brown Jr. while they were trying to serve an arrest warrant. A witness said police shot Brown while he was trying to drive away. Seven deputies have been placed on leave amid protests demanding that authorities release bodycam footage. Gov. Roy Cooper has also called for the bodycam footage to be released \" as quickly as possible .\"\n\nInitial reports of the shooting in Elizabeth City and death of Andrew Brown, Jr. this week are tragic and extremely concerning. The body camera footage should be made public as quickly as possible and the SBI should investigate thoroughly to ensure accountability.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, police in Escondido, California killed a white man who, according to police, charged at an officer with a metal pole. Officers had arrived at the area after a call that a man was hitting cars with a metal object. The man hasn't been identified but he was a homeless man who was well known to police and had been arrested 188 times since 2002. There had reportedly been numerous attempts to get him help from mental health professionals but they were never successful, according to authorities. \"Here's someone the police are saying was very well known to have mental health issues and was rotating through the system many times, and never got the help he needed,\" homeless advocate Michael McConnell told the San Diego Union-Tribune . \"He's dead because our system failed him, plain and simple.\"\n\nIt \"remains to be seen\" whether any of the officers involved in these killings will face charges, notes the AP.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "No One Becomes a Cop Because It's Safe\n\nScout Schultz.\n\nRemembering Scout Schultz/Facebook\n\nA student at Georgia Tech was shot dead by a police officer Saturday night after refusing to comply with orders. 21-year-old Scout Schultz, who identified as gender nonbinary and used they/them pronouns, was in the midst of what their family's lawyer says was a mental health crisis. A video of Schultz's final moments, filmed from a window shortly before midnight, shows police officers pointing their weapons and shouting \"drop the knife!\" and \"do not move!\" Scout Schultz responds, \"Kill me.\"\n\nWhile the shooting is still being examined by state investigators, it's not too early to make an informed prediction about how the Georgia Tech police will attempt to justify Schultz's death. They will almost certainly argue that this was a clear-cut case of police officers facing a potentially lethal threat and making the reasonable decision to protect themselves from lethal risk.\n\nSome version of this argument has been used to defend countless police officers in the wake of shootings that have struck many Americans as avoidable. Timothy Loehmann said he was scared for his life when he shot Tamir Rice in Cleveland; he thought Rice, who was holding a toy gun, was brandishing a real weapon. Randall Kerrick said he was scared, too, when he shot Jonathan Ferrell outside Charlotte, North Carolina ; he thought Ferrell was lunging toward him with an object in his hand. Dante Servin was also scared when he shot Rekia Boyd in Chicago; he thought one of her friends had pulled out a weapon.\n\nIn each of those cases, a prosecutor , jurors , or a judge accepted the premise that an on-duty shooting can be justified as long as the officer in question had a reasonable (if objectively unwarranted) fear of losing his life if he didn't apply lethal force. There's a certain pragmatism embedded in this logic. Police officers need to make instantaneous high-pressure decisions. If we insist on punishing them for sometimes making the wrong call, we'll hinder their ability to do their jobs. The logical conclusion of this line of argument, then, is that we have to tolerate a few bad, even fatal, decisions in order to make it possible for police to make good ones.\n\nThat's the theory. The facts on the ground are that, according to the Washington Post , 963 people -including 44 who had toy weapons, 48 who were unarmed, and 241 who were known to suffer from mental illness-were shot and killed by police in the United States last year. It may be true that some of those shootings happened because well-intentioned, well-trained officers were forced into impossible situations. It's also true that a lot of those shootings might have been avoided if American police officers weren't trained to be so afraid of the citizens they're supposed to be protecting.\n\nIn May 2015, I wrote about the \" grim canon of videos \" shown to police officers during training. These videos, many of which are shot with dashboard cameras, show a succession of officers being murdered because they waited too long to use deadly force. As I wrote at the time, the videos are meant to serve as \"a chilling reminder to never lose sight of the unpredictability [officers] face on the street-and to resist any political pressure they might feel to forget their training in the face of danger.\"\n\nOne particularly famous video in law enforcement circles shows the 1998 murder of Deputy Kyle Dinkheller of Georgia's Laurens County Sheriff's Office. The three-and-a-half minute \"Dinkheller tape\" shows the deputy pulling over a car on the side of a highway and getting a rifle pulled on him. After ordering the man to put the gun down five times, Dinkheller gets shot, and the man runs back into his truck and drives off.\n\n\"There were multiple times when he would have been justified in using deadly force against that individual with the rifle, and he either hesitated or chose not to do it,\" said Dave Grossi when I interviewed him in 2015. Grossi, a former police lieutenant in upstate New York who spent 12 years as a private law enforcement trainer, told me videos like the Dinkheller tape teach recruits to avoid making tactical mistakes.\n\nThe most striking conversation I had about these videos was with Emanuel Kapelsohn, who sits on the board of directors of the International Association of Law Enforcement Firearms Instructors. \"One of the biggest problems we have in police training today,\" Kapelsohn told me, \"is getting officers to understand when they need to use force and getting them to be willing to use it.\"\n\nHe pointed to a news story about an officer who declined to fire his gun at a suspect who was running toward him while holding his hand in his pocket. Although the officer was feted in the press for his restraint after successfully making the arrest, Kapelsohn sharply criticized his approach after watching body-cam footage of the incident. \"From a professional point of view, the officer made an extremely poor tactical decision and needs to be retrained, not commended,\" he said. \"Whether Ferguson was going through his head, I don't know. Whether Staten Island was going through his head, I don't know. But an officer has to be prepared and trained and capable of shooting someone even though he doesn't want to. This was someone who needed to be shot, should have been shot.\"\n\nThat's the mindset of a person whose job it is to train police officers on how to use their guns. As I wish I'd emphasized when I originally wrote my 2015 story, it's a mindset that is undermined by the relative infrequency with which police officers are killed in the line of duty. According to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund , firearms-related officer fatalities peaked in 1973, when 156 officers were shot and killed, then dropped to an average of 87 per year in the 1980s, 68 per year in the 1990s, and 57 per year in the 2000s. In 2016, 64 officers were fatally shot, five of them during the sniper attack in Dallas that July and three more 10 days later during a Missouri man's rampage in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.\n\nNo doubt one of the reasons these numbers are not higher is that police officers are trained to fear for their lives. It's thanks in part to the Dinkheller tape and others like it that officers who think they might be in fatal danger tend to act quickly to neutralize the threat. But it is impossible to draw this connection, or to say that police training keeps officers safe, without considering the trade-offs involved, and what those trade-offs mean for civilians-particularly black people and the mentally ill, both groups that are shot by police at a disproportionate rate.\n\nI'm reminded of a December 2015 piece written by my colleague Jamelle Bouie after prosecutors announced that the officers responsible for killing Tamir Rice wouldn't be charged. He wrote:\n\nPart of policing is risk. Not just the inevitable risk of the unknown, but voluntary risk. We ask police to \"serve and protect\" the broad public, which-at times-means accepting risk when necessary to defuse dangerous situations and protect lives, innocent or otherwise. It's why we give them weapons and the authority to use them; why we compensate them with decent salaries and generous pensions; why we hold them in high esteem and why we give them wide berth in procedure and practice.\n\nAlong these same lines, Dallas Morning News columnist Steve Blow wrote a piece in March 2015 interrogating an oft-repeated mantra that has been called \" the first rule of law enforcement \": that the \"No. 1 duty of a police officer is to go home to his or her family at the end of the shift.\"\n\nBlow wrote:\n\n[It] sounds so obvious at first that of course we nod along.\n\nBut wait. Really? Is that the No. 1 duty of a police officer?\n\nIf so, then an officer is always right to shoot in any dangerous encounter. Or potentially dangerous. Or conceivably dangerous. Or most any time.\n\nIf self-preservation is the first and foremost priority of a police officer, then you get what we have seen in recent months and years-a series of unsettling police shootings.\n\nAfter acknowledging that he lacks the courage to do what police officers do, Blow continued:\n\nI so appreciate their willingness to assume the risks of the job.\n\nBut there's the crux of the matter. They have willingly taken a job that involves personal risk. It also requires split-second decision making that must go beyond simple self-preservation.\n\nIf going home safely becomes the overriding priority, that can become another way of saying, \"Shoot first and ask questions later.\"\n\nHow much risk is it fair to ask a police officer to take? Speaking as someone who has never patrolled a dark alley, answered a 911 call, or raced to the scene of a shooting spree, my first inclination is to say, \"I don't know and it's not for me to judge.\"\n\nMy second inclination, though, is to say that it's a police officer's job to take risks the rest of us are unable or unwilling to take. That is why the vast majority of police officers, the ones who perform their duties admirably and selflessly, deserve our respect and admiration. The reason we revere cops isn't their dedication to protecting their own lives. It's their dedication to protecting ours.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Quiet Epidemic of Predators in Uniforms\n\nA series of recent groundbreaking investigative reports unveiled what many advocates for police accountability have known for decades: Child sex abuse by law enforcement officials is far too common across our country. Systemic failures within policing-coupled with lax oversight by police departments, prosecutors, and judges-too often shield police officers from meaningful accountability.\n\nChild sex abuse is chronic and widespread, yet justice for survivors is rare. Studies have found that nearly 25 percent of girls and roughly 8 percent of boys experience sexual abuse before turning 18. Numerous social and psychological factors including guilt, fear, and self-blame often prevent children from telling their families or others about their abuse , with a majority of incidents never known by anyone other than the survivor and their abuser until years after the abuse ended.\n\nIn cases where parents, teachers, or other authority figures do become aware of abuse in time to prevent further harm, many children are too traumatized by the experience to turn to the criminal legal system for real accountability. When they do, the results are deeply disheartening. The Justice Department estimates that fewer than 20 percent of reported child sex abuse cases result in prosecution, and less than half of those cases result in conviction.\n\nIf the perpetrator is a policeman armed with a badge and a gun, the long-term damage inflicted on survivors is even more dire. Young people often feel abandoned, betrayed, and violated when someone charged with protecting them turns out to be a predator. Their trust in law enforcement can be permanently eroded.\n\nIn a piece published last month, the Washington Post uncovered at least 1,800 law enforcement officers charged with child sex abuse between 2005 and 2022-a staggering 10 percent of criminal charges filed against officers in this period were for child sex abuse. Given the challenges in reporting and charging these cases , it is likely that such incidents are even more common than publicly available figures suggest.\n\nWhen officers are in fact investigated, charged, and convicted of sex abuse of children, they commonly are shielded by lax accountability. According to official data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission , 98.8 percent of people convicted of child sex abuse are given an average prison sentence of 16 years. Meanwhile, 40 percent of police officers convicted of child sex abuse received sentences of probation, house arrest, or community service. Of the police officers who were incarcerated, 66 percent received sentences of less than five years.\n\nWhile not every policing department is experiencing these concerns, the broader systemic failures are unacceptable, and comprehensive change throughout our criminal legal system is needed to protect vulnerable children.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies must adopt more rigorous screening and training for those entrusted to interact with and protect children. Training must incorporate developmentally appropriate, trauma-informed policies for interactions with youth , clearly prohibit this conduct, and put officers on notice they will be terminated and potentially prosecuted when it occurs.\n\nAs the Washington Post noted, without \"clear messages\" that inappropriate behavior with children will not be tolerated, potentially predatory officers may assume they will escape accountability.\n\nPolicing departments also need fortified procedures and the resolve to fire abusers, as well as national databases that bar these officers from future careers in other agencies.\n\nElected prosecutors have a particularly important role to play in addressing these issues, both by implementing best practices like robust and truly independent handling of these cases and by working with law enforcement to promote long overdue reforms to protect youth. This includes investigations of misconduct by departments other than the officer's employing agency.\n\nFair and Just Prosecution's Blueprint on Policing Reform urges prosecutors to implement and advocate for strategies aimed at changing culture and breaking the \"code of silence\" that has taken hold in far too many law enforcement agencies. (One of the authors is the executive director of Fair and Just Prosecution.) This includes establishing zero-tolerance policies for both predatory officers and those who fail to report or otherwise cover up these incidents.\n\nFinally, prosecutors should support the creation of independent civilian oversight bodies and ensure they have the tools and resources needed-including subpoena power, adequate investigatory staff, expansive jurisdiction, and the authority to implement reforms. These oversight bodies ensure that law enforcement is accountable to the communities they protect and serve.\n\nChildren deserve to be safe from abuse, regardless of the position and authority of their abusers. The level of child sex abuse uncovered by the Post's bombshell investigation is intolerable, and prosecutors must use their tremendous power and influence to implement these and other essential reforms in the communities they serve. Our children deserve nothing less.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Police Officers Suspected of Assisting Capitol Riot Suspended; Other Sympathizers Under Investigation\n\nSeveral officers stationed at the Capitol during last week's siege have been suspended, and more than a dozen more Capitol Police officers are currently under investigation, for actions that range from inappropriate support for the rioters to suspected involvement with the insurrection. The anemic, borderline permissive security response to the incursion has come under heavy criticism in the days after the event. The front-line Capitol Police were undermanned and the federal response to bolster security to defend the national legislature took hours and appears to have been intentionally slowed by the Trump administration, including by President Donald Trump himself. There were also troubling signs of police officers exhibiting support for the insurrection on the ground that day, as well as support online for some of Trump's most pernicious election lies that prompted the attempted takeover.\n\nOne officer was suspended for taking a selfie with pro-Trump rioter; a video of the moment ricocheted around the internet in real time Wednesday, giving the impression that the sympathies of some portion of the police lay with the mob that lead to five deaths, including two officers. Another officer was suspended for wearing a red Make America Great Again baseball cap as the crowd was closing in on the Capitol. \"One video taken during the mayhem appears to show an officer wearing a MAGA cap leading a line of men in black helmets and body armor as they leave the Capitol to a crowd of applauding rioters,\" the Washington Post reports. \"It is unclear whether other men behind him are officers or rioters.\" Supporters of the officer say that he was using the hat as a prop to subdue the mob and get at-risk officers to safety.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nOther investigations revolve around officers' supportive online posts about the rally outside the White House that preceded the riot, as well as support for Trump's efforts to overturn the election. \"The Department also has been actively reviewing video and other open source materials of some USCP officers and officials that appear to be in violation of Department regulations and policies,\" acting Capitol Police chief Yogananda Pittman said. \"Our Office of Professional Responsibility will investigate these behaviors for disciplinary action, up to, and including, termination.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Police Lie. All the Time. Can Anything Stop Them?\n\nChristopher Parham was grocery shopping for his boss when Henry Daverin, a plainclothes NYPD officer, approached him. Daverin accused Parham of driving recklessly on an illegal scooter without a helmet; a few minutes later, Parham was writhing in pain on the sidewalk outside. What happened during those few minutes was a matter of dispute . The NYPD said that Parham, a Black 19-year-old, had violently resisted arrest. Daverin and his colleagues said that they did not use force against him even though Parham had gruesome Taser burns all across his back.\n\nThen surveillance video of the episode emerged-and proved that nearly every detail of the NYPD's account was false. Parham had immediately cooperated with Daverin; he did not resist arrest. Nonetheless, Daverin and his colleagues had assaulted Parham, tackling him to the ground, then Tasing him over and over again. After Parham's attorneys released the video-and his local representatives raised concerns-the district attorney dropped all charges. Daverin, who had been named in at least 10 other misconduct lawsuits, was never disciplined, either for brutalizing Parham or for lying about it. Two years later, he remains on the force.\n\nThe police reaction to George Floyd's murder, as well as the resulting nationwide protests, introduced many Americans to the fact that law enforcement officers lie. After officer Derek Chauvin killed George Floyd, the Minneapolis Police Department issued a statement falsely claiming that Floyd \"physically resisted officers\" and excluding the fact that Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes. When Buffalo police officers violently shoved a peaceful 75-year-old man, their department falsely asserted that the victim \"tripped and fell\" during \"a skirmish involving protesters.\"\n\nThis tendency to lie pervades all police work, not just high-profile violence, and it has the power to ruin lives. Law enforcement officers lie so frequently-in affidavits, on post-incident paperwork, on the witness stand-that officers have coined a word for it: testilying . Judges and juries generally trust police officers, especially in the absence of footage disproving their testimony. As courts reopen and convene juries, many of the same officers now confronting protesters in the street will get back on the stand.\n\nDefense attorneys around the country believe the practice is ubiquitous; while that belief might seem self-serving, it is borne out by footage captured on smartphones and surveillance cameras. Yet those best positioned to crack down on testilying, police chiefs and prosecutors, have done little or nothing to stop it in most of the country. Prosecutors rely on officer testimony, true or not, to secure convictions, and merely acknowledging the problem would require the government to admit that there is almost never real punishment for police perjury.\n\nOfficers have a litany of incentives to lie, but there are two especially powerful motivators. First, most evidence obtained from an illegal search may not be used against the defendant at trial under the Fourth Amendment's exclusionary rule; thus, officers routinely provide false justifications for searching or arresting a civilian. Second, when police break the law, they can (in theory) suffer real consequences, including suspension, dismissal, and civil lawsuits. In many notorious testilying cases, including Parham's, officers blame the victim for their own violent behavior in a bid to justify disproportionate use of force. And departments will reward officers whose arrests lead to convictions with promotions.\n\nTwo major cities are taking two different approaches to the problem. In New York City, prosecutors keep secret databases of unreliable police officers, though only two boroughs actually prohibit those officers from taking the stand. Without further reforms, however, this approach fails to address the underlying problem: Prosecutors are reluctant to accuse officers of lying in the first place, or to investigate an officer's claims to learn if they align with reality. As a result, an officer who lies convincingly can evade the list indefinitely. In San Francisco, by contrast, District Attorney Chesa Boudin has sought to eradicate the incentives that lead police to lie in the first place. Both cities are witnessing an experiment play out in real time: What happens when the criminal justice system can no longer rely on its enforcers to tell the truth?\n\nThe New York Police Department provides a case study in how the criminal justice system rewards lying. One NYPD officer, David Grieco-commonly known as Bullethead-has been sued at least 32 times , costing the city $343,252, for civil rights violations, including excessive force and fabrication of evidence. Yet Grieco was promoted and prosecutors continued to call him to the stand long after a slew of his victims blew the whistle on his violent and lawless behavior. Judges continued to rely on his word to lock up defendants. And Grieco's name did not appear on Brooklyn District Attorney Eric Gonzalez's long-secret list of officers with known credibility problems.\n\nGrieco is a symptom of a much deeper problem. Widespread lying about Fourth Amendment violations is at least as old as the exclusionary rule itself. The Supreme Court applied this rule nationwide in 1961's Mapp v. Ohio , preventing state prosecutors from relying upon illegally obtained evidence to secure a conviction. Mapp spawned a surge in \"dropsy\" cases: Rather than admit to an illegal search, police claimed that defendants simply dropped drugs on the ground in front of them, since evidence found in \"plain view\" can be used at trial. Studies of criminal trials in New York City found that, after Mapp , police began lying about arrests to ensure that evidence would be admissible. In the early 1970s, the New York district attorney even told the New York Court of Appeals that, since Mapp , officers lied on the stand in a \"substantial\" number of \"dropsy cases.\" Two decades later, the Mollen Commission-a famous investigation of the NYPD-found that officers routinely engaged in perjury and falsification of records, \"the most common form of police corruption.\"\n\nWhen NYPD officers are accused of illegal behavior, the department itself usually investigates, then conceals its findings and imposes, at worst, a slap on the wrist, like brief paid leave. Prosecutors could separately investigate, but they have little incentive to question an officer's story: If they know an officer is lying, they cannot legally rely on his testimony; if they remain in the dark, they can still use his perjury to clinch a conviction. Moreover, prosecutors and police work together to put defendants behind bars, developing a team mentality that prevents prosecutors from scrutinizing officers' testimony with appropriate skepticism. As long as officers' lies cannot be proved false, prosecutors have little reason to question their account of events. As a New York assistant district attorney told the Mollen Commission: \"Taking money is considered dirty, but perjury for the sake of an arrest is accepted. It's become more casual.\"\n\nOccasionally, the system will catch these lies. Yvette, an Egyptian American who lives in New York City, believes cross-examination of deceitful officers likely secured her acquittal. (Her name has been changed at her request to protect her from retaliation.) In 2017, Yvette witnessed three NYPD officers arresting the owner of a Brooklyn hookah lounge. As the police were detaining him, he handed Yvette his phone and asked her to call his mom. The officers promptly \"attacked\" her, she told me, severely damaging her knee. When she begged for an ambulance, the officers ignored her. Yvette eventually called one herself and learned at the hospital that the attack tore her ACL. When two officers visited her bedside, she asked if they were going to take her statement. They explained that they were there to arrest her for allegedly attacking the officers at the hookah lounge.\n\nWhat these officers did not know was that Yvette had recently recovered from multiple surgeries on her knee, one of which resulted in a staph infection. It had been a mere two weeks since Yvette learned how to walk without a cane again. Now the NYPD was accusing her of a violent assault.\n\nAt a three-day bench trial, Yvette's public defender, Theodore Hastings, grilled the cops about their account. Two officers claimed that Yvette had attacked them at the exact same time, a physical impossibility. A third alleged that Yvette had run about 500 feet before lunging at the officers.\n\nYvette herself also testified. \"The judge heard my story and understood and felt my pain,\" she told me. \"She saw I really wasn't lying.\" The judge acquitted Yvette of all charges.\n\nBut hoping a judge will vindicate the truth is a luxury most wrongfully accused people cannot afford. Not everyone has a medical record or video footage to prove their account. If an individual goes to trial, they have a right to access the arresting officer's record of misconduct because it could help prove their innocence. But the vast majority of criminal cases do not go to trial, and until recently, defense attorneys in New York City could not obtain officers' disciplinary records due to a notorious shield called Section 50-A. The state repealed this law in June, and Mayor Bill de Blasio has since promised to publish an online database of police disciplinary records. With New York City's prosecutors still fighting to conceal their do-not-call lists, it will now be left to defense attorneys, activists, and the public to track untrustworthy officers.\n\nAcross the country in San Francisco, newly elected District Attorney Chesa Boudin is taking a different approach. Boudin, a former public defender and staunch critic of mass incarceration, confronted testilying head-on. \"Police are allowed to lie and get away with it over and over and over again in matters big and small,\" he told me. \"I can think of dozens of examples where police were either able to get away with-or faced no consequences if they were impeached and called out on their dishonesty. When you have a system of that kind of impunity, it snowballs. It teaches, encourages, and enforces bad behavior.\"\n\nBoudin has minimal control over the SFPD itself. But he has created a robust \"do not call\" list of officers whom his office will not call to the stand as a witness. Officers who are caught testilying go on the list, as do those who commit other forms of misconduct. Boudin has also mandated careful assessment of charges like assaulting an officer and resisting arrest. \"When police use excessive force or brutalize someone,\" Boudin said, \"the most common outcome is that the police arrest the person and ask prosecutors to charge that person with resisting arrest or assaulting an officer.\" He now requires his staff to review video footage of the incident before filing those charges. \"It's not because we think officers are lying most of the time,\" he said. \"We just know that, until we watch video footage, we have no ability to distinguish between a testilying police report to cover up excessive force and legitimate criminal activity of assaulting an officer.\"\n\nA third reform may have more direct practical consequences for victims of routine testilying designed to avoid the exclusionary rule. Too often, officers find a trivial reason to stop someone, or just make one up, then discover drugs or weapons in the ensuing search. The target of these pretextual stops is usually a person of color. \"We know 'driving while black' is a reality for far too many people,\" Boudin said. \"If you have dark skin, you're more likely to get pulled over, more likely to get searched, and more likely to get arrested. You're also more likely to have force used during your arrest than if you're white.\"\n\nTo disincentivize this behavior, Boudin's office stopped charging any contraband case that grew out of a pretextual stop. As an example, he cited searches initiated after a stop for some minor traffic offense. \"Our vehicle code makes it possible for police to legally stop any car,\" Boudin said. \"We all know that most drivers do not come to complete stops at stop signs and most police don't enforce that law most of the time.\" If the police do pull over a driver for an incomplete stop, and the encounter results in an arrest for possession of drugs or guns, his office will not bring charges.\n\nIlona Solomon, a San Francisco public defender and former colleague of Boudin's, admires his work but remains skeptical that he has the power to change the city's broken law enforcement apparatus. \"There is an entrenched culture in the DA's office that is very resistant to reform,\" Solomon told me. \"Chesa can't fix all the problems immediately, and some things he doesn't have control over.\"\n\nStill, in his seven months on the job, Boudin has made headway in the face of sustained opposition from the SFPD. Solomon pointed to two recent cases involving the same officer, Robert Gilson. In 2017, a California judge found Gilson had \"changed his testimony\" regarding a search and arrest, deeming him \"not reliable.\" Yet prosecutors continued to call him to the stand, and judges continued to paper over his inconsistencies.\n\nIn one recent case, Gilson stopped a Samoan man who was holding a bag of marijuana, which is legal in California. After a lengthy search, the officer discovered bindles of cocaine. Gilson's reason for the stop shifted: At the time, he said he wanted to search \"bulges\" in the man's pocket; later, he testified that he sought to determine if the man was holding an illegal amount of marijuana. A judge accepted this reasoning and refused to suppress the cocaine. In another case, Gilson stopped a Black man, justifying the action because the man was jaywalking. After Gilson threatened to strip search the man, he let the officer search him, uncovering a small stash of cocaine. A judge refused to suppress the evidence, crediting Gilson's testimony that he believed the man was concealing drugs due to his worried \"demeanor\" during the search.\n\nSolomon represented both men. She told Boudin that, in both cases, Gilson had engaged in blatant racial profiling. Boudin agreed and dismissed all charges. Still, Boudin's office could not say whether it had placed Gilson on its \"do not call\" list, which is not public. The SFPD confirmed Gilson was assigned to field operations but said they could not comment further on personnel matters.\n\nKate Levine, a Cardozo Law professor and former public defender who studies police accountability, told me she's skeptical that patchwork solutions like a \"do not call\" list can ever stamp out testilying. Maryanne Kaishian, a public defender in Brooklyn, agreed, noting that it's easy for \"clean\" officers to conceal the involvement of a known dirty cop by keeping his name off all paperwork. Nor do these lists remove officers' strong incentive to lie: Police are more likely to get promoted if they effect more arrests that result in successful prosecutions. Promotions come with more prestige and a higher salary. Prosecutors still have an incentive not to question officers' \"blue lies.\"\n\nTo end testilying, Levine said, \"I would entirely change incentive structures.\" Officers would be rewarded for reporting on their colleagues' lies and scrutinized when their stories do not line up. They would no longer be able to coordinate their stories before testifying, a common procedure that lets them iron out potential inconsistencies. Nor could they watch bodycam footage before providing their version of events, another perk that's not provided to civilians. Prosecutors would be rewarded for rooting out unconstitutional behavior. Officers who lie, and prosecutors who tolerate them, would be terminated immediately. In short, the system would encourage police officers and prosecutors to focus less on winning cases and more on following the rules, even when a constitutional violation stands in the way of a conviction.\n\nWhat would happen if a city really tried to eliminate testilying? I posed this question to Bennett Capers, a former federal prosecutor and Fordham Law professor who studies police lies. \"In all honesty, I think my initial reaction would be that the system cannot exist without it,\" he told me. \"It would grind to a halt.\" Capers said that \"run of the mill policing would have to change. We are doing about 13 million misdemeanor arrests a year. With a lot of those small crimes, there's fudging. Nobody's paying attention.\"\n\nPolice, in other words, would have to stop arresting so many people for minor crimes. Once cities stopped deploying officers to harass misdemeanants, they could shrink their police force, reducing the number of encounters between cops and civilians. Agencies might then dedicate those resources to investigative and detective work in order to build solid cases against suspects, thereby creating a higher bar for which cases to pursue. Prosecutors would be forced to make a more careful calculation about the risk of bringing a case to trial and drop cases that rested on a search of dubious legality. In the short term, the legitimacy of the entire system might take a hit-though only because its participants confronted the illegitimate basis of so many convictions. Over time, however, the system might regain the legitimacy it lost with a preference for punishment over justice.\n\n\"We all wanted to see justice happen,\" Capers recalled from his time as a prosecutor. \"And law enforcement often thinks that, in the interest of justice, the rules get in the way. I'm not aware of ever saying, 'Does this story sound quite right?' We benefited from small lies.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

      "text": "I Learned to Think Like a \"Warrior Cop\"\n\nPop quiz! What is the third thing-besides weapons and skills-that you need to survive armed combat? Is it:\n\nA. Ammunition? B. Body armor? C. Tactical advantage? D. The will to kill?\n\nThe answer is D, obviously-or at least it would be obvious if you knew that the question is part of an online course, called \" On Combat ,\" that is steeped in a pseudo-academic field called \"killology,\" and that the instructor and creator, Dave Grossman , is the foremost killologist on the planet. When I decided recently to learn how to be a warrior cop, Grossman's course is where I turned.\n\nI am not a cop and will almost certainly never become one. But earlier this year, I became very interested in understanding how police officers think-how the mindsets they nurture might be related to outcomes such as the killings of Breonna Taylor in Louisville, Kentucky, and George Floyd in Minneapolis, and the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. The nationwide protest movement that erupted in May has called attention to the problem of overaggressive and racist policing in America, raising some very specific questions about police training and threat-assessment methods, situational escalation, and police tolerance of community dissent. In the background of all of this is the ongoing militarization of the American police department. Many cops these days are functionally indistinguishable from soldiers-in terms of the gear they use, the image they project, and the mindset that they embody.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons for this evolution. As Radley Balko writes in his 2013 Rise of the Warrior Cop , much of it has to do with federal incentives for police departments to pursue this country's endless war on drugs. But another answer is that there is a cottage industry of trainers and consultants who encourage police to see their beats as a battlefield.\n\nA retired Army lieutenant colonel with a master's of education in counseling psychology , Dave Grossman is one of America's best-known independent police trainers-and one of the foremost exponents of the \"warrior cop\" mindset. Under the aegis of his Killology Research Group -he defines killology as \"the scholarly study of the destructive act, just as sexology is the scholarly study of the procreative act\"-Grossman travels the country offering continuing-education seminars to cops and cop-adjacents. He musters scientific research, anecdotal evidence, and a boatload of presuppositions in order to prepare his students for the realities of combat, while valorizing the notion that the thin blue line is humanity's last bulwark against total societal collapse.\n\nMany have argued that \"warrior cop\"-style training seminars teach law enforcement officers to start from a place of fear, which can lead them to quickly turn peaceful situations violent. The officer who shot and killed Philando Castile during a 2016 traffic stop in Falcon Heights, Minnesota, had attended a \"Bulletproof Warrior\" course co-taught by Grossman and a colleague, Jim Glennon, two years earlier. Over his career, according to the Minneapolis Star Tribune , that officer had clocked more than 100 hours of trainings on topics such as firearms usage, street survival, and the use of force-but had only attended two hours of deescalation training.\n\nA lot of cops want to hear from Grossman-and so did I. Though I couldn't take one of his in-person courses- Grossman's touring calendar , normally packed with engagements, has been empty since the pandemic began-I decided to spend $79 to take the online version of \"On Combat\" that can be found on his Grossman Academy website (the other courses are \"On Killing\" and \"The Bulletproof Mind\"). The class is divided into eight hourlong units. Each is effectively an enhanced PowerPoint presentation, with Grossman narrating the slides that appear on screen. Occasionally, as a treat, Grossman himself will pop up on screen to tell a story or underscore a point. Each unit ends with a five-question multiple-choice quiz, but the quizzes are not particularly challenging, and students can take them over and over again until they get a passing grade.\n\nI came away with a certificate of completion from Grossman Academy (the o in \"Grossman\" is a rifle sight), an abiding dislike for the term sheepdog , and a much better sense of how and why so many American police officers seem to believe that the streets of America are effectively a war zone-and why the average American police department seems so resistant to reform.\n\nYou can define a police officer's job in a lot of ways: to solve crimes, to maintain order, to help people in need. In the first unit of \"On Combat,\" Grossman characterizes cops as basically like the Avengers, but with more body armor and less public accountability. \"Think about it,\" Grossman says, \"if we went but a single generation without men and women who are willing to go out every day and confront evil, then within the span of that generation we should surely be both damned and doomed.\"\n\nGrossman's America is a terrifying place where police are both the primary targets of and defenders against superpredation. \"Increasingly the police must face organized opponents armed with assault rifles and bombs,\" Grossman says at the outset of the class, citing an \"explosion in violent crime\" and an \"extraordinary rise in violence\" in the streets of America . (The online course bears a copyright date of 2014; many of the incidents that Grossman cites throughout the course happened in the 1990s.) Though many independent sources show that the violent crime rate in America has steadily declined since the early 1990s, Grossman maintains that America is now scarier than ever-and that cops may well be the ones with the most to fear. \"We know that if it were not for all the body armor, bulletproof vests worn by officers, law enforcement fatalities in the United States would easily be double or even triple what they are today,\" Grossman asserts. \"If this is not war, then you tell me what is.\"\n\nWell, war is war: combat waged between states, or states and state-adjacent groups, or states and organized insurrections that hope to topple the state. What Grossman is describing is violent crime, the penalties for which are prescribed by civilian codes of law. But Grossman, who spent decades in the U.S. Army, doesn't just blur the line between soldiers and police officers: He completely erases it.\n\nWhen people talk about military-style policing, they are often referring to the militarized gear and weaponry that many police departments prefer these days: the body armor, the semi-automatic rifles, the armored SWAT Humvees equipped to recapture Fallujah. But the gear is just a symptom of these departments' gradual adoption of the premise that the world is now a theater of war and that battles are most easily won through the liberal use of shock and awe. \"You've probably heard of the Big Bang Theory,\" Grossman says in Unit 2. \"I call this the Bigger Bang Theory, which states that, all other things being equal, in combat, whoever makes the bigger bang wins.\" Combat has clear military connotations, and Grossman's frequent use of the term undergirds the course's martial framing.\n\nGrossman wants cops to develop \"autopilot responses\" so that they will not be caught flat-footed when confronted by an armed suspect. \"Is it possible to see a gun pointed at you, draw your own weapon, and shoot without conscious thought?\" Grossman asks. \"Not only is it possible, in this case it is highly desirable. Of course, his training must be state-of-the-art, so that he knows instantly that the threat is indeed a gun, and not a wallet or a cellphone.\" In practice, many cops have had trouble clearing this threat-assessment barrier.  (\"You shot four bullets into him, sir. He was just getting his license and registration, sir,\" Castile's girlfriend told the cop who shot and killed him.)\n\nGrossman makes sure to clarify that deadly force should be used \"only under the rules of engagement,\" and very few people would disagree with that caveat. But rules of engagement is also a military term, and its usage is just another willful conflation of policing and war. Grossman invokes terrorist attacks, school shootings, and a \"large-scale epidemic of preteen and teenage mass murderers\" who have been trained to kill on \"murder simulator\" video games-he spends a lot of time on this last point, and it is fairly exhausting-in order to argue that your local Officer Friendly should prepare himself to go ahead and unleash his inner G.I. Joe.\n\n\"As a cop, or a peacekeeper, your job is not to kill. It is to serve and protect. To do that, you may have to kill,\" he says in Unit 4. \"The most effective way to stop someone is to fire a bullet into his central nervous system. It is up to God and the paramedics as to whether the man dies. Your job is to stop the deadly threat, and the most effective way to do that is to make the threat die.\" Throughout \"On Combat,\" Grossman is very, very clear that police officers must be ready to manifest the will to kill-and to deal with the aftermath of having done so.\n\n\"On Combat\" borrows from Grossman's book of the same name, which he co-wrote with Loren W. Christensen. In it, Grossman draws on his academic background to break down the neurological, physiological, and emotional responses that participants can expect to experience before, during, and after combat situations. It's true that cops who are better able to control and understand their bodies and emotions while on duty are probably less likely to act recklessly. But Grossman's goal isn't to stop cops from killing; it's to train them to do so more efficiently. To this end, he wants his students to understand how their minds and bodies work so that they can suppress any intrinsic resistance when it's time to pull the trigger.\n\n\"Any natural or learned resistance to killing, any sense of the sanctity of human life, any human emotions, any remorse or compassion at the moment of truth can all be overcome and overwhelmed with training,\" Grossman says in Unit 2. What's more, he says, even a post-traumatic stress reaction can be averted with training. He acknowledges that killing in the line of duty can be very unsettling. He presents a lot of material on how a cop might expect to feel after having done so, and how their colleagues and family can help them process and cope with the experience. Grossman does not deny the reality of PTSD. But he also argues that cops who kill need not be scarred for life by their actions. \"If you do the rationalization and acceptance ahead of time, if you prepare yourself and immerse yourself in the lore and spirit of mature warriors, past and present, then the lawful, legitimate use of deadly force does not have to be a self-destructive or traumatic event,\" Grossman says.\n\nGrossman wants his students to become \"mature warriors\" who can sleep at night untroubled by the bodies they've left in their wake. Though Grossman recently told the Spokane, Washington, Spokesman-Review that the warrior model is not central to his training methods, it was certainly a large part of the course I took, which anyone can take right now. \"We are warriors,\" he says in Unit 1, and the theme recurs throughout the course. Unit 4 literally features a slide of a uniformed cop standing next to a medieval suit of armor, as if to underscore the ostensible link between the paladins of yore and the SWAT teams of today.\n\nGrossman refers to his students as \"sheepdogs,\" battle-ready protectors who are innately responsible for-and tacitly superior to-their noncombatant charges. \"We know that the sheep live in denial; that is what makes them sheep. They do not want to believe that there is evil in the world,\" says Grossman. \"They can accept the fact that fires can happen, which is why they want fire extinguishers, fire sprinklers, fire alarms, and fire exits throughout their kids' schools. But many of them are outraged at the idea of putting an armed police officer in their kids' school.\" (\"On Combat\" doesn't consider whether putting armed cops in schools may well be a solution in search of a problem. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that the presence of armed officers does not serve to deter school shooters or reliably stop shootings in progress.)\n\nBut what recourse do the sheep have when the sheepdog becomes the wolf? The course spends no time acknowledging any of the ways in which cops may abuse their power, and it certainly does not acknowledge the long history of ongoing mistrust between many communities and their police departments. Though I did not expect him to-the name of the course is \"On Combat,\" after all, not \"A People's History of Police Work\"-Grossman does not address the social construction of crime and criminality, or the historically racist coding of \"tough on crime\" policies and rhetoric, or the political origins of this country's endless drug war, or any other factors that might complicate his Manichean thesis. He sees no oppression in the sight of warrior cops forever riding roughshod through \"bad\" neighborhoods like members of an occupying army. He does not stop to consider that treating the \"war on crime\" like an actual war tacitly encourages cops to take less care with the lives of their \"enemies\"-nor does he acknowledge that those disposable lives are all too often Black ones.\n\nWhile Grossman does spend part of Unit 3 discussing the phenomenon of civilians filming on-duty cops, he does so in the course of disparaging the tapers' motives and advancing his \"cops are under siege\" motif: \"Sometimes these videographers do creative editing to make the police look bad and then take the doctored videotape to the media.\" Grossman has little use for the media. \"Do the media people know that they are hurting people? Of course. They even admit it. Do they care? Apparently not,\" Grossman says in Unit 6. \"We are dealing with an industry functioning at the moral level of drug dealers; in fact, one of their objectives is to convince us to legalize drugs.\" He also blames violent video games and entertainment products as prime factors in America's alleged decline and fall-an argument you hear often from gun proponents looking for an alternative explanation for shootings. \"Violent video games are murder simulators,\" he says, \"except when police officers and soldiers use them for training, in which case they are combat simulators.\"\n\nTo Grossman, who makes much of school shootings as the proving grounds for game-addled, kill-crazed teens, the difference is clear. To others, the difference between \"murder\" and \"combat\" might not be so obvious. In 2019, according to Education Week , eight people in America were killed in a school shooting; 35 people were killed that way in 2018. But 999 people in America were shot and killed by the police in 2019, according to the Washington Post , and in 2018, 990 people were killed that way. Even if 95 percent of these deadly police shootings were unquestionably justifiable, the body count of the remaining 5 percent would still be higher than the body count from the school shootings that Grossman repeatedly cites as proof that it's war out there.\n\nBut the streets of America are not a war zone. Police work is not combat. Cops are not soldiers. Property damage is not a capital offense, Black men and women are not targets for shooting practice, and Americans demanding police reform are not tantamount to some fifth column of saboteurs. In the wake of the Floyd case and other incidents, communities across America are asking their police departments to reconsider their roles and responsibilities, to pursue demilitarization, and to learn to deescalate the dangerous situations that they too often create.\n\nGrossman has not, as far as I can tell, gone on record with his thoughts about this summer's police reform movement. But in recent years, his style of trainings has seen a backlash from municipalities that now find them troubling, as well as a counterbacklash from police officials who seemingly can't get enough of the \"will to kill.\" When Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey banned warrior cop-style courses in 2019, the local police union offered to pay for any cop who wanted to take one. When a woman in Spokane, Washington, launched a petition earlier this year to urge the county sheriff's office to cancel an upcoming \"mindset bootcamp\" seminar from Grossman, the sheriff vowed that the course would go on as planned. \"I am tired of being bullied by political rights and left,\" the sheriff told the Spokesman-Review ; earlier this month, he told a local television station that the opposition was spearheaded by \"a group of progressive socialist[s]\" who are \"actually promoting a lie about the training.\"\n\nYou want to know the truth about the training? Take it from me, a proud holder of a certificate of completion from Grossman Academy: \"On Combat\" teaches its students to fear and resent the people they serve, to willfully mistake this contempt for bravery, and to believe that heroism is conferred by the barrel of a smoking gun. This philosophy, as manifested by the countless police officers and officials who subscribe to it, is and will continue to be one of the foremost impediments to meaningful efforts at police reform in towns across America. \"If we do not keep the warrior in the mix, we become glorified social workers with guns,\" Grossman says very early in \"On Combat\"-and even if that's what the communities whose taxes pay their salaries want from their police officers, Grossman implies that it is those officers' patriotic duty to resist.\n\n\"In this dark hour, our mission is to rise up and nurture the next generation of warriors,\" Grossman says at the very end of the course, his words illustrated by a photograph of a cop standing in the middle of a city street. The cop's arms are crossed. He wears mirrored sunglasses, a baseball cap that says \"POLICE,\" and a resolute half-smirk on his face, as if daring the sheep and wolves alike to try to move him off his spot.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

According to records, the original description of the suspect was for a white man who had been creating a disturbance in the store, but a man later claimed he was assaulted by a Black man and pointed at McAlpin - a claim that was disputed by store employees and surveillance video, KNXV-TV reported .\n\nMcAlpin was initially charged with felony assault and resisting arrest following the Aug. 19 encounter with Phoenix police, but the charges were dropped on Oct. 17.\n\nThe decision to drop the charges against McAlpin was announced by Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell, who said in a statement that she personally reviewed the case after a member of the local chapter of the NAACP expressed concern over the incident and poured through \"a large volume of video recordings, police reports, and other materials that have been forwarded to my office.\"\n\n\"I also convened a large gathering of senior attorneys and members of the community to hear their opinions as they pertain to this case,\" Mitchell said. \"I have now completed my review and have made the decision to dismiss all remaining charges against Mr. McAlpin.\"\n\nIn the body camera video, police are seen pulling up to McAlpin and ordering him down to the ground. He doesn't appear to immediately comply. The video then shows the officers punching him 10 times in the head and shocking him with a stun gun four times while yelling: \"Get your hands behind your back.\"\n\nMcAlpin's attorney said that his client, who is deaf, didn't know what was going on and could not hear the commands.\n\n\"It is our sincere hope that the County Attorney's Office will respond to what is shown in the video and to the voices in the community who have raised alarms about what is shown in the video and will dismiss all charges against Tyron,\" McAlpin's attorney, Jesse Showalter, told ABC News in a statement on Oct. 14.\n\nABC News reached out to Showalter for additional comment after the charges against his client were dropped.\n\nInterim Phoenix Police Chief Michael Sullivan said in a statement on Oct. 16 that the Professional Standard Bureau (PSB) launched an internal investigation shortly after the incident took place.\n\n\"Their work is important to ensure all facts are known before drawing any conclusions. I ask for the public's patience during that process,\" Sullivan said.\n\n\"I recognize the video is disturbing and raises a lot of questions. I want to assure the community we will get answers to those questions,\" he added.\n\nAccording to Sullivan, the findings of the PSB will be reviewed by himself, as well as by the Office of Accountability and Transparency and the Civilian Review Board \"to ensure it is thorough and complete.\"\n\nAsked if there are any updates in the investigation, a spokesperson for the Phoenix Police Department did not immediately respond to ABC News' inquiry.\n\nABC News' Sean Keane contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Ex-officers charged in Tyre Nichols beating death 'laughed' over 'dying body': prosecutor\n\nThe three officers, who face life in prison, have pleaded not guilty.\n\nOpening statements began on Wednesday in the federal trial of three former Memphis police officers charged in connection with the January 2023 beating death of Tyre Nichols.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Rogers presented the prosecution's case, explaining to jurors what evidence they can expect to see and warned them that they will watch and hear \"horrifying\" body camera video and audio over the course of the trial, according to WATN, the ABC affiliate in Memphis covering the case in the courtroom.\n\n\"They stood by his dying body and laughed,\" Rogers said, describing what happened after the officers were finished beating Nichols, according to WATN. \"These will not be easy days.\"\n\nDefense attorneys for the former officers -- Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith -- also began presenting opening statements.\n\nJohn Perry, Bean's defense attorney, told jurors that they can expect to see that the evidence will show the officers did their job, according to WATN.\n\n\"It will take you 5 minutes to deliberate,\" Perry said, according to WATN.\n\nMichael Stengel, Haley's attorney, said that Nichols did not stop for 2 miles after officers turned on their police lights, according to WATN. Stengel claimed that there is no evidence that the officer knew who was driving at the time and there was no personal vendetta concerning rumors of a woman.\n\n\"When they got the wallet [of Nichols] after the stop, that's when they learned who it was,\" Stengel said, according to WATN.\n\nBean, Haley and Smith, along with two other officers involved in the incident, were charged on Sept. 12, 2023, with violating Nichols' civil rights through excessive use of force, unlawful assault, failing to intervene in the assault and failing to render medical aid - charges that carry a maximum penalty of life in prison, according to the U.S. Department of Justice. The 4-count indictment also charged all five officers with conspiring to engage in misleading conduct by attempting to falsify or intentionally withholding details of the arrest in statements and to a supervisor - charges that carry up to 20 years in prison, per the DOJ.\n\nBean, Haley and Smith have pleaded not guilty to all charges.\n\nDesmond Mills Jr. and Emmitt Martin III, the two additional officers who were also charged in this case, have pleaded guilty to some of the federal charges.\n\nMartin pleaded guilty to excessive force and failure to intervene, as well as conspiracy to witness tamper, according to court records. The other two charges will be dropped at sentencing, which has been scheduled for Dec. 5, according to the court records.\n\nMills pleaded guilty to two of the four counts in the indictment -- excessive force and failing to intervene, as well as conspiring to cover up his use of unlawful force, according to the DOJ. The government said it will recommend a maximum penalty of 15 years in prison, based on the terms of Mills's plea agreement.\n\nTyre Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells, who attended opening statements, told reporters on Wednesday that she hopes the jury will return a guilty verdict.\n\n\"Our hope is that they're found guilty and to show the world that my son was a good person and he wasn't the criminal that they're trying to make him out to be,\" she said.\n\nABC News reached out to the attorneys representing the officers but requests for comment were not immediately returned.\n\nNichols, 29, died on Jan. 10, 2023 - three days after a traffic stop captured in body camera footage and surveillance footage, which allegedly shows officers violently striking Nichols repeatedly and walking around, talking to each other as Nichols was injured and sitting on the ground. He was also pepper-sprayed and tased during the incident. The beating triggered protests and calls for police reform.\n\nPolice said Nichols was pulled over for reckless driving, though Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn Davis said she has been unable to substantiate that.\n\nBody camera footage shows Nichols getting away from the officers after the initial stop, but he was apprehended minutes later by the officers. He then sustained multiple punches, kicks and hits from a baton from the officers.\n\nNichols was transferred to the hospital in critical condition where he later died. The medical examiner's official autopsy report for Nichols showed he \"died of brain injuries from blunt force trauma,\" the district attorney's office told Nichols' family in May 2023.\n\nWhile Nichols' mother has said that first responders told her he was drunk and high, the autopsy report shows that his blood alcohol level was .049, the DA's office said. The district attorney's office told the family that was \"well less than the legal limit to drive.\"\n\nThe five former officers charged in this case were all members of the Memphis Police Department SCORPION unit - a crime suppression unit that has since been disbanded after Nichols' death.\n\nRogers told the jury on Wednesday that the SCORPION unit followed an alleged rule that they called the \"run tax,\" according to WATN, where it was understood that the first person to reach a running suspect would beat them.\n\nPerry claimed that his client, Bean, was not present at the initial stop and only arrived at the second scene after hearing a call on dispatch radio, according to WATN.\n\nThe five officers charged in connection to Nichols' death were all fired for violating the policies of the Memphis Police Department.\n\nAll five former officers also face state felony charges, including second-degree murder, aggravated assault and aggravated kidnapping, in connection with Nichols' death. They pleaded not guilty.\n\nABC News' Sabina Ghebremedhin contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

So, in my mind, that was one of the first indicators, 'hey, maybe this is not just a normal protest.'\"\n\nPingeon recalls his team being outnumbered and says he was punched in the face by rioters who had descended on the Capitol that day to protest the certification of the 2020 presidential election results, fueled by false claims about election fraud spread by Former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"I was knocked on my back,\" Pingeon said. \"My helmet came down and felt like someone was on top of me and I couldn't see anything. And I remember just thinking, I have to protect my gun, because they stole my baton.\"\n\nPingeon wasn't injured as severely as other officers, but he has invisible scars that may never fully heal.\n\nHe returned to work shortly after the riot and served in the Capitol Police for another nine more months as the memory of Jan. 6 became politicized. He has since left law enforcement.\n\n\"Right after Jan. 6, it seemed like everybody was on the same page,\" Pingeon said. \"This is not OK. Then very quickly the narrative shifted. And that was really difficult to see.\"\n\nApproximately 140 Capitol Police officers were injured by rioters, making it one of the most violent days for law enforcement in recent U.S. history.\n\nFour officers who responded to the Capitol attack have since died by suicide.\n\nCapitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick died after suffering multiple strokes hours after he was pepper sprayed by rioters. The Washington DC medical examiner ruled he died of natural causes, but said his experience on Jan. 6 played a role in his condition.\n\nDespite the deaths and injuries to officers, a months-long investigation by ABC News found conservative figures, including Trump, have begun to downplay the violence on Jan. 6, painting that day as a largely peaceful protest and recasting imprisoned rioters as \"hostages.\"\n\nDerrick Evans, a former West Virginia House of Delegates and congressional candidate who served three months in federal prison for charges related to Jan. 6, repeated many of those false claims in an interview with ABC News.\n\n\"Do I think that anyone should be fighting police officers? No, I do not,\" Evans said. \"I think it's wrong to do that. The police officers are the ones that really started the whole violence over there.\"\n\nWinston Pingeon reacted strongly.\n\n\"That's not true,\" he said when ABC News played video of Evans' comments for the former Capitol Police officer. \"We were there protecting. We were there to hold a line. We're not pushing back unless we're pushed on first.

The incident is the subject of an \"ongoing internal investigation,\" according to the statement.\n\nThe department told CNN last week the officers had not been placed on leave.\n\n\"There are many who are concerned after seeing the video of officers' interaction with a man they later learned was disabled.

      "text": "6 ex-officers, some of whom called themselves 'The Goon Squad,' plead guilty to state charges in torture of 2 Black men\n\nSix former Mississippi law enforcement officers pleaded guilty Monday to all state charges against them stemming from the torture and abuse this year of two Black men, one of whom was shot in the mouth.\n\nTheir pleas Monday came after the former officers - five of them deputies for the Rankin County Sheriff's Office, the sixth an officer for the Richland Police Department - pleaded guilty this month to federal charges in connection to the same January incident, which the victims have claimed was motivated by their race.\n\nFormer deputies Christian Dedmon, Hunter Elward, Brett McAlpin, Jeffrey Middleton and Daniel Opdyke and ex-police officer Joshua Hartfield were each charged with conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice, according to a news release from the Mississippi Attorney General's Office .\n\nRelated article Tasers, taunts, torment: How 6 White officers subjected 2 Black men to hours of grueling violence, and then tried to cover it up\n\nAdditionally, Dedmon was charged with home invasion and Elward was charged with home invasion and aggravated assault, the release says. McAlpin, Middleton, Opdyke and Hartfield each faced an additional charge of first-degree obstruction of justice.\n\nAll six appeared with their attorneys in Rankin County court Monday, shackled at the wrists and wearing prison jumpsuits. The names of the county jails in which they are being held were covered by duct tape.\n\nThe former officers pleaded guilty August 3 to federal charges in the case, in which US prosecutors said the former officers kicked down the door of a home in Braxton, Mississippi, where the Black men were living and assaulted them for two hours.\n\nThe officers did not have a warrant, and some \"called themselves 'The Goon Squad' because of their willingness to use excessive force and not to report it,\" according to a federal charging document.\n\nThe six officers were charged with a combined 13 felonies in connection with \"the torture and physical abuse\" of the two men that night, the Justice Department said in a news release.\n\nCNN has reached out to attorneys for each of the men for comment but did not receive a response from those representing McAlpin and Dedmon. Attorneys for Middleton, Elward and Hartfield declined to comment.\n\nAn attorney for Opdyke said the former officer \"has admitted to his wrongdoing\" and will plead guilty to all charges against him in Rankin County Circuit Court on August 14.\n\n\"He takes responsibility for his part in the horrific harms perpetrated on Mr. Jenkins and Mr. Parker, the victims, and is prepared to face the consequences of his misconduct,\" reads a statement to CNN from Opdyke's attorney, Jeffery Reynolds.\n\nThe victims, Michael Jenkins and Eddie Parker, filed a federal lawsuit in June, alleging the officers illegally entered their home and handcuffed, kicked, waterboarded and tased them and attempted to sexually assault them over nearly two hours, before one of the deputies put a gun in Jenkins' mouth and shot him.\n\nThe deputies, \"in their repeated use of racial slurs in the course of their violent acts, were oppressive and hateful against their African-American victims,\" the lawsuit says. \"Defendants were motivated on the basis of race and the color of the skin of the persons they assaulted.\"\n\nParker enjoyed seeing the \"walk of shame\" during the plea hearing Monday, he told reporters afterward.\n\n\"I hope this is a lesson to everybody out there. Justice will be served.\"\n\nAccording to a federal charging document , Dedmon texted Elward, Middleton and Opdyke on January 24 about going to the property in Braxton to resolve a complaint received by McAlpin. McAlpin's White neighbor told him several Black men were staying at a White woman's home and reported seeing suspicious behavior.\n\nDedmon warned the deputies there might be surveillance cameras on the property, telling them to knock on the door instead of kicking it down if they saw any, the document stated. Otherwise, they could barge in without a warrant, the document continued.\n\nRelated article 6 former Mississippi law enforcement officers have pleaded guilty to charges related to the torture of 2 Black men\n\n\"No bad mug shots,\" he said, meaning, prosecutors said, the defendants could use excessive force on parts of the body that would not be seen in a mug shot, according to the charging document. Dedmon told the others Hartfield would accompany them.\n\nAvoiding a surveillance camera above the front door, Dedmon, Opdyke and Elward broke open the carport door while Hartfield kicked open the back door, the document stated. They encountered Parker, who was living there to help take care of the woman who owned the property, and his friend Jenkins, who was staying there temporarily.\n\nOver the next two hours, the two men were subjected to grueling violence at the hands of the White officers, the document said. They were repeatedly tased and called racial slurs, and the officers poured milk, alcohol and chocolate syrup in their mouths. Elward threw eggs at the men, and Dedmon poured grease on Parker's head, according to the document.\n\nRelated video Officers belonging to self-described 'goon squad' plead guilty to torturing two Black men\n\nEventually, Elward removed a bullet from his gun, forced Jenkins onto his knees and put the gun into his mouth, the document stated. Elward fired the gun, which did not discharge, then racked the slide, put the gun back in Jenkins' mouth and pulled the trigger again, according to the document. The bullet lacerated Jenkins' tongue, broke his jaw and went out through his neck.\n\nAccording to the charging document, the officers then devised a cover story and discussed planting a gun Middleton had in his patrol car on Jenkins. Instead, Elward planted a BB gun, and the officers discarded one shell casing, the document stated. Hartfield threw the men's soiled clothes in the woods and took the hard drive from the home's surveillance system before throwing it in a creek, according to the document.\n\nRankin County Sheriff Bryan Bailey announced in June deputies had been fired, though he did not say how many or their names. The Richland Police Department announced in July that Hartfield - who was off-duty at the time of the alleged assault - had resigned.\n\nBailey, who does not face any charges, has said he will not resign. In a statement Monday, he said he hoped the \"guilty pleas bring some sense of justice\" to Parker and Jenkins.\n\n\"The Rankin County Sheriff's Office continues to evaluate and modify its policies, procedures, and training for all sheriff's office employees,\" Bailey said. \"We have asked for assistance from outside agencies and contracted with outside firms to evaluate us, make recommendations, and conduct training. These actions are taken to prevent anything like January's tragedy from ever happening again.\"\n\nBailey is running unopposed for reelection in November.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this story gave the incorrect date for when the officers entered guilty pleas to federal charges. It was August 3.\n\nCNN's Emma Tucker, Ryan Young, Devon Sayers, Pamela Kirkland and Raja Razek contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

      "text": "Why police forces are struggling to recruit and keep officers\n\nIn a growing number of American cities, if you call the police, there are fewer officers taking the call.\n\nPolice departments across the nation are raising concerns about current and future staffing levels. CNN reached out to nearly 20 departments nationwide, along with other key stakeholders including elected officials, union officials and outside recruiters for departments for this story.\n\nThey all point to similar concerns including Covid-19, the great resignation, the climate for law enforcement and local reform efforts that are making recruitment and retention difficult.\n\nThe challenges have led the chief of police in Durham, North Carolina, to join her officers in patrolling her own city. The department is down 90 officers out of a budgeted force of 627. The department has started to offer a $5,000 bonus for new hires to fill its ranks.\n\n\"It's been tough,\" Chief Patrice Andrews said of the current staffing issues facing her city. \"We've had to be very creative with staffing, you know, putting investigators and those that typically wouldn't necessarily be taking 911 calls, putting them back on the street.\"\n\n\"The 911 calls don't stop. People are still having emergencies, the emergencies don't stop and certainly the emergencies don't care if you are 60% staffed or below,\" Andrews told CNN while she was on patrol. \"This profession is, is something we were all called to do and not everyone is meant to be the police. This profession is certainly a noble one, even yet and still, despite everything, this profession is certainly noble.\"\n\nA national survey from June of 2021 found that departments around the country on average were filling 93% of budgeted positions available, according to the Police Executive Research Forum .\n\n\"You've got a workforce that's being compressed on the front end, you've got a drop in people who want to be cops. And on the other end, you have a significant increase in people who are resigning and retiring. And we have a survey that we did (that found a) 44% increase in retirements, 18% increase in resignations (in police departments),\" according to Police Executive Research Forum President Chuck Wexler.\n\nOn average, officers spend 8 months training before they can patrol the streets alone, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics . Meaning, it will take years to fill the open jobs at departments across the country, Wexler said.\n\nRelated article DeSantis says plan to offer $5,000 bonuses to out-of-state police relocating to Florida is not related to vaccine mandates\n\n\"It's a trying time to be a police officer in this country,\" Wexler said. \"So, police chiefs are wondering who are going to be the cops of the future.\"\n\nDepartments are also struggling daily to cover those out sick due to Covid-19, and higher rates of crime, Wexler and several departments said.\n\nIn Philadelphia, the department is down 440 officers or 7% of the number of police officers budgeted for the city, the department told CNN.\n\n\"Well, right now it's not a very desirable job,\" John McNesby, head of the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), told CNN. \"Everything that's been going on around the country for the last couple of years. ... But right now, I mean just getting people to apply is a monster in itself.\"\n\nDuring a recent recruitment event, 600 people said they would attend, only 200 showed up and only 26 moved on to the physical assessment phases, McNesby said. The FOP also points to a recently passed requirement that requires all applicants to have lived in the city for at least a year, as an additional challenge to find new officers in the city of brotherly love.\n\nIn Atlanta, which like many cities in America also saw unrest in the wake of the murder of George Floyd, two incidents of police use of force also put pressure on the local community. Community outreach events like Clippers and Cops, held in local barbershops around the city, are trying to \"bridge the gap\" between the community and the police. The events allow officers to open a dialogue between themselves and the citizens who they serve and protect, participants say.\n\nDuring an appearance at the event this month, Andre Dickens, the newly elected mayor of Atlanta, said he is working to get the police department back to full strength.\n\n\"The goal is to be smart on crime, and so we have to have a balanced approach to safety and justice,\" Dickens said. \"That means getting more officers in because we lost about 400 to 500 officers over the past three years. So I'm trying to get those 400 officers back, but training them in conflict resolution and skills on how to de-escalate issues so that they can be better community-based cops.\"\n\nThe mayor said a number of issues contributed to the decrease in the rank and file. \"There was a morale challenge across the last couple of years with Covid and with a lot of issues related to police, excessive use of force that went unchecked, but then ... everybody said get rid of police and these sorts of things,\" Dickens said.\n\nThe founder of Clippers and Cops was one of those 400 officers who left the department. Detective Tyrone Dennis retired from the force in August 2020, moved back to St. Louis, Missouri, to be with his family and took a job as a director of school safety, a job that paid more than being a police officer.\n\n\"They got to do better with pay ... incentives to retain officers,\" he said. \"It would be foolish for me to stay for $48,000. When I have a wife and three kids to feed for $48,000. I can almost qualify for public assistance. That's not cool,\" Dennis said.\n\n\"Basically we're one bullet away from death, and one mistake away from indictment so why roll the dice with my future when I can go do something else?\" Dennis said.\n\nPolice leadership also say that pay should be more in line with work requirements. \"When you think of what the line of work calls for and what they're having to do, they're wanting to be compensated, you know, but also to they've got to be able to support their families. You know, we have officers that can't even qualify for apartments because their, their income doesn't match up with what the apartments require. That's a problem,\" Andrews said.\n\nIn Phoenix, the police department is sending detectives and officers from various specialty assignments to patrol. Last month, the department started to take additional reports virtually rather than send officers out, police department spokesperson Sgt. Andy Williams told CNN.\n\nRelated article Bans on chokeholds for federal officers latest in nationwide push to hold police to a 'higher standard'\n\nThe police department is down 13% of its allotment of officers, according to data provided by Phoenix Police to CNN.\n\nIt is offering hiring bonuses of up to $8,700 dollars for new hires with college degrees, the department said.\n\nIn Winston-Salem, North Carolina, Police Chief Catriana A. Thompson says the situation is \"alarming.\" The department is down 96 officers or 18% of its allotted force. Some of the department's \"specialized units have been disbanded temporarily until staffing levels improve,\" Thompson told CNN in a statement.\n\nReliant Hiring Solutions, a firm that works with law enforcement around the country to set up job fairs, said it was more difficult to find recruits in more \"liberal cities,\" Randall Blanchard, told CNN.\n\nIn Seattle, the department is experiencing \"unprecedented\" losses of staff, the department told CNN. The department is short more than 225 officers or 17% of its workforce.\n\nRelated article Freddie Gray case fallout has put Baltimore 'ahead of the game' with police reform. There's much work still to be done\n\n\"Our losses over the last two years have been unprecedented,\" police department spokesperson Sgt. Randy Hyserik told CNN. \"Many of our newer officers separated from our department and moved to smaller agencies in the area, and some left law enforcement altogether. In their exit interviews, many cited the 'defund' movement and a lack of support from local elected officials as their reason for leaving our department, or for leaving law enforcement completely.\"\n\nSeattle's attrition rate has over doubled in the last two years. Prior to 2020, the annual attrition rate was 70 to 75 officers a year. The department has had 356 officers leave over the last two years, according to data provided to CNN by the department.\n\nPeople that call police for non-life-threatening calls may have to wait longer for a response, unless staffing levels are improved, \"you may be lucky if you get an officer 2, 3, 4 hours down the line,\" McNesby said.\n\n\"I mean it's easier for me to sit here and talk about it,\" McNesby said, \"but it really affects the people standing at roll calls in the morning when they look to the left and look to the right and there's nobody else there ... or you have a citizen that's on the line ... where they feel the need for police attention and they dial 911 and you're not getting anybody coming.\"\n\nCNN's Kevin Conlon contributed to this report\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "3 officers convicted of witness tampering in Tyre Nichols fatal beating but acquitted of most serious charge\n\nFollow:\n\nThree former Memphis police officers were convicted Thursday in the 2023 fatal beating of Tyre Nichols , but were acquitted of the harshest charges they faced for a death that sparked national protests and calls for broad changes in policing.\n\nJurors deliberated for about six hours before coming back with the mixed verdict for Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith.\n\nAll were convicted of witness tampering related to the cover-up of the beating, but Bean and Smith were acquitted of civil rights charges. Haley was acquitted of violating Nichols' civil rights causing death, but convicted of the lesser charge of violating his civil rights causing bodily injury. He was also convicted of a conspiracy to witness tamper charge that the others were acquitted of.\n\nThe court remained silent as the verdicts were read.\n\nThe judge ordered all three officers to be taken into custody. He planned to hold a hearing Monday to hear from the defense lawyers about releasing them pending sentencing. The witness tampering charges carry possible sentences of up to 20 years in prison. The civil rights charge against Haley carries up to 10 years in prison. They had faced up to life in prison if convicted on the harshest charges.\n\nThe verdict marked a partial setback for prosecutors who were unable to land a conviction for civil rights violations for two officers who played an active role in the encounter. Jurors repeatedly watched graphic clips from police video that showed the officers punch and kick Nichols and hit him with a police baton just steps from his home, as the 29-year-old called out for his mother.\n\nIn a statement, Assistant U.S. Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who oversees the Justice Department's civil rights division, said \"Tyre Nichols should be alive today.\"\n\n\"We hope this prosecution provides some measure of comfort as the law enforcement officers tied to his death have been held accountable,\" Clarke said.\n\nBean and Smith were seen on video wrestling with Nichols and holding his arms, while also hitting him, but the jury was not convinced those actions amounted to civil rights violations. An FBI agent said Smith told him he punched Nichols, but defense lawyers argued Bean and Smith were merely slapping Nichols' hands away as they tried to put handcuffs on him.\n\nRodney Wells, Nichols' stepfather, told The Associated Press outside the courtroom: \"A win is a win. They're all going to jail.\"\n\nFive officers were charged in Nichols' death , but two pleaded guilty and testified against members of their old crime suppression unit.\n\nProsecutors argued that Nichols was beaten for running from a traffic stop, saying it was part of a common police practice referred to in officer slang as a \"street tax\" or a run tax.\" They said the officers lied - to a supervisor, to medical professionals attending to Nichols and in required written reports - about the extent of the force they used.\n\n\"This has been a long journey for our family,\" RowVaughn Wells, Nichols' mother, told reporters. \"I'm actually in shock right now because I still can't believe all the stuff that's going on. But we're happy that they all have been convicted and they have been arrested.\"\n\nRelated article Police delivered a 'beatdown' that killed Tyre Nichols, prosecutor says in trial closing\n\nSmith's lawyer declined to comment. Attorneys for Bean and Haley did not respond to requests for comment sent by phone, text and email after the verdict.\n\nNichols, who was Black, ran from the traffic stop despite being hit with pepper spray and a Taser. The five officers, who were fired after the beating, also are Black.\n\nSome of the most emotional testimony at trial came from one of the officers, Desmond Mills, who took a plea deal in which prosecutors call for up to 15 years in prison. He testified in tears that he was sorry for the beating, that he left Nichols' young son fatherless and that he wishes he stopped the punches. Later, he testified that he went along with a cover-up in hopes that Nichols would survive and the whole thing would \"blow over.\"\n\nNichols died January 10, 2023, three days after the beating. His son is now 7 years old.\n\nThe other officer who reached a deal with prosecutors, Emmitt Martin, testified that Nichols was \"helpless\" while officers pummeled him, and that afterward the officers understood \"they weren't going to tell on me, and I wasn't going to tell on them.\" Under his plea agreement, prosecutors will suggest a prison sentence of up to 40 years.\n\nDefense attorneys sought to portray Martin as a principal aggressor. Martin testified Nichols was not a threat, yet he acknowledged punching and kicking Nichols in the head.\n\nMills' lawyer declined to comment. Martin's attorney did not immediately respond to a phone message.\n\nThe police video shows the officers milling about and talking as Nichols struggles with his injuries. An autopsy report shows he died from blows to the head. The report describes brain injuries, and cuts and bruises on his head and other areas.\n\nWith the federal criminal trial complete, other investigations and court action still aren't settled.\n\nThe five officers also have been charged with second-degree murder in state court, where they pleaded not guilty, although Mills and Martin are expected to change their pleas. A trial date in state court has not been set.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice is conducting a \"patterns and practices\" investigation into how Memphis officers use force and conduct arrests, and whether the department in the majority-Black city engages in racially discriminatory policing.\n\nThe Justice Department also has a separate review concerning use of force, de-escalation strategies and specialized units within Memphis police.\n\nPastor Earle Fisher, a Memphis activist who has long called for investigations of the city's police, said he hopes the probes \"provide for us the remedies we so rightly deserve.\"\n\nAdditionally, Nichols' mother filed a $550 million lawsuit against the city and its police chief.\n\nBen Crump and Anthony Romanucci, lawyers for Nichols' family, said the verdicts \"bring a measure of accountability for his senseless and tragic death.\"\n\n\"Our fight for justice for Tyre is far from over,\" the lawyers said in a joint statement.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "'The day of justice has come': 2 Black men tortured by 6 White law enforcement officers speak before sentencing hearing\n\nFollow:\n\nEddie Parker and Michael Jenkins said they were often not believed when they tried, for months, to tell people about the grueling violence and torture they endured at the hands of six White law enforcement officers, culminating in Jenkins being shot in the mouth.\n\nNow, more than a year later, the men - both of whom are Black - and their attorney say justice may finally come as the White officers who tortured them for nearly two hours are set to be sentenced in federal court this week. Five of the officers face a maximum of 20 years in prison while the sixth could face a maximum of 30 years behind bars.\n\n\"I'm here for a reason,\" Parker said in a tearful interview with CNN on Monday. \"I'm still here fighting and I'm gonna fight.\"\n\nDetails from the January 24, 2023, incident eventually came to light after the two men filed a federal civil rights lawsuit in June. Many of the claims were later borne out by federal prosecutors in August as the six former Mississippi officers pleaded guilty to a combined 13 felonies in connection with the torture and abuse of the two men.\n\n\"The day of justice has finally come for the Rankin County 'Goon Squad,'\" Malik Shabazz, lead attorney for Parker and Jenkins, said Monday. \"It's an important day, not only for Mississippi, but it's an important day for accountability, for police brutality all across America.\"\n\nRelated article Tasers, taunts, torment: How 6 White officers subjected 2 Black men to hours of grueling violence, and then tried to cover it up\n\nParker and Jenkins, along with their families and attorneys, spoke at a news conference in Jackson on Monday afternoon, ahead of the federal sentencing proceedings this week of the former officers, whose actions both victims say was motivated by their own race. Some of the officers called themselves \"The Goon Squad\" because of their willingness to use excessive force and not report it, federal prosecutors said.\n\n\"We want the maximum sentence. We want the sentences to match the crimes because the nation is watching, the world is watching, police officers are watching, the families are watching - and they want justice,\" Shabazz said.\n\nFormer Rankin County Sheriff's deputies Hunter Elward, Brett McAlpin, Christian Dedmon, Daniel Opdyke, Jeffrey Middleton, as well as former Richland Police Department officer Joshua Hartfield, pleaded guilty in August to charges of conspiracy against rights, deprivation of rights under color of law, conspiracy to obstruct justice, and obstruction of justice related to the incident.\n\nParker and Jenkins are expected to testify in federal court this week.\n\nParker, sitting beside Jenkins and Shabazz, described himself to CNN as a \"thornbush,\" saying \"They took my roots, they took out my strength\" but he refused to stop fighting.\n\nWearing a T-shirt with a photo of himself below that of Emmett Till, the 14-year-old Black teen whose murder helped fuel the civil rights movement in the US, Parker fought back tears and said he was happy to be alive and see justice.\n\nWhen asked about the significance of the shirt and the torture Till also went through before his death, Parker noted he didn't know anyone whose face was on a T-shirt and was not dead. \"To be right here,\" he said looking down at the shirt, \"that's an honor for me. That's something nobody can take.\"\n\nAngela English with the NAACP also spoke at the news conference, urging the judge to apply the maximum sentences. \"We can't erase Mississippi's past but we can move forward today and set a precedent that has never been set before,\" English said, adding, \"This is not 1964, it's 2024.\"\n\nShabazz noted the significance of the case and the historical impact of the pending sentences.\n\n\"Never in the history of the United States of America and in this state have you had six police officers plead guilty and be headed to court for sentencing at the same time,\" Shabazz said.\n\nHe added the case stands apart from others in Mississippi. \"A lot of harm has occurred decade after decade in this state,\" he continued.\n\nShabazz told CNN his team met with the Justice Department on Friday ahead of the sentencing proceedings in Jackson.\n\n\"Kristen Clarke, US Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights, has just reached out to Michael Jenkins, Eddie Parker and their families,\" Shabazz told CNN on Friday. \"Clark expressed her commitment to civil rights and to eliminating racial intimidation under the color of law in Mississippi.\"\n\n\"We are deeply appreciative of her department's historic legal efforts,\" he continued.\n\nElward and Middleton are scheduled to be sentenced on Tuesday; Dedmon and Opdyke on Wednesday; and Hartfield and McAlpin on Thursday. Federal prosecutors are seeking the maximum sentences for the officers.\n\nDetails about what the defense attorneys for the six men are seeking in their sentencing proceedings were not immediately available.\n\nElward faces the most serious of federal charges stemming from the 2023 incident - discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence. He faces up to 30 years in prison, the federal charging document shows. McAlpin, Middleton, Dedmon, Opdyke and Hartfield each face up to 20 years in prison.\n\nRelated article 6 former Mississippi law enforcement officers have pleaded guilty to charges related to the torture of 2 Black men\n\n\"The sentence that's given to Hunter Elward, in specific, will send a sign of how the rest of the defendants will be sentenced and it will send a great sign of how serious the judge is about doing justice,\" Shabazz told CNN in an interview Monday, adding he believes the judge in the case \"is going to give out some strong justice.\"\n\nThe incident occurred on January 24, 2023, in Braxton, Mississippi, just southeast of Jackson. In their lawsuit, Jenkins and Parker alleged the officers illegally entered their home and handcuffed, kicked, waterboarded and tased them and attempted to sexually assault them over nearly two hours, before one of the deputies put a gun in Jenkins' mouth and shot him.\n\nThe deputies, \"in their repeated use of racial slurs in the course of their violent acts, were oppressive and hateful against their African-American victims,\" the lawsuit says. \"Defendants were motivated on the basis of race and the color of the skin of the persons they assaulted.\"\n\nShabazz said during Monday's news conference their civil rights litigation is ongoing  and the issues raised in the lawsuit \"have not been resolved.\"\n\nThe attorneys for Parker and Jenkins are asking the Justice Department to open a pattern or practice investigation into misconduct at the Rankin County Sheriff's Department, Shabazz said.\n\n\"We absolutely believe that the 'Goon Squad' is not limited to the six officers facing sentencing,\" he said. \"We know it's a lot deeper.\"\n\nThree of the officers, Dedmon, Elward and Opdyke, also pleaded guilty in federal court to additional felonies related to a separate incident in December 2022, according to the Justice Department. If convicted on those charges, all three men could face up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine for deprivation of rights. Dedmon faces a maximum sentence of life in prison on the weapons charge.\n\nThe six former officers also pleaded guilty to state charges against them stemming from the same January 2023 incident. Each of the officers were charged with conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice, according to the Mississippi Attorney General's Office.\n\nDedmon is charged with home invasion and Elward is charged with home invasion and aggravated assault. McAlpin, Middleton, Opdyke and Hartfield each face an additional charge of first-degree obstruction of justice. They await sentencing on the state charges.\n\nCNN's Jade Gordon contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "5 former police officers involved in deadly beating of Tyre Nichols indicted on federal charges\n\nFive former Memphis police officers involved in the deadly police beating of Tyre Nichols have been indicted by a federal grand jury, according to court filings.\n\nThe five former officers - Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills Jr. and Justin Smith - are facing several charges, including federal civil rights, conspiracy, and obstruction offenses resulting in Nichols' death.\n\nTyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man, was violently beaten by Memphis police officers in January and died in the hospital from his injuries. Nichols was repeatedly punched and kicked by the five Memphis Police Department officers after the officers conducted a traffic stop and brief foot chase. He required hospitalization after the encounter and died three days later.\n\nRelated article District Attorney drops more than 30 cases involving former officers charged in Tyre Nichols' death\n\n\"Officers who violate the civil rights of those they are sworn to protect undermine public safety, which depends on the community's trust in law enforcement,\" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement.\n\nGarland added, \"The Justice Department will continue to hold accountable officers who betray their oath.\"\n\nThe federal indictment says the five men \"willfully deprived\" Nichols of his constitutional rights \"to be free from an unreasonable seizure, which includes the right to be free from the use of unreasonable force by a police officer.\"\n\nThe former officers \"unlawfully assaulted\" Nichols and \"willfully failed to intervene in the unlawful assault,\" which caused injuries that resulted in his death, the indictment reads.\n\nCNN has reached out to attorneys for the five officers for comment. A lawyer for Justin Smith declined to comment.\n\n\"This is going to cause us to change gears a little bit. This adds another layer of things that we'll have to look into and investigate,\" Blake Ballin, defense attorney for Desmond Mills, told CNN, reacting to the federal indictment.\n\n\"We have been expecting this federal indictment and it does not change Mr. Mills's position,\" Ballin said in another statement to CNN. \"As in the state case, Mr. Mills maintains his innocence. He will turn himself in on the federal indictment and continue to defend himself against all allegations in both the state and federal court systems.\"\n\nThe death reignited a national debate on justice in policing and reform, rocking a nation long accustomed to videos of police brutality, especially against people of color. It also spurred protests and vigils in Memphis and other major US cities.\n\n\"If anything, we are so hopeful that today sent a chilling effect - a chilling effect - on police officers across America,\" said Benjamin Crump, an attorney for the Nichols family, during a news conference Tuesday. \"That not only are you going to be under review by the state, but Merrick Garland and the Biden administration have sent the warning and set a precedent that the federal government is going to defend the civil rights for all American citizens, against anybody, whether they're wearing a badge or not.\"\n\nThe five officers are also facing state charges in Tennessee related to Nichols' death - which they have pleaded not guilty to - and a federal civil lawsuit. All five were terminated by the Memphis Police Department.\n\n\"When some officers violate the Constitution, when they use excessive force, when they ignore serious injuries inflicted on people they arrest, their actions erode the public's trust,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who leads the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division, during a news conference on Tuesday.\n\nSince January 2021, the Justice Department has brought more than 100 prosecutions involving violations of constitutional and legal rights by law enforcement officials. In that same period, the department obtained more than 86 convictions, Clarke said.\n\nBody camera videos and surveillance footage from Nichols' arrest were released on January 27, publicly revealing the severity of the beating, and sparking widespread condemnation from residents and police officials. The county prosecutor said at the time the videos contradicted what officers said happened in the initial police report.\n\nThe initial police report filed in the hours after the traffic stop said Nichols \"started to fight\" with officers and at one point grabbed one of their guns. But neither claim was substantiated in footage of the encounter released by police.\n\nAnd despite the fact that the videos don't appear to show Nichols fighting back, the report identified Nichols as a suspect in an aggravated assault. The report also did not mention the officers punching and kicking Nichols.\n\nThe report also claimed Nichols was pulled over for reckless driving at high speed - another claim not substantiated by video of the encounter.\n\nThe five fired officers were part of the department's specialized SCORPION unit, which was launched in 2021 to take on a rise in violent crime in Memphis. Police permanently deactivated the unit shortly after Nichols' death.\n\nIn the federal indictment, prosecutors also allege the five officers purposefully tried to keep their body-worn cameras out of view of the beating.\n\nAfter the beating, the five detectives attempted to cover up the use of unreasonable force by giving misleading information to and withholding details from their supervisor and the officer tasked with writing an incident, according to the indictment.\n\nOfficers allegedly failed to tell emergency responders that Nichols had been repeatedly struck in the head and allegedly lied about Nichols pulling on the officers' gun belts and being so strong that he lifted two officers off the ground.\n\nRelated article A brutal beating. Cries for his mom. 23-minute delay in aid. Here are the key revelations from the Tyre Nichols police videos\n\nMore than an hour of footage showing the deadly assault released by city officials in January shows multiple officers threatening Nichols with violence while he appears to comply with their commands or is already on the ground.\n\nA body camera video that captures the initial encounter between Nichols and police shows the officer getting out of his car with his gun drawn and captures an officer yelling for Nichols to \"Get the f**k out of the car.\"\n\nNichols is heard saying, \"I didn't do anything,\" and later, as he gets on the ground, \"All right, I'm on the ground.\"\n\nAn officer yells at him, \"B*tch, put your hands behind your back before I ... I'm going to knock your ass the f**k out.\"\n\nNichols says, \"I'm just trying to go home.\"\n\nNichols' family filed a $550 million federal lawsuit in April against the city of Memphis, its police department and what the suit said were \"unqualified, untrained, and unsupervised\" officers assigned to the SCORPION unit.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed by lawyers for Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells, said the fatal beating was the \"direct and foreseeable product of the unconstitutional policies, practices, customs, and deliberate indifference of the City of Memphis\" and its police officials.\n\n\"It is tragic to see a life cut short at 29 with so many milestones unmet, so many words unsaid and so much potential unfulfilled. Tyre Nichols should be alive today. No one in this country should have to bury a loved one because of police violence,\" Clarke said Tuesday.\n\nDuring a news conference Tuesday held by the Nichols family and their attorneys, Wells said her family is \"grateful\" for the indictment against the five former officers.\n\n\"As I've mentioned before, Ty, he was just a free spirit and he really should be here today,\" Wells continued. \"Because of those five police officers, he's not. This is something that I'm gonna have to deal with for the rest of my life - that I will not have my son. But if my son had to leave this Earth in this manner, I'm hoping it was for the greater good.\"\n\nThe Justice Department opened a civil rights investigation into the city of Memphis and its police department in July, seeking to determine whether there are systemic violations of the Constitution or federal law by the agency. The probe is separate from the federal criminal civil rights investigation of the officers, the department said.\n\nLast month, Shelby County District Attorney Steven Mulroy said his office dismissed more than 30 cases involving the five former police officers who were charged in Nichols' death, CNN previously reported.\n\n\"As in any such case, the primary consideration is concern about the credibility as witnesses of discharged officers,\" the district attorney's statement said.\n\nIn addition to the 30 dismissals, charges were reduced in about a dozen other cases, the district attorney's statement said. Mulroy said the changes came after his office reviewed approximately 100 cases involving the officers.\n\nCNN's Josh Campbell , Nick Valencia and Ray Sanchez contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

We were called n***er, we were called monkey, we were called boy, and we were accused of dating White women,\" the statement said.\n\n\"After Hunter Elward shot me, they left me to die bleeding on the floor. And they tried to set me up to be in prison,\" Jenkins' statement said. \"Your honor, they killed me. I just didn't die.\"\n\nEach of the ex-officers faced state charges of conspiracy to commit obstruction of justice.\n\nDedmon was also charged with home invasion, and Elward was also charged with home invasion and aggravated assault.\n\nMcAlpin, Middleton, Opdyke and Hartfield all faced an additional charge of first-degree obstruction of justice.\n\nWhile all of the state sentences will run concurrently with the federal sentences, some of the ex-officers will now spend more time behind bars because of the state charges:\n\n- Elward was sentenced in state court to 25 years in prison, to run concurrently with his federal sentence of 20 years.\n\nRelated article The 'Goon Squad' case yielded stiff sentences.

The Goon Squad might still be corruptly abusing people in Rankin County.\"\n\nWednesday morning's hearing took place in a circuit court that sits in the heart of the Rankin County seat of Brandon - across the street from a Confederate monument - and around 20 miles from the home where the racially charged torture of Parker and Jenkins took place.\n\nThe NAACP started a national petition to remove the 1907 monument, topped by a statue of a Confederate soldier, which they say symbolizes decades of racist culture in the county.\n\nAfter the sentencing hearing, Jenkins and Parker told CNN they were satisfied with the former officers' sentences and felt relieved this case was now over.\n\n\"I sit back and think of everything we went through - the days, the months, moving from state to state, trying to stay safe. I'm glad that it came to an end,\" Parker said.\n\nAfter the incident last January, Parker and Jenkins tried, for months, to tell their story - but often, no one believed them.  Moving forward, Parker and Jenkins said they will embrace being a catalyst for change in Mississippi and continue to fight and be a voice for other potential victims of the \"Goon Squad.\"\n\nParker said he may have found purpose in his own fight for justice: to fight for others who can't or are too scared to.\n\n\"I know people who are out there and still afraid to say something,\" Parker said. \"I'm putting it out there that anybody who is scared or needs someone to talk to - I'll meet you where I need to meet you and make sure no one else has to go through this, where they are afraid or intimidated about anything.\"\n\nFor those who don't have a support system that can help them secure lawyers and fight for justice, Jenkins offered his own support. \"I can imagine how scary that would be fighting against the police,\" he said. \"If you need people and y'all see this, you don't have to be scared.\"\n\nThe torture happened on January 24, 2023, in Braxton, just southeast of Jackson. It came to light after the two victims filed a $400 million federal lawsuit , which is still pending. Many of the claims in the lawsuit were reflected in the federal charging document.\n\nThe two men said the six law enforcement officers illegally entered the home of a woman Parker was helping to care for and where he was also living. They kicked, waterboarded and used Tasers on Jenkins and Parker and attempted to sexually assault them over nearly two hours before Elward put a gun in Jenkins' mouth and shot him.\n\nRelated article 'A momentous day': All 6 rogue Mississippi officers got long prison sentences in 'Goon Squad' torture of 2 Black men\n\nThe officers went to the home after a White neighbor reported that several Black men were staying at a White woman's home and reported seeing suspicious behavior - but in the end the officers found no crime , prosecutors said.\n\nAt least three of them - Elward, Middleton and Opdyke - were part of a group of deputies that called themselves \"The Goon Squad\" because of their willingness to use excessive force and not report it, federal prosecutors said in court documents .\n\n\"This brutal attack caused more than physical harm to these two individual victims; it severed that vital trust with the people,\" Mississippi Attorney General Lynn Fitch said in August when announcing the state charges . \"This abuse of power will not be tolerated.\"\n\nThe former officers pleaded guilty to federal charges of conspiracy against rights, deprivation of rights under color of law, conspiracy to obstruct justice, and obstruction of justice, according to court records. Elward faced the most serious of the federal charges stemming from the torture - discharge of a firearm during a crime of violence.\n\nJustice Department attorneys described in court how Middleton boasted about the group with Rankin County Sheriff's Department emblems branded with the words \"Goon Squad,\" picturing a Confederate flag and a noose.\n\nRankin County NAACP President Angela English said this painful part of law enforcement history shouldn't end with the sentencing of the six ex-officers.\n\n\"This chapter of the book has been written, but the book is not finished,\" she said Wednesday.\n\nRelated article Sheriff announces reforms after deputies and an officer plead guilty\n\nEnglish said she wants Rankin County Sheriff Bryan Bailey removed from office.\n\n\"We have spoken with the Department of Justice.

      "text": "Here are the key players in the trial of the former Louisville police officer connected to Breonna Taylor's killing\n\nNearly two years after a botched police raid led to Breonna Taylor 's death, the only officer facing criminal charges for his actions on that day is standing trial in Kentucky.\n\nBrett Hankison , a former Louisville Metro Police Department officer, is facing three counts of felony wanton endangerment in the March 2020 shooting in Louisville, Kentucky. Hankison pleaded not guilty to the charges.\n\nWhile Hankison was among several officers who took part in the raid on Taylor's apartment, the three felony counts are for endangering the people in a neighboring apartment, according to the state attorney general. He is not charged in Taylor's death.\n\nThe counts against Hankison have so far been the only criminal charges issued by authorities in relation to the raid, even after Taylor's killing sparked protests across the country and renewed conversations about police brutality against Black women. Activists and Taylor's family continue pushing for police officers to be charged in Taylor's killing.\n\nHere's a look at the people tied to the case:\n\nTaylor, 26, had been working as a certified emergency medical technician at the time of her death but her goal was to become a nurse. Her family nicknamed her \"Breewayy\" - because whatever she wanted, she found a way to make it happen.\n\nOn March 13, 2020, Taylor and her boyfriend were in bed in her apartment in Louisville's South End when police attempted to serve a search warrant on her apartment shortly after 12:30 a.m. in a series of raids related to Taylor's ex-boyfriend. They eventually used a battering ram to open the door. Taylor's boyfriend, armed with a handgun and fearing an intruder, fired one shot, and police officers returned fire, killing Taylor, who was shot eight times.\n\nThe city of Louisville agreed to pay $12 million and institute sweeping police reforms in a historic settlement of the wrongful death lawsuit filed by Taylor's family. The lawsuit against three Louisville police officers involved in the raid, accused them of battery, wrongful death, excessive force, negligence and gross negligence.\n\nPeople across the country have repeated Taylor's name loudly and often; in the streets and online, as they demand justice in her death. Like the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis, Taylor's death fueled ongoing nationwide conversations over racial injustice and police brutality.\n\nHankison was a detective with the Louisville Metro Police Department's criminal interdiction when Louisville officers burst into Taylor's apartment after midnight with a no-knock warrant.\n\nHe was standing outside Taylor's apartment and blindly fired 10 rounds through a door and window. The bullets entered an adjacent apartment where a pregnant woman, a man and a child were home, according to the state attorney general.\n\nMore than three months after Taylor's death, the then-police chief ordered Hankison's  termination saying he violated standard operating procedure when his \"actions displayed an extreme indifference to the value of human life.\" He has appealed his termination and a decision remains pending.\n\n\"I find your conduct a shock to the conscience,\" former LMPD Chief Robert Schroeder wrote in a letter to Hankison. \"Your actions have brought discredit upon yourself and the Department ... and demands your termination.\"\n\nA grand jury indicted Hankison in September 2020 after months of anticipation that a Kentucky grand jury would deliver justice in Taylor's killing.\n\nIn audio from the closed-door grand jury proceedings , Hankison told investigators that he fired his weapon fearing for his own life and those of his colleagues because he felt the officers were \"sitting ducks.\"\n\nHankison said he wasn't supposed to be working that night as it was his scheduled day off. He wasn't an investigator on the case but he answered an \"all-call\" email for help to serve four scheduled warrants, he told investigators.\n\nKenneth Walker III, 28, was inside Taylor's apartment when police arrived. He was arrested and accused of shooting a police officer officer during the raid. Last year, a Kentucky judge dismissed the charges \"with prejudice,\" meaning Walker can't be charged with the same offenses related to the shooting, according to court documents.\n\nWalker told investigators he heard banging at the door and assumed it was Taylor's ex-boyfriend, Jamarcus Glover. Taylor, who had awoken, shouted, \"Who is it?\" but Walker said there was no response.\n\nHe said he and Taylor scrambled to get dressed and that he grabbed his gun, which his attorney has said he legally owns. He said both he and Taylor were yelling, \"Who is it?\" but received no response.\n\nAs they made their way toward the front door, Walker said, the door flew off its hinges.\n\n\"So I just let off one shot,\" he said. \"I still can't see who it is or anything.\"\n\nPolice then returned fire, killing Taylor. There is no police body camera video of what transpired in the moments after officers broke through Taylor's door. Police said they identified themselves and didn't knock the door off its hinges but did use a battering ram to open the door.\n\nJamarcus Glover was the focus of the Louisville police narcotics investigation that led plainclothes officers to execute a warrant on Taylor's home. He had previously dated Taylor on-and-off for seven years, Walker told investigators.\n\nPolice said Glover, who was suspected of supplying a local drug house, had recently used Taylor's residence as his \"current home address,\" according to an affidavit for a search warrant. The detective who wrote the affidavit said he saw Glover walk into Taylor's apartment in mid-January and leave with a package before going to a \"known drug house.\" Taylor's apartment was one of five locations police obtained search warrants for as part of the investigation.\n\nGlover was arrested elsewhere during a series of raids that day but was released on bail.\n\nTaylor's family and their attorney have maintained that she was not involved in her ex-boyfriend's alleged drug deals.\n\nGlover told the Louisville Courier Journal that police used misleading and wrong information to obtain the warrant, during which Taylor was fatally shot.\n\n\"The police are trying to make it out to be my fault and turning the whole community out here making it look like I brought this to Breonna's door,\" Glover told the newspaper. \"There was nothing never there or anything ever there, and at the end of the day, they went about it the wrong way and lied on that search warrant and shot that girl out there.\"\n\nJonathan Mattingly, a retired Louisville Metro Police Department sergeant, was one of the three officers who fired their weapons that night.\n\nNeither Mattingly or the other officers wore body cameras, the police department said, because they were plainclothes narcotics officers.\n\nHe was the first to enter Taylor's apartment after officers sent the battering ram through the door and was shot in the leg, he told investigators.\n\nThe round, fired by Taylor's boyfriend Kenneth Walker III, severed his femoral artery. He and the two other officers returned fire.\n\nMattingly's attorney, Todd McMurtry, has defended his client's conduct saying the officer \"was following orders of superior officers, was not involved in the planning process of the arrest, and at all times followed established police procedures.\"\n\nIn a mass email to the department, Mattingly defended his actions and slammed the city's leadership.\n\n\"I know we did the legal, moral and ethical thing that night,\" Mattingly wrote in the email. \"It's sad how the good guys are demonized, and criminals are canonized.\"\n\nLast year, Mattingly's plans to write a book about the case drew widespread criticism, leading Simon & Schuster to announce they won't distribute the book written by the retired police officer.\n\nMattingly retired from the Louisville Metro Police Department last year, the department said.\n\nMyles Cosgrove was a detective with the Louisville Metro Police Department at the time of Taylor's killing. He was one of the three officers who fired their weapons that night.\n\nFBI ballistic tests determined a bullet from Cosgrove's gun killed Taylor, according to Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron.\n\nCameron said Mattingly and Cosgrove's shots were justified because Taylor's boyfriend fired at officers first.\n\nLast year, the Louisville Metro Police Department terminated Cosgrove for use of deadly force for firing 16 rounds into Taylor's home and failing to activate his body camera, according to a copy of his termination letter. The Louisville police union at the time called the firing \"unjustified.\"\n\nA review board upheld his termination in December after several days of hearings.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

McAlpin was punched and shocked with a stun gun, the video shows.\n\nMcAlpin had been charged with felony aggravated assault and resisting arrest, but Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell dismissed the charges in October after having reviewed the case.\n\nMcAlpin's attorney said at the time that the officers' injuries during the arrest resulted from their \"frenzied and violent attack on Tyron.\"\n\nPhoenix police said in a statement Wednesday: \"The Department identified policy violations\" following an administrative investigation into the arrest.\n\nThe statement did not identify the officers. A police spokesperson said the department was not naming them because a possible appeal process is pending.\n\nAll three offices were suspended without pay for 24 hours, and two of them will be required to undergo additional de-escalation training, the police department said.\n\nThe suspensions are for 24 hours in total, so if officers work eight-hour shifts, they would be three-day suspensions, police said.\n\n\"Our priority is always the safety and well-being of our community and our officers. We understand the concerns raised by this incident, and we take them seriously,\" interim Police Chief Michael Sullivan said.\n\nThe incident occurred after someone called 911 about a fight at a Circle K store, police said in an incident report. The caller said a white man was the aggressor and was still inside the store, according to the report.\n\nThe man pointed to McAlpin, who is Black, and claimed he assaulted him, police wrote in the report.\n\nMcAlpin's attorney, Jesse Showalter, said police used excessive force and didn't interview the Circle K employee or anyone else to ask what happened.\n\nIn the video, \"what you see is simply Tyron trying to avoid being struck repeatedly by the officer who repeatedly swings punches at his face,\" Showalter said in October.\n\nThere is no indication that the officers knew McAlpin was deaf or had cerebral palsy before they arrested him.\n\n\"Our goal is to learn from this and move forward together as a stronger department and community,\" Sullivan said in Wednesday's statement.\n\nShowalter called the department's suspensions insufficient. He said the city's news release does not explain \"why a 24-hour suspension is the appropriate punishment for beating, Tasing, and falsely charging a man who had committed no crime and posed no threat to anyone.\"\n\nHe filed a lawsuit on behalf of McAlpin against the city of Phoenix and police officers Benjamin Harris, Kyle Sue and Jorge Acosta on March 5, which alleges battery, negligence and violations of Fourth Amendment constitutional protections.\n\n\"The City is attempting to avoid responsibility or accountability for its unconstitutional policies and practices that have repeatedly harmed citizens of Phoenix by giving the officers involved a slap on the wrist,\" Showalter said.\n\nThe lawsuit seeks damages, including punitive damages against the officers, but a dollar amount is not specified.\n\nPhil Helsel is a reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

He faced a District of Columbia charge of second-degree murder, and federal charges of conspiracy to obstruct and obstruction of justice in the October 2020 unauthorized pursuit that killed Karon Hylton-Brown, 20. Sutton was the first D.C. police officer to be convicted of murder for conduct while on duty.\n\nThe same jury that found Sutton guilty also convicted Andrew Zabavsky, a lieutenant who supervised Sutton, of conspiracy to obstruct and obstruction of justice. Zabavsky was sentenced to four years in prison. He was not a ccused of the more serious charge of second-degree murder. Trump granted Zabavsky clemency.\n\nBoth men had been free pending the outcome of their appeals.\n\nTrump had hinted of his plans to pardon them after his inauguration.\n\n\"They were arrested, put in jail for five years because they went after an illegal,\" Trump said Tuesday. \"And I guess something happened where something went wrong, and they arrested the two officers and put them in jail for going after a criminal.\"\n\nHylton-Brown was an American citizen, his mother, Karen Hylton, said in an interview Thursday night. She said he was born Feb. 29, 2000, in Washington, D.C.\n\nHylton said she sent a letter to the White House addressed to Trump on Tuesday asking him not to pardon Sutton and Zabavsky. She also wrote in the letter, a copy of which she shared with NBC News, that she believed racism had caused her son's death, and she asked Trump to review the case before making a judgment. A White House spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment Thursday night.\n\nThe D.C. Police Union praised Trump's decision, saying in a statement that Sutton had been \"wrongly charged by corrupt prosecutors for doing his job.\"\n\n\"This action rights an incredible wrong that not only harmed Officer Sutton, but also crippled the ability for the department to function,\" the union said.\n\nThe union expressed \"dismay\" a day earlier after Trump pardoned more than 1,500 people charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, including those who assaulted law enforcement officers.\n\nThe Metropolitan Police Department thanked Trump \"for supporting its officers\" after the Sutton-Zabavsky pardons, adding in a statement that the prosecutions \"were literally unprecedented.\"\n\n\"Never before, in any other jurisdiction in the country, has a police officer been charged with second-degree murder for pursuing a suspect,\" the department said.\n\nOn the night of Oct. 23, 2020, months after the police killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis had ignited widespread protests against police brutality and racial injustice, Sutton used a police car to chase Hylton-Brown, who was driving a moped without a helmet on a sidewalk in northwest Washington, prosecutors said.\n\nHylton-Brown ignored Sutton's attempt to stop him and drove off. Sutton chased Hylton-Brown for more than 10 blocks \"at unreasonable speeds,\" prosecutors said, and, at one point, drove the wrong way on a one-way street. Sutton followed Hylton-Brown into a narrow alley, turned off his car's emergency lights and siren and accelerated. When Hylton-Brown exited the alley, he was struck by another vehicle, according to prosecutors.\n\n\"As Mr. Hylton-Brown lay unconscious in the street in a pool of his own blood, Sutton and Zabavsky, agreed to cover up what Sutton had done to prevent any further investigation of the incident,\" prosecutors said in a statement in September.\n\nThe officers allowed the driver whose car struck Hylton-Brown to leave the scene within 20 minutes of the crash, then turned off their body-worn cameras, conferred privately and left, prosecutors said.\n\nSutton drove his police car directly over the crash site, audibly crushing pieces of debris from the collision as he left, prosecutors said, and neither officer contacted the department's Major Crash Unit or its Internal Affairs Division to each initiate investigations.\n\nThey also misled their commanding officer about the severity of the crash, denying that a police chase had even occurred and omitting any mention of Hylton-Brown's critical injuries, prosecutors said. According to prosecutors, Zabavsky also falsely implied that Hylton-Brown had been drunk and Sutton drafted a false police report.\n\nHylton-Brown suffered severe head trauma and died two days later.\n\n\"The jury in this case found the defendants guilty beyond a reasonable doubt for their roles in the murder of Karon Hylton Brown and a related cover up, affirming that what happened here was a serious crime,\" then-U.S. Attorney Matthew M. Graves said in September after the officers were sentenced. \"Public safety requires public trust. Crimes like this erode that trust and are a disservice to the community and the thousands of officers who work incredibly hard, within the bounds of the Constitution, to keep us safe.\"\n\nThe case spurred days of protests outside a police station in Washington.\n\nDavid Shurtz, an attorney representing Hylton-Brown's estate, said Trump's decision was \"outrageous\" and \"misguided.\"\n\n\"I think it's one of the worst decisions Trump has ever made,\" he said. \"And I believe he is being ill-advised.\"\n\nShurtz believes police unions influenced the decision for the officers to receive pardons.\n\nZabavsky's attorney, Christopher Zampogna, said in a statement that his client \"thanks President Trump for issuing his pardon unconditionally.\" J. Michael Hannon, Sutton's attorney, did not immediately return a request for comment.\n\nJanelle Griffith is a national reporter for NBC News focusing on issues of race and policing.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

He was booked for investigation of one count of felony kidnapping, impersonating a law enforcement officer and two other misdemeanors. On Monday, the police department said it had obtained warrants charging Johnson with two more counts of kidnapping.\n\nDeputy Police Chief Monty L. Anders said three Latino men were in the pickup truck. None of them were charged, and their names were not being released, he said.\n\nJohnson was released Saturday after he posted bond, according to jail records, and he is due in court next month. He could not be reached for comment Monday at a phone number listed for him.\n\nSullivan's Island police responded to a call about a person operating a vehicle without a license Wednesday. Later, they said in a news release, they were made aware of the \"disturbing\" viral video, which prompted a criminal investigation into the 911 caller, whom they identified as Johnson.\n\n\"This video displayed possible criminal actions by the caller that were not initially reported to police while on-scene,\" they said.\n\nAnders said the video lasted a few minutes and \"is not the entire incident,\" but he said he could not comment further.\n\nIn the video widely shared on social media, a white man, whom police identified as Johnson, stands at the driver's-side window of a vehicle with a Latino in the driver's seat. The video was recorded by a man in the passenger seat.\n\nThe window is down, and the white man asks the person in the driver's seat whether he is from Mexico and tells him: \"You're going back to Mexico.\"\n\nThe video also shows the white man taking the keys out of the truck's ignition, dangling them in front of the driver and telling him in a mock accent: \"You cannot drive. You have no driver's license.\"\n\n\"You are going back,\" he says, and he tells the man that police are on their way and that he cannot drive a vehicle without a license.\n\nAt one point, the man in the driver's seat holds a cellphone up to the man at the window, and the man responds: \"No, no, no, it's over. It's over.\"\n\nThe man in the driver's seat, who is holding a cellphone in front of himself, can be heard speaking Spanish. The man at his window then says, \"Hey, El Chapo.\" The driver continues speaking Spanish, and the man at his window tells him, \"Don't be speaking that pig Latin in my f------ country, bro.\"\n\n\"Don't be speaking that pig Latin here,\" he adds. \"This is America. We speak English in America.\"\n\nHe then smacks the cellphone out of the man's hand and again says: \"We speak English, English.\"\n\n\"Habla Ingles? No,\" he then says to the man in the driver's seat, later adding: \"This is my job. This is my truck. I own this country.\"\n\nHe also tells another man standing near the car window that the man in the driver's seat \"doesn't even have a license\" and twice says, \"I got his key.\"\n\nThe police department said that after \"extensive video review\" and interviews of witnesses, warrants were obtained for Johnson, who lives in Huger, about 30 miles from Charleston.\n\nAndes, the deputy police chief, said Johnson does not face hate crime charges because South Carolina is one of the few states without hate crime laws.\n\n\"The charges that we filed against him were the fullest to the extent that we could by law,\" Andes said Monday.\n\nPalomares, of LULAC, commended the police department for filing the maximum charges.\n\n\"This is an example of the dangerous climate that our community is facing out there,\" Palomares said.\n\nIn the Pennsylvania case, Aidan Steigelmann was charged with conspiracy of impersonating a public servant, court records indicated. A Philadelphia police spokesperson said two men identified themselves as ICE officers Saturday night to enter a Temple University residence hall.\n\nA third man arrived, and all three left together, police said.\n\nMinutes later police received a report that three men were identifying themselves as ICE agents at an Insomnia Cookies store nearby. Two of the men left in an SUV, but Steigelmann was arrested.\n\nPolice did not identify the two other men. They said the three wore \"black shirts with 'Police' on the front and 'ICE' on the back.\"\n\nTemple University said in a statement that the three men at the cookie store were the same men who were denied access to Johnson & Hardwick Residence Hall earlier that night.\n\nThe school said two of the men impersonated law enforcement officers and a third recorded the interaction. A student was taken into custody and placed on interim suspension pending an investigation, the school said; it did not identify the student.\n\n\"Neither Temple's Department of Public Safety nor the Philadelphia Police Department have any reports of federal ICE agents being on campus,\" the school said. \"It is deeply troubling and disappointing to know behavior like this reportedly occurred on our campus.\"\n\nSteigelmann is represented by the Defender Association of Philadelphia, which declined to comment Monday.\n\nJanelle Griffith is a national reporter for NBC News focusing on issues of race and policing.\n\nChristiana Corporon is an NBC News researcher.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The detention center is in Downey, about 13 miles south of downtown Los Angeles.\n\nAttorney General Rob Bonta's office said there were at least 69 fights in the second half of 2023, involving 143 children and teens ages 12 to 18. Some fights, Bonta's office said, resulted in physical injury.\n\nOfficers, Bonta said in the statement, were alleged to have overseen \"'gladiator fights' when they should have intervened.\"\n\nThe defendants took advantage of the victims' vulnerability and their own position of trust, his office said.\n\n\"Let today's charges be a warning for all those who abuse their power,\" Bonta said. \"The California Department of Justice is watching, and we will hold you accountable.\"\n\nThe fights came to the attention of the attorney general and state investigators after video of one of the altercations was \"leaked\" in January 2024, Bonta's office said. Speaking to news media by video, he described the violence.\n\n\"The footage, which was later circulated widely by the media and on social media, shows one youth in the detention center being attacked by a series of other youth who come at him one by one as detention officers stand by watching,\" Bonta said in video aired Monday by NBC affiliate KCRA of Sacramento . \"The officers look more like referees or audience members at a prize fight, not adults charged with the care and supervision of young people.\"\n\nStacy Ford, president of Los Angeles County Deputy Probation Officers Union AFSCME Local 685, which represents the 30 officers in labor negotiations, said in a statement that the organization \"will do everything in our power\" to support the officers.\n\n\"Every American is innocent until proven guilty,\" Ford said. \"Our members are entitled to this same presumption of innocence and deserve to be treated with fairness and due process, just as they provide to those in their custody.\"\n\nHe said juvenile detention officers are tasked with keeping peace and order among children and teens often accused of violent crimes.\n\n\"Despite these challenges, our professional peace officers remain committed to maintaining the highest level of professionalism,\" he said. \"We will continue to advocate for the safety, rights, and integrity of our members.\"\n\nAccording to the indictment, each of the 30 officers is charged with felony child abuse under a California law aimed at those who enable child endangerment, with those convicted of the charge facing two to six years in state prison.\n\nOne of the 30 faces an additional count of misdemeanor battery, accused of using force and violence against an unnamed subject, according to the document.\n\nThree of the defendants were charged with conspiracy to commit a crime, according to the indictment. It alleges two of them allowed some of the fights, knew beforehand when and where they would happen and told new detention officers to watch but not report the bouts.\n\nProsecutors alleged the third joined the two others in allowing some of the fights, one of which resulted in a broken nose for an unnamed victim.\n\nOne of the three told new officers that nine fights on Dec. 22, 2023, in a unit of the juvenile facility were an example of how the detention employees controlled the children in their care, according to the indictment.\n\nTwenty-two of the defendants were arraigned Monday. The rest will be arraigned April 18, the attorney general's office said.\n\nAll have been placed on unpaid leave, the county's probation department said in a statement. In April 2024, probation chief Guillermo Viera Rosa said officers involved in the alleged abuse captured on video had been removed from duty as he sought investigation from an outside agency.\n\n\"We will not tolerate misconduct like that depicted in the video,\" he said at the time.\n\nThe next month, he said, 66 officers were placed on leave amid an internal investigation. Viera Rosa said he would root out the \"culture of violence, drug use, neglect and sexual misconduct in the nation's largest probation agency,\" the county s aid in a s tatement at the time.\n\nSaying the indictment announced Monday is an example of the need for change in the culture of county probation officers, county Board of Supervisors member Janice Hahn said she would support firing any officers found guilty.\n\n\"The young people in Los Padrinos are not only in our custody, they are in our care,\" she said in a statement. \"It is unacceptable that probation officers who were entrusted with this responsibility would use their power to abuse these kids.\"\n\nDennis Romero is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The victim was not identified by name, and neither was his business partner, a woman who was identified only as unindicted co-conspirator 1, a \"wealthy Chinese national,\" the U.S. attorney's office said.\n\nSteven Arthur Lankford, 68, of Canyon Country, California; Glen Louis Cozart, 63, of Upland, California; Max Samuel Bennett Turbett, 39, of Australia, who is a United Kingdom citizen; and Matthew Phillip Hart, 41, of Australia, are charged in a superseding indictment with one count of conspiracy to commit extortion, one count of attempted extortion, one count of conspiracy against rights and one count of deprivation of rights under color of law, the office said.\n\nLankford is a retired Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy who stopped working for the agency in 2020 and owns a Santa Clarita-based process service company, Cozart is also a former county sheriff's deputy who owns a private investigation and security services company, Turbett is a former member of the British military who owns a private investigation and asset recovery business, and Hart is a former member of the Australian military who owns a management service business, prosecutors said.\n\nThe four defendants are scheduled to be arraigned Monday afternoon. Their attorneys could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\n\"It is critical that we hold public officials, including law enforcement officers, to the same standards as the rest of us,\" U.S. Attorney Martin Estrada said in the statement. \"It is unacceptable and a serious civil rights violation for a sworn police officer to take the law into his own hands and abuse the authority of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.\"\n\nIf convicted, the defendants face a maximum sentence of 20 years in federal prison for each extortion-related count and up to 10 years in federal prison for each count related to deprivation of rights, prosecutors said.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, the victim and his business partner had a yearslong dispute over their ownership in the rubber chemical manufacturer. The disagreements led to at least three lawsuits in China and one in Atlanta, prosecutors said.\n\nIn December 2018, the unindicted co-conspirator allegedly contacted Turbett to help with her business dispute. She said the long and costly litigation had not been \"the smart way\" to handle her dispute and asked Turbett to find a different \"solution to finish the problem,\" prosecutors said. She promised Turbett that if he helped her, \"we can both retire,\" authorities said.\n\nTurbett and the unindicted co-conspirator drafted purported settlement agreements calling for victim 1 to transfer assets - including about $36,972,386 in cash, as well as lucrative shares in Jiangsu Sinorgchem - to the unindicted co-conspirator, prosecutors said.\n\nThat move led to a chain of events that led to the faux raid on June 17, 2019. Before then, prosecutors alleged, Turbett hired Cozart to find victim 1 and assemble a team to get victim 1's signature on the settlement agreements.\n\nCozart, in turn, hired Lankford, then a sheriff's deputy, who, against department policy, searched victim 1's name and date of birth in the National Crime Information Center database. Law enforcement databases are not to be used for personal reasons, prosecutors said.\n\nTurbett and Hart flew from Australia to Los Angeles, where they met with Cozart and Lankford to plan out the sham raid, prosecutors said.\n\nDuring the hoax raid, the defendants forced the victim and his family into one room, authorities said. Their phones were taken away, prosecutors said, and they were prevented for leaving for hours. The businessman was also choked, slammed into a wall and threatened with deportation for him and his wife, as well as possibility of permanently separating from their 4-year-old son, prosecutors said.\n\nThe victim then signed the settlement agreements, authorities said. Although the victim was told not to contact the police, when the defendants left, he reached out to Irvine police, prosecutors said.\n\nLankford falsely told police that he had been at the businessman's home for a legitimate law enforcement purpose, that the businessman consented to all parties being in his home and that no force was used, prosecutors said.\n\nBy November 2019, all defendants had been paid for their work coercing the businessman to sign the settlement, authorities said.\n\nThe unindicted co-conspirator paid Turbett's company about $419,813 and emailed Turbett to thank him for a \"very good job,\" prosecutors said.\n\nAntonio Planas is a breaking news reporter for NBC News Digital.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

Hours later, the suspect was found dead with a \"gunshot wound to the head\" that authorities believe was \"self-inflicted.\"\n\nOfficers Christopher Reese, 30, and Cameron Girvin, 25, were fatally shot while attempting to pull over a blue Hyundai Sonata with expired plates, Virginia Beach Police Chief Paul Neudigate said at a press conference on Saturday.\n\nWhen the car failed to stop, officers pursued it to a cul-de-sac and approached the vehicle, Neudigate said. The driver, identified as John McCoy, was \"immediately argumentative\" and initially refused to exit the vehicle at the officers' request, Neudigate added.\n\nWhen McCoy, 42, eventually compiled, a struggle broke out between him and the two officers. During the altercation, McCoy allegedly drew a pistol and shot both officers, Neudigate said. McCoy shot both of the officers a second time while they lay on the ground wounded, and then drove off, Neudigate added.\n\nBoth officers were later pronounced dead at nearby hospitals, where they were surrounded by family and friends, the police chief said.\n\n\"I'm going to be quite honest. We're all hurting,\" Neudigate said. \"We've got families that have lost a loved one in the prime of their life, and they are completely devastated.\"\n\n\"We've got an officer that is 25 years old, another one that is 30, with such a future ahead of them, senselessly taken,\" he added.\n\nIn the hours after killings, police found McCoy's body in a Virginia Beach apartment complex.\n\n\"Ultimately, the determination and cause of death will be up to the medical examiner, but I can say that our preliminary investigation at this point in time, with everything that we know, lends us to believe that this is a self-inflicted gunshot wound,\" he said. \"At no time did any of our officers fire shots.\"\n\nAt the press conference, Neudigate was joined by Virginia Attorney General Jason Miyares and Virginia Beach Mayor Bobby Dyer.\n\n\"Our city is heartbroken. We mourn the loss of two of our own brave Virginia Beach police officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice,\" said Dyer. \"Their dedication to protecting our community will never be forgotten.

Aquilino Gonell , who was injured by the mob on Jan. 6 , told NBC News that he tried to purchase a number of the replica medals this week, planning to hand them out as gifts, and was surprised to see they were no longer available.\n\nGonell said the erasure of the medals fits in a broader pattern, pointing to the failure of Congress to place a memorial for law enforcement officers who defended the Capitol up in the building before Trump's second inauguration last month.\n\nJustice Department webpages that listed the cases and featured summaries of the work of the federal prosecutors who brought Jan. 6 cases were also removed from the web after Trump took office.\n\n\"Not only do Republican members of Congress refuse to put up the plaque, but they are even erasing and removing the ability to purchase the coin for the Congressional Gold Medal,\" Gonell said.\n\nBefore the listing was erased from the Mint's website, a description noted that the medal was struck under the authority of Public Law 117-32 , an act passed in August 2021 to honor the \"sacrifice of heroes including Capitol Police Officers Brian Sicknick and Howard Liebengood, Metropolitan Police Department Officer Jeffrey Smith, and those who sustained injuries, and the courage of Capitol Police Officer Eugene Goodman.\"\n\nThe law called on the Mint to \"expedite production of the gold medals and duplicate medals under this Act, so that the sacrifices of fallen officers and their families, and the contributions of other law enforcement agencies who answered the call of duty on January 6, 2021, can be recognized and honored in a timely manner.\"\n\nTrump pardoned more than 1,500 Jan. 6 defendants and commuted the related sentences of several Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, including some who were convicted of seditious conspiracy.\n\nRyan J.

      "text": "Robert De Niro and former Capitol Police officers show up outside Trump trial â to talk about Jan. 6\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nActor Robert De Niro led a surprise press conference for the Biden campaign outside the Manhattan courthouse where Donald Trumpâs trial is taking place.\n\nBut the event seemed focused on everything but Trumpâs trial, as De Niro, at one point battling both a heckler and a car alarm, laid out a broader case against Trump while drafting off the trialâs coverage.\n\nTaking a local approach, De Niro said Trump âdoesnât belong in my cityâ and said New Yorkers saw him as a âtwo-bit playboy lying his way into the tabloidsâ and a âclownâ in his pre-politician days.\n\nâThis city is pretty accommodating,â he said. âWe make room for clowns. We have them all over the city, people who do crazy things in the street. We tolerate it, itâs part of the culture. But not a person like Trump, who will eventually run the country. That does not work, and we all know that.â\n\nThe event focused heavily on Trump as a threat to democracy, a major Biden campaign theme, with De Niro accusing Trump of âpromising to use our own military to attack U.S. citizensâ and aspiring to be a âtyrant.â\n\nJanuary 6, where Trump supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol, was invoked often throughout the event. Harry Dunn and Michael Fanone, two former Capitol Police officers present during the riot, also spoke at the press conference, seeking to remind voters of that day and arguing that Trump is a danger to democracy.\n\nâDonald Trump is the greatest threat to our country,â Dunn said. âDonald Trump encouraged and continues to encourage political violence. MAGA Republicans called us, police officers, âtraitorsâ for doing our jobs on January 6. Political violence is not acceptable, yet Donald Trump champions it.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nWhen the Biden campaign announced a press conference outside the trial on short notice, it raised eyebrows because the president and his team have so far largely ignored Trumpâs legal issues. Apparently, theyâre still hesitant to touch on them âÂ and itâs creating some odd messaging.\n\nThereâs a variety of possible reasons for the Democratsâ unwillingness to address the topic â concern about a sitting president being seen as tilting the scales of justice, skepticism that voters are interested in the details of his cases, and fear about playing into the hands of Trump, who has cast the various indictments, lawsuits, and civil cases as a partisan effort to undermine his campaign.\n\nIn that context, the event seemed like an effort to talk about the trial without talking about the trial. De Niro recently recorded an ad for the campaign reminding voters of the more disorderly low points under Trump, and Tuesdayâs event seemed like a strained effort to fit the legal proceedings into the general category of self-interested chaos, similar to what Nikki Haley attempted in the primaries.\n\nBut the refusal to discuss the elephant in the courtroom while De Niro sparred with MAGA protestors left even some Trump critics confused.\n\nâYeah, Iâm sorry I donât get the whole De Niro presser outside the courthouse at all,âRon Filipkowski, editor of the activist news site MeidasTouch and a closely followed figure in Bidenâs orbit , posted on X. âNot sure who came up with that idea. Do something else somewhere else some other time.â\n\nThe Biden campaign argued that the press conference was a creative way to get their message out when the cameras are overwhelmingly pointed at Trump this week. One person close to the campaign told Semafor it was an effective event, as the networks took it live and all eyes were on them.\n\nâWeâre not here today because of whatâs going on over there,â Michael Tyler, the communications director for the Biden campaign, told reporters outside the trial. âWeâre here today because you all are here.â\n\nTrumpâs communications team also attended the press conference, and took the podium after team Biden to give their own message: That the Biden event is proof of Trumpâs claims that the trial is politically motivated.\n\nâThe Biden folks have finally done it,â Trump senior advisor Jason Miller said. âAfter months of saying politics had nothing to do with this trial, they showed up and made a campaign event out of a trial day for President Trump. Why? Because Joe Bidenâs numbers are in the tank.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nEvery federal agency will soon have a new âchief AI officerâ under a new policy the White House issued Thursday.\n\nThe new rule is part of a first-of-its-kind Office of Management and Budget policy designed to help the entire federal government use artificial intelligence safely and effectively, as the technology becomes more advanced and widespread. The federal government is trying to take advantage of AI, but the Biden administration is also wary of potential pitfalls associated with the quickly-evolving technology.\n\nâAI presents not only risks but also tremendous opportunity to improve public services and make progress on societal challenges like addressing climate change, improving public health, and advancing equitable economic opportunity,â Office of Management and Budget Director Shalanda Young told reporters.\n\nThe policy does not apply to AI used in national security systems, like those used by the Pentagon, which already has its own rules in place.\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe OMB policy grows out of the executive order President Biden signed last October . It calls on each agency to designate a âchief AI officerâ to oversee the agencyâs strategy around the technology as well as an AI governance board within 60 days, according to a memorandum from Young that will go out to executive departments on Thursday.\n\nUnder the rules, federal departments will need to publicly disclose a list of AI tools they use, identify any risks associated with those technologies, and disclose how they are working to manage the risks.\n\nBy the end of this year, federal agencies are also required to implement âminimum practicesâ to protect the rights and safety of individuals impacted by their AI use, including by testing systems and looking at whether they pose risks for discrimination.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris, who previewed the new policy along with Young, offered an example: âIf the Veterans Administration wants to use AI in VA hospitals to help doctors diagnose patients, they would first have to demonstrate that AI does not produce racially-biased diagnoses,â she said.\n\nThe White House is hoping the new rules will serve as a model for other governments, said Harris, who expanded on what she described as âexistential threatsâ of AI during a speech in London last year . The White House has also called on Congress to enact legislation regulating AI.\n\nâWe will continue to call on all nations to follow our lead and put the public interest first when it comes to government use of AI,â Harris said.\n\nOMB also plans to solicit information about the federal procurement of AI, which the White House plans to issue rules on at a later date, Young said.\n\nFederal agencies are already experimenting with AI. The New York Times reported earlier this month that the Department of Homeland Security is the first to incorporate generative AI widely , with plans to use tools in counter-narcotics and emergency management.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor flagship"

Law enforcement officials said that Yoonâs â refusal of the legal process â is âdeeply regrettable,â and next steps will be decided after a review.\n\nYoon had already ignored three police summonses as part of an investigation into his brief declaration of martial law in December.

Itâs the first time that a sitting president has faced arrest, and police officersâ failure to do so â raises serious and uncomfortable questions about whoâs in charge here. â Some analysts argued that Yoon anticipated his current situation and prepared for it: The president had appointed several allies into positions of power, including the head of the presidential security service who joined in September .

      "text": "Kenya finally deploys police to Haiti amid protests at home\n\nSign up for Semafor Africa: A rapidly-growing continentâs crucial stories. Read it now .\n\nNAIROBI âÂ Kenyaâs President William Ruto on Monday, saw off 400 police officers set to deploy to Haiti as part of a UN-backed security mission. They will leave for Haiti on Tuesday, June 25. Kenya is expected to send a total of 1,000 officers to the island nation in a phased approach.\n\nRuto handed the officers the Kenyan flag in a low-key event at State House, the presidential residence in Nairobi. The media was not invited to the event, in which Kenyan clergy members also prayed for the forces. Godfrey Otunge, senior assistant inspector general of Kenyaâs police force, was named commander of the officers deployed to Haiti.The initial batch of officers is composed of elite officers from various specialized response units.\n\nThe deployment, however, continues to face opposition from a section of Kenyans, including several activist groups. The deployment was declared unconstitutional by a court in January, a decision the government has challenged. Following the Monday event, lawyer and politician Dr. Ekuru Aukot who led the case questioned Rutoâs move to deploy the officers. On X , he described the Kenyan president as âtoiling for the globalists to oppress and plunder our black brothers and sisters in Haiti.â\n\nThe deployment also comes amid nationwide youth-led protests demanding the scrapping of an unpopular finance bill, which proposes several tax hikes. The protests have been characterized by arrests of protesters and use of teargas, water cannons and, in some instances, live bullets. Two protesters have been confirmed killed so far. Several key mobilizers have also been abducted , with protesters continuing to demand for their release.\n\nSome Haitian human rights groups have already raised concerns on the Kenyan deployment to Haiti citing the police brutality witnessed in the Kenyan protests. The Movement Unforgettable Dessalines Jean Jacques (MUDJJ), last week wrote to the United Nations expressing concern that the conduct of the police in handling domestic protests might foreshadow the use of similar tactics in Haiti.\n\nThe deployment of a multinational security force was initially approved by the UN Security Council in October, but has been beset by delays following the High Court ruling in January. A number of countries have so far expressed willingness to support the mission, including Benin, the Bahamas, Bangladesh, Barbados, and Chad. The United States is providing $200 million to support the mission.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor africa"

And more than 60 went missing and several more were injured. No officers have so far been prosecuted or sacked in relation to their alleged conduct during their protests, although probes are ongoing according to the countryâs Independent Policing Oversight Authority (Ipoa).\n\nâThese crackdowns, when done violently and poorly around the world, end up leading to more instability, not more stability, in most cases,â said Murphy, who is considered to be among the frontrunners to be secretary of state if Democratic Party nominee Kamala Harris wins the upcoming US presidential election.\n\nMurphy said he raised the reported disappearances and abuses in meetings with Ruto and Foreign Affairs Cabinet Secretary Musalia Mudavadi.\n\nâI think itâs really important for US leaders to convey those concerns and make it clear that our relationship canât be at its strongest level unless there is a real commitment from the Kenyan government to hold anyone that engages in abuse, particularly in the context of these protests, accountable.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe US sees Kenya as a key strategic partner in a continent where its influence and presence has been waning, particularly in Sahel and West African states. Chinese and Russian presence on the continent, and that of Gulf states, has also been growing.\n\nKenyaâs protests and the police response have tainted Washingtonâs embrace of Ruto, which was capped by a rare state visi t in May and Kenyaâs designation as a non-NATO ally.\n\nKenyan members of parliament last week voiced frustration over the lack of action taken on police officers accused of engaging in illegal killings and abductions. They gave the Ipoa until the end of August to provide and publish in-depth details on its investigations into 50 deaths the body recorded during the protests.\n\nâWe have 61 deaths recorded from the Gen Z protests,â said MP Gathoni Wamuchomba while questioning Ipoa officials.âYou havenât been able to arrest or convict those responsible for the abductions, deaths, and violations of human rights. What has Ipoa done?â\n\nThe protests in Kenya began in opposition to unpopular tax hikes proposals contained in the Finance Bill 2024. The bill was subsequently dropped on the back of public pressure, but protests continued with calls for Rutoâs resignation and the prosecution of police officers in killings.\n\nRuto, who dismissed nearly his entire cabinet at the height of the protests, brought several senior members of the largest opposition party, the Orange Democratic Movement (ODM) into his cabinet in July. Key ministries handed to the opposition party in what Ruto describes as a âbroad-based governmentâ were the National Treasury and Planning.\n\nThe prosecution of police officers accused of engaging in illegal killings and abductions during the protests is necessary to build trust in the countryâs justice system. A failure to punish wrongdoers would only fuel existing anger over corruption and taxation that has seen mostly Gen Z and millennial Kenyans take to the streets in recent months.\n\nPromises by the government to compensate victims of police brutality, so far unfulfilled , should also be met. This should be a particularly important concern for the government as the likely re-introduction of some proposed tax hikes from the finance bill could spark a new wave of demonstrations.\n\nRuto has previously said he would âensure accountabilityâ in relation to police officers accused of extrajudicial killings during the protests. In July, he also called for the release of wrongly arrested peaceful protesters, saying it would accelerate an investigation into the elements he claims âhijackedâ the demonstrations.\n\nâThis will enable the agencies to focus their resources, efforts and time on investigating and prosecuting serious criminal elements who took advantage of peaceful demonstrations to advance a dangerous agenda,â he said.\n\nRights organizations including Amnesty Nigeria have called for an investigation into the deaths of 23 protesters it says were killed across the country during demonstrations over the cost of living held earlier this month. Young protesters in Nigeria were reportedly inspired by their counterparts in Kenya.\n\nâOur findings, so far, show that security personnel at the locations where lives were lost deliberately used tactics designed to kill while dealing with gatherings of people protesting hunger and deep poverty,â Amnesty Nigeria wrote in a statement.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor africa"

      "text": "Phoenix police officers on leave amid probe into violent arrest of deaf man\n\nTwo Phoenix police officers were placed on paid leave amid an investigation into the violent arrest of a deaf Black man with cerebral palsy that sparked an uproar of outrage and condemnation.\n\nThe Phoenix Police Department confirmed Tuesday that officers Benjamin Harris and Kyle Sue were on administrative leave while the agency conducts a formal inquiry into the August arrest of Tyron McAlpin, 34.\n\nGraphic body camera footage of the encounter shows the two officers pummeling McAlpin and shocking him with a Taser repeatedly after he did not comply with their commands. McAlphin faced two counts of aggravated assault on an officer and resisting arrest but those charges were dropped by Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell last week.\n\nFootage of the arrest released at a court hearing was widely scrutinized by local and state officials and human rights advocates.\n\nAn internal police department investigation into the violent arrest is pending. The department's interim chief, Michael Sullivan, said he would personally review that inquiry's findings.\n\nThe officers responded to a trespassing call made by employees of a Circle K store and gas station, according to body camera footage and records.\n\nWhen the officers arrived and spoke to the trespassing suspect, who is white, the man told them he had just been assaulted, and pointed to McAlpin across the street. McAlpin's lawyer has said these accusations were unfounded. No charges against McAlpin were related to that assault allegation.\n\nThe officers drove up alongside McAlpin, without speaking to other witnesses or interviewing the man further beforehand. In the video, McAlpin can be seen walking across the Dollar Store parking lot when Sue drives up to him and says, \"Hey buddy, stop where you're at.\"\n\nAfter a brief moment without a response from McAlpin, the officer reached out and a struggle began as Sue grabbed McAlpin's arm. McAlpin appeared to push back and raise his arms. The officers brought McAlpin to the ground, punched him over a dozen times and repeatedly stunned him with a Taser while telling him to put his hands behind his back. McAlpin was eventually put into handcuffs.\n\nState and local officials, including Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego and Vice Mayor Debra Stark, expressed concern after body camera footage of the arrest was shown at a court hearing on Oct. 1.\n\nStark later said in a statement that she respected the county attorney's decision to drop the charges against McAlpin but said she would wait for the results of the city's investigation before deciding whether the city and police department owed McAlpin an apology.\n\nArizona state Sen. Anna Hernandez and state Rep. Analise Ortiz said in a joint statement that the arrest was \"indicative of the larger systemic problems within the Phoenix Police Department.\"\n\n\"Tyron is deaf and has cerebral palsy and should never have been subjected to this brutal assault at the hands of police officers,\" the statement read.\n\nIn June, the U.S. Department of Justice slammed the Phoenix Police Department for civil rights violations, including that officers systematically used unlawful force and disproportionately targeted people of color.\n\nContributing: Jeanine Santucci, Michael Loria, USA TODAY; Maritza Dominguez, Miguel Torres, and Taylor Seely, Arizona Republic; Reuters"

      "text": "'Died a hero': Communities mourn officers killed in recent spate of shootings\n\nThree communities across the U.S. are mourning law enforcement officers killed in a recent spate of high-profile shootings.\n\nIn Hinds County, Mississippi, a funeral procession illuminated by streams of squad cars and motorcycles carried the body of 37-year-old Martin Shields Jr . to a church where a service was held on Monday. Shields, a father who had served as a Hinds County deputy for less than a year, was fatally shot a day earlier while responding to a domestic violence call .\n\nIn southern Pennsylvania, officer Andrew Duarte, 30 , was killed in a mass shooting at a hospital Saturday , officials said. The gunman held a hospital worker hostage and shot multiple people, including a doctor, a nurse and a custodian. The shooter was killed in a gunfight with police, which left Duarte with fatal injuries and injured two other officers.\n\nIn Virginia Beach, Cameron Girvin, 25, and Christopher Reese, 30, were fatally shot during a traffic stop Friday night. Police say the gunman - who was later found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound - opened fire during a struggle. Girvin, who was expecting a child this summer, and Reese, who had worked at the department for three years, were remembered for their generosity and public service.\n\nEach of these incidents underscore the daily threats faced by law enforcement and comes after a particularly deadly year for officers.\n\nThe number of U.S. law enforcement professionals who died in the line of duty last year increased 25% from 118 in 2023 to 147 in 2024, according to preliminary data from the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund .\n\nThe leading cause of the deaths was gunfire, responsible for 54 of the fatalities. Forty-six deaths involved vehicles, including 29 fatal traffic crashes, the nonprofit said. The FBI has also tracked an uptick in the number of law enforcement professionals killed in the line of duty.\n\nThe memorial fund vets each death and adds the names of the fallen officers to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington. D.C. CEO Bill Alexander, who is in constant contact with police agencies across the country, said multiple deadly shootings in such short succession is \"concerning.\"\n\n\"Every single one of these deaths is incredibly worrisome for leaders of law enforcement agencies, and the men and women out there doing the job,\" he said. Alexander noted that on any given year, hundreds of law enforcement personnel are shot but manage to survive. \"This is very hard and oftentimes very dangerous work.\"\n\nOn Sunday night in Hinds County, which encompasses part of Jackson, Mississippi, deputies responded to a domestic disturbance call. When Shields arrived at the scene, the suspect, 42-year-old Eric Brown, shot him, officials said. Brown is suspected of shooting his wife and another women, who were reported to be in stable condition.\n\nShields has been remembered as a kind, hard-working deputy in the days since his death. Shields had been employed with the Hinds County Sheriff's Office for approximately nine months. Before that, he worked with the Jackson Police Department .\n\nHe left behind a behind a wife and 12-year-old daughter.\n\nHinds County Sheriff Tyree Jones wrote on social media of the difficulty of informing Shields' family of his death. He said the two men had both responded to an incident involving a capsized boat hours before the fatal shooting.\n\n\"Deputy Shields died a hero. He died while responding to a call for service to assist someone in need. He fulfilled his assignment and his God-given mission on earth,\" Jones said. \"Pray for his family, his friends, the many lives he touched, and the men and women of the HCSO as we all prepare for a final salute. There's absolutely no way I could ever imagine or prepare to tell a family their deputy will not be coming home from their tour of duty. However, tragically, I found myself in that situation late this evening.\"\n\nJackson Police Chief Joseph Wade, called Shields \"a good man, a good person and a good police officer.\"\n\n\"My prayers, thoughts and condolences go out to his family, because I know they're hurting this morning. You had a person that was simply doing their job, and they lost their life,\" Wade said during a news conference this week.\n\nOn Saturday morning, authorities say Diogenes Archangel-Ortiz walked into UPMC Memorial Hospital in York, a city about 25 miles southeast of the Pennsylvania capital, Harrisburg, and took the staff of the ICU hostage, firing several shots and binding the hands of a nurse with zip ties.\n\nHe shot a doctor, a nurse and a custodian, said York County District Attorney Tim Barker. Archangel-Ortiz and police responding to the scene then exchanged fire. Archangel-Ortiz and Duarte were killed in the gunfight and two other officers were injured.\n\nDuarte had worked for the West York Borough Police Department since June 2022 and was a former patrol officer with the Denver Police Department, where he served for five years. He earned commendations for academic achievement when he completed drug recognition expert training, according to the Denver Police Department.\n\nDuarte received a bachelor's degree in criminal justice and political science from Pennsylvania Western University.\n\nOutside of work, he enjoyed \"photography, playing his guitar, hiking, traveling and most importantly spending time with his family,\" according to his obituary . Residents placed flowers and lit candles at the department's administrative offices before gathering for a vigil to remember Duarte. A public service will be held Friday to honor his service before a planned private burial.\n\n\"Officer Duarte was one of the best of us,\" Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro at a news conference. \"He is to be commended for a life of service, albeit one cut too short.\"\n\nOn Friday night, Girvin and Reese attempted to pull over the driver of a Hyundai Sonata with expired plates. The driver ignored them until he came to a dead end, according to officials.\n\nVirginia Beach Police Chief Paul Neudigate said the driver got out of the car and tussled with the two officers. During the struggle, the driver pulled out a pistol and shot both officers. \"He shot them a second\" time while the officers were defenseless on the ground, Neudigate said.\n\nHe \"executed our officers,\" Neudigate said.\n\nThe driver, identified as 42-year-old John McCoy III, was later found dead of an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound at a Virginia Beach apartment complex.\n\nSurrounded by family and friends at two nearby hospitals, the officers were pronounced dead early Saturday morning.\n\n\"I'm gonna be quite honest, we're all hurting,\" Neudigate said. \"We've got an officer that is 25 years old, another one that is 30, with such a future ahead of them, senselessly taken.\"\n\nGirvin had served as a Virginia Beach police officer since 2020, the department said. \"Within that time frame, he touched the lives of so many. His smile was infectious and he brightened every room he was in,\" read a GoFundMe set up to assist his family.\n\nHe was married to his high school sweetheart, Jessica, and the couple was expecting a daughter - to be named Paisley - due this summer, according to the fundraiser.\n\nReese joined the Virginia Beach Police Department in 2022 after serving with the Virginia Beach Sheriff's Office. In 2017, he graduated with a businesses degree from Virginia Wesleyan University in Virginia Beach.\n\nLaw enforcement was a family occupation. His father, George Reese IV, served in the Camden City police department, according to a Facebook post from Gloucester Township's police department.\n\n\"Chris was also a loyal friend and devoted husband,\" read an online fundraiser for his family. \"Chris unfortunately lost his life in a senseless tragedy.\"\n\nContributing: John Bacon, Natalie Neysa Alund and Jeanine Stantucci, USA TODAY; Pam Dankins, Mississippi Clarion Ledger; Jim Walsh, Cherry Hill Courier-Post; Victoria E.

Phil Krynsky.\n\nOne of the officers continued to \"fight for his life\" as of Wednesday night, Krynsky said. The other officer was released Wednesday from the hospital to recover at home.\n\n\"The support we have been receiving from the public and community partners has been unwavering. We appreciate the thoughts and encouragement for our officers as they continue to do the job, knowing one of their own remains in the hospital,\" Mountain View Precinct Commander Leif Myers said.\n\nKrynsky said investigators worked through the night Tuesday to collect evidence at the scene of the shooting, locating a firearm believed to be the one Bal used in the shooting.\n\nBal, a felon with a violent record, was charged with attempted homicide, weapons violations and burglary from a vehicle, according to Krynsky. Bal was held on a $2 million bond.\n\nDonations for the two officers could be made to the Phoenix Police Foundation on their website .\n\n\"\"I continue to keep the two officers injured in my thoughts and ask the entire Phoenix community to join me in supporting their families and our department through this difficult time. The perpetrator's unconscionable act of gun violence against our officers is a stark reminder that their service to our city comes with serious risk and sacrifice, for which we are immensely grateful,\" Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego said in a written statement.\n\nKrynsky noted that Phoenix police observed blue ribbons tied to streetlight poles in the area of the hospital where the two officers were taken.\n\n\"\"I call on all residents to support not only these officers but all members of our police force who continue to serve with courage and dedication,\" Phoenix City Councilmember Kevin Robinson said in a statement.\n\nPhoenix police interim Chief Michael Sullivan also expressed his gratitude for the entire Phoenix Police Department, while praying for the two injured officers."

Sutton, who then chased Hylton-Brown in a car for more than 10 blocks, including down an alley with emergency lights and sirens turned off, according to federal prosecutors. Hylton-Brown was struck by another car as he emerged from the alley and, as he lay unconscious, Sutton and fellow officer Andrew Zabavsky agreed to cover up Sutton's actions, prosecutors have said.\n\nThe pair allowed the driver of the other car to leave within 20 minutes, turned off their body cameras, conferred, and then left without contacting the Metropolitan Police Department's major crash and internal affairs units to start an investigation, according to the Justice Department.\n\nSutton was convicted by a federal jury in December of 2022 of second-degree murder, conspiracy to obstruct, and obstruction of justice. A judge sentenced him to 5 and a half years in prison. The same jury found Zabavsky guilty of conspiracy to obstruct and obstructing justice.

They also worked at the G20 Summit in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe team mostly puts their training to use in Springfield at events where there are large crowds.\n\nThe trip and its expenses will be reimbursed by the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nSpringfield police are also looking to learn from the experience. While the Springfield officers are well-versed with crowds and political figures, Phillips said he and the team will be looking to learn from the police there who routinely protect the president and other high-profile politicians.\n\nNo, the attending officers are from different divisions and units within the department, and there are enough officers in Springfield to cover the shifts.\n\nApproximately 140 Illinois National Guard members are deploying on federal orders.\n\nAround 110 Soldiers and 30 Airmen from the Illinois National Guard will attend.\n\nThe Illinois National Guard force will include 100 Military Police Soldiers from the 933 rd Military Police Company, based in Fort Sheridan, and about 30 Security Forces Airmen from the 183rd Wing based in Springfield, the 126th Air Refueling Wing based at Scott Air Force Base, and the 182nd Airlift Wing based in Peoria.\n\nThere will also be a few service members in the 5 th Civil Support Team (CST), based in Bartonville, and the 126 th Air Refueling Wing, based at Scott Air Force Base.\n\nTom Ackerman covers breaking news and trending news along with general news for the Springfield State Journal-Register.

      "text": "Phoenix police officers get 3-day suspensions over violent arrest of Tyron McAlpin\n\nManage your account\n\nCorrections & Clarifications: A headline was incorrect in a previous version of this article.\n\nThree Phoenix police officers will receive 24-hour unpaid suspensions for their involvement in the violent arrest of Tyron McAlpin, a deaf man with cerebral palsy, according to police.\n\nInterim police Chief Michael Sullivan issued the discipline in response to the assault and repeated shocking of McAlpin in August 2024. Two of the officers were also required to complete additional de-escalation training, police said in a March 25 news release.\n\nThe attack on McAlpin drew public outcry and criticism from local leaders after footage of the encounter was released. Sullivan said the department took those concerns seriously and the suspensions reflected its commitment to \"accountability and maintaining public trust.\"\n\n\"At the same time, we stand by the men and women of this department who are placed in difficult situations every day,\" he said. \"We will continue to support our officers with training and guidance to ensure they can perform their duties safely and effectively. Our goal is to learn from this and move forward together as a stronger department and community.\"\n\nPolice declined to name the officers who were suspended, saying the information would be available once an administrative investigation was complete. In October, police said officers Benjamin Harris and Kyle Sue were placed on administrative leave while the department investigated their involvement in McAlpin's arrest. A federal lawsuit filed by lawyers for McAlpin in March also accused officer Jorge Acosta of wrongdoing.\n\nOn Aug. 19, 2024, officers Harris and Sue responded to a trespassing call at a Circle K near Indian School Road and 12th Street. The white man they were asked to remove from the store told them he was attacked and directed them to McAlpin, who was across the street.\n\nAccording to police body camera footage, Harris told McAlpin to stop. Within seconds, Harris grabbed McAlpin and the two struggled. Harris used a stun gun on him four times, then both officers collectively punched McAlpin over a dozen times, according to video recordings.\n\nAfter the beating, Acosta tried justifying the officers' actions by falsely saying in a report that the white man told police McAlpin had assaulted him and stolen his phone, according to the federal lawsuit.\n\nThe encounter left McAlpin jailed for three weeks. He faced aggravated assault and resisting arrest charges that Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell eventually dropped .\n\nThe attack on McAlpin occurred two months after the U.S. Department of Justice released a report concluding that the Phoenix Police Department had widespread problems, including routinely using excessive force .\n\nSullivan was tapped to lead Phoenix police on an interim basis in September 2022 and is a finalist to be the department's chief. Phoenix police union members have said in recent surveys they were overwhelmingly opposed to Sullivan staying on as the police chief because he was leading the department in the wrong direction and wasn't supportive in trying times.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Arizona Republic: Phoenix officers get 3-day suspensions over arrest of Tyron McAlpin"

      "text": "3 Phoenix officers disciplined for violent arrest of deaf Black man\n\nManage your account\n\nThree Arizona officers who were involved last year in the violent arrest of Black man who is deaf and suffers from cerebral palsy have been disciplined, the Phoenix Police Department announced Tuesday.\n\nIn August 2024, police bodycam video showed Tyron McAlpin being repeatedly tased and punched by Phoenix police after they responded to a call about a White man loitering at a convenience store.\n\nThe video, which prompted widespread condemnation, captured two officers jumping out of their patrol vehicle and immediately punching McAlpin at least 10 times. In the video, one of the officers alleges that McAplin bit him and the other claims McAplin swung at him.\n\nThe man who had placed the 911 call told officers he had been assaulted, that his cell phone had been stolen, and pointed out McAlpin as the culprit.\n\nHowever, McAlpin was never charged over the man's claim. Instead, he was arrested on felony allegations of assaulting the officers and resisting arrest.\n\nThose charges were dropped by Maricopa County Attorney Rachel Mitchell last October. No criminal charges were brought against the officers.\n\nThe police department said in a statement Tuesday that three officers were given \"24-hour unpaid suspensions,\" and two of the officers were also required to attend \"additional de-escalation training.\"\n\nThose three officers were not named Tuesday. However, the two officers seen in the video assaulting McAlpin were previously identified as Benjamin Harris and Kyle Sue.\n\nIn a statement, interim Phoenix Police Chief Michael Sullivan said, \"We understand the concerns raised by this incident, and we take them seriously.

      "text": "Testimony: Officers concealed from Perkins before fatal shooting\n\nManage your account\n\nMar. 26-At the immunity hearing Tuesday that will decide if former Decatur police officer Mac Bailey Marquette is tried for murder, four witnesses testified, including an officer who acknowledged that police may initially have been hidden from Steve Perkins' view as he walked outside of his house the night his truck was repossessed and he allegedly threatened the tow truck driver.\n\nEvery seat in Morgan County Circuit Judge Charles Elliott's courtroom was filled as supporters of both the Perkins and Marquette families packed the room. Steve Perkins' widow, Catrela, and his older brother, Nick, sat with the prosecution, while Marquette sat alongside his defense team.\n\nMorgan County District Attorney Scott Anderson and Assistant District Attorney Garrick Vickery represented the state. Marquette was represented by Liz Young and Brett Bloomston of Birmingham.\n\nThe defense called as their first witness, Caleb Combs, the tow truck driver who attempted to repossess Perkins' white GMC Sierra truck after 1 a.m. on Sep. 29, 2023.\n\n\"What happened during your first visit to the Perkins' residence?\" Bloomston asked Combs.\n\n\"I started to back up to the vehicle, and I heard the garage door open up,\" Combs replied. \"I stopped to see what was going on and I noticed a man come from under the garage door with a pistol.\"\n\nCombs said Perkins told him to drop his \"f***ing truck\" and to get off his property. He said Perkins had a firearm aimed 6 or 8 inches from his chest.\n\nNext on the stand was Christopher Mukadam, one of the Decatur police officers with Marquette who was on scene at the Perkins residence.\n\nMukadam testified that although what Perkins did by threatening Combs was considered menacing, Combs told them he did not want to press charges if Perkins would just surrender the truck.\n\nBloomston asked Mukadam if he had ever responded to a vehicle repossession call in which the owner was hostile.\n\n\"Back in July of that year, we responded to a call on Lafayette Street where the homeowner was acting hostile,\" Mukadam said.\n\nWhen asked if he was lawfully allowed to be there on Lafayette Street, Mukadam replied he was.\n\nMukadam said he was only at Perkins' residence to \"keep the peace.\"\n\nAnderson then questioned Mukadam and asked if he believed he was keeping the peace by showing up at Perkins' residence unannounced and they could have resolved the situation a different way.\n\n\"It could have been handled differently, there's many different ways,\" Mukadam said. \"But there was nothing wrong with standing by and watching because we were following all the training that we had.\"\n\nAnderson asked Mukadam why officers didn't simply knock on Perkins' door, to which Mukadam responded that it was a civil matter unrelated to them and that they were only there for the tow truck driver's protection.\n\nHe then asked Mukadam if it was possible he and his fellow officers may have been hidden from Perkins' view.\n\n\"You don't consider yourself as being hidden from Mr. Perkins?\" Anderson said.\n\n\"Uh - you could say that,\" Mukadam said, hesitating.\n\n\"I'm asking you,\" Anderson replied.\n\nMukadam said officers are trained at the police academy to use concealment in certain situations.\n\n\"So, you agree with me now that you were concealed from Mr. Perkins,\" Anderson said.\n\n\"Yes,\" Mukadam replied.\n\nBody camera footage from Mukadam and former officer Joey Williams was shown in the courtroom. Immediately after Perkins exited his house and confronted the tow truck driver, several shots could be heard from Marquette on the footage. Williams' footage was seen from the passenger side of Perkins' truck and Mukadam's footage was from across the street.\n\nAlabama Law Enforcement Agency Special Agent Jamie King testified, while describing slow-motion bodycam footage, that Perkins initially pointed his flashlight-equipped gun at Combs, then at Marquette, but raised his gun away from Marquette immediately before Marquette began shooting the first of what appeared to be 18 bullets. King also said the bullet in Perkins' gun was not chambered.\n\nTwice in the hearing, Elliott chastised both Perkins and Marquette supporters for unruly behavior. The second time, he threatened to clear the courtroom if they continued.\n\nAfter eight hours of evidence, arguments, and witness testimony from both the state and defense, Elliott announced the hearing would resume Wednesday morning.\n\n\"I doubt, based on the evidence presented today, that I will have an order (Wednesday),\" Elliott said. \"I highly doubt that.\"\n\nHe warned that if more unruly behavior from the Perkins and Marquette supporters continues Wednesday, they will be charged with disorderly conduct.\n\n\"I will halt proceedings and those people will be taken into custody,\" Elliott said.\n\n- wesley.tomlinson@decaturdaily.com or 256-340-2442."

Six months later, people searching for missing relatives found clothing and human remains, raising questions about the initial investigation, including a failure to search the site thoroughly.\n\nAttorney General Alejandro Gertz Manero, who took over the investigation last week, promised there would be no cover-up in the investigation, saying extensive evidence meant that the \"truth will come out.\"\n\nOn Sunday, the state attorney general's office said one of the former police officers arrested is accused of kidnapping a man who was held at the ranch. The former officer and colleagues detained the victim for a supposed search as he was riding a motorbike, before handing him over to a group who took him to the site, the statement added.\n\nThe victim was later released from the ranch following an armed confrontation, the state attorney general's office said.\n\nBoth ex-police officers belonged to a police department whose chief had already been detained.\n\nSome 124,000 people are officially registered as missing in Mexico, mostly since 2006 when the government declared war on drug cartels.\n\nGuerreros Buscadores, a so-called collective dedicated to locating missing people, discovered the human remains on March 5, sparking protests across Mexico .

      "text": "Lawrence officer drove with knee while shooting at fleeing suspect's car, sparking questions\n\nManage your account\n\nRecently released bodycam footage showing a Lawrence Police Department officer firing a rifle through his front windshield during a police pursuit has raised questions about safety and protocol.\n\nLawrence police Lt. David Gordon, a 15-year veteran, is seen on the video steering with his left knee and pulling the rifle up with his right hand to fire at a dark-colored Chevrolet car that, moments earlier, he'd attempted to stop for a license plate issue. The car initially pulled over and a woman got out.\n\nBefore the car speeds away, Gordon yells, \"Put the car in park right f*cking now unless you want to have a bad day.\"\n\nThey're the first words heard by Gordon in an edited video released by Indianapolis Metropolitan Police because of their involvement in the pursuit that started with the traffic stop just after 4 p.m. on Dec. 30, 2024, in the 6900 block of Pendleton Pike .\n\nThe 11-minute video contains footage from bodycams, squad car dashcams, and public safety traffic cameras of the pursuit and shooting that led to 48-year-old Kenneth T. Roberts Jr.'s death.\n\nMan dead after traffic stop: Pursuit leads to shots fired by Indianapolis and Lawrence police\n\nThe other officers who discharged their weapons in the shooting were 7-year Lawrence police Sgt. Mateo Argresta and Indianapolis officer Owen Duckett, who's been with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department for one year.\n\nThe chase lasted almost 2.5 miles and resulted in over 50 gunshots audible on video as both Roberts and police fired rounds, according to investigators.\n\nThe footage also shows Roberts' vehicle weaving between vehicles and sometimes driving into oncoming traffic before eventually being fatally shot in the 6500 block of East 30th Street. No one else was hurt during the shooting, but multiple cars were struck by gunfire.\n\nThe video was shared across social media platforms with one post amassing over 31,000 views and nearly 300 comments from people with concerns and questions about how police handled the pursuit and whether it was warranted.\n\nIndiana's statewide police pursuit policy adopted in 2022 states officers should use their discretion when initiating a pursuit and should not pursue if the risk to public safety greatly outweighs the need for immediate apprehension.\n\nLawrence Police Deputy Chief, Travis Cline, told IndyStar the department is trained to abandon a pursuit if someone evading a traffic stop starts driving recklessly since that could put others in danger.\n\nBefore Gordon could approach Roberts' vehicle, he sped off. Gordon followed the vehicle from a strip mall parking lot, weaving through nearby U-Haul storage units and then turning west onto East 38th Street and speeding down the bus only lane to pass other cars. Gordon had to avoid hitting a red SUV to follow.\n\nFootage showed Roberts driving for nearly half a mile before police say he shot at Gordon.\n\n\"Once he fired a round at police that takes it to a whole other level,\" Cline said. \"That is a very dangerous person so we don't terminate the pursuit.\"\n\nLaw enforcement officials said Roberts shot at least twice before Indianapolis officer Owen Duckett joined the pursuit near East 38th Street and North Arlington Avenue.\n\nA public safety camera then captures Roberts driving into oncoming traffic and avoiding a pickup. The footage also depicts the back windshield of the Chevy being shot out. Police said the rear window was broken from Roberts firing at officers.\n\nAs Roberts kept driving south on North Arlington Avenue, Gordon told dispatch that Roberts fired more shots. That's when video footage shows Gordon using a rifle to shoot four rounds out of the front windshield of his police vehicle while steering with his knee.\n\n\"(Gordon) is also a SWAT officer for the Lawrence Police Department, so he has more training,\" Cline explained to IndyStar. \"(He) also never had traffic coming the opposite direction toward him so he was not firing into oncoming traffic.\"\n\nBased on the video footage, Gordon always stayed in the right lane while pursuing Roberts.\n\nRoberts turned left on East 30th Street.\n\nThe video shows Roberts driving into the wrong lane again into oncoming traffic. He avoids hitting three vehicles before shots ring out and the Chevy is seen slowing near an IndyGo bus stop. Audio depicts Gordon firing at least 12 more rounds during the pursuit before pulling over his police vehicle.\n\nWhile Gordon was shooting at Roberts' vehicle, another Lawrence Police officer told dispatch that Roberts was continuously firing at them. Body cam footage from Gordon shows him firing an additional eight rounds before exiting his police vehicle and firing 13 more times, reloading and firing again twice before he's heard saying, \"I can't see him.\"\n\nBodycam footage from Lawrence police Sgt. Mateo Argresta shows him firing off 10 rounds at Roberts from a different angle.\n\nBodycam footage from IMPD officer Owen Duckett shows a clear view of the Chevy. Duckett's firearm is heard and it appears gunshots are coming from Roberts' vehicle. Duckett then shoots another 10 times before reloading his Glock.\n\nOfficers gave verbal commands for several minutes for Roberts to get out of the vehicle and show his hands.\n\nA SWAT vehicle was then used to approach the Chevy where officers found him unresponsive. Roberts was removed from the car and pronounced dead at the scene. A firearm was found near him.\n\nIndyStar asked Brian Baxter, who spent 30 years in law enforcement with the Texas Department of Public Safety to examine the critical incident video. The retired assistant chief is a use-of-force analyst and police practices specialist.\n\n\"Shooting through his [Gordon] windshield at the car is historically unconventional, but it's been occurring more and more as patrol rifles become more prevalent,\" Baxter said. \"Sometimes it's done responsibly and sometimes it's not. Based on what I see he is timing his fire and there's no traffic in the backstop. He appears to be doing a good job managing the risk of bystanders but I'd have to see every angle unedited to really make that determination.\"\n\nBaxter said just because a shot is risky, doesn't make it less necessary, but it requires officers to take extra steps in their decision-making. Distance, angles, elevation, and accurate fire should always be used to mitigate the risk of bystanders getting hurt.\n\n\"I'm not familiar with Lawrence or these agencies, so I'm watching this assuming that the audio is synced correctly to the video,\" Baxter said. \"I'd have to see their policies and officer training records to make a fair assessment, but based on what I see in front of me the immediacy of this threat was high.\"\n\nIn a tweet shared to social media, IMPD Fraternal Order of Police president, Rick Snyder, highlighted officers' \"stellar work,\" while sharing clips from the critical incident video.\n\nHe said it demonstrates the value of \"superior\" police training, equipment, and skills while also showing there are times when officers must shoot at or from a moving vehicle.\n\nWhat dash & body cams show happened: Heated clash between man, Lawrence police goes viral\n\nLast month, Lawrence Police Officer Robert Santiago was placed on administrative leave after a viral video from a bystander captured two officers wrestling a man to the ground in the Walmart parking lot on Pendleton Pike.\n\nOne of the officers is seen kicking the man and stepping on his legs before using a Taser on him. The other officer appears to punch the man in the head several times while he attempts to detain him. A police report claims the man instigated the violence by punching officers before bystanders started recording.\n\nThe man was arrested but later released after the Marion County Prosecutor's Office declined to charge him pending further investigation.\n\nCourt records: Body cam footage didn't capture key moment in Lawrence police shooting\n\nThree days before Roberts shooting death by police, Lawrence PD had another traffic-stop-turned-shooting.\n\nAccording to court documents, Lawrence Police officers Khalid Brooks and Benjamin Thomas conducted an initial traffic stop on Dec. 27, 2024, near 52 nd Street and Kercheval Drive when a driver did not obey a stop sign. Body-worn camera footage showed one of the officers asking for a man's license and registration before he rolled up his window and revved his engine.\n\nWhat it doesn't capture is the man reaching toward the passenger side where investigators later found a rifle, but that's what police say happened when the officer stepped away from the car for his safety. \"However, (the officer) would have a different point of view than what his bodycam shows,\" the affidavit for the driver's arrest said.\n\nCourt records also revealed the second officer's body camera went dark due to a \"technical malfunction.\"\n\nAs the officers moved from the car, they drew their guns and fired at the man, who drove away and was arrested after abandoning his vehicle and seeking medical attention at a hospital.\n\n\"I understand that recent events have raised questions and concerns about the actions of our police officers,\" Lawrence Mayor Deb Whitfield told IndyStar. \"It is important to acknowledge that critical incidents of this nature can happen, but it is equally important to address these issues with transparency, accountability, and a commitment to continuous improvement.\"\n\nWhitfield said with any use of force involving Lawrence officers, several internal policies and procedures should be followed.\n\n\"We must trust the process, and I'm confident in our process,\" Whitfield said.\n\nThe actions of officers resulting in Roberts' death are being investigated by Indianapolis Police's critical response team and internal affairs as well as Lawrence's Use of Force Board and internal affairs.\n\n\"If there's something that our officers, speaking for IMPD, need to be held accountable for you'll hear me talk about that,\" Chief Chris Bailey said at the time of the shooting.\n\nAll Lawrence officers involved in these cases have returned to full duty and were reviewed by their Use of Force Board except Robert Santiago, who remains on administrative leave. Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Officer Owen Duckett also returned to full duty but hasn't yet gone before the department's Use of Force Board.\n\nJade Jackson is a Public Safety Reporter for the Indianapolis Star.

She said that she had entered the restroom with her ex-girlfriend, who handed her a tampon, when two male deputies stormed in, shining flashlights into the stall and demanding she exit. Morton, still using the toilet, was stunned.\n\nRelated : Cis Woman Mistaken as Transgender Records Being Berated in Bathroom\n\n\"They were flashing lights on our feet and saying, 'You have to get out of here. You have to come out. We need to talk to you,'\" Morton said. \"I'm telling them, 'I'm still using the restroom. I'm sitting down, I'm peeing. What is the issue?'\"\n\nWhen she finally exited the stall, she said she lifted her shirt to prove she was not a man, expecting the ordeal to end. Instead, she said one deputy continued to question her appearance, insisting she \"looked like a man.\" Morton started recording, later posting a 9-second clip to TikTok, where it has since been viewed more than 3.7 million times. \"They came in here in the girls' restroom because I'm a girl and they didn't think I was a girl, so they tried to come take me away,\" she says in the video.\n\n\"The only men in the women's restroom were the cops,\" Morton told The Advocate . \"That's what makes this so frustrating. If you think a man is in the restroom, why send male officers instead of female officers?\"\n\nThe Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed that the incident is under internal affairs investigation. In a statement to The Advocate , Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said, \"The Pima County Sheriff's Department takes all citizen complaints seriously and investigates each and every one of them.\" He indicated that the department has not gotten a complaint, but that authorities are aware of the social media video and \"are currently looking into the matter.\"\n\nWhen asked by The Advocate in a follow-up email whether officers are frequently called to the Walmart location for shoplifting or drug-related calls, Nanos declined to comment and said he would answer questions once the investigation is complete. \"As I mentioned previously, once the matter is completely investigated, the Pima County Sheriff's Department will gladly speak with you,\" Nanos wrote.\n\nKalaya Morton Courtesy Kalaya Morton\n\nOn Wednesday, the sheriff's department requested in a post on Facebook that anyone with information come forward.\n\nMorton told The Advocate that she hadn't made an official complaint with the sheriff's department yet but that she intended to report the incident. She also said she believed a Walmart cashier had called authorities, as the employee had been watching her closely before she entered the restroom.\n\nA representative for Walmart confirmed knowledge of the situation when contacted by The Advocate . \"We're cooperating with the police investigation,\" a spokesperson said, declining to speak further.\n\nMorton said she hasn't used a public restroom since the incident. She explained that in her daily life, she usually ignores when people misgender her, understanding that her masculine presentation might lead to assumptions. 'If someone mistakes me for a guy, I usually just correct them or let it go,' she said. 'But this was different. This wasn't just someone calling me 'sir'-this was law enforcement trying to remove me from a bathroom where I had every right to be.' \"I'm afraid now. It's already enough being Black and facing discrimination. Now I have to worry about being harassed just for needing to pee?\" she said.\n\nDetermined to fight back, Morton said she intends to seek legal counsel. \"They had no reason to do that to me,\" she said. \"I know my rights, and I'm going to make sure this doesn't happen to someone else.\"\n\nRelated: Lauren Boebert & Nancy Mace confront woman they thought was trans in 'predictable' Capitol bathroom incident\n\n\"This isn't just about me,\" Morton continued. \"It's about making sure this doesn't happen to the next person who just wants to use the restroom without being harassed.\"\n\nArizona does not have a law dictating who can use which restroom, yet the incident comes amid growing national scrutiny over restroom access and gender policing, with lawmakers increasingly pushing policies that target transgender and gender-nonconforming people. Recently, an Arizona lawmaker reintroduced legislation targeting bathroom access and pronoun use in schools, measures that activists argue put transgender students at risk.\n\nJust last month, Republican lawmakers at the U.S. Capitol mistakenly confronted a cisgender woman in a restroom, believing she was transgender after House Speaker Mike Johnson implemented rules restricting restroom use based on assigned sex at birth."

(WEHT) - According to the Mount Vernon Police Department (MVPD), a woman allegedly fled from an officer and resisted arrest, but some officers were injured in the process.\n\nOfficers say on March 20, around 9:45 p.m., a MVPD officer was on patrol in a marked police vehicle when he observed a gray mid-sized car traveling at a high rate of speed on 2nd Street and allegedly committing other traffic violations including failing to signal a turn. As the officer attempted to catch up to the vehicle, officers say the vehicle quickly pulled into the parking lot near 2nd Street and Main Street behind some apartments, with the officer pulling in behind the vehicle.\n\nCar accident leads to drug bust in Posey County\n\nMVPD says the driver, later identified as Amanda Osborne, 39, of Mount Vernon, quickly exited the vehicle carrying a black bag, and walked quickly toward the door of the apartments. The officer asked Osborne to come talk to him so he could address the traffic violations. Osborne allegedly yelled that he had no probable cause to stop her and she fled into the apartments where she ran up the stairs and into an apartment.\n\nPolice say the officer could hear her inside one particular apartment so he knocked on the door where a male subject answered but denied him access. The officer went outside to wait for backup officers and while he was speaking with other officers about the incident, Osborne and her father exited the apartment building. The officer approached Osborne to detain her and when he attempted to do so, police say she began actively fighting the officers. Osborne allegedly continued to resist and fight the officers, however officers were able to take her into custody.\n\nPolice officer and husband save woman's life with CPR and AED\n\nMVPD says during the struggle, the arresting officer sustained injuries and pain to his knee and another officer was allegedly kicked in the chin by Osborne, causing the officer to chip a tooth and sustain pain. After the officers secured Osborne, officers say she made statements acknowledging that she knew the officer was, in fact, a police officer, and that she fled from him upon entering the apartment building. Officers say they also located suspected Suboxone in the vehicle that Amanda was driving.\n\nMVPD says Osborne was arrested and lodged at the Posey County Jail, and she has been charged with Battery against Public Safety Official with Injury, Resisting Law Enforcement Causing Injury and Possession of Controlled Substance.\n\n\"Eyewitness News.

But racial bias and criminal punishments for small infractions may damage the very relationships they hope to build, critics say.\n\nLoading...\n\nJan. 27, 2017, 3:17 p.m. ET\n\nPolice officers may hope that their presence in schools will help them build strong relationships with students, improving police-community relations over the long term. But achieving that goal may require rethinking law enforcement's role in education, a new report suggests.\n\nLooking at federal data from the 2013-2014 school year, researchers at Education Week found that students in schools with at least one school resource officer (SRO) were 1.5 times more likely to be arrested than their peers in schools that did not have a police presence. The disparity is particularly stark for black students, possibly because police presence is concentrated in districts with a higher proportion of minority students. Black boys were three times more likely to be arrested at school than white boys, the report found.\n\nRather than building relationships and improving outcomes, students who are arrested or referred to law enforcement can see a drop in school performance and are disproportionately more likely to get involved with the law again as adults, researchers say. Racial bias means that outcomes are particularly poor in communities of color.\n\n\"If you lock kids up when they're young, they're more likely to end up locked up as an adult,\" Joseph Doyle, an associate professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management, previously told The Christian Science Monitor. \"So it looks like tough-on-crime doesn't really work, it just leads to more crime .\"\n\nSpurred by rising fears of violent crime during the 1980s and 1990s, some schools began turning to police to increase safety on campus. With federal funding, their presence only grew. Following tragedies like the school shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado, an increasing number of parents called for security measures like metal detectors and armed officers. By 2013-14, 44,000 \"school resource officers\" worked in schools on a full- or part-time basis, Education Week reported.\n\nIn some cases, hiring these officers has resulted in an impressive drop in incidents. When Burns Elementary School in Charleston, S.C., hired longtime area cop Eric Jourdan, it saw a decline from 35 incidents in the first half of the year to five in the second half of the year, The Post and Courier reported.\n\n\"Our community overall has such a poor perception of the reason for law enforcement,\" Principal Lynn Owings told The Post and Courier. \"Building that relationship with students when they are young will change their lives forever .\"\n\nBut the national picture is less positive. Particularly in schools with a high proportion of minorities, the SROs are overused, taking on disciplinary functions that classroom teachers have traditionally performed, experts say.\n\n\"When you're in charge of kids occasionally you need to discipline them, and when you have SROs, that's who you're going to rely on. That's been the mechanical thing: They're there, so you'll use them,\" Emily Owens, an associate professor of criminology at the University of Pennsylvania, previously told the Monitor.\n\nArresting students, rather than having a classroom teacher discipline them, brings financial and emotional costs. An American Civil Liberties Union report found that arrested students were twice as likely to drop out of high school - and for those who appeared in court, that figure doubled.\n\nEven for those who stay in school, their experience may change.\n\n\"Even though I had good grades, my teachers treated me differently after that,\" explained Keshaundra Neal, arrested after walking past a fight in her school when she was 13, in a report for Voices of Youth in Chicago Education .\n\n\"They saw me as someone who got into fights and got arrested,\" she said. Many students report feeling traumatized by their encounter with law enforcement.\n\nCompounding the problem, the cost of employing school resource officers means many schools with a police presence are less likely to have school counselors who can keep an eye on the psychological and developmental effects of arrests on children, Education Week reported. Detaining students also drains the budget of money that could be used to educate them.\n\nSo how can police officers help ensure safety without becoming disciplinarians who grease the school-to-prison pipeline? Training is key, National Association of School Resource Officers executive director Mo Canady told Education Week. SROs should see themselves not only as members of law enforcement, but also embrace their role as educators on issues like drug prevention and as informal counselors for students, Mr. Canady said.\n\nThe Obama administration supported this training.\n\n\"A routine school disciplinary infraction should land a student in the principal's office, not in a police precinct,\" then-Attorney General Eric Holder said.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

What it showed was one officer shooting a retreating Mr. McDonald, and then pumping over a dozen more bullets into the teenager's body as he lay on the ground.\n\nAs the director of the Chicago Law School's Civil Rights and Police Accountability Project, Craig Futterman spent a year in court alongside his students demanding the release of the footage. A judge finally agreed. On the eve of the release, an officer was charged in Mr. McDonald's killing. Sixteen officers were implicated in a cover-up. The police commissioner lost his job.\n\nHopes that such transparency would improve accountability and curb police brutality more broadly have in part dwindled. Video of five officers beating a motorist named Tyre Nichols to death in Memphis, Tennessee, was \"dispiriting,\" to say the least, Professor Futterman says.\n\nProgress is piecemeal. Transparency alone has not led to the progress that many hoped for. But the perhaps-rising trend of officers being held to account for unjustified violence - as happened in Memphis, by admission of the police chief there - may have more fundamental impacts in the long term. Our graphics offer context on the challenges.\n\n\"It's a weird kind of progress: The videos are now out there, because this is ultimately trying to stop that violence and trying to address the underlying racism and fundamentally change these systems so that they actually promote safety and prioritize the sanctity of everybody's life,\" Professor Futterman says. \"But nationally, police are killing at the same rate or even more than they have ever killed. It's a kind of Pyrrhic victory.\"\n\nSOURCE: Federal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Mapping Police Violence | Jacob Turcotte/Staff\n\nFederal Bureau of Investigation, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Mapping Police Violence\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Now the Capitol attack has put a spotlight on sympathies within police ranks toward right-wing extremists.\n\nThe vast majority of officers fought valiantly to protect lawmakers from harm. One officer died, 60 were injured, and the department lost another to suicide. But Capitol Police has opened as many as a dozen investigations into reports that officers aided the mob, and at least two have been suspended. Sworn officers were also on the other side, joining the rioters, a fact that has Mr. Erwin shaking his head. More than two dozen officers are under investigation for their participation in Jan. 6 events.\n\n\"If officers went up there and did that, that's a criminal act, and you ought to be held accountable like everybody else.\"\n\nAs the FBI braces the country for more trouble ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration, the attack on the Capitol revealed a troubling national blind spot: the political radicalization of police that predates the presidency of Donald Trump.\n\nMany Americans are struggling to understand the dynamics of right-wing terrorism, including the role of law enforcement officers and military personnel, and how rhetoric and mass psychology help to answer a fundamental question: Who do police protect and who do they protect them from?\n\n\"So often we tend to look at far-right militancy as something on the fringes of our society, tantamount to Al Qaeda and ISIS, without realizing that, no, these are members of state legislatures, police officers, military personnel,\" says former FBI agent Michael German, who infiltrated and prosecuted neo-Nazi groups in the 1990s.\n\nHe argues that the potential threat to public safety from the far right is much greater, given the cloak of authority under which these extremists can operate. \"Their capabilities are actually on par with any foreign terrorist group, if not greater. They don't just have the passion of their beliefs. What they have is government sanction.\"\n\nSince 2000, more than two dozen states have unmasked police officers with connections to white supremacist groups. Hundreds of federal, state, and local law enforcement officials have been caught expressing racist, nativist, and sexist views on social media, according to a September 2020 report by the Brennan Center for Justice in New York.\n\nThose facts provide an uneasy backdrop to the Jan. 6 attack, where police leaders seemingly underestimated the threat, leaving the crucible of democracy vulnerable to a mob. The former chief of U.S. Capitol Police, who resigned in the aftermath, has said that security officials at the House and Senate declined to call in the National Guard in advance of a rally, which included remarks by President Trump, that had been hyped as a final showdown.\n\nLarger failures of imagination, added to biases of individual police officers, are part of what analysts say makes police reform so difficult - and makes radicalization among officers possible. Making the issue harder for Americans to see is institutional discomfort at the FBI, in particular, to confront the problem publicly. The FBI tells its agents, for instance, to not discuss white supremacy cases around local police for fear of tipoffs, says Mr. German.\n\nMeanwhile, Congress has struggled to get data to compare the agency's response to Black Lives Matter protests against right-wing extremist activities last year, which killed dozens of Americans, including officers. In 2019, the FBI established the Domestic Terrorism-Hate Crimes Fusion Cell. But in its reporting to Congress it has lumped in antifa, an anti-fascist movement, with right-wing extremists like Boogaloos, an equivalency that critics say muddies the threat that should be prioritized.\n\nBrian Corr, a past president of the National Association for Civilian Oversight of Law Enforcement, says the history of U.S. slave patrols has cast a long shadow in Black communities. This contrasts with the story that cops tell themselves that \"the public are the police and the police are the public,\" he says.\n\n\"Both of these are historically true. But part of what's happening in our society is that people are unable to hold competing truths. For many, there is only one truth: Either police are corrupt and violent and racist or they're heroes that run toward gunfire when we run away from it,\" says Mr. Corr.\n\nThat divide has only sharpened under President Trump, who has at times attempted to blur the line between politics and policing. He invoked \"law and order\" when he sent federal police to quell protests in Portland, Oregon, against the wishes of local authorities and used them last June to clear peaceful protests from Washington's Lafayette Square so he could be photographed holding a Bible outside a church. His militaristic rhetoric on the border has also energized Border Patrol members.\n\nAccording to the Center for Strategic and International Studies , right-wing groups were responsible for 41 politically motivated attacks and plots last year, including attacks that killed police officers in Santa Cruz and Oakland, California; Kimberly, Alabama; and Ely, Nevada. There were 12 left-wing attacks and plots in the same period. Police officers were also hurt and some seriously injured, at times by gunfire, during last summer's social justice protests. Still, lethal threats to law enforcement have primarily come from right-wing extremists.\n\n\"That is what is hard to understand about the apparent affinity in law enforcement for far-right militants at riots,\" says Mr. German.\n\nAnalysts say the policing of Black Lives Matters protests and of protests by white and armed participants reflects that affinity. Last August, when pro-police groups rallied in Kenosha, Wisconsin, to face down racial justice protesters, police handed out water bottles to militiamen, including Kyle Rittenhouse, an armed white teen who allegedly shot dead two men and injured a third.\n\nTo many analysts, the preparation for pro-Trump protests at the Capitol was perhaps the ultimate expression of that bias in terms of which groups pose a threat to public safety.\n\nMeanwhile, pandemic malaise, social unrest, and on-the-job traumas endured by police officers, particularly military veterans, have likely boosted radicalization in the ranks. While veterans make up around 6% of the population, nearly 1 in 5 police officers previously served in the military, according to a 2017 analysis of U.S. census data.\n\n\"Folks go into these dangerous places and come back disillusioned with their own government and come back with a counterinsurgency mindset and techniques,\" says Boston University law professor Robert Tsai, author of \"Practical Equality: Forging Justice in a Divided Nation.\" \"One of the potential consequences ... is that more [right-wing officeholders] demand that police join their political efforts, their political aims. And when law enforcement becomes politicized, it becomes radicalized.\"\n\nFormer Baltimore police officer Peter Moskos agrees that the Jan. 6 attack likely caused a \"reckoning\" for police unions that tend to reflexively blame racial justice protests for endangering police.\n\nBut he points to how law enforcement, a naturally conservative institution that is often the target of progressive critiques, actually performed in the hourslong siege at the Capitol.\n\n\"Yeah, there are racists in police departments, but that's not the problem we're facing now,\" says Mr. Moskos, now a criminologist at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. \"At some level they failed miserably, but, that said, one of them got killed and they literally fought, died, and saved our democracy. Those words aren't often said.\"\n\nStill, professionalism is key for police to maintain a public trust that has been battered over the last year, in part because of the anger stirred by the killing last May of George Floyd and the police response to months of protests across the country.\n\nThe FBI on Wednesday arrested two Rocky Mount, Virginia, police officers - both military veterans, including one who was injured in an improvised explosive device attack in Iraq - after they posted pictures of themselves inside the Capitol. The men said they were welcomed in, but also said in social media posts that they \"attacked\" the building. They face charges of trespassing, disorderly conduct, and using threatening or abusive language inside the Capitol.\n\nThe Seattle Police Department is investigating two officers for their role in the insurrection at the Capitol.\n\nOath Keepers, an anti-government militia that boasts of having military and police among its members, were also on hand last week. According to the Anti-Defamation League, Oath Keepers aim much of their propaganda at military and police, reminding them that their oath to the Constitution includes defending it \"from all enemies, foreign and domestic.\" Their propaganda is of a global order that must be resisted by patriots, lest they are disarmed and sent to concentration camps.\n\nAmong those who didn't go to Washington last week was former Sheriff Richard Mack of Arizona's Graham County, the founder of the Constitutional Sheriffs and Peace Officers Association.\n\n\"I was browbeat for not going, but I just had a bad feeling about it,\" says Mr. Mack. \"The bottom line is, a lot of people are frustrated in this country, and I understand that frustration, and that frustration comes from both Republicans and Democrats making a mockery of our Constitution. But I will never support violence. And my message remains the same to all police and all military: Keep your oath to uphold and defend the Constitution. That's how we will fix this problem and restore the peace.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Constitutional sheriffs contend that they have the power to rebuff federal laws that they - not judges - deem unconstitutional. And they have vowed to not enforce gun restrictions and mask mandates.\n\n\"You see a lot of these self-described constitutional sheriffs also active in the militia movement,\" says Mr. Tsai, who sees a slippery path to radicalization in sheriff activism. \"They are now engaged in anti-mask, anti-pandemic actions, and they proudly say, 'We're not going to enforce these things.' They are part of this broader right-wing politicization of law enforcement.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But a new report reveals surprising areas of agreement between many members of law enforcement and police-reform advocates.\n\nLoading...\n\nJan. 11, 2017, 4:56 p.m. ET\n\nWhen it comes to accusations of racially-biased policing, most officers and citizens don't see eye to eye , a new report from the Pew Research Center has confirmed.\n\nBut strip away race from the equation, and there may be more common ground between police and police reform advocates than one would assume.\n\nThe Pew poll published Wednesday - the first nationally representative survey of how American police view the debate over officers' treatment of black Americans since Michael Brown was shot in Ferguson, Mo. in 2014 - found that, much like the Black Lives Matter activists who have taken to the streets to push for reform, the majority of officers support the use of body cameras, would like to relax marijuana laws, and say that police training could be better. These areas of common ground, while not surprising to those who study policing, are often lost in the narrative of law enforcement vs. the public, criminal justice experts say.\n\n\"Sometimes, kind of like in politics when Republicans and Democrats seem to have very little in common, an artificial dichotomy is created between the police and the public which makes it appear that they are farther apart on these important social issues than they really are,\" says Robert Kane, a Drexel University criminologist and coauthor of \"Jammed Up: Bad Cops, Police Misconduct, and the New York City Police Department,\" in a phone interview with The Christian Science Monitor.\n\nPoints of agreement between police and their critics are often overshadowed by more divisive areas of disagreement, such as the motivations of the Black Lives Matter movement or whether police shootings of black Americans are isolated incidents or part of a larger pattern, Professor Kane and other experts say. But they can serve as a valuable entry point for necessary and oftentimes difficult conversations between the two camps.\n\n\"There are areas of very strong emotion where there has been tremendous discord and where there has been, in some cases, violence, so of course they're going to take center stage,\" Laurie Robinson, a George Mason University criminologist who served as co-chair of the White House Task Force on 21st Century Policing, tells the Monitor. \"But when you can establish a dialogue and people begin talking through some of the more pragmatic or practical issues, after tempers calm down a little, then there's an opportunity to see that there may be more common ground.\"\n\n\"This research,\" she adds, \"shows that there is definitely a path forward for greater cooperation and even reconciliation.\"\n\nDespite recent headlines highlighting resistance to body cameras in various police departments, the majority of officers (66 percent) support the use of body cameras to record interactions with citizens, Pew reports. Criminal justice reform activists say body cameras increase transparency and hold officers accountable for their actions. Police say the widespread use of cameras combats negative stereotypes of police, protects officers from being falsely accused of misconduct, and improves community relations.\n\n\"We are part of the community, they are part of us, and we have to show them that the bad things that come out on YouTube from cellphone video are outliers,\" said Tim Doubt, assistant police chief in Salt Lake City, Utah, to the Daily Signal. \"In this country we've lost trust in the last couple of years with the public, and that body camera helps tell more of the truth.\"\n\nIn a similar way, says Baltimore narcotics veteran Neil Franklin, many officers see relaxing marijuana laws as a step toward eliminating the \"hostile environment\" that strict drug laws create between police and communities of color. About two-thirds (68 percent) of police support relaxing marijuana laws, and 1-in-3 would like to legalize marijuana for both recreational and medical use, according to the Pew survey.\n\nLegalizing marijuana, Mr. Franklin told Rolling Stone, could lead to \"hundreds of thousands of fewer negative police and citizen contacts across this country.

But it's difficult...because it requires both 'sides' to listen to and acknowledge some pretty harsh criticisms,\" Seth Stoughton, a former police officer and current assistant professor of law at the University of South Carolina, tells the Monitor in an email. \"What is helpful is when both sides listen to each other and respect the other's critical perspective, even when they don't agree with it.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Ms. Taylor was shot to death by Louisville officers who had knocked down her door while executing a search warrant.\n\nLoading...\n\nAug. 04, 2022, 2:20 p.m. ET | Louisville, Ky.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department announced civil rights charges Thursday against four Louisville police officers over the drug raid that led to the death of Breonna Taylor, a Black woman whose fatal shooting contributed to the racial justice protests that rocked the United States in the spring and summer of 2020.\n\nThe charges are another effort to hold law enforcement accountable for the killing of the 26-year-old medical worker after one of the officers was acquitted of state charges earlier this year.\n\nFederal officials \"share but cannot fully imagine the grief\" felt by Ms. Taylor's family, U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland said in announcing the charges.\n\n\"Breonna Taylor should be alive today,\" he said. The charges range from unlawful conspiracies, use of force and obstruction of justice, Mr. Garland said.\n\nThe charges are against former officers Joshua Jaynes, Brett Hankison, and Kelly Goodlett, along with Sgt. Kyle Meany.\n\nLocal activists and members of the Taylor family celebrated the charges and thanked federal officials.\n\n\"This is a day when Black women saw equal justice in America,\" lawyer Benjamin Crump said.\n\nSome of Taylor's family and other supporters gathered in a park downtown Thursday and chanted \"Say her name, Breonna Taylor!\"\n\nTaylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, said she has waited 874 days for police to be held accountable.\n\n\"Today's overdue but it still hurts,\" she said Thursday. \"You all [are] learning today that we're not crazy.\"\n\nMs. Taylor was shot to death by Louisville officers who had knocked down her door while executing the search warrant. Ms. Taylor's boyfriend fired a shot that hit one of the officers as they came through the door and they returned fire, striking Ms. Taylor multiple times.\n\nIn the protests of 2020, Ms. Taylor's name was often shouted along with George Floyd, who was killed less than three months after Ms. Taylor by a Minneapolis police officer in a videotaped encounter that shocked the nation.\n\nMr. Garland said the officers at Ms. Taylor's home just after midnight on March 13, 2020, \"were not involved in the drafting of the warrant, and were unaware of the false and misleading statements.\" Mr. Hankison was the only officer charged Thursday who was on the scene that night.\n\nMr. Hankison was indicted on two deprivation of rights charges alleging he used excessive force when he retreated from Ms. Taylor's door, turned a corner and fired 10 shots into the side of her two-bedroom apartment. Bullets flew into a neighbor's apartment, nearly striking one man.\n\nHe was acquitted by a jury of state charges of wanton endangerment earlier this year in Louisville.\n\nA separate indictment said Mr. Jaynes and Mr. Meany both knew the warrant used to search Ms. Taylor's home had information that was \"false, misleading and out of date.\" Both are charged with conspiracy and deprivation of rights.\n\nMr. Jaynes had applied for the warrant to search Ms. Taylor's house. He was fired in January 2021 by former Louisville Police interim chief Yvette Gentry for violating department standards in the preparation of a search warrant execution and for being \"untruthful\" in the Taylor warrant.\n\nMr. Jaynes and Ms. Goodlett allegedly conspired to falsify an investigative document that was written after Ms. Taylor's death, Mr. Garland said. Federal investigators also allege Mr. Meany, who testified at Mr. Hankison's trial earlier this year, lied to the FBI during its investigation.\n\nFederal officials filed a separate charge against Ms. Goodlett, alleging she conspired with Mr. Jaynes to falsify Ms. Taylor's warrant affidavit.\n\nGarland alleged that Mr. Jaynes and Ms. Goodlett met in a garage in May 2020 \"where they agreed to tell investigators a false story.\"\n\nFormer Louisville Police Sgt. Johnathan Mattingly, who was shot at Ms. Taylor's door, retired last year. Another officer, Myles Cosgrove, who investigators said fired the shot that killed Ms. Taylor, was dismissed from the department in January 2021.\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The House Jan. 6 committee continues to investigate the insurrection.\n\nLoading...\n\nDec. 06, 2022, 10:56 a.m. ET | Washington\n\nTop House and Senate leaders will present law enforcement officers who defended the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, with Congressional Gold Medals on Tuesday, awarding them Congress' highest honor nearly two years after they fought with former President Donald Trump's supporters in the insurrection.\n\nTo recognize the hundreds of officers who were at the Capitol on Jan. 6, the medals will be placed in four locations - at U.S. Capitol Police headquarters, the Metropolitan Police Department, the Capitol, and the Smithsonian Institution. President Joe Biden said when he signed the legislation last year that a medal will be placed at the Smithsonian museum \"so all visitors can understand what happened that day.\"\n\nThe ceremony in the Capitol Rotunda comes as Democrats, just weeks away from losing their House majority, race to finish a nearly 18-month investigation of the insurrection. Democrats and two Republicans conducting the probe have vowed to uncover the details of the attack, which came as Mr. Trump tried to overturn his election defeat and encouraged his supporters to \"fight like hell\" in a rally just before the congressional certification.\n\nAwarding the medals will be among House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's last ceremonial acts as she prepares to step down from leadership. When the bill passed the House more than a year ago, she said the law enforcement officers from across the city defended the Capitol because they were \"the type of Americans who heard the call to serve and answered it, putting country above self.\"\n\n\"They enabled us to return to the Capitol,\" and certify Mr. Biden's presidency, she said then, \"to that podium that night to show the world that our democracy had prevailed and that it had succeeded because of them.\"\n\nDozens of the officers who fought off the rioters sustained serious injuries as the mob of Mr. Trump's supporters pushed past them and into the Capitol. Officers suffered physical wounds, and many struggled to work afterward because they were so traumatized.\n\nFour officers who testified at a House hearing last year spoke openly about the lasting mental and physical scars, and some detailed near-death experiences.\n\nAt least nine people who were at the Capitol that day died during and after the rioting. Several months after the attack, in August 2021, the Metropolitan Police announced that two more of their officers who had responded to the insurrection had died by suicide. The circumstances that led to their deaths were unknown.\n\nThe June 2021 House vote to award the medals won widespread support from both parties. But 21 House Republicans voted against it - lawmakers who had downplayed the violence and stayed loyal to Mr. Trump. The Senate passed the legislation by voice vote, with no Republican objections.\n\nMs. Pelosi, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, and Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell will attend the ceremony and award the medals. Capitol Police Chief Thomas Manger and Metropolitan Police Department Chief Robert Contee are also expected to attend.\n\nThe Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor Congress can bestow, has been handed out by the legislative branch since 1776. Previous recipients include George Washington, Sir Winston Churchill, Lady Bird Johnson, and Mother Teresa. In recent years, Congress has awarded the medals to cyclist Greg LeMond for sportsmanship and the 6888th Central Postal Directory Battalion, the only all-female Black unit that served in Europe in World War II.\n\nSigning the bill at the White House last year, Mr. Biden said the officers' heroism cannot be forgotten.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

As hundreds of officers consider retiring early or resigning, efforts are being made to boost morale and support.\n\nLoading...\n\nApril 05, 2021, 12:48 p.m. ET | Washington\n\nThe United States Capitol Police are struggling.\n\nOne officer was killed and another injured when a driver slammed into them at a barricade Friday afternoon. The attack comes after officers were overrun and injured when a violent mob of Trump supporters overran the Capitol on Jan. 6, breaking through insufficient barriers and pushing their way to within steps of lawmakers. One officer died and another killed himself.\n\nScores of officers are considering early retirement, top leaders have resigned, and those in office face increasing criticism. Security concerns over the events of the past four months may alter not only how the department operates, but also whether the historically public grounds can remain open.\n\nThe head of the Capitol Police union said officers are \"reeling\" following the death on Friday of Officer Billy Evans, who was on the force for 18 years. He was struck at a Capitol entrance by a man who, according to investigators, suffered from delusions and suicidal thoughts.\n\nMr. Evans' death comes after Officer Brian Sicknick, who was among hundreds of officers trying to fight off rioters without the necessary equipment or planning, died following the Jan. 6 riot. Officer Howard Liebengood died by suicide shortly afterward.\n\nHundreds of officers are considering retirement or finding jobs elsewhere, union chair Gus Papathanasiou said in a statement. \"They continue to work even as we rapidly approach a crisis in morale and force numbers,\" he said, noting that officers are dealing with \"massive amounts of forced overtime.\"\n\nDozens of officers were injured on Jan. 6 and others have been held out of work during an internal investigation into the department's response, including the officer who fatally shot a woman attempting to climb through a broken window as she and others massed at a barricaded doorway. That's further depleted a force that has more than 200 vacant positions, roughly 10% of its authorized force level.\n\nIn the months since the insurrection, many officers have routinely worked 12-hour days or longer to protect the building during President Joe Biden's Jan. 20 inauguration and impeachment proceedings against former President Donald Trump.\n\n\"This ... [attack] continues to provide a level of uncertainty and worry about the workplace and what's happening there,\" said Rep. Tim Ryan, an Ohio Democrat who chairs a subcommittee overseeing Capitol Police funding. \"And I think this is very personal for so many of us who have come to really love and respect the Capitol Police even more than we already had, because of what they did on Jan. 6, and then immediately turning it around to make sure that the inauguration was safe.\"\n\nActing Chief Yogananda Pittman received a vote of no confidence from the union in February, reflecting widespread distrust among the rank and file. Ms. Pittman was assistant chief in charge of intelligence during the riot and has admitted she did not see an FBI assessment the day before warning of \"war\" at the Capitol.\n\nSteven Sund, who resigned in January as the agency's chief amid scrutiny over whether the police force was adequately prepared for the riot, told The Associated Press that officers he had spoken to were \"on edge.\"\n\nThe grief and crises that have engulfed the Capitol Police are also part of broader social forces that have tested the country, Mr. Sund said.\n\n\"There's the impact of the pandemic on the American psyche,\" Mr. Sund said. \"There's a lot of stuff in social media and a lot of action in reference to the actions of law enforcement. Law enforcement have been attacked in cities around the country. So there's just a lot of things gearing up that make 2020, 2021 a little unique.\"\n\nThe Capitol Police are not a typical law enforcement agency. The roughly 2,000 officers are responsible solely for protecting Congress - its members, visitors, and facilities, an area of about 16 acres.\n\nThe department dates back to the early 1800s, after President John Quincy Adams asked that a police force be established to help protect the building following incidents there. Now they have an operating budget of $460 million.\n\nThe driver in Friday's incident, Noah Green, was shot by officers shortly after emerging from the vehicle wielding a knife, authorities said. Mr. Green died later at a hospital. There is no known connection between the insurrection and Mr. Green, who described himself in online posts as being under government thought control and being watched.\n\nNew concrete barriers are in place around the checkpoint where Mr. Evans and a colleague were standing guard north of the Capitol. But the attack underscores that the Capitol will always be a target, said retired Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who chaired a task force that made several security recommendations following the insurrection.\n\n\"It is the most important building in America, because it's the seat of our democracy,\" Lt. Honoré told ABC's \"This Week\" on Sunday. \"If that building and the people in it don't function, we no longer have democracy. And whatever price we have to pay to protect it, we need to do it.\"\n\nThe task force called for a renewed push to fill the 233 open positions on the force and for Congress to fund 350 new jobs and new fencing systems and other infrastructure. The task force also wants Congress to give the Capitol Police chief new authority to seek National Guard support in a crisis. Mr. Sund has alleged that leaders on the three-member Capitol Police Board delayed his calls for Guard help on Jan. 6, which former members of the board have denied.\n\nMr. Papathanasiou, the union chair, said he supported Lt. Honoré's recommendations and had met with him and his team Thursday, the day before Mr. Evans' death.\n\n\"As I explained to him, these improvements are critical, but our first priority has to be retaining our existing officers,\" Mr. Papathanasiou said. \"There are immediate steps Congress can take to address this.\"\n\nRep. Jennifer Wexton, a Virginia Democrat, has been in touch with Mr. Liebengood's family since his death. She called for a program to encourage \"peer-to-peer\" discussions between officers about the trauma they had incurred separate from mental health professionals called in to meet with officers.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

But prosecutors say all four should be tried together as they acted in concert.\n\nLoading...\n\nSept. 11, 2020, 5:29 p.m. ET | Minneapolis\n\nAttorneys for four former Minneapolis officers charged in the death of George Floyd say each client should get his own trial, as the officers try to diminish their roles in the Black man's death by pointing fingers at one another.\n\nProsecutors say all four officers should be tried together because the nature of the charges and evidence is similar, and \"it is impossible to evaluate any individual Defendant's conduct in a vacuum.\"\n\nThe former officers are due in court Friday for a hearing on several issues, including the prosecution's request to hold a joint trial. Other issues being argued include defense requests to move the trial out of Minneapolis, sequester the jury, and keep jurors anonymous.\n\nMr. Floyd, who was in handcuffs, died May 25, 2020, after Derek Chauvin pressed his knee against his neck as Mr. Floyd said he couldn't breathe. Mr. Chauvin is charged with second-degree murder, third-degree murder, and manslaughter. Thomas Lane, J. Kueng, and Tou Thao are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and manslaughter.\n\nDefense requests to dismiss charges won't be addressed Friday. A trial is scheduled for March.\n\nFriday's hearing also marks the first time Mr. Chauvin has appeared in a courtroom. He is in state custody and has attended previous hearings via videoconference.\n\nA few dozen protesters gathered in a street in front of the courthouse that had been blocked off, chanting \"No justice, no peace.\" One carried a Black Lives Matter flag and wore a black helmet with swim goggles around the back of his head. The windows on most nearby buildings were boarded up.\n\nProsecutors say the case should proceed with one trial because the evidence - including witness statements, body-camera video, and police department policy on use of force - is similar for each officer. Prosecutors say the officers also acted in close concert.\n\n\"Here, all four Defendants worked together to murder Floyd: Chauvin, Kueng, and Lane pinned Floyd face-down, while Thao stopped the crowd from intervening, enabling the other Defendants to maintain their positions. Defendants also discussed and coordinated their actions throughout the incident,\" prosecutors wrote in a court filing.\n\nProsecutors also say witnesses and Mr. Floyd's family members would likely be traumatized by multiple trials, and it would be more efficient and in the interest of justice to hold one proceeding.\n\nBut defense attorneys are pushing for separate trials, saying they are likely to offer \"antagonistic\" defenses, and evidence against one officer could negatively impact another's right to a fair trial.\n\nAttempts at finger-pointing are already prevalent throughout court filings in the case. Attorneys for Mr. Lane and Mr. Kueng have argued that their clients were rookies who were following Mr. Chauvin's lead. Mr. Thao's attorney, Bob Paule, has said his client's role was \"absolutely distinct\" from the others, because he was on crowd control and was securing the scene, while the other three restrained Mr. Floyd.\n\nMr. Chauvin's attorney, Eric Nelson, wrote that his client's case is different. Mr. Nelson said prosecutors must prove Mr. Chauvin intended to assault Mr. Floyd, but they must also show that the other officers knew of Mr. Chauvin's intent before it happened. As a result, he said, Mr. Chauvin will have to defend himself differently.\n\n\"The other defendants are clearly saying that, if a crime was committed, they neither knew about it nor assisted in it,\" Mr. Nelson wrote. \"They blame Chauvin.\"\n\nBut Mr. Chauvin also points fingers at the others. Mr. Nelson wrote that Mr. Lane and Mr. Kueng - the officers who responded to a forgery call - initiated contact with Mr. Floyd before Mr. Chauvin and Mr. Thao arrived, and that Mr. Chauvin believes Mr. Floyd was overdosing on fentanyl. Mr. Nelson wrote that while Mr. Lane and Mr. Kueng called for a paramedic and believed Mr. Floyd was \"on something,\" they didn't elevate the call to one of more urgency or give medical assistance.\n\n\"Instead, they struggled to subdue Mr. Floyd and force him into their squad car, likely exacerbating his condition considerably,\" Mr. Nelson wrote, adding that Mr. Chauvin could reasonably argue that their inaction led to Floyd's death.\n\n\"If EMS had arrived just three minutes sooner, Mr. Floyd may have survived. If Kueng and Lane had chosen to de-escalate instead of struggle, Mr. Floyd may have survived. If Kueng and Lane had recognized the apparent signs of an opioid overdose and rendered aid, such as administering naloxone, Mr. Floyd may have survived,\" Mr. Nelson wrote.\n\nAttorneys for all four men have also asked that the trial be moved from Minneapolis, saying pretrial publicity has made it impossible for them to receive a fair trial.\n\nMr. Paule, Mr. Thao's attorney, said in a court filing that the state has tainted the jury pool by calling Mr. Floyd's death a \"murder.\" Mr. Paule also cites protests that caused millions of dollars of damage in Minneapolis, saying an impartial jury can't be found in Hennepin County because jurors would \"shoulder the weight of their decision creating further rioting and destruction.\"\n\nThis story was reported by The Associated Press.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The murder didn't happen, but the officer wasn't charged.\n\nLoading...\n\nUpdated Aug. 05, 2015, 9:52 a.m. ET\n\nA police officer in Alabama proposed murdering a black resident and creating bogus evidence to suggest the killing was in self-defense, the Guardian reported, Tuesday.\n\nOfficer Troy Middlebrooks of the Alexander City Police Department kept his job after authorities there paid the resident, Vincent Bias, $35,000 to avoid being publicly sued over the incident, according to The Guardian.\n\nBias received his payment after a secret recording of Middlebrooks' remarks was played to the city's police chief and the mayor. The intended victim told The Guardian, \"This town is ridiculous. The police here feel they can do what they want, and often they do.\"\n\nBias's observations are reflected in national statistics.\n\nFive-Thirty-Eight found allegations of police misconduct rarely result in charges . They cited a report from the National Misconduct Reporting Project, in which researcher David Packman found of more than 8,300 misconduct accusations (involving almost 11,000 officers) in his database from April 2009 through the end of 2010, 3,238 resulted in legal action.\n\nExcessive force was the most common type of accusation; 15 percent involved firearms.\n\nSo what affects whether police get away with crime?\n\nTodd H. Oppenheim, who has been a public defender for 10 years in Baltimore, said the legal process - from judges to internal reviews - is too lenient on cops in an op-ed on Baltimore Brew.\n\nMr. Oppenheim said he has handled thousands of criminal cases but can count on one hand the number of times a judge reprimanded an officer for illegal actions:\n\n\"Even when a judge grants a motion and finds police behavior illegal, nothing happens to the officers. Their pay isn't docked. They don't have to answer to a supervisor. Internal police reviews are a joke, and civilian review boards lack the teeth to impact anything.\"\n\nThe American Civil Rights Union is unsettled by the lack of metrics to evaluate police misconduct.\n\nJamil Dakwar, Director of the ACLU's human rights program, said the lack of transparent data on how many officers are convicted or dismissed when faced with charges stunts reform and grants police impunity.\n\nHow can states look into allegations of misconduct with care?\n\nSome say they should look to Newark's new cop watch board.\n\nThe ACLU praised the initiative, which created \"a strong and independent civilian complaint review board to review allegations of police misconduct,\" and was signed into law by Newark Mayor Ras Baraka in May.\n\n\"Not only will it have the power to subpoena records and police officer testimony, it will have the rare power to make its disciplinary decisions stick. In order to reject the review board's findings, the police director must determine that the board committed 'clear error,' a high standard to meet. The board will also audit department policies and procedures, and it will issue public reports of data on interactions with the public.\"\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Chris Christie also recently took steps to strengthen the legitimacy of police misconduct investigations.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that \"New Jersey county prosecutors now must disclose the findings of any use-of-force investigation even if the case isn't presented to a grand jury for consideration.\"\n\nActing Attorney General John J. Hoffman released the rules as part of an announcement that the state will spend $4 million to equip state troopers and local police officers with body cameras to capture policing encounters, according to The Journal.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The $35,000 paid to Bias in the Alabama case alludes to a much bigger cost.\n\nA recent Wall Street Journal article found the 10 cities with the largest police departments paid out $248.7 million last year in settlements and court judgments in police-misconduct cases, up 48 percent from $168.3 million in 2010.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Five-year-old Chloe wanted to pray with them.\n\nHer dad snapped a photo and shared it with the Cedar Hill Police Department .\n\n\"Marshals Herron and Wallace admit they've never had anyone pray with them and that her prayer was so beautiful,\" the department wrote on the Facebook page Tuesday.\n\nThe photo has been shared almost 5,000 times on Facebook and captures black churches' complex response to the discussion over police relations with minority communities.\n\nSome pastors see the Black Lives Matter protests over police force as the sequel to the Civil Rights movement of the 1960s. The Rev. Jamal Bryant of Baltimore led protests after the death of Freddie Gray in police custody, The Baltimore Sun reported. He became a well-known supporter of Trayvon Martin in 2012, and he spent several weeks protesting in Ferguson, Mo., after the police-involved death of Michael Brown.\n\nEddie Glaude Jr., a religion professor and Princeton University's chair of the Center for African American studies, also sees black churches as a resource for organizing against police brutality during what he told NPR is \"open season\" for young black men.\n\n\"Churches and ministers ought to find a way to comfort the spirit, not to get us adjusted to the injustice, but to understand that we are justified in our rage and anger,\" Dr. Glaude told NPR in late 2014. \"Black churches have always been and continue to be wonderful resource institutions where we can build capacity in order to speak back and respond to crises.\"\n\nOther black church leaders are working within the system to increase trust. For the Rev. David Isom of Fairfield, Calif., this meant staying out of a proposed walk-out by black communities for Martin Luther King Jr. Day in 2015. He instead organized a unity walk alongside members of a mostly white church that ended at the city's Police Activities League, the Religion News Service reported. He has joined a partnership with other ministers and a local police chief to mentor local youth and assist them with scholarships.\n\n\"I am concerned about what has happened to African-American lives - period,\" he told Religion News Service. \"But I don't think that all police are bad, and I don't think that all kids are angels.\"\n\nRev. Uriel Castrillon, a pastor in Baltimore who also volunteers as a police chaplain has met with a police group that organizes dialogues and prayer meetings between faith leaders and police. He participated in demonstrations in Baltimore after the death of Freddie Gray, but when he heard out-of-town protesters inciting violence, he took them aside.\n\n\"We engage in civil dialogue, not attacks on the Police Department,\" he told the Baltimore Sun. \"Otherwise you're compromising the Gospel.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

More healthcare and policing. (Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images)\n\nTEACHERS: Researchers from Kansas State University estimated that there are currently 55,289.2 teacher vacancies across the U.S., with the South being the most impacted, with an estimated 19,869 vacancies, according to teacher vacancy data from 30 states for the 2022-23 academic year, nine states and Washington, D.C., for the 2021-2022 school year and three states for years prior to 2021 Last October, in a report examining the Covid-19 pandemic's impact on aspects of education, including staffing, the National Center for Education Statistics reported that 18% of public schools had at least one teacher vacancy, and 57% of the public schools located in highly impoverished neighborhoods had at least one teacher vacancy. Among the top reasons teachers cited for wanting to leave their job were stress, disappointment, salary and excessive working hours, a survey of teachers published earlier this year by research organization RANDO found.\n\nHEALTHCARE WORKERS: In the healthcare industry, there is a shortage of 17,000 primary care practitioners, 12,000 dental practitioners and 8,000 mental health practitioners across the country, according to the Department of Health Resources and Services Administration. In the next 10 years, the American Hospital Association predicts America will be short 124,000 physicians. The National Governors Association attributed the exacerbation of the shortage of healthcare workers to the pandemic, burnout and stress.\n\nPOLICE: A survey of 182 police agencies in 38 states and Washington, D.C. from the Police Executive Research Forum noted that, although hiring is improving, the 50% increase in police resignation last year compared to 2019 and the total sworn staffing decreasing by 5% over the past three years is outpacing the hiring. In addition to pay, some cite public scrutiny following the protests of 2020 that prompted current and potential cops to rethink the role.\n\nA small Minnesota town's entire police department dissolved Wednesday after the chief and other police officers resigned earlier this month, with the chief citing poor officer retention due to non-competitive pay--following a long trend of cops and other public sector employees quitting their jobs.\n\nThe public sector includes jobs in government, protective services (such as policing and firefighting), education (such as teaching or being a custodian for a public school), community service (such as social workers) and health care workers. There were 9.6 million job openings on the last day of June, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said , 136,000 of which were in healthcare and social assistance and 62,000 of which were in state and local government. LinkedIn data shows several public sector workers leaving those positions for jobs in technology, information, media, financial services, manufacturing and professional services during the first five months of last year. Many noted better pay and opportunities for growth as their motivation to leave the public sector for the private sector. The Center for Economic and Policy Research attributes the slow post-pandemic recovery of public sector jobs to budget cuts and privatization of public services that occurred amidst the Great Recession of 2008 . \"The negative consequences of both cuts and privatization in the aftermath of the Great Recession meant that the public sector - and, thus, the public - were in a far less resilient place than they could have been when the COVID-19 crisis began. A robust and fully recovered public sector would have put states, territories, and localities in a much better position to weather the storm,\" the report, authored and released last month, said.\n\nEntire Small Town Minnesota Police Department Quits-Leaving Streets Unpatrolled For Most Of Day (Forbes)"

      "text": "Corporate Officers Face Expanded Oversight: What To Know\n\nBy Priya Cherian Huskins\n\nBy Priya Cherian Huskins ,\n\nContributor.\n\nCorporate Officers Face Expanded Oversight\n\nEveryone knows that directors of companies-both public and private-can be personally liable for certain breaches of fiduciary duties.\n\nIn a concerning turn of events, it's now clear that the same is true for corporate officers for risks within their scope of responsibility-an especially difficult charge for CEOs, CFOs and general counsel, given the enterprise-wide nature of their jobs.\n\nProving in a Delaware court of law that directors and officers utterly failed to oversee compliance at their company is difficult. But that doesn't mean that shareholders won't sue them for allegedly failing to do so.\n\nIn this article, I'll discuss a brief background on the duty of oversight and Caremark litigation. I'll then discuss how a recent case involving McDonald's has expanded the scope of liability for oversight beyond directors to include corporate officers.\n\nIn the 1990s, a pivotal moment in corporate governance occurred with the landmark case involving healthcare provider Caremark International Inc. ( Stone v. Ritter ).\n\nCaremark established clear expectations for corporate directors and their oversight duties to manage mission-critical risks of the company.\n\nUnder the legal standards set by Caremark , directors must make a good-faith effort to effectively oversee a company's operations.\n\nCaremark claims, however, have been historically hard to prove. To win a motion to dismiss, Caremark claims must show that directors didn't just drop the ball but utterly failed to put any systems in place to oversee risk.\n\nFor years, this standard meant that shareholders bringing these claims were unsuccessful. That changed in 2019 with Marchand v. Barnhill in 2019 , which involved a listeria outbreak in Blue Bell Creameries ice cream.\n\nThat case was encouraging for plaintiffs because it provided a roadmap for risk oversight claims.\n\nThe court focused on the fact that the company did one thing: produce ice cream-and as such, food safety was the most critical risk Blue Bell Creameries faced.\n\nBut the record showed no evidence of the board's implementing a system reasonably likely to bring food safety issues to its attention, much less any evidence of the board addressing food safety risks in a proactive way.\n\nBecause of this, the defendant directors did not win their motion to dismiss the case, and the case settled for millions , as discussed in this article in Bloomberg Law.\n\nAfter the Blue Bell Creameries case, plaintiffs have become increasingly aggressive about bringing Caremark claims, and some of these have also survived defendants' motions to dismiss, garnering millions in settlement payments.\n\n(As a reminder, corporations incorporated under Delaware law and the laws of many other states as well are not permitted to pay the settlements in these types of claims, hence the critical need for D&O insurance. More on that later.)\n\nPlaintiffs have not been content to limit themselves to directors in Caremark claims, however.\n\nIn McDonald's Corp. Stockholder Derivative Litigation , a pivotal 2023 Delaware case, the court broadened the scope of liability by holding that executives, not just board directors, can be liable for failing to oversee risks related to their areas of direct control.\n\nWhile the situational application of oversight duties might differ between officers and directors, the fundamental responsibilities remain.\n\nMcDonald's former head of HR, David Fairhurst, was accused of fostering a culture of sexual harassment at McDonald's and personally engaging in misconduct.\n\nFairhurst lost his initial motion to dismiss because the court was focused on what plaintiffs asserted were \"red flag\" claims.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that Fairhurst was aware of sexual misconduct issues but failed to act, embodying a pattern of neglect that could be construed as bad faith-a crucial element for establishing a claim under Caremark principles. Fairhurst's own involvement in sexual misconduct was certainly a bad fact as well.\n\nThe court emphasized that corporate officers, like directors, have a duty of oversight when addressing compliance risks within their domains. Because his role specifically involved handling human resources functions-including sexual harassment prevention-Fairhurst had a duty of oversight for this type of risk.\n\nThis case was ultimately dismissed for a technical procedural reason as explained in an article by Duane Morris. That does not, however, mitigate the importance of this case for corporate officers.\n\nThe McDonald's case notably broadens the potential liability corporate officers face. It emphasizes the critical role that officers play in implementing and responding to risk oversight systems.\n\nCorporate officers can reduce their liability by:\n\n● Engaging in effective risk oversight. You want a clear record that shows you have implemented systems reasonably designed to bring issues to your attention and that you have responded to address issues once raised.\n\n● Securing a personal indemnification agreement. A personal indemnification agreement is a contract between individual officers and the companies they serve. These agreements promise to advance legal fees and, where allowed by law, pay losses on your behalf if you are named in a lawsuit in your capacity as an officer of the company.\n\n● Ensuring sufficient D&O insurance coverage. State corporate law may prevent corporations from settling McDonald's-type oversight claims. This is where D&O insurance really matters. You will want to make sure your company purchases adequate Side A insurance. Side A is the part of a D&O insurance policy that can pay settlements in McDonald's type cases.\n\nThe McDonald's case serves as a critical reminder of the evolving landscape of corporate governance and the importance of proactive risk management and legal preparedness by corporate officers."

More student safety (Photo by Irfan Khan / Los Angeles Times via Getty Images)\n\nStationing police officers in schools ends up criminalizing students instead of keeping them safe, according to a new study .\n\nResearchers found no evidence that the presence of police officers in schools reduced crime or promoted safety.\n\nBut schools with police officers attached did see higher levels of suspensions and expulsions, with students more likely to become criminalized as a result.\n\nBasing police officers in schools - or school-based law enforcement (SBLE) - has become a widely-used approach to try to counter crime and disorder, either committed by students or directed against them.\n\nAlthough accurate figures are hard to come by, around two in five public schools in the U.S. had at least one police officer on campus for at least one day a week.\n\nBut the policy has been controversial, with numerous reports of officers using a heavy-handed approach and arresting students for minor incidents.\n\nConcerns over the negligible impact on crime rates and the disproportionally negative effect on marginalized groups such as Black, disabled and LGBTQ students, a number of cities have started removing SBLEs, including Minneapolis, Denver and Seattle, a movement that gained momentum following the death of George Floyd in 2020.\n\nNow new research has found that not only do police officers in schools not make schools safer, but they have detrimental consequences for students, who are more likely to end up in the criminal justice system as a result.\n\nThere was \"no evidence that our collective investment in putting police in schools has led to safer schools, but instead is associated with harmful practices of excluding students from school,\" according to Benjamin Fisher, of the University of Wisconsin-Madison and lead author of the report.\n\nAfter analyzing 32 studies from around the world, researchers found that schools with police on campus had higher rates of crime and behavior problems than those without, according to the study published in the journal Campbell Systematic Reviews.\n\nRather than this being due to police being more likely to be stationed in schools with high crime levels, researchers found this was primarily the result of higher levels of suspension and expulsion.\n\nSchools with police on campus also had a higher rate of discipline - and inflicted more punishment on students - than schools without a police presence, the study found.\n\nThe use of exclusionary discipline puts students on a pathway towards future punishment and behavior problems, including contact with the criminal justice system, researchers noted.\n\nResearchers were unable to detect any noticeable improvements to crime or violence as a result of police being stationed on campus.\n\nAmong the possible explanations for the link between police on campus and higher rates of discipline put forward by researchers are that school-based officers increase detection rates of relatively minor misbehaviors or are involved in administering sanctions.\n\nSchool-based police may also contribute to making the school's approach to discipline more punitive, resulting in more formal sanctions, or may actually encourage students to engage in more problem behaviors, if they are seen as normal.\n\nResearchers also looked at studies which examined possible links between police stationed on campus and other factors, such as learning outcomes, and found no evidence of any impact.\n\nThey did detect one positive effect of campus police, however: students were more likely to feel safer at school if there were officers stationed on site, although this had no connection to crime rates.\n\n\"If the intent of SBLE is to prevent crime and delinquency in schools, this study found no evidence that this intent is being accomplished,\" researchers said.\n\nThe result is that schools interested in promoting safety are likely to benefit from withdrawing from campus-based police programs and instead invest in evidence-based strategies, they added."

      "text": "Five Ex-Memphis Police Officers Indicted On Federal Charges For Alleged Roles In Tyre Nichols Death\n\nFive former Memphis police officers were indicted on four federal counts by a federal grand jury on Tuesday for their involvement in Tyre Nichols' death in January-months after facing charges in state court for allegedly beating 29-year-old Nichols to death during a traffic stop.\n\nA screen at the entrance of Mississippi Boulevard Christian Church displays the \"Celebration of ... More life\" in memory of Tyre Nichols on February 1, 2023, in Memphis, Tennessee. On Tuesday, five former Memphis police officers were indicted by a federal grand jury on Tuesday for their involvement in Nichols' death in January, according to multiple reports.\n\nFormer officers Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin III, Desmond Mills Jr. and Justin Smith are facing a number of charges, including excessive force, failure to intervene, deliberate indifference and attempting to cover up their misconduct by withholding details and providing false information.\n\nTwo of the counts carry a maximum penalty of life in prison, and two carry a maximum penalty of 20 years each.\n\nThe five men also face criminal court charges in Shelby County for second-degree murder, aggravated assault and more.\n\nThey have all pleaded not guilty to the state charges.\n\nIn January, Nichols was driving home after watching the sunset, when he was pulled over for alleged \"reckless driving\" by a group of officers from the SCORPION Unit -which stood for Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods-who then attacked and brutally beat him; he died three days later from excessive blood loss.\n\nThe indictment comes months after the Department of Justice announced an investigation into the Memphis Police Department with a focus on the use of excessive force, \"racially discriminatory stops\" and other policing practices against the city's Black residents.\n\n\"We stand ready to hold law enforcement officers accountable for their misconduct because no one is above the law in our country,\" said Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke of the DOJ's civil rights division in a release .\n\nVideo footage from police body cameras and surveillance cameras that was released three weeks after Nichols' death showed police officers violently kicking and punching him as he lay on the ground, and hitting him with pepper spray as he pleaded with officers. Following the release of the footage, FBI Director Christopher Wray said he was \"appalled\" and Memphis Police Chief Cerelyn Davis said the violence in it was \"about the same, if not worse\" than the 1991 beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police. Shortly after Nichols' death, the Scorpion Unit, which was a 50-person, seven-day-a-week team dedicated to fighting violent crime, focusing on weapons, auto thefts, gangs and \"crime suppression officers\" in \"hot spot areas\" was disbanded by the Memphis PD. The five former Memphis officers indicted Tuesday-all of whom were Black-were fired later in January and were eventually found by the Shelby County District Attorney's Office to be \"directly responsible\" for Nichols' death. Attorneys representing Nichols' family filed a lawsuit against the city of Memphis in April, alleging Nichols died \"at the hands of a modern-day lynch mob\"; they are reportedly seeking $550 million in damages."

This activity presents a risk for introduction of contraband goods into the prison. While the number of people tasked with supervising prison inmates is high, so is the temptation to cross the line. The prices that inmates are willing to pay has gone through the roof.\n\nAccording to a press release from the Department of Justice, Cheyenne Harris was a corrections offer at the Leavenworth Federal Detention Center in Leavenworth, KS, a maximum security federal prison run by private prison company CoreCivic. Harris was charged with selling packs of cigarettes to an inmate for $100/pack ... the inmate turned around and resold them to other inmates for $350/pack! When the FBI was tipped that contraband was moving into the prison, they confronted Harris earlier this year about whether or not she was receiving money through Cash App. Harris denied having Cash App even though it was her primary means of getting money for the contraband. One would have thought a visit by the FBI would have been enough to stop moving goods, but the indictment alleges that Harris approached two more inmates after the FBI encounter seeking to bring even more cigarettes into the institution.\n\nCigarettes are still a form of currency in prison ... but their value has gone through the roof.\n\nContraband in prisons is not new and the premium for these goods is at a premium. Cigarettes are expensive but drugs like marijuana and heroin are astronomical. The most expensive item on inmates' contraband lists are cell phones. A prison guard was recently charged with selling more than 25 cell phones to inmates on San Quentin's Death Row, basic phones, for $500 each ... they resold between inmates for $900 each.\n\nCell phones are all over federal facilities. In 2010, Congress passed the Cell Phone Contraband Act to crack down on cell phone use in prison and give additional punishment as a result. Congressman Bobby Scott (Virginia) acknowledged the problem then by saying of the law \" will address an ongoing problem of cell phones being smuggled into prisons by visitors and prison guards. Prison inmate cell phone accessibility has resulted in offenders facilitating and committing crimes with the use of the cell phones. Gangs have also become far more organized because members in prison have cell phone access. \" An inmate in USP Atlanta live-streamed on Facebook from his cell ... so no shortage of those willing to take a risk.\n\nA cell phone on the prison black market can cost up to $5,000 each when it is a top-end smart phone like the Apple iPhone. For those responsible for sending these goods into prison it could mean thousands of dollars each month of extra cash but it could also be years in prison if caught .\n\nThe problem with contraband goes back to urban legends of inmates receiving baked goods with saw blades inside. In 2016, the Office of Inspector General wrote a blistering report on the Federal Bureau of Prisons' record on controlling contraband. According to BOP data, cell phones were the most common type of contraband recovered between 2012 through 2014 ... the BOP reported that over 8,700 cell phones were recovered during this period, 2,012 more than the next most common contraband type, weapons. One recommendation from the OIG was for the BOP to step up their screening of staff.\n\nState prisons are also a problem. In 2017, South Carolina prison officers reported finding and taking one phone for every three inmates, the highest rate in the country. One excellent article I found in Slate said that the temptation is so high for inmates and staff to use cell phones that the institutions should just look at allowing inmates to carry them.\n\nContraband is here to stay and the price of goods will continue to rise along with the risk."

      "text": "The Ascent Of Chief Product Officers: Transforming Business In An Era Of Innovation\n\nBy Benjamin Laker\n\nBy Benjamin Laker ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nIn a rapidly changing economic landscape marked by the acceleration of digital transformation-think big data, automation and artificial intelligence-and the need for innovative, customer-centric products and services, a new role is emerging in the C-suite: the Chief Product Officer (CPO).\n\nChief Product Officers are tasked with staying up to date on emerging technologies, trends, and ... More market conditions\n\nFrom startups to established enterprises, the rise of the CPO signifies a shift in focus towards a customer-centric approach. In fact, the CPO is a company's champion of innovation, customer excellence, and experience. This is why, the role is a lynchpin for organizations seeking to stay ahead of the curve: one-third of Fortune 100 companies now have their own, according to research , which is an enormous increase from just three years ago.\n\nThe CPO is responsible for guiding product strategy and accelerating innovation across a company's entire portfolio of products and services-from ideation to execution. Consequently, the multifaceted mandate is critical in enhancing a company's intellectual property (IP) value: developing, protecting and monetizing assets by effectuating cutting-edge products and solutions that can be patented, trademarked, or copyrighted. Furthermore, the CPO is responsible for keeping abreast of changes within relevant legal frameworks-such as patent legislation and copyright laws, regulations, and rulings-and for managing intellectual property transactions with other companies to maximize their impact on the market and bottom line.\n\nThis is where PLG comes in.\n\nProduct-Led Growth (PLG) is a dynamic, customer-centric approach to growth and revenue generation that puts customer experience first. By focusing on user experience, PLG puts products and services at the core of a business's growth strategy.\n\nVijay Pereira, professor of strategic and international human capital management at France's NEOMA Business School, said in an interview, \"From a strategic and human capital perspective, the position of a CPO is more important than ever in today's business environment. CPOs are now being asked to take on an increasingly larger role within an organization-from strategy and planning to talent acquisition and development, to performance management and organizational design.\" He added, \"This increased role for CPOs is a direct result of the globalization of business and the changing dynamics of relationships between employers, employees and stakeholders.\"\n\nPereira's view infers that product-led growth strategies will become increasingly important as companies seek to remain competitive in the ever-changing digital world. Indeed, the presence of a CPO also allows for quick pivots when needed and can help organizations stay agile in the face of change.\n\nHelmi Norman, an associate professor of digital and futuristic education at the National University of Malaysia, agrees. \"The product-led growth strategy requires the organization to be customer-centric, which is why appointing a CPO is essential,\" he said in an interview. \"A CPO will ensure that the company's products and services are aligned with customer needs and market trends-think Rendanheyi -so that they can achieve sustainable, profitable growth.\"\n\nEvidently, the CPO is now a critical piece of the puzzle when it comes to driving a company's success. They are uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between product innovation, customer experience and financial performance-allowing companies to deliver value faster and more efficiently. But what sets them apart from other C-suite roles, and how does this role interact with other top executives, such as the Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Chief Operating Officer (COO)?\n\nThe CPO is a strategic thought leader responsible for creating and executing a product vision that is aligned with the company's overall business strategy. As a result, they are not just focused on developing new products; they also need to consider ways to extend existing products, repurpose them or sunset them to optimize financial results.\n\nTo do this, CPOs must have a deep understanding of the customer's needs and wants, as well as an intimate knowledge of the competitive landscape; the ability to connect the dots between different parts of the business; and a knack for leading and motivating diverse internal and external teams. Often, their book of contacts and partnerships can be just as important as the products they create.\n\nWhile other C-suite executives, such as a Chief Learning Officer (CLO) or Chief Engagement Officer (CEnO) may be involved in customer-facing initiatives-albeit with limited strategic depth and reach-the CPO is the one who has their finger on the pulse of customers and can quickly identify changes in market trends or customer needs and adjust the product or service accordingly. In other words, they need to be in charge of driving customer-centric innovation.\n\nAfter all, they are uniquely positioned to develop a unified customer-centric strategy because of their expertise in creating and managing a portfolio of products that are both differentiated from the competition and relevant to customers' needs; all while balancing the demands of cost and scalability.\n\nThe relationship between the CPO and the CEO is critical to a company's success. Together, they can define the company's vision and translate it into actionable product strategies. The CPO, therefore, should act as a trusted advisor to the CEO, providing valuable insights on market trends and customer needs, while the CEO should empower the CPO to make strategic decisions that drive growth and innovation. In many cases, the CPO and CEO will have a shared vision for the company's future, with the CPO responsible for turning this vision into a reality. This partnership is crucial to fostering a culture of innovation and ensuring that any company remains agile in the face of new challenges and opportunities.\n\nThe CPO should also work closely with the COO to ensure efficient operations and high-quality execution of product initiatives. As the CPO focuses on product vision and strategy, the COO oversees the operational aspects of the business, ensuring that resources are allocated effectively, and processes are streamlined to support the company's growth. By collaborating closely, the CPO and COO can align product development with operational excellence, creating a powerful synergy that drives both innovation and performance. This includes coordinating on product launches, supply (and value) chain management, and customer support infrastructure, including the delivery function.\n\nIn summary, by fostering a culture of curiosity and creativity, the CPO can empower employees to think differently, take risks, and contribute to the company's success in new and meaningful ways. As organizations navigate the challenges and opportunities of the digital age, the CPO's unique blend of strategic, creative, and operational expertise will be essential to maintaining a competitive edge.\n\nBy working closely with other C-suite executives, the CPO can help shape company vision, foster a culture of learning, and amplify customer engagement-ensuring that businesses are well-equipped to thrive in an era of rapid change and disruption.\n\nSo, if you're considering hiring a CPO, think about how their skills and insight could be used to your organization's benefit-and start exploring the possibilities. It just may be the best decision you make this year."

      "text": "12 Ways CEOs And Companies Fail Chief Diversity Officers\n\nBy Shaun Harper\n\nBy Shaun Harper , Former Contributor. Forbes contributors publish independent expert analyses and insights. I am a diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) expert\n\nBy Shaun Harper ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nBlack businesswoman in corporate office\n\nChief diversity officers (CDOs) are set up to fail in many companies. These talented DEI professionals often experience tremendous disappointment and depart with really negative feelings. An alarming number of corporate CDOs stay less than two years. Given how essential DEI is to the success of today's businesses, CEOs really need CDOs to stay and succeed.\n\nI've worked extensively with CDOs over the past two decades; many have expressed their frustrations to me. I've also been able to make my own determinations about why they weren't achieving the DEI results their organizations were pursuing. Additionally, over the past 18 months, I've learned a lot in forums with corporate CDOs spanning just about every industry-including panels and conversations about their leadership challenges. These leaders worked in public and private sectors, and in organizations of all sizes that are mostly headquartered in the U.S. I also interviewed more than two dozen CDOs specifically for this article. Here are 12 ways CDOs consistently say CEOs and companies fail them:\n\nCDOs rarely have seats at the table with other C-Suite executives. On many dimensions, one of these VPs isn't like the others. They don't have the same decision-making authority. Compared to other VPs, CDOs say their budgets and staffs are much smaller. Also, their compensation packages are reportedly much lower than counterparts within the company who have similar titles. Everyday reminders of these inequities are paradoxical and understandably frustrating to the person whose job it is to be the company's top equity officer.\n\nIn recruitment conversations, CEOs often tell prospective CDOs how much they personally value DEI, yet they don't get to spend much time with CDOs after they accept the positions. The CDO doesn't have the same access to the CEO as do other VPs. One told me he'd talked with the CEO a total of 30 minutes over a two-year period; 20 of those were during their one-on-one when he was interviewing for the job.\n\nDespite the position supposedly being responsible for the integration of DEI into every aspect of the business, the CDO's boss in many places is the chief human resources officer (CHRO). It's worse in some instances: despite having chief and VP titles themselves, CDOs report to someone who reports to the CHRO. This makes them two layers removed from the CEO. Some were told they'd be reporting dually to the CEO and HR Chief - they say it's a terrible arrangement because substantive engagement with the CEO is relatively lower, oftentimes nonexistent.\n\nIn too many businesses, CEOs jumped on the 'everybody else is doing it bandwagon' and created CDO positions without being entirely clear about what the role was really supposed to be and do. In the weeks after George Floyd's murder, lots of businesses abruptly created CDO positions. Many DEI professionals who took those jobs less than three years ago have already left. To be sure, executives were hastily creating these positions long before summer 2020, sometimes under intense pressure from their diverse employees to do something in response to specific internal DEI crises.\n\nLike financial operations, communications, human resources, marketing, and legal affairs, DEI should be a cross-business function. In many places it's isolated to one area of the company: HR. Some DEI professionals ascend to the CDO job through diversity recruiting roles, but this isn't the case for all. Regardless of their paths to the CDO position, many understand the job they accepted to be multidimensional, all encompassing. They recognize that their company's DEI needs, challenges, vulnerabilities, and possibilities, include, but expand far beyond HR-related responsibilities. \"They pay people to do HR; I should be partnering with them, not doing the HR team's diversity work entirely for them,\" a former tech industry CDO told me.\n\nWeirdly, when there's a crisis that involves racial or gender discrimination, the CDO is too often left out of the conversation. Instead, legal and communications teams work on making the crisis go away as quickly, quietly, and inexpensively as possible. They too often mishandle these situations in ways that disappoint women and employees of color within the company, as well as invite criticism from diverse customers and others on social media. CDOs say certain missteps could've been avoided had their cultural intelligence and expertise on diverse communities been invited to the crisis response table. It isn't just about being invited - they also want their expertise to be as valued as the expertise colleagues from legal and communications bring.\n\nThe CDO tells the CEO the company has a serious racial problem. It's based on what they've experienced firsthand or observed, or it's credibly informed by what employees of color have reported to them. The CEO ignores this; tells the CDO all the reasons why they're wrong; lists a few things the company has recently done for people of color (thereby making it incapable of racism); seeks out a handful of other execs (sometimes, but not always people of color) who say there isn't a problem; and then ultimately rejects the CDO's advice on what the company should do. Versions of this occur far too often, mostly to CDOs of color and most especially to women of color.\n\nIt's painfully apparent to many CDOs that the work they lead isn't nearly as connected as it should be to other parts of the business. With the exception of demographic representation numbers, the CEO and executive leadership team usually don't have the same expectations for KPIs; the same shared, enterprise-wide accountability standards; and the same strategic concern for DEI as they do other things. Most CDOs strongly believe that good business strategy has DEI deeply, measurably, and sustainably imbedded into its every dimension.\n\nMany CDOs pursued and accepted their jobs because they care deeply about DEI. They want to help companies enact their espoused values and improve on longstanding failures. The work feels urgent to them, but oftentimes not to other executives at their level and above. CDOs report that something else is almost always seemingly more urgent than DEI, despite the looming threat of one massive discrimination or harassment lawsuit potentially costing the company millions of dollars and tarnishing its brand.\n\nWhen the company fails to address workplace homophobia, a gay or lesbian CDO can lose credibility with queer colleagues. Similarly, when businesses are in the news for racial discrimination, CDOs of color could be viewed as incompetent, which might disqualify them from future leadership roles elsewhere. \"To be fair, this is the occupational hazard that any executive takes on when they accept a position on the executive leadership team,\" a CDO in the financial sector told me. \"The problem is that we aren't really executives, we aren't on those leadership teams where people get paid enough money to assume this level of what can easily become long-term damage to our professional reputations.\"\n\nAs previously noted, too many talented professionals transition in and out of CDO roles within two years. Many say the executives to whom they were reporting did very little (in some instances, nothing) to retain them. Usually, no offer is made to fix the cultural, structural, and systemic issues that compel frustrated CDOs to leave. Some executives convince themselves that the CDO is simply moving on to an opportunity that's a better fit. \"They wouldn't let a great CFO leave after 18 months without trying to negotiate a different set of arrangements that satisfy that person's expectations,\" one healthcare CDO said in an interview. \"But there's no negotiating with us; they're unwilling to bend on fixing a structure that we keep telling them is fucked up.\"\n\nA CDO leaves and execs swiftly hire someone else without doing an autopsy of what went wrong. They don't make significant structural revisions to the role. The new CDO is therefore set up to fail.\n\nA company's DEI effectiveness depends greatly on its CDO being positioned for success. Having a seat at the table alongside other C-Suite executives is essential. Making them report to someone other than the CEO strongly and offensively conveys to these DEI leaders that they aren't real executives. Also, CEOs have to pay CDOs like they pay other executives (the same level salaries, bonuses, stock options, and all); empower them with the same level of authority and autonomy; and give them budgets and staffing structures that are appropriate for an enterprise-wide function.\n\nMoreover, CDOs have to be treated like the experts they are. CEOs ought to rely on them heavily for advice, avoid attempting to resolve DEI crises without their significant input, and believe them when they say the company has a serious DEI problem that places it at reputational and financial risk. What the CDO does has to be treated as consequentially as what the chief technology officer does (like if the business was expected to function without email for a month, for example). Situating the CDO's work entirely or even primarily in HR denies a company the infrastructure that's required to fully execute a comprehensive, integrated DEI business strategy.\n\nCDOs need CEOs and other C-Suite peers to partner with them on creating and sustaining cultures, structures, and systems that hold every employee (including themselves) accountable for actualizing the company's DEI commitments. Lastly, CEOs really must stop letting extremely talented CDOs walk out the door without investing considerably more effort into retaining them."

      "text": "12 Ways CEOs And Companies Fail Chief Diversity Officers\n\nBy Shaun Harper\n\nBy Shaun Harper ,\n\nFormer Contributor.\n\nBlack businesswoman in corporate office\n\nChief diversity officers (CDOs) are set up to fail in many companies. These talented DEI professionals often experience tremendous disappointment and depart with really negative feelings. An alarming number of corporate CDOs stay less than two years. Given how essential DEI is to the success of today's businesses, CEOs really need CDOs to stay and succeed.\n\nI've worked extensively with CDOs over the past two decades; many have expressed their frustrations to me. I've also been able to make my own determinations about why they weren't achieving the DEI results their organizations were pursuing. Additionally, over the past 18 months, I've learned a lot in forums with corporate CDOs spanning just about every industry-including panels and conversations about their leadership challenges. These leaders worked in public and private sectors, and in organizations of all sizes that are mostly headquartered in the U.S. I also interviewed more than two dozen CDOs specifically for this article. Here are 12 ways CDOs consistently say CEOs and companies fail them:\n\nCDOs rarely have seats at the table with other C-Suite executives. On many dimensions, one of these VPs isn't like the others. They don't have the same decision-making authority. Compared to other VPs, CDOs say their budgets and staffs are much smaller. Also, their compensation packages are reportedly much lower than counterparts within the company who have similar titles. Everyday reminders of these inequities are paradoxical and understandably frustrating to the person whose job it is to be the company's top equity officer.\n\nIn recruitment conversations, CEOs often tell prospective CDOs how much they personally value DEI, yet they don't get to spend much time with CDOs after they accept the positions. The CDO doesn't have the same access to the CEO as do other VPs. One told me he'd talked with the CEO a total of 30 minutes over a two-year period; 20 of those were during their one-on-one when he was interviewing for the job.\n\nDespite the position supposedly being responsible for the integration of DEI into every aspect of the business, the CDO's boss in many places is the chief human resources officer (CHRO). It's worse in some instances: despite having chief and VP titles themselves, CDOs report to someone who reports to the CHRO. This makes them two layers removed from the CEO. Some were told they'd be reporting dually to the CEO and HR Chief - they say it's a terrible arrangement because substantive engagement with the CEO is relatively lower, oftentimes nonexistent.\n\nIn too many businesses, CEOs jumped on the 'everybody else is doing it bandwagon' and created CDO positions without being entirely clear about what the role was really supposed to be and do. In the weeks after George Floyd's murder, lots of businesses abruptly created CDO positions. Many DEI professionals who took those jobs less than three years ago have already left. To be sure, executives were hastily creating these positions long before summer 2020, sometimes under intense pressure from their diverse employees to do something in response to specific internal DEI crises.\n\nLike financial operations, communications, human resources, marketing, and legal affairs, DEI should be a cross-business function. In many places it's isolated to one area of the company: HR. Some DEI professionals ascend to the CDO job through diversity recruiting roles, but this isn't the case for all. Regardless of their paths to the CDO position, many understand the job they accepted to be multidimensional, all encompassing. They recognize that their company's DEI needs, challenges, vulnerabilities, and possibilities, include, but expand far beyond HR-related responsibilities. \"They pay people to do HR; I should be partnering with them, not doing the HR team's diversity work entirely for them,\" a former tech industry CDO told me.\n\nWeirdly, when there's a crisis that involves racial or gender discrimination, the CDO is too often left out of the conversation. Instead, legal and communications teams work on making the crisis go away as quickly, quietly, and inexpensively as possible. They too often mishandle these situations in ways that disappoint women and employees of color within the company, as well as invite criticism from diverse customers and others on social media. CDOs say certain missteps could've been avoided had their cultural intelligence and expertise on diverse communities been invited to the crisis response table. It isn't just about being invited - they also want their expertise to be as valued as the expertise colleagues from legal and communications bring.\n\nThe CDO tells the CEO the company has a serious racial problem. It's based on what they've experienced firsthand or observed, or it's credibly informed by what employees of color have reported to them. The CEO ignores this; tells the CDO all the reasons why they're wrong; lists a few things the company has recently done for people of color (thereby making it incapable of racism); seeks out a handful of other execs (sometimes, but not always people of color) who say there isn't a problem; and then ultimately rejects the CDO's advice on what the company should do.

      "text": "How Chief Health Equity Officers Are Changing The Healthcare Landscape\n\nBy Tory Clarke\n\nBy Tory Clarke ,\n\nForbes Councils Member.\n\nTory Clarke, Co-Founder & Partner, Bridge Partners .\n\nIn the wake of George Floyd's murder in 2020 and the stark inequities exposed by the Covid-19 pandemic, the rise of the chief health equity officer (CHEO) role is no coincidence. Healthcare purveyors are prioritizing efforts to understand and create the conditions for equitable outcomes with greater urgency. CHEOs are chartered with the mandate to integrate equity into the very fabric of their organizations to create accountability and drive outcomes.\n\nWhile the pandemic undeniably illuminated the glaring reality of health disparities faced by disenfranchised communities, there had already been a growing recognition of these ethical, economic and public health concerns. In 2018, a study by the National Institute on Minority Health and Health Disparities revealed that racial and ethnic health disparities cost the U.S. economy $451 billion , a 41% increase from the $320 billion costs in 2014. Addressing these disparities is not just the right thing to do, it's a strategic economic imperative. In a 2021 Deloitte survey of healthcare and life science CEOs, half of respondents said improved health equity was a top goal.\n\nTo address these issues, the chief health equity officer is becoming a crucial voice in how we understand and mitigate health disparities. This role blurs traditional healthcare ecosystem spheres of influence and boundaries of hierarchies and silos. It extends beyond hospitals and clinics into policy, education and community engagement. CHEOs are champions of social determinants of health-those factors outside of medical care that influence health outcomes, such as housing, income and education. These executives recognize that achieving health equity requires a holistic approach that addresses both the symptoms of disease and the root causes of health disproportions.\n\nHistorically, tackling such discrepancies primarily fell to public health initiatives or community-based organizations. But the national outcry for racial justice following George Floyd's murder has amplified the urgency of addressing health inequities , demanding a more impartial system. So public and private partnerships between hospitals, payers, tech giants and government agencies are emerging as new models of co-creation. CHEOs are the lynchpins of these efforts.\n\nNot simply reactive figures, chief health equity officers are proactive changemakers in closing gaps. Imagine a healthcare goliath or hospital system with a CHEO that's expanding the data and analytic strategy to address racial bias in clinical algorithms. The CHEO at a payer organization may partner with community-based groups to develop culturally relevant outreach programs for underserved communities. Even still, a tech giant's CHEO could work with product teams to design digital health tools that are accessible to low-income populations. These aren't scenarios from a distant future; they're the current possibilities unlocked by the CHEO role.\n\nBecause CHEOs play a pivotal role in impacting an organization's external stakeholders, they can provide vital perspective on internal HR policies and practices. HR leaders can lean on CHEOs to inform their inclusive employee health resources and benefits packages, provide guidance on enhancing the accessibility of internal HR systems and shed light on the health needs of various underrepresented employee populations. This is a strategic perspective that's often missing from the overall HR strategy in organizations.\n\nOf course, challenges lie ahead. The CHEO position is still emerging, and its scope and effectiveness will vary across organizations. Defining clear metrics for success, navigating complex organizational structures and securing long-term commitment from leadership are all hurdles that must be outlined and overcome. But the potential of the role is undeniable.\n\nBy bridging the gap between conventional healthcare and the social determinants of health, CHEOs can be the architects of a more just healthcare landscape. It's not just about treating everyone the same; it's about ensuring everyone has the same opportunity to achieve optimal health. As more organizations embrace the CHEO role, we all inch closer to a future where healthcare is not a privilege but a right enjoyed by all. The question is no longer if CHEOs will reshape healthcare but how quickly and effectively they will do so.\n\nForbes Human Resources Council is an invitation-only organization for HR executives across all industries. Do I qualify?"

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has described the attacks on police officers during the January 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol as \"very minor incidents.\"\n\nThe president made the comments as he defended pardoning or commuting the prison sentences of more than 1,500 people convicted in connection with the attack in his first sit-down interview since returning to the White House.\n\nTrump's actions on Monday freed people who were convicted of violent attacks on police officers, as well as the leaders of far-right extremist groups convicted of orchestrating plots to prevent the peaceful transfer of power.\n\nSeveral police officers died during and after the riots, while more than 100 were injured. One officer died of a stroke after sustaining injuries at the Capitol, while four officers died by suicide in the aftermath.\n\nTrump's remarks to Fox News ' Sean Hannity on Wednesday downplay the impact of the riot, and risk eroding trust between police officers and his administration.\n\nTrump told Fox News on Wednesday that the people granted pardons this week had been \"treated so badly\" while in prison.\n\n\"They were in there for three-and-a-half years, a long time, and in many solitary confinement, treated like nobody has ever been, treated so badly,\" he said. \"They were treated like the worst criminals in history.\"\n\nTrump repeated his claim that the 2020 election had been stolen from him, saying that people at the Capitol were \"protesting the vote because they know the election was rigged and you should be allowed to protest a vote.\"\n\nWhen Hannity interjected that the rioters should not have been able to invade the Capitol, Trump insisted that most people convicted were \"absolutely innocent.\"\n\nHe added: \"These people have served horribly, a long time. It would be very, very cumbersome to go and look, you know how many people we're talking about? 1,500 people. Almost all of them are, should not have been, this should not have happened.\n\n\"And the other thing is this, some of those people with the police, true, but they were very minor incidents, okay, you know they get built up by that couple of fake guys that are on CNN all the time. They were very minor incidents.\"\n\nThe family of Brian Sicknick, an officer who died the day after the attack, told CBS News: \"There are no words that adequately describe the pain of losing Brian, and the suffering we have endured every day since, never to end. The pardons are intended to 'end a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated on the American people, and to begin the process of national reconciliation.' It is up to the American people to decide whether this purpose will be achieved, involving far more serious questions than how our family feels about the death of a son and brother, and the undoing of the justice that was previously determined by the Court's sentencing of Brian's assailants.\n\n\"It is our hope that the truth of what happened that tragic day will survive, irrespective of partisan political objectives. We are proud of our son's defense of American democracy, and the continued efforts of his fellow officers to safeguard the seat of government, and the Constitution which guides it; our hearts go out to them as they cope with all that has occurred, and we pray for their strength and fortitude to continue their important mission.\"\n\nWinston Pingeon , a former police officer who defended the Capitol on January 6, 2021, told BBC 's Newsnight program that the pardons are \"a slap in the face.\"\n\n\"It's so utterly disrespectful to these officers who showed up on January 6, just like they have every day since, to make many personal sacrifices of themselves in service to Congress , in service to our nation and to American people, of trying to make this world a better place,\" he said.\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police , which endorsed Trump, and the International Association of Chiefs of Police said they were \"deeply discouraged\" by the pardons.\n\n\"The IACP and FOP firmly believe that those convicted of such crimes should serve their full sentences. Crimes against law enforcement are not just attacks on individuals or public safety - they are attacks on society and undermine the rule of law,\" they said.\n\n\"Allowing those convicted of these crimes to be released early diminishes accountability and devalues the sacrifices made by courageous law enforcement officers and their families.\n\n\"When perpetrators of crimes, especially serious crimes, are not held fully accountable, it sends a dangerous message that the consequences for attacking law enforcement are not severe, potentially emboldening others to commit similar acts of violence.\"\n\nSenator Thom Tillis told Reuters: \"I saw an image today in my news clippings of the people who were crushing that police officer. None of them should get a pardon. You make this place less safe if you send the signal that police officers could potentially be assaulted and there is no consequence.\"\n\nTrump's sweeping pardons will likely continue to face scrutiny.\n\nRepublican House Speaker Mike Johnson announced on Wednesday that House Republicans will establish a new select subcommittee to investigate the attack on the Capitol and counter \"false narratives.\"\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, contact the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline by dialing 988, text \"988\" to the Crisis Text Line at 741741 or go to 988lifeline.org\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nKhaleda Rahman is Newsweek's National Correspondent based in London, UK.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump issued full and unconditional pardons Wednesday to Andrew Zabavsky and Terrance Sutton, the former Metropolitan Police Department officers sentenced in a deadly 2020 chase of a man on a moped and the subsequent cover-up, a case that sparked protests in the nation's capital.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the MPD Wednesday night via email for comment.\n\nZabavsky and Sutton were sentenced in September for their involvement in the death of Karon Hylton-Brown. Zabavsky was sentenced to four years behind bars for conspiring with Sutton to hide the reckless pursuit of Hylton-Brown. Sutton was sentenced to five years and six months for a murder conviction in the case.\n\nDespite their sentences, both officers have remained free pending an appeal.\n\nThe incident that led to these sentences occurred on October 23, 2020, when Sutton pursued Hylton-Brown, who was riding an electric moped on a sidewalk without a helmet. Sutton, driving an unmarked police car, along with other officers and Zabavsky in a marked vehicle, engaged in a high-speed chase that violated police department policies and training.\n\nThe pursuit spanned 10 city blocks and ended tragically when Hylton-Brown was struck by an oncoming car as Sutton accelerated without his vehicle's emergency lights and sirens.\n\nFollowing Hylton-Brown's death, both officers embarked on a cover-up instead of preserving the evidence or properly interviewing witnesses. Their actions included allowing the driver who struck Hylton-Brown to leave and misleading their commanding officer about the incident's severity. Sutton further compounded the misconduct by drafting a false police report.\n\nOn Tuesday, the DC Police Union announced that it was collaborating with Trump to secure pardons for the two former District police officers convicted in the 2020 murder case.\n\n\"In fact, I'm going to be letting two officers from Washington-I believe they're from from D.C., but I just approved it. They were arrested and put in jail for five years because they went after an illegal, and I guess something happened where something went wrong. They arrested the two officers to put them in jail for going after a criminal,\" Trump said on Tuesday.\n\nIn his comments, Trump said Hylton-Brown was an \"illegal.\" However, no evidence or reporting has suggested that Hylton-Brown was in the country illegally.\n\nBefore the officers were pardoned Wednesday, Hylton-Brown's mother, Karen Hylton, released a statement that said in part: \"As a mother, I am asking you don't pardon the murders (sic) of my baby Karon Hylton.\"\n\n\"President Trump as the mother of a baby whom I love, I am requesting to speak with you privately...Please don't pardon Sutton and Zabavsky.\"\n\nMatthew Graves, the U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia, said in a statement after September's verdict: \"Crimes like this erode that trust and are a disservice to the community and the thousands of officers who work incredibly hard, within the bounds of the Constitution, to keep us safe.\"\n\nTrump's pardons of the D.C. officers come amid sweeping pardons and clemency orders for those convicted of crimes during the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol, when a group of his supporters violently protested the 2020 presidential election results.\n\nThe pardons were among his first official acts upon returning to the White House on Monday and fulfilled a key campaign promise.\n\nBut he is facing scrutiny over some of these pardons, particularly pertaining to those who have been convicted of violent crimes during the riot . Five police officers died in the weeks after the riot. One died of a stroke following injuries sustained at the scene, while four others died by suicide.\n\nUpdate 1/22/25, 7:24 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nGabe Whisnant is a Breaking News Editor at Newsweek based in North Carolina.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nDavid Dempsey, a man convicted of stomping on police officers' heads during the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol building, was among those pardoned by President Donald Trump on Monday.\n\nTrump issued sweeping pardons for those convicted of crimes during the Jan. 6 riot, when a group of his supporters violently protested the 2020 presidential election results. The pardons were among his first official acts upon returning to the White House on Monday and fulfilled a key campaign promise.\n\nBut he is facing scrutiny over some of these pardons, particularly pertaining those who have been convicted of violent crimes during the riot , such as Dempsey. Five police officers died in the weeks after the riot. One died of a stroke following injuries sustained at the scene, while four others died by suicide.\n\nProsectors described Dempsey as \"political violence personified,\" and he was eventually sentenced to 20 years in prison for his role in the riot.\n\nIn an August 2024 sentencing memorandum, prosecutors wrote that he was one of the most violent protesters.\n\n\"Unlike other rioters who slowly pushed their way through the crowd towards the Capitol, Dempsey climbed atop his fellow rioters, using them like human scaffolding, thrusting himself to the front,\" they wrote.\n\nThey continued that he \"began a prolonged attack, fighting with his hands, feet, flag poles, crutches, pepper spray, broken pieces of furniture, and anything else he could get his hands on, as weapons against the police\" and \"attacked a fellow rioter who was trying to disarm him.\"\n\nDempsey allegedly \"unleashed a torrent of pepper spray directly at Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) Detective Phuson Nguyen,\" burning his lungs, throat, eyes and face, according to court documents.\n\nProsecutors also wrote that he \"struck MPD Sergeant Mastony's head with such ferocity using a metal crutch that it cracked the protective shield of his gas mask, causing Sergeant Mastony to collapse in a daze, his ears ringing.\"\n\n\"Though Dempsey has pled guilty only for his assaults on Detective Nguyen and Sergeant Mastony, his violent assault on other officers defending the Capitol was relentless: swinging polelike weapons more than 20 times, spraying chemical agents at least three times, hurling objects at officers at least ten times, stomping on the heads of police officers as he perched above them five times, attempting to steal a riot shield and baton, and incessantly hurling threats and insults at police while rallying other rioters to join his onslaught,\" the document reads.\n\nNewsweek reached out to the White House and a defense lawyer who represented Dempsey via email on Tuesday for comment.\n\nRepresentative Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat who outlined some of the violent offenders pardoned by Trump, including Dempsey, wrote on X (formerly Twitter): \" These are some of the violent criminals and felons who assaulted police officers and attacked our democracy on January 6th. President Trump claims to be a president of law and order, but then lets cop beaters and killers walk free. It's disgusting and wrong.\"\n\nSenator Susan Collins, a Maine Republican, said in a statement to Newsweek : \"I do not support pardons given to people who engaged in violence on January 6, including assaulting police officers, or breaking windows to get into the Capitol, for example.\"\n\nFamily of Brian Sicknick, an officer who died following Jan. 6, said in a statement to CBS News: \"The pardons are intended to 'end a grave national injustice that has been perpetrated on the American people, and to begin the process of national reconciliation.' It is up to the American people to decide whether this purpose will be achieved, involving far more serious questions than how our family feels about the death of a son and brother, and the undoing of the justice that was previously determined by the Court's sentencing of Brian's assailants.\"\n\nMany of those pardoned by Trump have already been released. Meanwhile, Trump is expected to continue pushing his conservative agenda throughout the first days in office.\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline by dialing 988, text \"988\" to the Crisis Text Line at 741741 or go to 988lifeline.org.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nAndrew Stanton is a Newsweek weekend reporter based in Maine.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe trial for three former police officers accused of beating Tyre Nichols to death began this week.\n\nOn Wednesday, opening statements began in the case against three former Memphis police officers accused of civil rights violations in the death of Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who was beaten to death in January 2023.\n\nThe former officers are on trial for federal civil rights violations, with Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Rogers arguing in opening statements that they were punishing Tyre Nichols for fleeing a traffic stop. Rogers referenced the police slang \"run tax,\" which describes disciplining someone for attempting to escape. She noted that the level of force used far exceeded Nichols' actions and cautioned jurors that they would see video footage of the brutal beating. The footage was made public just weeks after Nichols' death.\n\nDuring the opening statements, Rogers accused the officers of failing to act during the \"crucial\" moments when Nichols' heart stopped.\n\n\"You won't see Tyre Nichols pose a threat to these officers at any time,\" Rogers said on Wednesday.\n\nTadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith have pleaded not guilty to federal charges, including depriving Nichols of his civil rights through excessive force, failure to intervene, and obstructing justice by tampering with witnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, Emmitt Martin III and Desmond Mills Jr. have already pleaded guilty. Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth Rogers confirmed that Martin and Mills are expected to testify during the trial.\n\nAccording to authorities, police attempted to stop Nichols while he was driving, and after he was stopped, a confrontation ensued that resulted in Nichols fleeing on foot. He was then apprehended again by the five officers, resulting in a second confrontation.\n\nThe police said Nichols complained of having \"shortness of breath\" and was taken to the hospital in a critical condition. He died of his injuries on January 10. Nichols was pepper-sprayed, stunned with a Taser, and brutally beaten with punches, kicks, and a police baton during the traffic stop.\n\nPolice footage, released that same month, captured the five officers-who are also Black-assaulting Nichols as he called out for his mother just a block from her home. The video also showed the officers standing around, conversing, while Nichols sat on the ground, visibly struggling from his injuries.\n\nJohn Keith Perry, an attorney for Bean, started crafting his defense during opening statements on Wednesday.\n\nPerry argued that Tyre Nichols drove for two miles after officers activated their blue lights and resisted their orders to surrender, claiming Nichols was \"fighting like hell\" with police. Perry stated that footage from a sky cop camera would show Nichols behaving suspiciously and asserted that evidence would prove the officers' innocence.\n\n\"The narrative you hear here will take you five minutes to deliberate on,\" Perry said.\n\nDuring a break in the proceedings on Wednesday afternoon, Nichols' family, their legal team and supporters gathered outside the courthouse for a prayer vigil.\n\n\"Our hope is that they're found guilty and to show the world that my son was a good person and he wasn't the criminal that they're trying to make him out to be,\" RowVaughn Wells, Nichols' mother, said.\n\nThis article includes reporting from the Associated Press.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nMatthew Impelli is a Newsweek staff writer based in New York.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nTwo former Louisville Police officers involved in the Breonna Taylor raid had their felony charges dismissed by a judge this week.\n\nOn Friday, the Associated Press (AP) reported that U.S. District Judge Charles Simpson issued a ruling on the raid that led to Taylor's death in 2020. In the ruling, Judge Simpson said that Taylor's cause of death was due to a gunshot fired by her boyfriend at the police and not a bad warrant.\n\nThe ruling dismissed felony charges previously announced against Louisville Police Detective Joshua Jaynes and former Sergeant Kyle Meany.\n\nIn 2022, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced felony charges against Jaynes and Meany while visiting Louisville to discuss the high-profile case. Meany and Jaynes were not present in the raid at Taylor's residence, but Garland argued that the two former law enforcement officials had placed Taylor in danger by falsifying parts of the warrant used in the incident.\n\nHowever, in the ruling on Friday, Judge Simpson said that \"there is no direct link between the warrantless entry and Taylor's death.\" The ruling lessened the civil rights violations against the two former officers. The previous charges held a maximum sentence of life in prison, the AP reported.\n\nThe judge refused to dismiss a conspiracy charge against Jaynes and a separate charge against Meany, who is accused of providing false statements to investigators.\n\nIn 2020, officials with the Louisville Police Department executed a raid on Taylor's residence. When police broke down the door, Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired his gun at police, thinking that an intruder was breaking into the home. In response, police fired a shot back at Walker, and the bullet fatally struck Taylor.\n\nThe death of Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, prompted widespread backlash against police and questions on how the warrant was carried out.\n\nIn his ruling, Judge Simpson wrote that the gunshot fired by Walker \"became the proximate, or legal, cause of Taylor's death.\"\n\n\"While the indictment alleges that Jaynes and Meany set off a series of events that ended in Taylor's death, it also alleges that (Walker) disrupted those events when he decided to open fire\" on police officials, the ruling said.\n\nImmediately after the incident, Walker was arrested and faced attempted murder charges for firing a gun at police officers. However, the charge was later dismissed.\n\nIn 2022, Kelly Goodlett, a third former Louisville police officer, pled guilty to conspiracy charges in connection with the raid and Taylor's death. Goodlett is likely to testify against both Jaynes and Meany in their respective trials.\n\nAdditionally in 2022, former officer Brett Hankison was charged by federal prosecutors in Taylor's death, but his trial ended in a hung jury last year. Hankison is expected to appear in court again in October for a retrial on the charges.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nMatthew Impelli is a Newsweek staff writer based in New York.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nChinese police will soon be patrolling streets alongside local counterparts in Hungarian cities, according to a new agreement.\n\nThe agreement, inked last month by Hungarian Minister of the Interior Sandor Pinter and Chinese Minister for Public Safety Wang Xiaohong, is aimed at boosting security in well-trafficked tourist areas, the Ministry of the Interior told Hungarian news portal Telex last week.\n\nThis official law enforcement presence follows allegations that China has been operating clandestine \"police stations\" in dozens of cities worldwide. In a 2022 report, Spain-based human rights organization Safeguard Defenders detailed how this shadowy network, believed to be part of the Chinese Communist Party's United Front influence apparatus, intimidate and surveil dissidents, asylum-seekers, and ethnic minorities living abroad.\n\nThe ministry said: \"Police officers from the two countries will in the future be able to carry out patrol duties together, thus helping to improve communication between the citizens and the authorities of the two countries and improving internal security and public order.\"\n\nHungary's Ministry of the Interior and the Chinese embassy in Budapest did not immediately respond to written requests for comment.\n\nSuch an arrangement is not unheard for the central European country and its neighbors. Hungarian police join patrols in Croatia during the coastal country's peak tourism season, and Austrian police do the same at tourist hotspots in Hungary, the ministry pointed out.\n\nCroatia, as well as Serbia and Italy have even run their own joint patrol programs with China. Italy announced it was ending the activity in 2022 after news of the underground police-like centers spread.\n\nSafeguard Defenders identified two of these hubs in the Central European country's capital of Budapest that it said were run by China's Qingtian and Fuzhou county public security bureaus.\n\nIt is unclear how closely Prime Minister Viktor Orban's China-friendly government will keep tabs on the activities of visiting law enforcements.\n\n\"At this point it is clear how lessons learned in other countries have not been heeded. While this is not at all surprising given Orban's Hungary and his relationship with the PRC (People's Republic of China), it is concerning and highlights how the coordinated European response we've been asking for is direly needed,\" Safeguard Defenders campaign director Laura Harth told Newsweek .\n\nThe U.S. is on high alert over suspected cases of Chinese transnational repression such as those detailed in the NGO's report.\n\nLast April, Chinese nationals Lu Jianwang and Chen Jinping, were arrested for allegedly running a secret police station in the Chinatown of New York City's Manhattan. The two claimed they were running \"service centers\" to assist other Chinese.\n\nLu and Chen were charged with obstruction of justice and conspiring to act as agents for China.\n\n\"As alleged, the defendants and their co-conspirators were tasked with doing the PRC's bidding, including helping locate a Chinese dissident living in the United States, and obstructed our investigation by deleting their communications. Such a police station has no place here in New York City-or any American community.\" U.S. Attorney Breon Peace for the Eastern District of New York was quoted as saying in a Department of Justice press release.\n\nUpdate 03/14/24, 10:40 p.m. ET: This article has been updated with additional information about China's previous police patrol agreements in Europe, and with a comment from Safeguard Defenders.\n\nMicah McCartney is a reporter for Newsweek based in Taipei, Taiwan.

      "text": "Are the Police a Force for Good? | Opinion\n\nAdvocates for ideas and draws conclusions based on the interpretation of facts and data.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nRecent reports about a \"Goon Squad\" of abusive police officers in Mississippi have thrust police misconduct back into national headlines . And an essential question continues to be debated: What is the proper role for the police in American society?\n\nThis is not an easy topic to address. And the debate is all too often radically over-simplified. \"Black lives matter!\" (Well, yes, of course.) \"Blue lives matter!\" (True, too.) \"Defund the police!\" (Say, what?) \"Refund the police!\" (Train them too, please.)\n\nOn the one hand, police brutality is a real thing. Some police officers do commit crimes against those they are supposed to protect. As is found in any large population of people, moreover, some subset of police officers are, in fact, racist. And America's long and brutal history with racism magnifies the harms and sensitivities surrounding police misconduct. It's hardly surprising that anecdotes of police violence (like the Goon Squad) can generate tremendous backlash, especially when captured on film and posted on social media.\n\nOn the other hand, the police are absolutely necessary for reducing crime. Many police officers have good intentions and aren't racist. And a strong police force protects innocent, vulnerable, law-abiding citizens, including-especially-those in underprivileged communities. Few Americans in high-crime neighborhoods are on the frontlines of radical movements seeking to abolish the police.\n\nAll of this is true at the same time.\n\nIt's also true that George Floyd 's murder by a Minneapolis police officer was every bit as horrific as the most impassioned social-justice warriors asserted. Yet in its aftermath, the extent to which Americans-online, among the press, in the streets-called for defunding the police and interpreted all use of force by the police as criminal was counterproductive. And deeply so. It predictably caused the police to withdraw from inner cities, contributing to increased violence there. Police officers are, after all, human beings like everyone else. Why would anyone risk life and limb and enter highly volatile and dangerous situations only to be accused of wrongdoing if things go sideways?\n\nSometimes cause and effect are hard to tease out with public policy. Sometimes they aren't. And this one's easy: The more police officers are unfairly accused of criminal violence, the less likely they are to proactively stop crime. How could it be any other way?\n\nSo how, then, should we as a nation wrestle with these competing considerations? Again, how should we determine the proper role for the police in American society?\n\nStaying rational is essential. While the stakes are high, emotions shouldn't distort the picture. Anecdotes shouldn't get undue weight. Facts and data shouldn't be distorted or ignored to keep cherished narratives intact. And everyone should recognize that a perfect line can't be drawn on the policy continuum-a police force large and proactive enough to sufficiently deter crime will inevitably commit some amount of gratuitous violence. Put another way-a town or city can't both adequately limit crime and eliminate police misconduct.\n\nThe key is to strike the optimal balance. Police forces should be sufficiently staffed, funded, and legally insulated to meet the specific needs of their communities; an emaciated and risk-averse police department is a huge net negative. And, at the same time, police officers should be adequately trained and regulated to minimize misconduct; punishments for bad actors should be proportional and swift.\n\nHow precisely to achieve these objectives is no easy task. Reasonable minds can and will differ on the specifics, which should be carefully implemented within the context of each local community. But everyone should agree on one thing at the outset-extreme views-on either side-have no place in this debate.\n\nWilliam Cooper is an attorney and the author of How America Works ...

      "text": "40 Percent of Police Officers Convicted of Child Sex Abuse Don't Get Prison Time, Investigation Finds\n\nPolice Abuse\n\nEmma Camp | 6.12.2024 3:11 PM\n\nA new investigation from The Washington Post has revealed that over the past two decades, almost 1,800 police officers were charged with crimes related to child sexual abuse. Even worse, of those convicted, nearly 40 percent managed to avoid prison time.\n\nThe investigation revealed a staggering lack of accountability for officers who sexually abuse minors-finding not only that convicted officers often received paltry sentences, but that police departments sometimes rehired officers with child sex abuse convictions.\n\nThe Post 's analysis looked at thousands of court filings, as well as The Henry A. Wallace Police Crime Database, the county's most comprehensive database of police arrests. The authors found that, between 2005 and 2022, around 17,700 police officers were charged with crimes-and 1 in 10 of those were charged with a crime involving the sexual abuse of minors.\n\nThe crimes officers were charged with varied, though most charges were for a few specific offenses. According to the Post 's analysis, 39 percent of officers charged with child sexual abuse crimes were charged with rape. Twenty percent were charged with crimes related to child sexual abuse material (another term for child pornography) and 19 percent were charged with forcible fondling.\n\nEighty-three percent of charged officers were convicted. However, only 61 percent of convicted officers received prison time. Fifteen percent received local jail sentences, and a striking 24 percent received sentences as light as probation, fines, and community service.\n\nBut even those imprisoned received relatively light sentences. Half were sentenced to less than five years in jail.\n\nWhy did so many officers seem to get off easy for heinous sex crimes? According to the Post , it comes down to how prosecutors and judges treat police officers.\n\n\"Prosecutors have broad discretion in the types of charges they bring, the plea bargains they offer and the cases they are willing to take to trial,\" the Post 's analysis reads. \"Judges play a critical role at sentencing hearings in determining what punishment officers deserve.\"\n\nPolice departments also shoulder much of the blame.\n\n\"Departments hired officers who had been accused-or sometimes convicted-of child abuse, domestic violence and other serious crimes,\" reads the Post 's investigation. \"In some cases, officers fired for their conduct have appealed their terminations through their police union protections, won their jobs back and then were convicted of abusing kids.\"\n\nThe analysis shows just how commonplace police sexual abuse can be-and just how many barriers have been erected to prevent convicted officers from receiving adequate punishment for their crimes.\n\n\"This happens to communities all across the country, but it's not on people's radar,\" Phillip Stinson, a former police officer and criminal justice professor at Bowling Green State University, told the Post . \"And then, police chiefs adhere to the bad apples theory, where they say, 'There's nothing to see here, we got rid of this problem when we fired them.'\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "\"Should Tort Law Care About Police Officers?,\" by Ellen Bublick (ASU) & Jane Bambauer (Florida)\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nTorts\n\nEugene Volokh | 3.5.2025 8:01 AM\n\nAn interesting response to The Plaintiff Police by Sarah L. Swan, Rutgers (Newark); here's the Introduction:\n\nIf a person purposely shoots at and injures another, should the shooter be accountable to pay damages to the person harmed? Absent significant justification, in almost every circumstance in every state, the answer is yes. But in The Plaintiff Police , Professor Sarah L. Swan argues that if the injured person is a police officer, the answer should be no. If the officer is hit by a negligent driver's car, she argues for the same result: no tort claim. Professor Swan would dramatically limit police claims to exclude intentional, reckless, and negligent torts, with only narrow exceptions.\n\nAs support for this extreme measure, The Plaintiff Police draws on the backdrop of historical racism, significant abuses of police power, and a set of cases that push the limits of tort liability no matter who brings the claim. That set includes Doe v. Mckesson , in which a police officer who was severely injured by a rock-throwing protestor filed suit against Black Lives Matter (BLM) protest organizers (a case that we have previously criticized as insufficiently protective of First Amendment rights). Alongside concerns about racism in policing, The Plaintiff Police draws on the widespread perception that injured civilians can rarely obtain civil remedies for police abuses.\n\nTogether, these impressions of vindictive police plaintiffs, and immunity from tort liability, foster a reflexive hostility to the police. In light of these impressions, Professor Swan argues that any possibility of civil action or recovery by police officers will be disproportionate to civilian legal actions, worsen power differentials, dampen political participation, and harm local citizen-community participation. On that basis, The Plaintiff Police argues for a draconian, if easy to administer, rule: if the plaintiff is a police officer, the court should toss out the plaintiff's claims at the start of the case.\n\nWe are aware of no state or country that has granted its entire population absolute immunity from civil liability for the tortious, even criminal, harms that its civilians inflict on police. And we think there are good reasons they haven't. In this Response, we argue that the arc of U.S. common law runs in the exact opposite direction: the common law has expanded, and should continue to expand, the civil legal rights of wrongfully injured people, including civilians wrongfully injured by police and police wrongfully injured by civilians.\n\nThe Plaintiff Police uses officer suits from injuries suffered during BLM protests to argue that tort claims filed by police officers are necessarily \"a familiar backlash to African Americans who dare seek equal justice under the law.\" However, the tort claims filed by Capitol police officers injured on January 6th serve as important counterpoints-reminders that officers' personal rights of redress are an important feature of equal justice under the law. Racial equality is not served by complete immunities for civilian misconduct any more than \"law and order\" is served by complete immunities for police officers who abuse their power.\n\nIn Part I, we lay out our understanding of the current state of affairs for civil claims pursued by police and contrast it with the picture of current suits painted by The Plaintiff Police. In Part II, we correct the record about police defendants, showing that the civil-justice system should, and does, allow for a range of claims against individual police officers, their departments, and federal, state and local entities. In Part III, we challenge Professor Swan's normative claim that officers' pursuit of individual tort claims for injuries suffered is inherently bad for society. To the contrary, we see much value in deterring tortious or otherwise unlawful conduct through civil, rather than criminal, enforcement, both for police and for civilians.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Law Enforcement Officers Are Part of \"the People,\" Not Above Them\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nSecond Amendment\n\nDavid Kopel | 12.11.2023 7:37 PM\n\nTwo weeks ago, I filed an amicus brief in U.S. District Court in Colorado, in Gates v. Polis , a case challenging the Colorado legislature's 2013 ban on magazines over 15 rounds. The brief was on behalf of Sheriffs and law enforcement training organizations: the International Law Enforcement Educators and Trainers Association, the Colorado Law Enforcement Firearms Instructors Association, the Western States Sheriffs Association, 10 elected Colorado County Sheriffs, and the Independence Institute (where I work).\n\nSome of the brief explains the practical mechanics of armed self-defense, and why bans on standard magazines do not impair mass shooters, but do endanger ordinary citizens, especially when attacked by multiple criminals. Another part of the brief shows that the key data created by some of the Colorado Attorney General's expert witnesses is obviously false.\n\nBut in this post, I will focus on a more fundamental argument in the brief. The law enforcement amici reject the claim that arms universally recognized as appropriate for ordinary law enforcement officers should be banned for ordinary citizens. The claim is based on the pernicious idea that law enforcement officers are above the people, rather than part of the people. Here are some excerpts from the brief:\n\nThe magazine ban attempts to divorce today's common arms of law-abiding citizens from today's common arms of law enforcement officers, including sheriffs and their deputies. The divorce, contrary to the wishes of both parties, endangers citizens and officers alike.\n\nThe arms of ordinary law enforcement officers are carefully selected for only one purpose: lawful defense of innocents in civil society. Throughout American history, many citizens have looked to law enforcement for guidance in choosing arms for the same purpose. Denying those arms to citizens and to retired law enforcement officers  endangers them for the same reasons that denying these arms to active law enforcement officers would endanger them. The most important reason is the necessity of reserve capacity, as detailed in Part II.\n\nMore fundamentally, the magazine ban violates the principles of our Constitution and of American law enforcement. Policing by consent is the American value, not militarized occupation from above.\n\nThe magazine ban is based on the sponsors' repeated claim that the \"one purpose\" of magazines over 15 rounds is \"to kill large numbers of people quickly.\" This false characterization was never challenged by any legislator who voted for the bill. The pernicious notion that Colorado law enforcement officers routinely carry arms for the \"one purpose\" of mass killing creates a false division between officers and the citizens whom they serve. The notion reduces citizen cooperation with officers, and also endangers officers. . . .\n\nAccording to the magazine ban, the very arms most commonly carried by ordinary law enforcement officers are off-limits to the community. This is backwards. As the Connecticut Supreme Court unanimously ruled, \"widespread acceptance ... within the law enforcement community also supports the conclusion that they [police batons] are not so dangerous or unusual as to fall outside the purview of the second amendment.\" State v. DeCiccio , 105 A.3d 165, 200 (Conn. 2014). . . .\n\nAmici reject the implied libel that the ordinary arms of American peace officers are the weapons of mass killers. Consider the following descriptions:\n\nThe first statement is accurate. The second inflames anger and hatred against law-abiding law enforcement officers.\n\nIf Defendant prevails because standard magazine are \"unusually dangerous,\" then the most typical arms of average deputies and officers are called into question, as supposedly excessive.\n\nThe magazine ban envisions policing from above, employing weapons of war. This is contrary to policing by consent. Law enforcement officers, including elected sheriffs, are part of their community. Colo. Const., art. XIV, §8. They enforce civil law, not martial law.\n\nIn 1828, United Kingdom Home Secretary Robert Peel (later Prime Minister) led a committee to study police. The resulting Metropolitan Police Act of 1829 created the first disciplined police force for the Greater London area. Peel's \"nine principles\" defined a policing system founded on public support. Because the police act with public approval, the public and police cooperate to tip the community balance against the criminals. Peel's principles were designed so that the power granted to government to carry out policing would not be abused. In the Peelian principles of law enforcement, \"[T]he police are the public and the public are the police, the police being only members of the public who are paid to give full-time attention to duties which are incumbent on every citizen in the interests of community welfare and existence.\"\n\nIn contrast, the magazine ban treats police like soldiers of an occupying army. The ordinary handgun and rifle magazines routinely carried for reasonable defense by deputies and other LEOs are declared to be weapons for mass murder. Supposedly, possession of weapons for mass killing by law enforcement is to be accepted as normal. What a perverse vision of police-community relations! Law enforcement officers are servants of the people, not their masters.\n\nThe idea that an ordinary sheriff's deputy on bike patrol is carrying arms made \"only\" for militarized mass killers poisons community relations. The divisive attitudes fostered by the magazine ban make the public less willing to cooperate with law enforcement. Sometimes, such attitudes result in attacks on officers.\n\nIn truth, the ban's law enforcement exemption falsifies Defendant's thesis that standard magazines are unneeded for lawful defense. . . .\n\nDefendant might argue that the law enforcement exemption is reasonable because law enforcement officers have more training and stronger vetting than does the average citizen. This is true. But the magazine ban is not a law about extra training or more thorough background checks. The magazine ban is ban for every citizen, no matter how impeccable of character and no matter how proficient.\n\nBecause the ban does not even allow inheritance, Colorado is on a path to become a state where typical law enforcement officers must appear among the people while carrying arms that are forbidden to the people. Such a repressive scenario contradicts our consensual Constitution. The Second Amendment protects \"the security of a free State.\" A free State-a state of consent-is the opposite of law enforcement officers being above \"the people.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Study: George Floyd Protests Did Not Cause Mass Exodus of Police Officers\n\nPolitics\n\nJoe Lancaster | 7.8.2024 4:35 PM\n\nDid the social justice protests of 2020 cause a wave of police officers to leave the force? A recent study suggests the truth may not be so simple.\n\nIn May 2020, a Minneapolis police officer killed George Floyd by pinning him to the ground with his knee. When video of the encounter circulated online, the image of a white police officer nonchalantly kneeling atop a black man until he asphyxiated ignited a powder keg: Americans, stir-crazy from sheltering in place for the first three months of the COVID-19 pandemic, took to the streets to protest police brutality, in some cases violently .\n\nThe conventional wisdom says that amid a nationwide spike in crime and mounting protests in which demonstrators proclaimed that \"all cops are bastards,\" many officers simply gave in. \"As anger bubbles in parts of the country, some US police departments are facing their own crises and some officers have now opted to walk away,\" CNN reported in June 2020, less than a month after Floyd's death.\n\n\"The law enforcement community is suffering in a year that began with a global pandemic and is now seeing significant social upheaval,\" Police1 reported in October 2020. \"In just a few short months, officers went from being lauded as essential workers to working amid a social discourse that paints all officers in a negative light.\"\n\nA June 2021 survey from the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) found a 45 percent increase in retirements in 2020-2021 when compared to the previous year, as well as an 18 percent rise in resignations.\n\nBut a new study from Duke University law professor Ben Grunwald challenges this narrative. To assess the validity of the claim that officers resigned en masse after the 2020 protests, Grunwald collected data \"on every job held by every officer in all 6,800 local law enforcement agencies across fifteen states that, together, cover half the U.S. population.\" That database came to encompass over 972,000 officers between the mid-1990s and 2022, though for the study, he focused only on 2011-2021.\n\nGrunwald found that \"the increase in separations\" among those agencies \"after the summer of 2020 was smaller, later, less sudden, and possibly less pervasive than the retention-crisis narrative suggests.\"\n\n\"Separations were nearly stable in 2020 compared to the year before,\" he writes, while \"in 2021, separations increased by historically large numbers but substantially less than the most widely reported figures for that period.\" Specifically, separations in 2020 increased \"by less than 1% compared to 2019\" while they \"rose far more in 2021, by 18% relative to 2019.\" Grunwald notes that while this increase \"was historically unusual, larger than any two-year period in the previous decade,\" it is also much smaller than the 2021 PERF study suggested, and about one-third of it \"can be explained by pre-existing trends that long predate the events of 2020.\"\n\n\"All told, the cumulative effect on aggregate employment by the end of 2021 was just 1%,\" Grunwald concludes. \"This was not because of increased lateral mobility [officers transferring to another department or another role within law enforcement], as some have wondered. Rather, [the database] shows that the vast majority of excess separations in 2021 were by officers leaving the field, at least for a while.\" He does acknowledge, though, that \"a substantial minority of large departments [those with 500 or more officers] were meaningfully hit, losing over 5% of staff by the end of 2021.\"\n\nAs to why officers chose to leave when they did, Grunwald conceded that he was unable to test for factors like \"social hostility\" or criticism from city leaders making officers feel unsupported. But he did examine \"whether the intensity of local protests affected local separations,\" comparing police separation rates with the reported attendance numbers for over 9,800 protests during the summer of 2020. \"The results,\" Grunwald concluded, \"provide no evidence that more intense political activism caused more separations among agencies with the highest protest intensity.\"\n\nInstead, Grunwald proposes four possible alternatives for an uptick in officer resignations. \"The first is economic ,\" he writes. \"Like workers in other fields, officers quit for better compensation, benefits, training, and opportunities for promotion-particularly in periods of economic growth....The U.S. job market surged dramatically in the first half of 2021, with monthly job openings rising 70% by the end of the year.\" In June 2021, the same month that the PERF survey found a huge spike in officer retirements and resignations, The New York Times ran an article headlined \"Why Police Have Been Quitting in Droves in the Last Year.\" Focusing on the Asheville Police Department as a microcosm of the national trend, the article noted that officers felt increasingly \"demoralized\" but also noted that the starting salary was $37,000, not nearly enough to buy a house in the city.\n\nAnother potential factor Grunwald identified was the pandemic itself, not only that officers had to contend with \"personal obligations, like family or childcare\" but also \"burnout\" as \"the pandemic amplified old stressors and created new ones.\"\n\nGrunwald also suggests that political activism may have contributed to officer attrition, either as a result of demoralizing protests or pressures for reform, though \"this timing is also consistent with the pandemic\" and cannot be easily separated.\n\nFinally, he suggests that demographic shifts may have played a role, as a large number of officers who were already approaching retirement age, hired either as part of the baby boom generation or after the 1994 crime bill, may have taken the opportunity to go ahead and call it quits. The Marshall Project reported in January 2023 that while some cities and counties struggled to staff their police departments in the years since 2020, those same jurisdictions were having a hard time finding \"firefighters, bus drivers and other government workers\" as the overall job market rebounded.\n\nThere are other plausible explanations as well. Fordham University law professor John Pfaff noted that \"a cop's annual pension payout is a function of their total income-not base wages, but wages PLUS OVERTIME-of their final few years.\" In Atlanta, officer overtime pay doubled in 2020 ; Chicago paid out over $177 million in overtime that year, a 27 percent increase over the year before.\n\nGrunwald's results will not alleviate every concern about the current state of policing-his data cannot address, for example, whether or not police officers are \" quiet quitting ,\" staying on the job but only expending a bare-minimum effort. But it does demonstrate that, despite recent fearmongering, the protests of 2020 likely did not cause cops to flee to the exits in droves.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "More Police Officers Associated with More Black Homicides Prevented\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nCrime\n\nEugene Volokh | 12.1.2021 11:22 AM\n\nAn interesting article cowritten by a UCLA Public Policy school colleague of mine, Police Force Size and Civilian Race , forthcoming from Aaron Chalfin, Benjamin Hansen, Emily K. Weisburst and Morgan C. Williams, Jr. (I quote below from the May 4, 2021 draft). I'm not an expert on this subject, but I thought it worth passing along; I'd be glad, of course, to also excerpt and link to any articles that point out flaws in this one.\n\nThe background:\n\nWhile there is now a strong consensus in the academic literature that the number of police officers (McCrary, 2002; Evans and Owens, 2007; Chalfin and McCrary, 2018; Mello, 2019; Weisburst, 2019b) combined with their presence and visibility (Sherman and Weisburd, 1995; Di Tella and Schargrodsky, 2004; Klick and Tabarrok, 2005; Braga et al., 2014; MacDonald et al., 2016; Weisburd, 2016) reduces crime, whether the effect of additional law enforcement is heterogeneous across Black and white Americans remains a surprisingly open question.... Using national data on police employment for a sample of 242 large U.S. cities over a 38-year period, this research provides novel evidence on the racial differences in public safety returns to law enforcement expansion in the United States....\n\nThe homicide findings (I use curly braces below, as I often do, to indicate moved text):\n\nWe find that each additional police officer hired abates between 0.06 and 0.1 homicides [per year] .... The estimates suggest that investments in police manpower can save a life at a cost of between $1.6 and $2.7 million, far lower than common for accepted estimates of the value of a statistical life which typically exceed $7 million.\n\nAlthough the total reduction in homicide is roughly equal across Black and white victims, the decline in homicide is twice as large for Black victims in per capita terms. {On a per capita basis, police force expansion has a larger effect on homicide victimization for Black civilians (0 . 006 - 0 . 012 homicides per 100,000 population [for each officer per year]) than for white civilians (0 . 002 - 0 . 008 homicides per 100,000 population). The per capita racial disparity in the effect of police force size on homicide victimization is significant ... ( p < 0.001).}\n\n{On average, individuals living in the cities in our sample are 24% non-Hispanic Black, 19% Hispanic, and 49% non-Hispanic white.... In an average city-year in our data, there are 244 homicide victims, of which 138 (57%) are non- Hispanic Black and 64 (26%) are non-Hispanic white. Nationally, approximately half of homicide victims are Black-the proportion in our sample is slightly higher as we focus on large cities. In per capita terms, Black residents are approximately 4 times as likely to be the victim of a homicide compared to white residents....}\n\nThe \"quality of life\" arrest findings:\n\nNext, we consider the extent to which investments in police manpower expand civilian interactions with the criminal justice system, or create \"net widening\" effects, focusing on differences by race in police enforcement activity. Here, we find that investments in police manpower lead to larger total numbers of low-level \"quality of life\" arrests, with each additional officer making 7-22 new arrests. These increases are driven by an increase in arrests for liquor violation and drug possession, with effects that imply that increases in these types of arrests are 2.5-3 times larger for Black civilians.\n\n{[W]hile the racial disparity that we estimate is not significant at conventional levels, this test is likely conservative since, due to arrest data limitations, Hispanic arrestees are overwhelmingly classified as white for this outcome. As research indicates important Hispanic-white disparities with respect to policing outcomes (Sanga, 2009), the white estimate which includes Hispanic arrestees estimate is likely to be larger than the non-Hispanic white estimate.}\n\n{To the extent that policymakers conclude that the costs of making large numbers of arrests for \"quality of life\" offenses outweigh the potential public safety benefits, we note that a number of different avenues for reform could address racial disparities in the burdens of police enforcement. Consistent with our finding that the racially disparate effects of investments in police manpower are particularly large for drug possession arrests, the decriminalization of the possession of small amounts of drugs may be a particularly promising avenue for reducing racial disparities.}\n\nAnd the findings on serious \"index crimes\" (\"murder, rape, robbery, aggravated assault, burglary, grand larceny and motor vehicle theft\"):\n\nAt the same time, we find that arrests for the most serious offenses (so-called \"index crimes\") fall with investments police manpower. {Consistent with the prior literature (Evans and Owens, 2007; Kaplan and Chalfin, 2019; Weisburst, 2019b), we find that each police officer abates approximately 18-24 index crimes, an estimate which implies an elasticity of index crimes with respect to police is approximately -1.1. Since larger police forces lead to reductions in index crimes, the decline in index crime arrests that we observe suggests that larger police forces reduce serious crime primarily through deterrence rather than by arresting and incapacitating additional offenders (Nagin, 2013; Chalfin and McCrary, 2017; Kaplan and Chalfin, 2019).}\n\nOn a per capita basis, the decline in index crime arrests that we observe is between 4-6 times greater for arrests involving Black suspects. This finding is consistent with the idea that police hiring has the potential to create a \"double dividend\" (Bratton, 2011; Cook and Ludwig, 2011; Durlauf and Nagin, 2011) for both Black and white Americans by generating reductions in both crime and arrests for serious offenses.\n\nThe authors' remarks on the broader policy implications:\n\nOur estimates capture the historical opportunity cost of policing, by including controls that hold municipal spending fixed. In this vein, our results suggest that \"de-funding\" the police could result in more homicides, especially among Black victims.\n\nOf course, reducing funding for police could allow increased funding for other alternatives. An array of high-quality research suggests that crime can, in certain contexts, be reduced through methods other than policing or its by-product, incarceration. Among the many alternatives to police for which there is promising evidence are place-based crime control strategies such as increasing the availability of trees and green space (Branas et al., 2011), restoring vacant lots (Branas et al., 2016, 2018; Moyer et al., 2019), public-private partnerships (Cook and MacDonald, 2011), street lighting (Doleac and Sanders, 2015; Chalfin et al., 2019), and reducing physical disorder (Sampson and Raudenbush, 2001; Keizer et al., 2008). There is also evidence that social service-based strategies such as summer jobs for disadvantaged youth (Heller, 2014; Gelber et al., 2016; Davis and Heller, 2017), cognitive behavioral therapy (Blattman et al., 2017; Heller et al., 2017), mental health treatment (Deza et al., 2020; Jácome, 2020) and local non- profits more generally (Sharkey et al., 2017) can have important crime-reducing effects. While social service interventions are often difficult to scale (Mofiitt, 2006; Ludwig et al., 2011), the increasing number of studies which show that there are ways to reduce crime outside the deterrence channels of the traditional model of Becker (1968) is encouraging.\n\nWhether communities should invest less in law enforcement and more in alternative strategies remains an open question, as such a material change in our society's approach to public safety has yet to be implemented at scale. Our research focuses on one crucial aspect of this policy debate-the effect of reducing police employment-an outcome which would likely result if proposals to reduce funding for municipal police departments are adopted in the future. This study provides an estimate of the historical trade-offs of investments in law enforcement and, critically, the resulting implications for communities of color.\n\nTo be sure, hiring police officers might also increase the number of blacks killed by police officers; the study notes that it \"exclude[s] homicides committed in prisons or jails as well as felons killed in the commission of a crime as these are likely to fall under the legal definition of justifiable homicide\" (and of course it's possible that some of the \"felons killed in the commission of a crime\" were actually innocent, or at least innocent of any serious crime). It's also possible that it might decrease that number, for instance by reducing the number of arrests for the serious index offenses, which may be especially likely to lead to police shootings.\n\nBut in any event, this feature is unlikely to affect the overall results of this study: The total number of blacks killed by police officers in 2020 was 241 (as compared to 457 whites), for a national average of about 0.5 per 100,000 population. Even if such shootings were positively correlated with additional police officers, that correlation is likely to be swamped by the 0.006-0.012 per 100,000 per police officer decline in homicides that the study observes. (Note that the total number of black murder victims in the U.S. was 9,913, as compared to 7,029 whites.)\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Trump Wants Police To Be Above the Law\n\nPolice Abuse\n\nBilly Binion | From the August/September 2024 issue\n\nIn May, former President Donald Trump traveled to Wisconsin, a battleground state crucial to his 2016 win and 2020 loss. The stakes are high. He made a few big promises to match.\n\n\"We're going to give our police their power back,\" he told rallygoers in Waukesha, \"and we are going to give them immunity from prosecution.\"\n\nThere are a few problems. As president, Trump would be constrained in immunizing anyone, including police, from prosecution, as most proceedings are in state court where his power wouldn't apply. And while it's true that some officers are charged federally-where he could lobby the Department of Justice to refuse to charge any cop-those prosecutions are often in addition to state charges.\n\nTake Derek Chauvin, who was convicted in a Minnesota court of murdering George Floyd. After that trial, he pleaded guilty to federal charges. A President Trump could certainly pardon him for that, but it would make no material difference in the time Chauvin spends in prison, as his state sentence (22.5 years) and his federal sentence (21 years) are running concurrently.\n\nBut despite the legal illiteracy of Trump's promise, it's worth considering the implication that those with the most power should be held to the lowest standard.\n\nTrump made clear in office that he'd fight legislation hamstringing qualified immunity, the legal doctrine that bars victims from suing state and local government employees if the way in which those employees allegedly violated the law has not been clearly established as unconstitutional in prior case law. It is why, for example, two California men could not sue officers who allegedly stole more than $225,000 from them during the execution of a search warrant, as there was no previous court ruling that said stealing under such circumstances is illegal. (Federal police, on the other hand, are essentially protected by absolute immunity.)\n\nA common objection to qualified immunity reform is that cops will be bankrupted by lawsuits without it. But a study conducted by UCLA law professor Joanna Schwartz found that governments or their insurance companies, not the cops themselves, paid 99.98 percent of the damages awarded to plaintiffs. It's hard to know if Trump realizes this is the case, as he promised in December to \"indemnify [police] against any and all liability.\" Whether that was a knowingly false  promise or whether he is unfamiliar with the law remains unclear.\n\nBut one thing is clear: Trump would like to see law enforcement held to a lesser standard than the public they serve. The former president has arguably never been a tried-and-true conservative, but he does need to court them. It is difficult to make a conservative case for ensuring that those who enforce the law are also above it.\n\nThis article originally appeared in print under the headline \"Trump Promises Police 'Immunity From Prosecution'.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "The Country's Largest Police Union, Which Repeatedly Endorsed Trump, Is Dismayed by His Capitol Riot Pardons\n\nCapitol Riot\n\nJacob Sullum | 1.22.2025 3:35 PM\n\nThe Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), which supported President Donald Trump's election in 2016 , 2020 , and 2024 , yesterday criticized his blanket pardon for people charged in connection with the January 6, 2021, riot at the U.S. Capitol. The FOP, the country's largest police union, is troubled by the president's clemency for Trump supporters who assaulted police officers while expressing their outrage at a supposedly stolen election.\n\n\"Crimes against law enforcement are not just attacks on individuals or public safety,\" the FOP said in a joint statement with the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP). \"They are attacks on society and undermine the rule of law. Allowing those convicted of these crimes to be released early diminishes accountability and devalues the sacrifices made by courageous law enforcement officers and their families. When perpetrators of crimes, especially serious crimes, are not held fully accountable, it sends a dangerous message that the consequences for attacking law enforcement are not severe, potentially emboldening others to commit similar acts of violence.\"\n\nSpreading the blame around, the FOP and the IACP roped former President Joe Biden into their critique of misguided clemency for people convicted of violence against police officers. The organizations cited \"long standing and positive relationships with both President Trump and President Biden,\" thanking them for \"their support of the policing profession.\" But they added that they are \"deeply discouraged by the recent pardons and commutations granted by both the Biden and Trump Administrations to individuals convicted of killing or assaulting law enforcement officers.\"\n\nThe groups' beef with Biden presumably involves his last-minute commutation for Leonard Peltier, a Native American activist who was convicted of murdering two FBI agents during a 1975 shootout at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation. Peltier, who is now 80 and ailing, served half a century for those crimes before Biden commuted his life sentence to home confinement on Monday.\n\nFormer FBI Director Christopher Wray described Peltier as \"a remorseless killer\" in a letter urging Biden to keep him in prison. But Biden noted that \"Tribal Nations, Nobel Peace laureates, former law enforcement officials (including the former U.S. Attorney whose office oversaw Mr. Peltier's prosecution and appeal), dozens of lawmakers, and human rights organizations strongly support granting Mr. Peltier clemency, citing his advanced age, illnesses, his close ties to and leadership in the Native American community, and the substantial length of time he has already spent in prison.\"\n\nWhatever you think of Peltier's commutation, it is different in kind and scale from Trump's pardons for Capitol rioters.\n\nFirst, although Biden showed he is by no means averse to self-interested acts of clemency , he has no personal stake in this particular case. Trump, by contrast, has a strong interest in minimizing the crimes committed by his supporters, who were inspired by his baseless claim that massive election fraud had deprived him of his rightful victory. That interest explains why Trump, who in 2021 described the riot as \"a heinous attack on the United States Capitol,\" now portrays it as \"a day of love.\"\n\nSecond, allowing an elderly murderer to die at home after spending most of his life in prison is not quite the same as granting pardons to \"heroes\" and \"patriots\" who assaulted police during the Capitol riot. The former does not imply that Peltier is innocent or undeserving of punishment, while the latter suggests that the January 6 defendants were all victims of \"a grave national injustice,\" as Trump put it .\n\nThird, Biden's commutation involves one sick old man who poses no plausible threat to public safety, while Trump's pardons included about 600 people who were charged with \"assaulting, resisting, or impeding law enforcement agents or officers or obstructing those officers\" during the riot. As of last November, the Justice Department reported , that group included 169 defendants \"charged with using a deadly or dangerous weapon or causing serious bodily injury to an officer.\"\n\nTrump's pardons, unlike Biden's commutation, implicitly excuse political violence, as long as it is committed by people who love the president and acted based on his phony grievance. Trump shows no such lenience when left-leaning protesters who hate him tangle with the police. Those \"thugs\" obviously belong in jail, he thinks.\n\nMore generally, Trump's authoritarian \"law and order\" instincts lead him to oppose accountability for police officers who violate people's constitutional rights. But when his supporters attack police officers who are simply doing their jobs, as happened during the Capitol riot, he sees no crime worthy of punishment.\n\nThe only plausible explanation for this blatant inconsistency is that Trump sees everything through a narcissistic lens, which is apparent even when he manages to do the right thing . When he pardoned Ross Ulbricht on Tuesday, Trump noted that the Silk Road founder \"was given two life sentences, plus 40 years,\" for creating a website that connected drug buyers with drug sellers, which the president rightly described as \"ridiculous.\" Trump sympathized with Ulbricht, he said, because \"the scum that worked to convict him\"-prosecutors at the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York-\"were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me.\"\n\nTrump perceived no contradiction between his sympathy for Ulbricht and his oft-repeated position that drug dealers should be executed. That hard-line attitude likewise did not stop him from condemning \"very unfair\" drug penalties, freeing drug offenders such as Alice Johnson in response to celebrity appeals, or supporting drug sentencing reform-a cause he embraced based on a political bet that he later complained did not pay off. \"Did it for African Americans,\" he told a New York Times reporter in 2022. \"Nobody else could have gotten it done. Got zero credit.\"\n\nTrump's otherwise puzzling incoherence on criminal justice and drug policy is understandable only if you recognize that his self-interest overrides any principles he claims to support. That includes the principle that people who assault police officers deserve to be punished.\n\nWhen the FOP endorsed Trump in September, its president, Patrick Yoes, said the Republican nominee \"has shown time after time that he supports our law enforcement officers and understands the issues our members face every day.\" During his first term, Yoes said, Trump \"made it crystal clear that he has our backs.\" If the FOP's leaders are now surprised that Trump abandoned that commitment when it conflicted with his personal interests, they have not been paying attention.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Natelson on the Offices and Officers of the Constitution in 1788 and 1868\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nJosh Blackman | 12.29.2023 12:32 PM\n\nRob Natelson is one of my favorite originalist scholars. When he writes something new, I will read it. And I think very, very carefully before I disagree with him. His careful writing and meticulous research is well-regarded. Natelson's scholarship has been cited by Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito.\n\nI was very pleased to see that Natelson published an op-ed on the Section 3 debate in the Epoch Times . And Natelson provides some support for the Tillman/Blackman position that the President is not an \"Officer of the United States\" for purposes of Section 3.\n\nThe Constitution of 1788 uses two distinct phrases: \"Officers of the United States\" and \"Office under the United States.\" Natelson concludes, \"substantial evidence . . . suggests\" that the phrase Office under the United States \"doesn't include elected offices, such as senators, representatives, the vice president, or the president.\"\n\nI am grateful that Natelson offered praise for the work of my dear colleague, Seth Barrett Tillman:\n\nOver a decade ago, Seth Barrett Tillman , an American legal scholar working in Ireland, noticed that the use of these \"office\" phrases isn't haphazard. He found patterns. These patterns appear both in the drafting process and in the finished Constitution. Mr. Tillman also identified other historical facts consistent with the patterns.\n\nSince that time, Mr. Tillman has been joined by another legal scholar, Josh Blackman . Together, they have tried to reconstruct the meanings of all these words and phrases.\n\nIn 2014, I gave a lecture on my ACA book at Stanford. Judge Michael McConnell was kind enough to host me at his home for a lovely dinner. Will Baude, who was then a fellow at Stanford, attended. Over dinner, we were discussing some of the most important, and under-appreciated originalist scholars. Our discussion immediately turned to Professor Tillman in Ireland. Indeed, in 2016 Baude wrote that \"Professor Tillman's theory makes sense of patterns that most of us never saw.\" Natelson, Baude, and I all recognized Tillman's gift: he sees what us moderns cannot. And Tillman saw all of this long before Trump came on the scene. His position has remained consistent for some time. I am grateful to have worked so closely with Seth for the past seven years or so.\n\nNatelson explains that our position about \"Officers of the United States\" and \"Office under the United States\" is \"back[ed] . . . up with a fair amount of proof.\" Natelson highlights six items.\n\nFirst , the phrase \"Office under the United States,\" Natelson writes, \"was the obvious successor to the extremely common British term 'office under the Crown.'\" And this phrase has for centuries refered only to appointed positions. Natelson observes that \"[a]s former subjects of the British Empire, members of the founding generation had heard and used that expression all their lives.\" It may be that people today are unfamiliar with this phrase. But, Natelson reminds us, \"We must never assume the Constitution's ratifiers didn't understand a legal phrase in a legal document as important, as closely examined, and as widely discussed as the Constitution.\" (Tillman and I discuss the phrase \"Office under the Crown\" in Part IV of our ten-part series.)\n\nSecond , Natelson focused on the Commissions Clause, which provides that president \"shall Commission all the Officers of the United States.\" He observes that \"commissioning yourself\" would be \"awkward.\" Natelson writes that \"no one has ever seriously suggested that the president must commission himself or other elected officials.\" Well, that's not exactly right. More than a decade ago, Professor Sai Prakash suggested that the President should commission himself and that such commissions may exist. Prakash wrote , \"That no physical evidence of such a commission exists, however, certainly does not prove that the President never issued one.\" I do not know if Prakash still holds that position. Professors Calabresi and Attorney General Mukasey have also cited the Commissions Clause as proof that the President is not an \"Officer of the United States.\" Natelson likewise observes that \"the president must not be an 'Officer of the United States.'\" (Tillman and I discuss the Commissions Clause in Part III of our ten-part series.)\n\nThird , Natelson points to the Impeachment Clause, which authorizes impeachment of \"The President, Vice President and all civil Officers of the United States.\" He writes that \"If the president and vice president were officers of the United States, there would be no need to list them separately.\" Again, this position is not new. Justice Story articulated this same textualist argument in his Commentaries .\n\nFourth , Natelson observes that \"[t]he Constitution treats the oaths of the president and members of Congress separately from the oaths of 'Officers of the United States.'\" The Article VI Oaths Clause provides oaths for \"Officers of the United States.\" The President does not fall in the aegis of this language. This fact is supported by the fact that he has a separate oath provision in Article II. (This argument stands apart from whether an oath to \"support\" the Constitution is distinct from an oath to \"protect and defend\" the Constitution.)\n\nFifth , Natelson turns to the Foreign Emoluments Clause, which applies to those who hold an \"Office . . . under the United States.\" Natelson, relying on Tillman's scholarship, remarks that \"President George Washington accepted such gifts without any public objection,\" as did Thomas Jefferson. Natelson concludes that this history \"suggests that the members of the founding generation didn't think of the president as an 'Office under the United States.'\"\n\nSixth , Natelson points to the Hamilton document from 1791. He observed that \"Hamilton's list included all appointed positions. It excluded all elected ones, including the presidency.\" We have said enough about the Hamilton document. And to our knowledge, no one has responded to our analysis. Natelson acknowledges that \"the Tillman-Blackman evidence from the 1790s does have the virtue of being uncontradicted.\"\n\nNext, Natelson turns to the Fourteenth Amendment. He observes that Section 3 uses the same phrases that are used in the Constitution of 1788: \"Officers of the United States\" and \"Office under the United States.\" And he offers a rule of legal interpretation: \"when an amendment uses a word or phrase from the original Constitution, we should presume that the amenders used the phrase the same way the original Constitution does.\" This approach should not be controversial. In Heller , Justice Scalia interpreted the phrase \"keep and bear arms\" in the Second Amendment by looking to \"historical background,\" including similar provisions in the English Bill of Rights and the early state constitution. Applying this rule, Natelson writes, \"suggests that 'office under the United States' in the 14th Amendment means the same thing as in the original Constitution.\" He adds, to his \"there's no strong evidence to the contrary.\" Natelson concludes, \"the president isn't an \"officer under the United States\" in the original Constitution, then he's not one in the 14th Amendment, either.\" And, Tillman and I have explained, in the Constitution of 1788 and Section 3, the phrase \"Officers of the United States\" does not include elected officials.\n\n***\n\nNatelson responds to the charge from the Colorado Supreme Court, and Professors Baude and Paulsen, that the Blackman/Tillman position amounts to a \"secret code.\" Rather, Natelson explains, the Framers of the Constitution \"were highly skilled legal drafters who knew what they were doing.\" The Constitution has \"no 'secret' meanings-even if modern writers ignorant of 18th-century conditions might think it did.\"\n\nIn recent months, former-Attorney General Mukasey and Professor Steve Calabresi have advanced our position: that the President is not an \"Officer of the United States.\" Now, Rob Natelson has joined the fray. There is no \"secret code.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Interesting Fifth Circuit Denial of Qualified Immunity to Police Officers\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nQualified Immunity\n\nEugene Volokh | 5.4.2024 2:09 PM\n\nFrom Hughes v. Few , decided yesterday by Judge Andrew Oldham, joined by Judges E. Grady Jolly and Kurt Engelhardt; for the details, read the opinion itself:\n\nFor those who worry that qualified immunity can be invoked under absurd circumstances: Buckle up.\n\nAustin Thompson Hughes is a Good Samaritan. After 2:30 a.m., Hughes called 911 to report a pickup truck swerving violently across a four-lane highway in Houston. While Hughes was on the phone with emergency dispatchers, the drunk driver crashed. Still on the phone with 911, Hughes pulled behind the drunk driver and effectuated a citizen's arrest in accordance with Texas law. But when police officers arrived at the scene, they let the drunk driver go and then arrested Good Samaritan Hughes. (Seriously.) Piling insanity on irrationality, the officers then charged Hughes with a felony for impersonating a peace officer. Hughes spent thousands of dollars defending against the frivolous criminal charges before the City of Houston dropped them. Then Hughes brought this § 1983 suit against the two officers who victimized him. The district court denied qualified immunity. We affirm. (Obviously.) ...\n\nIn the context of split-second excessive force cases, the Supreme Court has \"repeatedly told courts not to define clearly established law at too high a level of generality.\" That is so because in the typical excessive-force case, officers must make life-or-death split-second decisions, often at night or in the chaos of a deadly chase or both. This case does not involve excessive force, or split-second decisions, or the chaos of a chase. Rather, it involves a simple, clearly established rule that all officers should know at all times under Franks and Winfrey : Do not lie....\n\nAll told, Garcia's affidavit made at least eight material misstatements or omissions. Any reasonable officer would have known, based on the evidence available, that the affidavit contained these errors. Hughes therefore sufficiently pleaded Garcia violated his clearly established Fourth Amendment rights by producing and submitting the affidavit....\n\nThe only evidence suggesting Hughes ever impersonated a law enforcement officer-thus the only evidence that could possibly have established probable cause-came from the drunk driver's statement. As discussed above, the drunk driver reportedly told Officers Few and Garcia that Hughes had claimed to be a police officer. But even the officers' counsel admitted that this assertion came in the midst of the drunk driver's \"crazy statement[s].\" Given the vast inconsistencies (indeed, impossibilities) reflected in both versions of the drunk driver's statement, the driver's obvious intoxication, and the evidence supporting Hughes's account, no reasonable officer could have suspected Hughes committed a felony. Therefore, a corrected warrant affidavit could not have established probable cause to arrest and prosecute Hughes....\n\nThanks to Jay Horowitz for the pointer.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Maryland Cop Who Recklessly Shot a 5-Year-Old Boy Got Qualified Immunity\n\nQualified Immunity\n\nJacob Sullum | 1.13.2025 4:40 PM\n\nDuring an August 2016 standoff with an armed woman at an apartment in Baltimore County, Maryland, a police officer fired his rifle through an interior wall into the kitchen. The bullet struck the woman, Korryn Gaines, in the upper back, then ricocheted off the refrigerator, striking her 5-year-old son, Kodi, in the cheek.\n\nThe officer, Baltimore County Cpl. Royce Ruby, later testified that he fired the \"head shot\" without a clear view of Gaines, saying he could see only her braids and the barrel of the shotgun through his rifle scope. He also said he could not see Kodi but knew that he was in the kitchen and that \"there's a possibility\" the boy would be hit by the bullet. A witness testified that Gaines, explaining his decision to take the shot, described himself as \"hot\" and \"frustrated.\"\n\nIt was understandable that Ruby was hot. The police had cut off power to the apartment building, which was sweltering without air conditioning. It was also understandable that he was frustrated. At that point, the standoff, during which more than 30 officers surrounded the building, had dragged on for more than six hours. Police had been told that Gaines \"had a history of mental illness and that she had been off her medication,\" as the Maryland Supreme Court later noted . \"Officers testified that Ms. Gaines acted erratically, sometimes negotiating with officers, at other times threatening them and cutting off contact.\"\n\nIt is harder to fathom why Ruby decided to fire his rifle even though he recognized that he was endangering a little boy and even though he was not facing an \"imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.\" The Maryland Supreme Court accepted that Gaines \"may have raised her shotgun\" but \"was not aiming it directly toward officers.\" It nevertheless ruled that Ruby was entitled to qualified immunity, which shields police officers from federal civil rights claims unless their alleged misconduct violated \"clearly established\" rights.\n\nBased on that conclusion, the court overturned $32 million in damages that a jury had awarded Kodi. The boy's father, Corey Cunningham, is now asking the U.S. Supreme Court to review the Maryland Supreme Court's decision. \"Obviously unlawful conduct alone clearly establishes the law such that qualified immunity does not apply,\" his petition argues, citing Supreme Court precedents to that effect. \"Conduct that is so egregious and obviously unlawful as to shock the conscience necessarily forecloses qualified immunity.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court, the Cato Institute notes in a brief supporting Cunningham's petition, \"has held that some rights violations are sufficiently obvious to violate clearly established law even without factually similar precedent.\" It urges the justices to clarify that a court should not grant qualified immunity to \"a police officer who committed a conscience-shocking rights violation simply because it could find no prior decision involving nearly identical facts.\" In this case, Cato says, \"it is self-evident that the officer's conscience-shocking conduct violated the right of Kodi, an innocent bystander, to be free from arbitrary state action.\"\n\nThe deadly encounter with Gaines began after she failed to appear in court for alleged traffic violations. Trying to serve a warrant for her arrest, two Baltimore County police officers knocked on the door of her apartment and announced themselves. Getting no response, they kicked in the door and saw Gaines sitting on the floor with a shotgun in her lap. She remained armed but contained throughout the standoff.\n\nBefore he fired his rifle, Ruby claimed, he saw Gaines \"raise her shotgun into a firing position and aim toward the hinge side of the front door, from which she could have hit officers stationed on the other side.\" But that account, the Maryland Supreme Court noted, was inconsistent with Ruby's testimony that \"all he could see through his scope were Ms. Gaines's braids and the barrel of the gun.\" Other witnesses \"testified that more of her body would have been visible had she been aiming the gun as Corporal Ruby contended.\"\n\nAfter Ruby fired his rifle, thereby injuring Kodi as well as his mother, he entered the apartment. Hearing \"the shotgun go off and being reloaded,\" he shot Gaines three more times, killing her. One of his rounds again struck Kodi, who this time was hit in his elbow. Kodi \"underwent multiple surgeries to remove bullet fragments from his face\" and \"required multiple reconstructive surgeries on his elbow.\"\n\nWhen Ruby first opened fire, Cato's brief notes, he did so \"without any imminent threat to life or limb.\" Because \"he was 'hot and frustrated,'\" he \"fired his rifle through the wall of a kitchen where he knew a five-year-old child...was present but not visible.\" Ruby \"admitted to knowing that his first shot could hit Kodi.\"\n\nDespite those facts, the Maryland Supreme Court concluded \"it was not clearly established that Corporal Ruby would violate Kodi's right to substantive due process under the Fourteenth Amendment\" by firing his rifle in these circumstances. The court conceded that \"'clearly established' does not mean that there must be a case with precisely matching facts or that found a violation in the same specific context.\" But its subsequent analysis seemed to require just that.\n\n\"Although it is 'possible' that sufficiently 'reckless and irresponsible' actions like 'shooting into a crowd at close range' could rise to the level of a Fourteenth Amendment violation,\" the court said, \"the parties have cited no case decided by the time of the shooting here that had reached such a conclusion....At the time of the shooting, no decision from any appellate court in the country-much less a controlling decision or 'a robust consensus of persuasive authority,' had held that an officer who took action similar to that of Corporal Ruby violated the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\n\nDissenting Justice Michele Hotten saw things differently. \"This case is a catastrophic example of poor decision-making and the overzealous exercise of state-sanctioned force,\" she wrote . \"The decision by an officer to shoot through a wall, at a target he could not see, when he knew a child was on the other side of that wall and could be injured or killed, is patently offensive to a 'universal sense of justice.'...As made clear by the facts, the shooting of Ms. Gaines and the injury to Kodi were unnecessary, avoidable, and legally unjustifiable. At best, this decision joins an ever-increasing line of cases in which few, if any, abusive exercises of state power are deemed violative of a person's Substantive Due Process rights. At worst, this case serves to justify future shootings by police, taken in frustration and in disregard to the risk posed to known bystanders.\"\n\nThe majority's position on qualified immunity illustrates a baffling situation that 5th Circuit Judge Don Willett has decried . \"To some observers,\" he wrote in a 2019 case, \"qualified immunity smacks of unqualified impunity, letting public officials duck consequences for bad behavior-no matter how palpably unreasonable-as long as they were the first to behave badly.\"\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch noted the same danger as a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit. \"Some things are so obviously unlawful that they don't require detailed explanation,\" Gorsuch wrote in a 2015 case, \"and sometimes the most obviously unlawful things happen so rarely that a case on point is itself an unusual thing. Indeed, it would be remarkable if the most obviously unconstitutional conduct should be the most immune from liability only because it is so flagrantly unlawful that few dare its attempt.\"\n\nBased on similar concerns, the Supreme Court has said that alleging a violation of \"clearly established\" law does not necessarily require locating a precedent with closely similar facts. The issue, it explained in the 2002 case Hope v. Pelzer , is not whether the \"very action in question has previously been held unlawful\" but whether officials had \"fair warning that their alleged [misconduct] was unconstitutional.\" In Hope , the Court deemed it \"obvious\" that handcuffing a shirtless prisoner to a hitching post for seven hours in the hot sun violated the Eighth Amendment's ban on \"cruel and unusual\" punishment.\n\nThe Court reiterated that qualified immunity does not apply to \"obvious\" constitutional violations in the 2020 case Taylor v. Riojas , which involved a Texas prisoner who was confined in \"a pair of shockingly unsanitary cells.\" One \"was covered, nearly floor to ceiling, in 'massive amounts' of feces\"; the other was \"frigidly cold\" and \"equipped with only a clogged drain in the floor to dispose of bodily wastes.\"\n\nAlthough Hope and Taylor \"both involved Eighth Amendment claims, their holdings are general,\" Cato notes. Yet \"persistent confusion about the obviousness exception in qualified immunity doctrine has engendered analytical inconsistency and avoidable injustices, like the one that occurred in this case.\"\n\nThe Maryland Supreme Court's \"erroneous approach-granting qualified immunity simply because there is no case exactly on point, no matter how manifestly unlawful the rights violation-is regrettably common in the lower courts,\" Cato says. It cites cases where cops or jailers received qualified immunity after shooting a 10-year-old boy in the leg \"while attempting to shoot an unthreatening family dog\"; after stealing $225,000 in cash and rare coins while executing a search warrant; and after putting a prisoner in solitary confinement for five months \"because he asked why he could not visit the commissary.\" To prevent such outrageous outcomes, Cato says, the Supreme Court \"should reaffirm that Hope and Taylor apply to any case involving obvious rights violations.\"\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "What the Prosecution of Chauvin's Fellow Officers Could Look Like\n\nLaws that progressives want to see reformed could make convictions more likely, though it will be a challenge.\n\nAfter initially charging only Officer Derek Chauvin, Minnesota prosecutors subsequently added charges against the other three officers present at the scene of George Floyd's death. Officers Thomas Lane, J. Alexander Kueng, and Tou Thao are charged as accomplices to second-degree felony murder and second-degree manslaughter. For complicated reasons, unlike Chauvin they are not charged with third-degree murder, though that charge could still be added later.\n\nGiven their more limited roles in the offense, the charges against the other three officers will be harder to prove than those against Chauvin. And the charges, while legally valid under Minnesota law, rely on some fringe doctrines of accomplice liability. These doctrines, which have long been criticized by progressive reformers, create expansive strict liability for minor participants in group crimes. Even with those doctrines, the charges against Lane, Kueng, and Thao are at the outer edge of permissible enforcement of accomplice liability. I previously described the charges against Chauvin and wrote about the challenges of prosecuting him. As a matter of trial strategy, the case against the other three will be even more complicated because most of the jurors' outrage will be directed at Chauvin.\n\nIt should be noted that the other officers may never go to trial. These charges could be a precursor to a plea deal, whereby at least one of the officers will agree to reduced charges in exchange for testifying against Chauvin. It is already clear that the officers here will not hide behind the blue wall of silence: At a preliminary hearing last Friday, attorneys for Lane and Kueng made clear that their defense will involve placing all the blame on Chauvin. (Thao, by contrast, may stick by his partner, at least for the moment.) Lane and Kueng might be willing to reach a deal, perhaps for a reduced charge of manslaughter or assault.\n\nThe vast majority of American criminal cases end in plea bargains, but this isn't a normal case. It's hard to negotiate compromises when the whole world is watching. Attorney General Keith Ellison is under a great deal of political pressure to throw the book at all these officers. Even a negotiated reduction to manslaughter would seem far too lenient to many activists. On the other side, the officers are probably being advised by their attorneys that they have a good chance of winning at trial. They may also be reluctant to admit to a crime that they honestly believe they did not commit.\n\nA mutually acceptable plea bargain will be hard to come by. We may be in for a messy trial-or trials-where jurors have to try to assess relative blame in accordance with the intricacies of accomplice liability .\n\nAccomplice liability is responsibility for helping someone else commit a crime-that is, for \"aiding and abetting\" a crime. Imagine two guys rob a bank together, with one going in and sticking up the teller while the other waits in the getaway car. Both are guilty of bank robbery. The guy who goes inside with the gun is guilty as the \"principal,\" or primary actor, while the getaway driver is guilty as an accomplice. Importantly, and somewhat counterintuitively, both can be charged with the same crimes and given the same punishment. In for a penny, in for a pound.\n\nStated simply, accomplice liability has an act requirement and an intent requirement . The accomplice must provide some act of assistance and also intend to assist the crime.\n\nAs for the act requirement, in general the failure to act is not a crime. As the Minnesota Supreme Court has stated, mere presence at the scene of a crime and passive acquiescence are insufficient. Some have suggested officers have a duty to protect citizens, and so officers should be held to a higher standard-they should be guilty for failing to stop a crime. That may be true as a moral matter, but it is not a legal principle that has been adopted in Minnesota. While the Minneapolis Police Department does have a duty-to-intervene policy, a violation of that internal policy is not in and of itself a crime. There is no Minnesota statute or case stating that officers can be liable as accomplices merely for failing to intervene in another person's crime. Some affirmative act of assistance is required.\n\nIn general in American law, any act of assistance, no matter how small, is sufficient. The bar in Minnesota is arguably somewhat higher. In a leading case called Ulvinen , a mother repeatedly encouraged her son to kill his wife, then stood guard while he dismembered the body, then helped him fabricate an alibi to police. The jury convicted her of being an accomplice to murder, but the Minnesota Supreme Court reversed the conviction. It held that accomplice liability requires a \"high level of activity\" on the part of the accomplice, something that makes it possible for the principal to commit a crime he couldn't have completed on his own. On the other hand, the same court has also stated in other cases that presence combined with intent is sufficient-which, if true, means there's no act requirement at all. The law here is a bit of a mess since our courts haven't been entirely consistent, and our standard jury instructions arguably do not state the law correctly.\n\nTurning to the intent requirement, the jury will be instructed that, in order to find the other three officers guilty, it will have to find that they \"knew Chauvin was going to commit or was committing a crime.\" It will also have to find that they \"intended that their presence or actions aid the commission of a crime.\"\n\nKnowledge alone does not establish intent. If a gas station attendant sells gas to the bank robbers on their way to the crime, she is not guilty of being an accomplice-even if, for example, she overhears them talking about their plans and knows what they're up to. An accomplice must also have intent, or a stake in the venture, as the United States Supreme Court has suggested. In addition to knowing about the crime, an accomplice must also want the crime to succeed.\n\nStarting with these basic principles of accomplice liability, in order to find someone guilty of murder, a jury would have to find both that the accomplice provided some act of assistance and also that he wanted the victim to die. If those basic principles were the whole story, charging the other officers as accomplices to murder would not be possible.\n\nThe basic principles, however, are not the whole story. Minnesota has supplemented the basics with some doctrines of expansive liability that make it easier to convict accomplices of greater offenses.\n\nFirst, Minnesota has adopted by statute the natural and probable consequences doctrine . Under that doctrine, if an accomplice intentionally aids one crime, he can also be held liable for any additional crimes that flow from that, so long as they are reasonably foreseeable. Back to our bank robbers-if the principal inside the bank cracks a guard in the head with the butt of his gun, both he and the getaway driver can be convicted of assault. The getaway driver aided and abetted the robbery, and although he didn't intend to aid an assault, he can be found guilty anyway because it was a foreseeable consequence of the first crime.\n\nUnder that principle, the other three officers could be liable if they aided Chauvin in committing a lesser offense, and then he committed some additional offense that was a reasonably foreseeable result of the initial offense.\n\nSecond, the felony murder doctrine , which I discussed last week, itself creates expansive liability. If the other officers either committed or aided an underlying felony-here an assault-they can be found guilty of murder if a death, even an unintentional death, results from that felony. In Minnesota, moreover, because felony assault it itself a partial strict liability offense, felony murder does not even require intent to commit a felony. An intent to commit or aid a misdemeanor assault is sufficient. Minnesota may be the only American jurisdiction where a simple misdemeanor assault can get bootstrapped all the way up to murder.\n\nThe interaction between these two principles of expansive liability is complicated. The bottom line will be that in order to find the other three officers guilty as charged, the jury will have to find that they intended to aid or commit an assault, and that Floyd's death was a foreseeable consequence of their initial crime. These doctrines of expansive liability essentially relieve the prosecution from proving the usual intent required for murder.\n\nNote again that these doctrines of expansive liability are controversial and have been rejected by some jurisdictions. They were disavowed by the highly influential Model Penal Code, drafted in the mid-20th century by the American Law Institute. In Minnesota law, however, these doctrines remain firmly embedded. Minnesota generally applies something close to strict liability for aggravated and additional offenses. If you shove someone and he trips and cracks his skull, you can be liable for aggravated assault even if you didn't intend that degree of injury. If you are selling drugs within a few hundred feet of a school, you can be liable for an aggravated drug offense even if you had no idea a school was nearby. Minnesota criminal law has taken the \"in for a penny, in for a pound\" principle to a rather extreme degree. Collectively, these doctrines allow prosecutors to obtain long sentences for relatively minor crimes.\n\nThe doctrines of expansive liability are the foundation of the prosecution against the other three officers. An irony of this case is that the expansive liability doctrines, which progressive lawyers and academics have sought to reform for years, are now necessary to a high-profile prosecution that is demanded by progressive activists and pursued by a progressive attorney general. For better or worse-worse, I'd say-they will become even more deeply entrenched in Minnesota law as a result.\n\nEven employing those fringe doctrines, a successful prosecution here will not be simple. How this will all play out at trial will depend a great deal on whether the defendants are tried together or separately. Whether to seek joint or separate trials will be one of the most important strategic decisions faced by the parties.\n\nIn many American jurisdictions, joint trials are the norm in multi-defendant cases. Federal law, for example, mandates a strong presumption of joint trials. Minnesota, by contrast, has rejected that approach. Our rules of criminal procedure differ from the federal rules, and our Supreme Court has stated: \"Minnesota, unlike the federal system, has a historical preference for separate trials.\" Once again the case law is somewhat inconsistent, but in general, separate trials are favored where defendants present antagonistic defense-that is, where each defendant in a case tries to blame the others. That looks to be exactly what will happen in this case.\n\nA joint trial could be supremely chaotic. There would be five parties present and five competing theories of the case. Imagine four defense attorneys, rather than one, cross-examining the state's medical expert. A joint trial would also involve a lot of confusing instructions to the jury, such as: \"Members of the jury, you are about to hear evidence that you may only consider as to one defendant. You must ignore it as to the other defendants.\" More generally, given the nature of the antagonistic defenses, the trial would play out something like a circular firing squad. A jury might hate them all and convict all four. Or, given all the competing accusations, it might not be sure of anything beyond a reasonable doubt and therefore acquit them all. Joint trials are messy.\n\nSeparate trials could be cleaner, but might make an acquittal more likely, especially for the three officers charged as accomplices. It is easier to blame someone who isn't in the room. If the other three officers are tried separately from Chauvin, they will be able to attack him even more relentlessly. He won't be there to defend himself, and the prosecution will be put in the somewhat awkward position of saying \"It's not all Chauvin's fault.\"\n\nRegardless of whether the defendants are tried jointly or separately, the jury (or juries) will be told to consider each defendant separately. No defendant's guilt is legally dependent on any other's. Technically, that means that a jury could acquit Chauvin but convict one or more of the others. As a practical matter, though, that is extraordinarily unlikely. Formal legal rules aside, jurors use common sense, and they care about apportioning blame. Even at a separate trial for the accused accomplices, Chauvin will remain the center of attention, as the other officers try to paint him as a villain who acted alone.\n\nMy guess is that at least two of the defendants, Kueng and Lane, will move for separate trials. The prosecution could oppose that motion, but doing so risks creating a substantial issue for appeal if they were convicted at a joint trial. The strategic calculus is complicated all around.\n\nThe other three officers will have some plausible defenses to the charges. They will argue that although they were present and perhaps acquiesced in Chauvin's conduct, they didn't provide a sufficient level of assistance to be convicted as accomplices. They will also argue that they lacked the requisite intent. They'll argue that they didn't intend to assault Floyd, much less kill him.\n\nRemember, even under Minnesota's expansive liability doctrines, the other officers must at least have intended to commit some initial predicate crime. The prosecution will still have to prove that each of them-as individuals-intended to aid or commit a criminal assault. Given that police officers are allowed to use some force to effectuate an arrest, that will not be easy to show.\n\nLegal doctrines aside, their defense will boil down to a simple proposition: Blame Chauvin. The video evidence will loom large here. Just as that evidence will be the most powerful evidence to convict Chauvin, it could also be the most powerful evidence to acquit the others. The video shows Chauvin kneeling on Floyd's neck, with a look of (at best) indifference on his face the whole time, even as Floyd begged for life and then died. In the video footage, Lane and Kueng can be seen assisting in the restraint by kneeling on Floyd's back, but their conduct at least appears less egregious. They are also less visible, so it will be harder for the jury to assess what they were doing or thinking.\n\nEspecially if tried separately, I'd expect the accused accomplice officers to take the stand in their own defense. They will express deep remorse for Floyd's death. They will express outrage at Chauvin's conduct, but they will testify that in the heat of the moment, they didn't know what to do to stop it. That is particularly true for the two rookie cops, who were operating under MPD's famously regimented hierarchy. Lane, moreover, will be able to testify that he did try to stop it, repeatedly asking Chauvin to get off Floyd and roll him on his side, but Chauvin refused. Those statements are audibly recorded. Kueng's attorney has also stated that he tried to intervene, unsuccessfully. Both of them will testify that they didn't intend to commit a crime, any crime, including the lesser crime of assault that can be bootstrapped up to murder in Minnesota.\n\nOf course they should have done more. They should have pulled Chauvin off, or at least insisted more forcefully. But while their failure to do so might make them bad cops and bad people, it doesn't make them accomplices to murder.\n\nThe officers will also have the option of calling character witnesses. And make no mistake, whatever you think of their conduct that day, these other officers are somewhat sympathetic characters. Officer Kueng, for example, is a young African-American man who was only on his third shift as a Minneapolis officer. He is a youth sports coach. Lane does volunteer work mentoring Somali kids. They don't exactly fit the profile of jaded, hardened cops bent on oppressing citizens of color.\n\nI wrote last week that the charges against Chauvin, while not a certainty, are likely to result in a homicide conviction. Convictions of the other three officers are less likely, due to their apparently limited role in the offense and the nature of the video evidence. Personally, I am also less sure that the charges against the other three officers are just.\n\nThe desire for retribution is a powerful and deep-seated human emotion. Crime causes immeasurable pain, and the victims of crime-as well as their families and friends and allies-want punishment. Often they want the most severe punishment possible. You can see that dynamic playing out here. The initial charges against Chauvin were criticized as too weak, so the lead prosecutor was replaced, and the new lead prosecutor added new charges against Chauvin and the other three. Many have said these new charges are still not enough, and have encouraged even more severe charges, including first-degree murder (even though such a charge would be highly dubious under existing Minnesota law).\n\nThe emotions underlying the calls for justice are more than understandable. Witnessing a horrible incident like George Floyd's death makes us want someone to be punished. But in a system devoted to the rule of law, the desire for retribution must be checked. Just because we want to convict these guys doesn't mean it's a good idea to abandon existing limitations on first-degree murder or accomplice liability-any more than it would be a good idea to abandon the beyond a reasonable doubt standard. Don't forget that the excessive desire for retribution is part of what drove the American criminal justice system for the last half-century. The great American crime wave of the '80s and '90s led to a torrent of retributive outrage and bipartisan demands for stricter criminal justice policies. ( See, e.g ., Biden, Joseph.) That political climate caused a one-way ratchet effect of more criminal laws, broader definitions of crimes, expansive liability doctrines, and increased sentences.\n\nThat is what got us 2 million people in prison, and they are disproportionately people of color.\n\nCriminal justice reform is necessary, and that should mean more than reforming or defunding the police. It should mean reforming the substantive criminal law itself. It should mean reducing sentences rather than clamoring for ever-more prison time. It should mean narrowing definitions of some offenses even if that means some bad people get off easy occasionally. And it should mean abolishing fringy doctrines of expansive liability-such as Minnesota's assault-felony-murder doctrine. In short, to achieve real criminal justice reform, the ratchet needs to turn the other direction. This prosecution won't help.\n\nThe implicit message from progressives now is: \"What comes around goes around. Excessive prosecutorial tactics have been used against poor minority people in the past, and now with progressives like Keith Ellison in power, we can use those same tactics against instruments of oppression.\" I'm not sure that will work out well in the long run. I'd prefer not to use aggressive prosecutorial tactics against anyone. An eye for an eye leaves everyone blind.\n\nThe case against the other officers is somewhat marginal, both on the law and the facts. Whatever the jury decides, I hope we all remember that the cause of criminal justice reform is more important than the result in this case. Locking a few more humans in cages will not create the systematic reform we need. Justice for George should mean much more than just sending these four cops to prison.\n\nPhotograph of Keith Ellison by Scott Olson/Getty Images.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "What a Decades-Old Experiment Can Teach Us About Derek Chauvin and George Floyd\n\nStanley Milgram discovered that obedience to authority has a powerful hold.\n\nIt has been 60 years since Yale social psychologist Stanley Milgram conducted his famous experiment on obedience to authority, but the trial of Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin on multiple criminal charges, including third-degree murder, for the death of George Floyd has given us new reason to look back at Milgram's experiment .\n\nChauvin's trial will determine what, if any, legal responsibility he bears for the death last May 25 of Floyd. Milgram's experiment leads us to a more difficult question: How was a single police officer, Derek Chauvin, able to kneel on Floyd's neck for more than eight minutes without being effectively challenged by the other police officers on the scene?\n\nMilgram began his experiment in July 1961, the same month that the trial in Jerusalem of Adolf Eichmann, a high-ranking Nazi official who played a key role in transporting Jews to German extermination camps, started. Milgram's experiment was designed to show how willing people were to obey authority even when what was asked of them was cruel. Eichmann's trial dovetailed with Milgram's concerns. The colorless Eichmann's actions were the classic example of what the historian Hannah Arendt in her account of the trial, Eichmann in Jerusalem, called the \"banality of evil,\" and in his 1974 book, Obedience to Authority , Milgram paid tribute to Arendt, noting that the concept of the banality of evil \"comes closer to the truth than one might dare imagine.\"\n\nMilgram's experiment consisted of taking volunteers and dividing them into the roles of teacher and learner. The division was planned so that the volunteer always ended up as teacher, while the learner was a paid participant. The volunteer was instructed by the experimenter to give electric shocks to the learner (a paid participant) for wrong answers. How far would the teacher go in obeying the experimenter was the issue Milgram focused on. The answer was very far-a conclusion consistent with that of subsequent Milgram-like studies.\n\nThe learner was placed in an adjacent room, and as the test progressed was given increasingly large, fake shocks. At 75 volts the learner was instructed to start to scream. From 150 volts to 330 volts the learner was instructed to scream with increasing intensity. After that, the teacher's questions were met by silence. In the end 65 percent of the teachers continued to shock the learner up to the maximum 450 volts.\n\nWhat makes the Milgram experiment especially relevant to Chauvin's trial is the nature of Floyd's death. He was not killed by a panicky policeman firing his gun. Nor was he killed by an angry policeman in a rage. Floyd's death, like Milgram's experiment, played out over time and for that reason has seemed particularly horrifying.\n\nAccording to the official charge statement filed in district court against Chauvin, he had his knee on Floyd's neck for 8 minutes and 46 seconds, and for 2 minutes and 53 seconds of this time, Floyd was unresponsive. Chauvin and the three other policemen on the scene were not forced into a rushed decision on how to treat the handcuffed Floyd.\n\nIn the case of Chauvin, we will have to wait for his trial to learn more about his thinking during his encounter with Floyd. What is clear from the video of the scene is that Chauvin ignored Floyd's multiple cries of \"I can't breathe,\" just as the teachers in the Milgram experiment ignored the cries of pain from the actors playing the learner. But there is a key additional element at work in Minneapolis, where Chauvin's impact on the other police officers on the scene parallels that of the Milgram experimenters who were able to influence various teachers to ignore the learner's cries of pain.\n\nThe official charge description in the Floyd case points out there was discussion of how to treat Floyd among the police on the scene. When officer Thomas Lane asks Chauvin, \"Should we roll him on his side?\" Chauvin says no, and when Lane then says, \"I am worried about excited delirium or whatever,\" Chauvin again brushes him off, saying, \"That's why we have him on his stomach.\"\n\nAfter this exchange, neither Lane nor two other officers who were present, J. Alexander Kueng and Tou Thao, tried to intervene on Floyd's behalf. Lane was on his fourth day on the force and Keung just his third . Chauvin, a 19-year police veteran, was deferred to as an authority figure rather than regarded as a peer. As the charge description notes, \"None of the three officers moved from their positions.\"\n\nMight Floyd still be alive if the three other policemen on the scene, now charged with aiding and abetting Chauvin, had refused to go along with Chauvin's actions? We can only guess. The Milgram experiment helps us see that in police departments in which racism-covert or overt-exists having police officers willing and able to intervene when racial abuse occurs is crucial.

      "text": "The Awful Realities of the Breonna Taylor Case\n\nThe grand jury's decision might have been proper, but the laws that led the police to violently enter her home and confront her armed boyfriend are unjust.\n\nYesterday a grand jury in Kentucky refused to charge the officers who killed Breonna Taylor. This result was both lawful and deeply unjust. Let me explain why.\n\nIn August, I wrote an extended newsletter called \" Supreme Court Precedent Killed Breonna Taylor .\" It was a bold headline and a bold claim, but both were justified. The court's precedent had created the legal cover for police tactics that placed police and lawfully armed citizens on a violent collision course-one that has resulted in tragic deaths before, and (unless the law is changed) will result in tragic deaths again.\n\nI don't want to rehash the entire argument, but the essence is this: In a series of opinions reaching back more than two decades, the Supreme Court has permitted the use of no-knock police raids not just to preserve life, but also to preserve evidence . It has also granted officers specific legal privileges even when they've violated citizens' constitutional rights, including, a) exemptions from the exclusionary rule (which blocks the use of unlawfully obtained evidence in criminal trials) for raids that violate knock-and-announce requirements and, b) exemptions from attempts to impose heightened obligations for the use of force when officers are violating the Fourth Amendment by unlawfully intruding in a citizen's own home.\n\nPolice departments across the country have taken advantage of this wide latitude. They've sought no-knock warrants liberally. They've blurred the line between no-knock and knock-and-announce with \"quick knock\" practices. And they've engaged in surprise, late-night violent entries into private dwellings for the sole purpose of preserving evidence.\n\nNow, let's compare this line of precedent with a different series of laws, including a key SCOTUS case. In District of Columbia v. Heller , the court held that citizens have an individual constitutional right to keep a handgun in their home for their personal defense. Other states, including Kentucky , go farther and have enacted laws recognizing the so-called \"castle doctrine\" and stand-your-ground laws. At the risk of oversimplifying these doctrines, they in general hold that a person does not have a duty to retreat when he is lawfully present in a place and he reasonably believes he faces an imminent threat of death or serious bodily harm.\n\nTo be clear, castle doctrine statutes often explicitly state that individuals do not have the right to shoot police officers who attempt to enter a dwelling in the pursuit of their official duties, but there's a caveat-the person prohibited from \"using force\" must know or \"reasonably should have known\" that the person entering was a cop.\n\nDo you see how these doctrines create virtually inevitable armed clashes? In the darkness and confusion of a violent entry, a homeowner may not know who is charging straight into his house. If he can't reasonably and immediately (we're talking about mere seconds at issue) know that he's facing police officers executing a warrant, he has a right under the law to open fire.\n\nAt the same time, when the police are performing their official duties-even if they're at the wrong house or even if the warrant itself is unlawful-they also have the right to open fire if they reasonably perceive a mortal threat. Thus, a gun battle can commence with both parties acting completely lawfully .\n\nIs this what happened in Breonna Taylor's case? It appears so.\n\nThanks to extraordinary reporting from the New York Times's Rukmini Callimachi , we now have a much better picture of what happened on the terrible, fatal early morning hours of March 13, 2020. Let's break down the key elements step-by-step.\n\n1. The police obtained a no-knock warrant to raid Taylor's apartment based on allegations thata suspected drug dealer named Jamarcus Glover had received packages at Taylor's home (Glover and Taylor had a previous relationship). The police sought the no-knock warrant out of a desire to preserve evidence.\n\n2. Before the warrant was served, the police were directed to knock and announce rather than execute the warrant without knocking. At approximately 12:40 a.m. on March 13, the police pounded on Taylor's door. Taylor was inside with her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker. He lawfully possessed a handgun.\n\n3. At this point the facts are in dispute. Police claim that they knocked and announced they were police. A witness corroborates this account, but other witnesses dispute it, claiming they never heard the cops identify themselves. Walker claims that he was startled by the pounding, asked who was there, never heard a response, and was worried that it might be Glover. So he grabbed his gun.\n\n4. The police then broke down the door to enter the apartment. Walker and Taylor saw them in the darkness, and Walker fired a single shot, striking one officer in the leg, severing his femoral artery and gravely injuring him. Under the available evidence (Walker hadn't heard the police identify themselves and unknown individuals were violently entering his home), Walker had a legal right to shoot at the intruders, even if they were police .\n\n5. At the same time, the instant the officers saw that Walker was pointing his gun at them-and certainly when he pulled the trigger- they had their own legal right to shoot back . They were performing their official duties, and an armed man was quite plainly placing them in immediate, mortal danger.\n\n6. They did not, however, have the right to use indiscriminate force. Two officers fired directly at Walker. They hit Taylor, who was standing nearby. But given the proximity of Taylor to Walker, it would be virtually impossible to prove that the officers' startled response-aimed directly at the perceived threat-was reckless enough to be criminal.\n\n7. There was, however, a third police officer who fired, and he fired his weapon irresponsibly. The grand jury properly indicted former detective Brent Hankison for \"wanton endangerment.\" I say \"former\" because the Louisville Metro Police Department had already fired him for showing \"extreme indifference to the value of human life.\"\n\nAs the New York Times reported, \"Hankison fired into the sliding glass patio door and window of Ms. Taylor's apartment building, both of which were covered with blinds, in violation of a department policy that requires officers to have a line of sight. Some of the bullets entered a nearby apartment where a pregnant woman, her husband and their 5-year-old child were asleep.\"\n\nAt his news conference explaining the grand jury's decision, Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron declared that \"Justice is not often easy.\" He said it \"does not fit the mold of public opinion, and it does not conform to shifting standards.\"\n\nThis is certainly correct, but it's incomplete. The grand jury's decision was proper, but the laws that led the police to violently enter Taylor's home and confront her armed boyfriend in the middle of the night are unjust. The practices of the Louisville police department capitalizing on those laws are also unjust. The Washington Post's Radley Balko has done indispensable work following this case, and these three paragraphs from his most recent piece simply sting:\n\nThe most serious questions here concern the investigation itself, and why these officers were asked to serve a warrant on Taylor's home in the first place. ... There is the fact that despite the surveillance on Taylor's home, the police didn't know there was another person inside. There are the police bullets that were inadvertently fired into surrounding apartments. There's the cut-and-paste language used to secure the no-knock portion of the warrant. There's also the fact that the officer who procured the warrant was not part of the raid team. There's the fact that five officers involved in the Taylor raid were involved in another violent, botched raid on an innocent family in 2018.\n\nAnd there's the 2015 study by criminologist Bryan Patrick Schaefer, who was allowed to embed himself with the Louisville police department. As Schaffer [sic] wrote, \"Of the 73 search warrant entries observed, every entry involved using a ram to break the door down. Further, the detectives announce their presence and purpose in conjunction with the first hit on the door. A detective explained, 'As long as we announce our presence, we are good. We don't want to give them any time to destroy evidence or grab a weapon, so we go fast and get through the door quick.'\"\n\nSchaefer added that in the raids he observed, the difference between how police served a no-knock warrant and a knock-and-announce warrant was \"minimal in practice.\"\n\nIn the contest between the rights of a woman to sleep peacefully in her own home and for her boyfriend to defend it against violent entry and the right of the state to make a violent entry, the law should prefer the homeowner. No, that doesn't mean removing from police the ability to defend themselves. It means dramatically restricting their ability to make a violent entry in the first instance. It means revitalizing the Fourth Amendment, and reviving its importance in our constitutional republic. \"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\"\n\nYesterday, the grand jury correctly applied the law to the facts, and its decision not to charge the officers who fired the fatal shots was almost certainly correct. But Breonna Taylor's death was still deeply unjust, and the injustices will continue until the law is reformed.\n\nOne last thing ...\n\nYesterday I had a great time recording our first Advisory Opinions Live with my brilliant co-host, Sarah Isgur.

      "text": "When the Law Doesn't Contain All the Answers\n\nEven if the legal system convicts one officer of one crime, that does not relieve us of our responsibility to confront our country's truth about race.\n\nHere we go again. The video of George Floyd prostrate on the pavement, a police officer's knee on his neck for nine minutes, is truly sickening to watch. It feels almost pointless to express one's disgust and anger at the injustice of it because the misconduct of the officer (with that chilling stare directed at the panicked and horrified onlookers literally begging for him to stop) seems so obvious. Who could defend what is depicted in that video? Thankfully, no one really has, but give it time, it's a big country. Some people have a psychological or financial interest defending the indefensible, so they will. These people should be ignored-their goal is more to provoke than to engage in a meaningful discussion.\n\nBut even if the rest of us on planet Earth, who may not agree on much, are in broad agreement that the Floyd death represents a horrifying example of misuse of the power and authority our legal system delegates to law enforcement with the aim of protecting life, not snuffing it out, that agreement isn't unifying. It's sad.\n\nThe officers involved were immediately terminated by the city of Minneapolis, and a phalanx of state and federal civil rights investigators and prosecutors have been committed to investigate and presumably prosecute the case. The wheels of justice have begun to turn. Under our system of laws, that's what should happen, and no one that matters is saying it shouldn't.\n\nYet that doesn't seem enough. People are angry. Of course, if somehow the accused officer escapes punishment as defendants, even guilty ones, sometimes do in our system, we will not want to hear a legal rationale or a chin-stroking reference to \"better that 10 guilty men go free, than blah blah blah ... \" But even presuming a state or federal conviction, I doubt that many of us will have the feeling that \"the system worked.\"\n\nGeorge Floyd will still be dead.\n\nFor almost 20 years, since the time I began a rewarding and brief two-year portion of my varied legal career serving as a senior official in the Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, I have followed with interest high-profile instances of alleged police misconduct. On one occasion, in 2002, I went to Inglewood, California, for DoJ after a home video showed a black teenager, hands in cuffs, getting his head slammed onto the hood of a cruiser and punched by an officer. The echoes of the Rodney King incident and riots from a decade earlier were audible throughout Los Angeles and the country as CNN played the video seemingly on a loop. The officers involved were fired immediately by the mayor of Inglewood while I was there meeting with him, local prosecutors, and FBI agents. (The mayor's actions that day, right or wrong, probably avoided a riot.)\n\nAs it turns out, an enhanced slow motion review of the video by the FBI showed that the teen, while his hands were cuffed behind his back, grabbed the officer's scrotum and squeezed, precipitating the punch and push to the head until he let go. The officers on the scene (unaware they were being recorded, as this was before the age of the cell-phone camera) called in supervisors to review the use of force and all prepared contemporaneous reports acknowledging what happened. Their stories matched the video of the incident that they didn't know was being filmed. In short, they did what you would want them to after an incident when use of force is necessary-they knew their department policy, called it in to their bosses, and explained it without lying or minimizing. Neither the state nor DoJ brought charges, and if I recall correctly, an arbitrator upheld the officers' union grievances to the firing and they were rehired with back pay after a year or two. Legally, the State of California and DoJ made the right call-the use of force was not criminal, and was likely justified by the circumstances.\n\nThe Inglewood saga is just one example of the fact that, viewed through the lens of the legal standards applied in federal criminal civil rights case for \"willful\" deprivations of constitutional or statutory rights, police misconduct cases must meet a very high bar. Moreover, \"narratives\" that develop around high profile civil rights cases sometimes don't withstand close factual scrutiny. In 2014, I predicted within a week of the Michael Brown incident in Ferguson, Missouri, that no federal charges would be brought, notwithstanding the strength of the \"Hands Up! Don't Shoot\" narrative at that time. Eventually, the Holder Justice Department issued a report going beyond a decision not to charge-it essentially cleared officer Darren Wilson and concluded that his use of force was proper. Similarly, state charges weren't successful and no federal charges were brought in the Freddie Gray case in Baltimore, a case involving a handcuffed Gray allegedly being given a \"rough ride\" in the back of a transport vehicle, which resulted in injuries from which he never recovered.\n\nSo, what do these cases where the officers were cleared have to do with George Floyd, a case where, it seems, the evidence appears cut and dried and some conviction seems likely?\n\nThese cases are instructive because they involve black men. Regardless of the result, they all demonstrate that the issues surrounding how our society, including but not limited to the police, perceive and treat black men, cannot be adequately addressed in the context of the prosecution of an individual case, regardless of the outcome.\n\nIt is not that the charging decision or verdict in a given case doesn't matter-it clearly does. But a civil rights prosecution of an officer asks narrow questions about a snapshot in time: Did the officer, at the time force was used, have a reasonable fear for death or imminent bodily harm to justify it? Did the officer approach the situation intending to deprive the victim of federally protected rights?\n\nApplying these standards, as a lawyer with some familiarity with the relevant law, I can tick through a list of high-profile police misconduct cases that weren't prosecuted, as well as those that were, and find that most reached the \"correct\" result applying existing legal standards. On one very important level, \"the system\" worked in such cases-a criminal prosecution was or was not legally warranted. It is easy under such circumstances to look at unrest or even rioting in minority communities in response to a decision not to charge and wonder: \"What are people complaining about? The legal outcome was correct!\"\n\nBut the answer is simple, if troubling: The law, even applied correctly, doesn't remedy what we know is wrong. We can hope that the George Floyd killing can provide some insight into the feeling of frustration in many minority communities surrounding policing issues, because we can see, or at least sense, the depth of the problem. Assuming the system properly tries and convicts the kneeling officer of some serious offense, will you feel any better about George Floyd's death? I won't. As a lawyer, I can easily analyze the narrow question of whether one officer's conduct was legal. But that analysis is independent of the uncomfortable truth that it is hard to imagine that George Floyd wouldn't be alive if he were white . That truth is one that our society, our culture, all of us, not just our law enforcement officers, must confront. Even if the legal system convicts one officer of one crime, that does not relieve us of our responsibility to confront our country's truth about race. We sense that some responsibility-not legal responsibility, mind you, but something else-rests with all of us when we know, just know , that our society has shaped our law enforcement's view of black men, black men's view of law enforcement, and has further shaped the individuals involved through millions of encounters, presumptions, fears, and interactions that combine to make the nightmare on the video spring to life.\n\nIt is impossible to conclude that even a fully functioning and just legal system that produces the legally correct results can soothe the discomfort felt watching George Floyd stop moving before our eyes. Recognizing that law doesn't contain all the answers should help us understand why, in those instances where that same legal system rightly exonerates the police in the death of a black man, the community where that man grew up doesn't necessarily care as much about the \"correct\" legal answer in terms of use of force policy or federal civil rights law. Whether or not an individual officer is guilty or innocent may provide an answer of sorts, but it's not to the question they are truly asking. The question on their minds is too often \" would this man be dead if he weren't black? \"\n\nOftentimes, we know the answer in our heart, cringe, and then focus on the easier question of legality lest we get too uncomfortable thinking about it.\n\nGeorge Floyd is still dead.\n\nBob Driscoll is chair of the White Collar and Government Investigations Group at McGlinchey in Washington, D.C., and a former deputy assistant attorney general for civil rights with the Department of Justice.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "The CIA's Ugly Legacy on Workplace Sexual Violence\n\nThe agency has been unable to create a safe environment for its female officers.\n\nLast month yet another Central Intelligence Agency officer was convicted for a workplace sexual assault on a female agency colleague, one that happened in front of more than a dozen witnesses. It followed another former officer's conviction in a bench trial last year in a similar attack, in which a female trainee was strangled in a stairwell at CIA headquarters while resisting her colleague's advances. This case will be retried in front of a jury in Virginia today. Last month another agency officer was sentenced to 30 years in prison for drugging and molesting dozens-perhaps hundreds-of women and filming his depraved acts. These court proceedings come on the heels of a CIA inspector general report demanded by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, and a House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence investigation, on the agency's epidemic of workplace sexual violence.\n\nI've had the honor of representing several female CIA officers who bravely came forward with criminal complaints of sexual assault at the hands of agency colleagues. Their truth-telling came at a high price to their careers. The first officer to inform Congress about this crisis was soon fired for obviously pretextual reasons, and her claim of unlawful retaliation is under investigation by the CIA's inspector general. She settled, on confidential terms, a lawsuit for Civil Rights Act and Privacy Act violations. Yet another officer in a sensitive post, who interacted regularly with the most senior CIA officials, felt compelled to resign in protest at how badly the agency mishandled her assault.\n\nBeginning from a very low standard, and only under intense congressional pressure via reforms mandated in the bipartisan 2024 National Defense Authorization Act, has the CIA made limited forward progress regarding workplace sexual violence.\n\nUntil recently, for example, the agency as a policy threatened victims with prosecution for unauthorized disclosure of classified information, if they told law enforcement of their assailants' CIA association or identified colleagues as witnesses to their assaults without agency permission. This was, in law and in fact, felony witness tampering: the knowing attempt to intimidate a person to delay or prevent their communication to law enforcement information relating to the possible commission of an offense such as sexual assault on federal property. In the stairwell victim's case, the agency's misconduct went beyond just witness tampering to obstruction of justice, in my view, when CIA lawyers unlawfully leaked her workplace communications to her assailant, who used them in an unsuccessful effort to intimidate her from testifying against him at his criminal trial.\n\nThe agency no longer helps assailants within its ranks dodge local law enforcement attempts to serve them with orders of protection. The CIA also no longer routinely threatens victims' security clearances or assignments to discourage them from filing employment discrimination complaints or seeking needed mental health assistance. This progress is long overdue, but it's progress.\n\nYet the agency still refuses victims' requests to have their security-cleared lawyers present for meetings with CIA investigators. It also still insists on videotaping victims' interviews with investigators-even though the only people who benefit are the accused perpetrators' defense counsel, who use them to cross-examine victims. CIA security personnel still interrogate victims about whether they disclosed classified information in reporting sex crimes, and in one case, bizarrely polygraphed a female officer who'd been sexually assaulted about whether she'd ever been raped , which is irrelevant to her suitability for holding a security clearance. In one recent case the agency unit responsible for taking sexual assault complaints even filed a personnel action against a victim whom they considered to be too pointed in the manner of making her complaint.\n\nThe CIA is forbidden from wielding general police powers, or interfering with domestic law enforcement, including by state and local authorities, and most CIA personnel lack relevant criminal investigative experience. Yet the agency still improperly allows itself to decide whether to notify law enforcement of sex crimes complaints involving its officers. In fact, until recently, the agency refused to report to law enforcement what it considered to be mere misdemeanors.\n\nWhether misconduct is a crime, and if so whether it's a felony or a misdemeanor, are legal decisions properly made by prosecutors' offices and grand juries. It's not clear why the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of Virginia, which is commendably aggressive in prosecuting national security cases involving counterintelligence, export controls and terrorism, appears to habitually defer to the agency regarding this core law enforcement responsibility when it comes to sex crimes. Fortunately for CIA women, good local police and prosecutors in northern Virginia are now rising to the task; unfortunately, agency policies continue-unnecessarily and perhaps deliberately-to make these investigations and prosecutions more difficult.\n\nMeanwhile, male CIA officers under active investigation by law enforcement for felony sex crimes are permitted to remain in operational postings abroad. This is despite glaring counterintelligence threats posed by their criminal liability exposure-which could lead them to defect to an adversary's intelligence service rather than face decades in prison in the U.S.-and the obvious physical safety dangers such predators pose to female colleagues, liaison partners, sources, and host country civilians.\n\nI was proud to serve as a CIA case officer for six years, one of many young professionals who set aside their civilian careers after 9/11. In my view, albeit now from the outside looking in, and as a lawyer in private practice once again, the agency still doesn't \"get it\" on this important issue.\n\nCrucially, the agency still claims that most information about sex crimes is secret, which plainly it is not. The executive order authorizing the entire classification system specifically forbids declaring anything secret because it is criminal, or embarrassing to a government agency. Remarkably, the CIA insists that its inspector general's 648-page report on sexual harassment and assault is somehow classified. When the agency is confronted with hard questions about workplace sexual violence, its bureaucrats respond weakly-the CIA \"takes this very seriously\" and \"acts swiftly\" to \"ensure a safe working environment\"-instead of providing action plans.\n\nOne of my clients was sexually assaulted by her supervisor, whose counsel admitted was blackout drunk in the office in the afternoon, in a conference room at a clandestine agency facility. Her victim impact statement, delivered in court in September, described experiencing \"a Byzantine and ultimately useless process\" within the CIA after her assault. Her assailant was allowed to go through a months-long transition program, retire, and keep his security clearances-despite misconduct corroborated by witnesses that later resulted in his conviction for a violent crime. Another officer convicted of a workplace assault on a female colleague was similarly permitted to keep his clearances and, relatedly, a Navy Reserve intelligence billet.\n\nDespite pressure from Congress, the press, and most of the agency's own workforce, CIA management under Director William Burns still simply can't-or won't-ensure a workplace environment for female officers that is free from violent sexual predators.\n\nIf any local law enforcement jurisdiction in America had a similarly poor record of mistreating female sex crime complainants, while failing to punish male perpetrators, the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division would investigate its police department and district attorney's office. I'm biased as a native New Yorker, but I think the New York Police Department is our nation's finest. Yet even NYPD's famous Special Victims Division recently fell under scrutiny by the DOJ Civil Rights Division and local U.S. attorneys regarding whether the NYPD engaged in gender-biased policing. Often, when DOJ's Civil Rights Division finds that a police department has engaged in a pattern and practice of misconduct, it appoints a federal monitor of that law enforcement agency for a period of time. Again using the NYPD as an example, it operated for years under a federal monitorship regarding alleged racial profiling in its \"stop, question, and frisk\" practices.\n\nThe same high standards that rightly apply to any police department in America ought to apply to the CIA, too. The situation warrants a Justice Department civil rights investigation of the agency's response to sex crimes, and depending on the results of that probe, the possible appointment of an independent federal monitor. That monitor-likely a former prosecutor, and ideally a woman-would report to DOJ and perhaps even, pursuant to equal employment opportunity litigation, a federal judge. This monitor's reports should be shared with CIA's congressional oversight committees and the press and the public.\n\nIn 2024, it's impossible for the United States to conduct espionage well without talented women. About 3 in 5 American university graduates now are female, a general trend that's even stronger at the elite colleges and graduate programs from which the CIA typically seeks recruits. Beyond that, some human intelligence sources are more easily recruited or handled by female case officers, in cultural circumstances in which a particular cover for status or action simply fits better on a woman. Yet the persistence of sex crimes within the agency harms the recruitment, morale, and retention of good female officers. As my client stated in court, \"When he shoved his hand up my skirt, I felt myself losing confidence, getting 'smaller', feeling like I had no voice.\" She is sadly not alone in her feelings.\n\nWhen I was in the Army, a wizened old general observed to a group of us junior officers preparing to undergo an inspection, \"Boys, a cat can't skin itself.\" He was right. The CIA clearly cannot solve this problem internally, and will not solve it on its own. The agency needs outside expert help to fix its sexual violence problem. CIA women, patriots performing often hazardous duties for the United States, deserve no less.\n\nKevin Carroll served as senior counsel to Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly (2017-18) and House Homeland Security Committee chairman Peter King (2011-13), and as a CIA and Army officer.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

While Saturday's demonstrations were largely peaceful, evening clashes at a temporary fence erected near the White House led to a flurry of videos, images, and comments online. In one viral tweet featuring video footage of protesters confronting law enforcement officers, Jon Levine-a political reporter for the New York Post -highlighted that no arrests were made during the incident.\n\n\"No arrests were made.\" - NYPost https://t.co/6RRaTi1SAp https://t.co/KYC3FXJW2D\n\n- Jon Levine (@LevineJonathan) January 14, 2024\n\nLevine cites a story in the New York Post detailing the extent of the protests and damage sustained to the fence. According to the story, sections of the fence were dislodged by protesters, requiring Secret Service officers to physically maintain the barrier. Additionally, objects were thrown at officers and some protesters attempted to scale the fence.\n\nThe New York Post story cited by Levine is correct: No arrests were made related to events in the evening near the White House. \"The Secret Service made no arrests associated with the march on Jan. 13,\" a spokesperson for the U.S. Secret Service told The Dispatch Fact Check in an email.

Metropolitan Police also confirmed in an email that the department had made no arrests.\n\nHowever, a spokesperson for the U.S. Park Police-who also hold law enforcement jurisdiction in the District of Columbia and its surrounding areas-told The Dispatch Fact Check that its officers had arrested two individuals earlier in the day during the protests: one for assaulting a police officer and another for disorderly conduct.\n\nIn addition, Capitol Police arrested approximately 130 pro-Palestine protesters on Tuesday at the Cannon House Office Building. \"A group of people legally entered the Cannon House Office Building after they went through screening,\" a Capitol Police spokesperson told The Dispatch Fact Check in an email. \"Demonstrations are not allowed inside Congressional Buildings, so when they started to protest and refused to stop, we began arresting them.\" The Capitol Police also confirmed in an email that no arrests had been made by its officers during Saturday's protests. However, the Capitol Police hold law enforcement jurisdiction only around the Capitol Complex and adjacent grounds, not the areas around the White House where clashes occurred.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

It depicts officers of the agency's Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) unit apprehending several undocumented workers during a raid at Fresh Mark, a meat processing company. In the photo, the arrestee's gray T-shirt has no writing on the back, and the officers' vests read \"POLICE HSI.\" This differs from the now viral version, in which the arrestee's shirt reads \"LATINOS FOR TRUMP 2024\" and the officers' vests read \"POLICE ICE\".\n\nAccording to the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Northern District of Ohio, HSI agents detained 146 workers at the plant who were subject to arrest for immigration violations. Following the arrests, Fresh Mark agreed to pay a $3.7 million penalty in connection with identity theft and obstruction offenses by one of its hiring managers, who had used stolen information from U.S. citizens to falsely verify employment eligibility for undocumented immigrant workers.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

      "text": "How Many January 6 Convicts Will Trump Pardon?\n\nDefendants charged with misdemeanors will likely get pardons, but what about more serious offenders?\n\nWhen most Republican senators voted to acquit Donald Trump over his role in inciting the storming of the U.S. Capitol January 6, 2021, a common message was that the federal government should nevertheless focus on prosecuting those who had participated in the riot. But as Trump looks poised to pardon a large number of January 6 convicts and defendants, most of those same Republican senators are greeting those impending pardons with a shrug.\n\n\"The January 6 attack on the Capitol was horrific and appalling,\" Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said in 2021. \"Those who planned and participated in the violence that day should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\" When asked last week in the Capitol if there are any categories of January 6 convicts who should not be pardoned, Cornyn told The Dispatch : \"You know, that's nothing that the Senate's going to have anything to do with. That's strictly up to the president.\"\n\nIn 2021, Sen. Steve Daines of Montana said : \"Going forward, the focus must be to arrest and prosecute the domestic terrorists who broke into our Capitol, attacked law enforcement officers, sought to cause harm, and tried to disrupt the peaceful transfer of power. They should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\" But last week, Daines told The Dispatch : \"I support what President Trump is going to do. I know he will very thoughtfully go through ... everyone who was imprisoned, and I trust his judgment. I think he will do exactly the right thing.\" Asked if those who committed violence should not be pardoned, he said: \"Look, I trust President Trump's judgment on this.\"\n\nAnd Sen. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota said just after the Capitol riot : \"If I was in charge of security at the U.S. Capitol and some guy came in busting through the window, I would have put a bullet in his head and thrown him back out the window the other way to show the next person what would happen.\" Cramer told The Dispatch in the Capitol last week: \"I think with regard to anybody that was violent, you've got to take a person by person and case-by-case approach to it. Not all violence is the same.\"\n\nGOP senators aren't the only ones singing a different tune on the January 6 rioters. Trump himself said on January 7, 2021: \"The demonstrators who infiltrated the Capitol have defiled the seat of American democracy. To those who engaged in the acts of violence and destruction, you do not represent our country. And to those who broke the law, you will pay.\" But on the campaign trail last year, he repeatedly pledged to issue pardons-and often played a song by the J6 Prison Choir composed of 20 inmates who had been charged over the Capitol riot.\n\nThe precise scope of Trump's January 6 pardons remains unknown at the moment. \"I'm going to do [pardons] case-by-case, and if they were non-violent, I think they've been greatly punished. And the answer is I will be doing that, yeah, I'm going to look if there's some that really were out of control,\" Trump told Time magazine after the election. And on January 11, Vice President-elect J.D. Vance said on Fox News Sunday : \"If you committed violence on that day, obviously you shouldn't be pardoned. And there's a little bit of a gray area there.\"\n\nComments from Trump and Vance have led many to believe that out of the nearly 1,600 people charged in connection with January 6, somewhere between 900 and 1,000 who faced only misdemeanor charges such as trespassing will be swiftly pardoned by Trump. \"I expect a lot of free people walking shortly after Trump's inauguration,\" said Matthew Braynard of Look Ahead America, an organization advocating for pardons for January 6 convicts and defendants. \"I expect about a thousand folks that were not even charged with violence, they will be pardoned almost immediately, based on what the administration said. Others may be reviewed more on a case by case basis.\" Braynard said he couldn't comment on whether he's gotten any reassurances from the Trump team, but he eventually expects a \"fairly comprehensive result.\"\n\nWhat remains unknown is how many of the convicts and defendants charged with more serious crimes will be pardoned. A Washington Post analysis from December separated those people into three categories: Thirteen people charged with seditious conspiracy for orchestrating the attack, at least 379 people charged with assaulting police or members of the media, and at least 287 people \"charged with less violent or nonviolent felonies. Most of them have been charged with federal rioting, but many also have faced property destruction, theft, obstruction or firearms counts.\"\n\nIf comments by Vance and Trump about violence are to be taken even slightly seriously, that would mean at the very least that a January 6 convict such as Peter Francis Stager, who was caught on tape beating a police officer with a flagpole on the Capitol steps, would not be pardoned. \"That entire building is filled with treasonous traitors. Death is the only remedy for what's in that building,\" Stager said on videotape before the riot. \"Every single one of those Capitol law enforcement officers, death is the remedy, that is the only remedy they get.\" Stager pleaded guilty and was sentenced to 52 months in prison ; he was released early in October.\n\nAsked about what his group wanted to be done with January 6 convicts charged with shoving or beating police officers, Braynard said: \"You should look at what someone is typically charged with a case like that ... I'm confident that these guys were over-sentenced.\" According to a Washington Post analysis , the \"average sentence for someone convicted of assaulting police on Jan. 6 has been about four years ... below national averages for that crime.\" Scores of police officers were injured as they fought to keep rioters out of the Capitol building, with much of the fighting caught on videotape . Officer Brian Sicknick died of a stroke after the riot: The medical examiner ruled that Sicknick died of natural causes, but also said that \"all that transpired played a role in his condition.\" Four police officers who defended the Capitol later committed suicide.\n\n\"If President-Elect Trump overturns the convictions of individuals who were convicted by judges and juries or admitted guilt for crimes on January 6, he would undermine the U.S. judiciary and criminal justice system and send a message to Americans that attacking U.S. democratic institutions is appropriate and justifiable,\" the Society for the Rule of Law, an organization of lawyers and judges who previously served in Republican administrations, said in a statement in December. \"Even if President-Elect Trump pardons some people, he should absolutely not pardon or commute the sentences of any of the more than 500 individuals who have been charged with assaulting or interfering with law enforcement officials. This would be a grave insult to our law enforcement personnel.\"\n\nThe pledge not to pardon those who had committed violence still leaves plenty of that \"gray area\" that Vance talked about. For example, Michael Bradley swung a baton at police officers and was sentenced to 60 months, but \"video at his trial couldn't conclusively prove whether he made contact,\" a Wall Street Journal editorial reported. And there are those who received the stiffest sentences for orchestrating the attack , such as Proud Boys leader Enrique Tarrio, who was sentenced to 22 years in prison for seditious conspiracy and other charges. Tarrio was not physically present at the Capitol during the riot, but claimed credit for it: \"Make no mistake . . . we did this,\" he wrote on social media. Asked if he expected Tarrio to be pardoned, Braynard replied: \"I don't know.\"\n\nWe'll begin to find out just how sweeping the January 6 pardons are sometime after noon today, when the man most responsible of all for the events that transpired on January 6, 2021 is sworn in for a second term as president.\n\nJohn McCormack is a senior editor at The Dispatch and is based in Washington, D.C.

FAQ - New Privacy Policy\n\nFormer Anheuser-Busch executive Anson Frericks explained how companies' focus on politics and social issues backfired on their bottom line as President Donald Trump reassures Americans about market uncertainty.\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Two dozen state financial officers sent a letter today to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), asset managers, proxy advisors and public companies, sounding the alarm on the financial risk of prioritizing a political agenda , like DEI, over financial returns.\n\nIn the letter, 24 state financial officers outline the risk of DEI destroying shareholder value and warn of potential consumer backlash and boycotts, decreased productivity and increased litigation costs when a political agenda invades financial institutions.\n\n\"Asset managers and proxy advisors should not prioritize a political agenda over financial returns by supporting pro-DEI shareholder proposals and/or voting against directors who do not support such proposals,\" the letter said.\n\nThe officers highlight the steps taken by the SEC under President Donald Trump 's administration to prevent activists from pushing a political agenda in corporate boardrooms. The letter advises companies on how to push back through SEC no-action letters and by pursuing a court ruling to block activist proposals.\n\nYOUNGKIN EFFORTS LEAD SLEW OF VA COLLEGES TO NIX DEI, AS HOKIE ALUMS REPORTEDLY PUSH BACK\n\nTwenty-four state financial officers sent a letter to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, asset managers, proxy advisors and public companies, sounding the alarm on the financial risk of prioritizing DEI over financial returns. (iStock)\n\n\"The SEC's recent guidance directing asset managers that push DEI and other ESG policies on companies to file on the more rigorous Schedule 13D is a positive first step, but enforcement must follow. Influencing corporate DEI policies is inconsistent with the role of a passive investor and should trigger Schedule 13D filing requirements,\" the letter said.\n\nTRUMP RESCINDS BIDEN-ERA POLICY DECLARING DEI AN 'INTEGRAL' PART OF SCIENTIFIC PROCESS\n\nSchedule 13D is an SEC filing requirement when someone acquires a significant stake in a public company. The officers argue in the letter that Schedule 13D filings should be required for asset managers who influence corporate DEI policies.\n\n\"As state financial officials, we have a duty to protect taxpayer funds and the retirement savings of state employees. Asset managers and proxy advisors should oppose proposals that compel companies to maintain or reinstate unlawful DEI practices that erode shareholder value,\" the state financial officers said in the letter.\n\nThe financial officers demand asset managers and proxy advisors who manage money for investors and help them decide how to vote in shareholder meetings oppose \"unlawful DEI practices\" and prioritize shareholder value and financial returns.\n\n\"Asset managers and proxy advisors who continue to prioritize political agendas, such as DEI, over financial performance are neglecting their fiduciary responsibilities. As state financial officers, we have a duty to act in the best financial interests of pension and retirement beneficiaries.

(AP/Alex Brandon / Associated Press)\n\n\"President Trump has made it clear that incorporating DEI into company policies should be stopped, but activist investors, asset managers and proxy advisors continue to prioritize a political agenda over financial returns. By using their influence over corporate boards, organizations such as BlackRock, Glass Lewis and ISS are able to inject woke policies such a DEI into companies, which erode shareholder value,\" OJ Oleka, CEO of the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF), told Fox News Digital.\n\nDespite Trump rejecting corporate DEI policies, Oleka said activists continue to \"prioritize a political agenda over financial returns\" which can \"erode shareholder value.\"\n\nOleka and 24 state financial officers from across the country are advocating for \"the commonsense policy of measuring shareholder returns as the primary metric for success.\"\n\nThe BlackRock logo outside its offices in New York City. (Reuters/Brendan McDermid/File Photo / Reuters Photos)\n\n\"Under the Trump Administration, we have seen the SEC take steps to combat radical ideology in corporations by releasing new guidance that holds these activists accountable for wrongfully trying to influence companies and corporate boards into prioritizing a far-left political agenda, rather than focusing on fiduciary duty and maximizing profits. In every area of the American financial sector, our state financial officers will continue to fight for the commonsense policy of measuring shareholder returns as the primary metric for success,\" Oleka told Fox News Digital.\n\nSignatories of the letter include state financial officers from Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Indiana, Iowa, Kansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Texas, Utah and Wyoming.\n\nThe companies, asset managers and proxy advisors receiving the letter include the SEC, BlackRock, Capital Group, Fidelity, Franklin Resources, State Street, T.

These officers are paid by the government but work \"full-time on union matters\" and do not retain certification to perform screening functions, DHS said.\n\nMASSIVE POWER OUTAGE AT BWI AIRPORT IMPACTS THOUSANDS OF PASSENGERS WITH EXTENSIVE DELAYS\n\nA Transportation Security Administration officer at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in Atlanta on Monday, Oct. 2, 2023.

      "text": "30 probation officers charged with enabling 'gladiator fights' between at least 143 juvenile inmates\n\nThirty probation officers have been charged with allowing - and even encouraging - scores of \"gladiator fights\" at a California juvenile detention center involving at least 143 young inmates.\n\nThe charges, unsealed Monday , follow a more than yearlong investigation into the troubled Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall in Los Angeles County sparked by a video showing multiple officers doing nothing as a group of teens pummeled a 17-year-old inmate, breaking his nose and leaving him with head trauma.\n\n\"Some officers are even seen laughing, and shaking hands with the young people involved,\" California Attorney General Rob Bonta told reporters Monday, according to KTLA .\n\n\"Watching the video, the officers look more like referees or audience members at a prize fight, not adults charged with the care and supervision of young people. The officers don't step in or intervene and don't protect their charges,\" he said.\n\nThe filmed fight - first published by the Los Angeles Times in January 2024 - was one of at least 69 \"gladiator fights\" at the detention hall between July and December 2023, Bonta said.\n\nIn the video, one of the 30 officers, identified as Taneha Brooks, appears to move out of the way as one teen charges at the victim and kicks him. Brooks can be seen checking her watch - seemingly to time each fight, the LA paper said.\n\nAnother officer, Shawn Smyles, shakes hands with one of the teen's attackers as he helplessly tries to defend himself from a hail of fists in another part of the room, the video shows.\n\nIn her written report on the incident, Brooks said the victim and the assailants were in a mutual fight that ended when she told them to stop.\n\nThe 30 were charged with child endangerment and abuse, conspiracy and battery. The first 22 were arraigned Monday in Los Angeles Superior Court, with the other eight scheduled for April 18.\n\nAll of them have been placed on leave without pay during an internal investigation by the LA County Probation Department.\n\n\"Accountability is a cornerstone of our mission, and we have zero tolerance for misconduct of any peace officers, especially those dealing with young people in our system,\" the department said in a statement.\n\nCalifornia's Board of State and Community Corrections ordered Los Padrinos - which hosts a majority of LA County's juvenile delinquents - to shut down last year and it repeatedly failed inspections and was declared unsafe, but the probation office refused, according to the LA Times.\n\nThe board had previously closed two other juvenile detention centers due to surging violence and a staffing crisis. An LA County superior court judge is considering the county public defender's office's request to remove all its clients from the facility over safety concerns.\n\nBonta called the indictment \"an important step toward holding these officers accountable and addressing shortfalls at Los Padrinos Juvenile Hall.\n\n\"Let today's charges be a warning for all those who abuse their power: the California Department of Justice is watching, and we will hold you accountable.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

While on the ground, defenseless, he shot them each a separate time ... What I can tell you from the video is after he executed our officers, he calmly walked away,\" Neudigate said.\n\nOfficer Reese was pronounced dead just past midnight, surrounded by family, friends and fellow officers. Girvin succumbed to his wounds around 4:30 a.m.\n\n\"I'm going to be quite honest, we're all hurting,\" a tearful Neudigate said. \"We've got an officer that is 25 years old, another one that is 30, with such a future ahead of them ... senselessly taken.\"\n\nLaw enforcement found McCoy dead in a nearby shed shortly after the incident, with what the police chief said appeared to be a self-inflicted gunshot wound.\n\n\"At no time did any of our officers fire shots,\" he said.\n\nThis is the first shooting death of a Virginia Beach police officer since 2008, according to Neudigate.\n\n\"We have a very young workforce. The vast majority of our workforce has never experienced a loss of this magnitude.\"\n\nReese joined the department in 2020, Neudigate said, while Girvin joined in 2021.\n\nHis wife, Jessica Girvin, posted a devastating farewell to her husband on Facebook .\n\n\"I'm not supposed to have to write this.

The whole city is upside down.\"\n\nPolice Benevolent Association President Patrick Hendry echoed the observation: \"They think they can take a swing at a cop and get away with it, because they believe the justice system is on their side.\n\n\"We're starting to see a change when we turn out for these cases in court, but the consequences for attacking police officers need to come much faster so that the message trickles down to the streets.\"\n\nNYPD Chief of Crime Control Strategies Michael Lipetri said this week attacks on cops are pushing up the number of overall assaults in the city, which have seen a 5% increase, with 22,806 so far this year compared to 21,712 at this point in 2023, police data show.\n\n\"Police officers in New York City are more engaged than they ever have been,\" LiPetri said, noting crime against cops was at \"unprecedented levels.\"\n\n\"They're engaging with individuals that quite frankly should not be walking around the streets of New York City,\" he said. \"They're dangerous and they're assaulting New York City police officers.\"\n\nIn one caught-on-camera assault, Police Officer Mary Fay was left with blood running down her face after she tried to break up an Aug. 1 fight between a brute and a group of kids in the Bronx.\n\nAfter allegedly hitting her, repeat offender Ernst Delma, 41, was tackled by other cops at the corner of Randall and Rosedale Avenues in Clason Point.\n\nA longtime Bronx cop called for a mandatory minimum sentence for assaulting a cop.\n\n\"I think anybody that assaults a police officer should do a minimum of a year in jail,\" the cop said.\n\n\"I've always said that we are the last line of defense,\" the officer added. \"Even if I wasn't a cop, I would feel the same way, like your parents always taught you never be disrespectful to the cops.

Right now, a lot of units have been depleted,\" said one ICE source.\n\n\"If the fugitive operations street team isn't making enough arrests, they'll crack down on them first,\" the source added, referring to the agency's program that assists field offices in locating and arresting migrants who represent a threat to national security or public safety.\n\n\"And if that's still not enough, then they'll probably be mandated to add more officers to the arrest team to make more arrests.\"\n\nThere are dozens of vacant positions in each ICE office that need the funding in order to fill them, according to sources.\n\n\"They're not able to fill them because they don't have the funding for them,\" a source opined. \"They really defunded us without really saying it,\" they added, referring to the Biden-Harris administration.\n\nHoman, who served in the last Trump administration as acting ICE director, said that in his first week on the job, he plans to visit the southern and northern borders and meet with Border Patrol and ICE personnel to get a sense of their greatest needs.\n\nHe also indicated that he would prioritize making arrests of illegal migrants who pose threats to national security and public safety, and bring back worksite raids, which the Biden-Harris administration halted in October 2021.\n\nMeanwhile, some migrants are choosing to cross the border now because they fear the hawkish policies of the Trump administration.\n\nOne migrant family from Venezuela that crossed into Eagle Pass , Texas, Wednesday morning told The Post that they're taking a \"risk\" to come now because they very well believe they could be deported when Trump comes to power.\n\n\"It's a risk,\" one of the women from Venezuela said after slipping into the country and into the waiting arms of Border Patrol agents.\n\nNeither ICE nor a Trump spokesperson immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\nAdvertisement"

A 10th officer is being charged with tampering with evidence.\n\nAll the officers entered not-guilty pleas at a court hearing in Utica. At least six of the officers made bond - which was set at $250,000 bail bond for the murder charges.\n\nBrooks was rendered defenseless against the guards' alleged beat-down as his hands were cuffed behind his back the entire time as the guards showed a disturbing \"sense of normalcy\" in the shocking footage, Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said at a news conference.\n\n\"I think any sentient human being looking at the tapes naturally comes to the conclusion that [Brooks] must have said something. He must have spit at the officers. He must have resisted in some way. And the fact of the matter is, he did absolutely nothing,\" Fitzpatrick said.\n\nThe DA further claimed that he would be able to prove in court that the correction officers believed their bodyworn cameras were off during the group assault.\n\nProtesters filled the courtroom Thursday, with some shouting \"Murdered, murderer\" at the guards, who arrived at the proceeding in handcuffs.\n\nNicholas Anzalone, David Kingsley, Anthony Farina, Christopher Walrath, Mathew Galliger and one unnamed man were each charged with second-degree murder. Meanwhile, Michael Mashaw, Michael Fisher and David Walters were charged with first-degree manslaughter, indicating prosecutors believe they are criminally liable for the actions of others but did not commit murder.\n\nThree other prison employees have already reached plea agreements, Fitzpatrick said Thursday.\n\nBrooks, 43, was serving a 12-year prison sentence for first-degree assault since 2017 and had arrived at the prison shortly before his caught-on-tape beating. He had been transferred to the Oneida County prison from another nearby facility.\n\nIn the disturbing tape, Brooks, hands cuffed behind his back, is repeatedly beaten by a group of prison guards - who strike him with a shoe, grip him by the neck and throw him to the floor. Fitzpatrick said it was the third beating he received after arriving at the prison.\n\nHe sustained a broken bone in his neck, ripped thyroid cartilage, and bruised internal organs as a result of the assault and died the next day.\n\nThe Onondaga County medical examiner ruled that Brooks died from compression of the neck and multiple blunt-impact injuries .\n\nAfter the court proceedings, Robert Brooks Jr., the deceased man's son, made a plea for justice.\n\n\"These men killed my father, it was on video. The whole world got to see it. Waiting a month for these charges has been incredibly hard. But these men must be prosecuted and convicted of the crimes they made,\" Brooks Jr. said.\n\nGov. Kathy Hochul condemned the heinous gang attack by state employees.\n\n\"Today will, hopefully, be a chapter in restoring the faith of people that when people cross the line, people engage in such horrific acts, that there are severe consequences,\" the governor told reporters in Manhattan.\n\nShe had previously ordered the guards involved in Brooks' death be fired.\n\nHochul has her own correction officers problem - staring down a wildcat strike that has employees at 36 correctional facilities across New York refusing to work.\n\nState Supreme Court Justice Donna M. Siwek ruled that the strikes are in violation of the Public Employees Fair Employment Act, documents filed in Erie County revealed Wednesday.\n\nWith Post wires\n\nAdvertisement"

Ya'll were in the wrong.\"\n\nHe alluded to the officer's misconduct being addressed and \"taken care of.\"\n\nA criminology professor at the University of Houston Clear Lake jumped to Brown's defense to call out the police union's hypocrisy, claiming the joking from the union would stop people from reporting cop misconduct.\n\n\"They are trying to be dismissive of their behavior by saying the young men were doing something similar, but do two wrongs make a right?\" Kimberly Dodson told ABC 13.\n\nThe union reassured the public that there wouldn't be consequences for reporting police officers' actions.\n\n\"We don't go out there hunting people for complaining about police officers.

Mata fought back and pulled a gun on Yarusso, she said.\n\n\"He placed his .380-caliber Hi-Point pistol against the officer's chest and fired,\" she said.\n\nMata also shot Abreu in the leg before one of the cops returned fire and struck him in the ankle, the ADA alleged.\n\nProsecutors and court documents revealed new details Wednesday about the police chase through the streets of Elmhurst, including the actions of a third officer - Sgt. Nicholas Condos, who joined the two cops as they tried to stop Mata after spotting him riding a scooter the wrong way along Ditmars Boulevard without a helmet or license plate on a pedestrian-filled sidewalk.\n\nMata ditched his moped and ran off when the trio of cops walked up, documents state.\n\nCondos then jumped onto Mata's scooter and used it to chase the fleeing suspect, prosecutors said.\n\nThe chase ended near 23rd Avenue and 89th Street, where Yarusso and Abreu tried to cuff Mata, who struggled with the cops on the ground before he reached into a cross-body bag and pulled out a gun, according to court documents.\n\nBoth cops were shot once each in the struggle, which ended with Abreu shooting Mata in the ankle, documents state.\n\nThe sergeant was among the 54 cops in the courtroom during the arraignment, which ended with Queens Criminal Court Judge Jeffrey Gershuny ordering Mata to be held without bail.\n\n\"There is no monetary amount of bail that would ensure his return to court,\" the judge said.\n\nMata faces 17 criminal counts, including first- and second-degree attempted murder, assault and resisting arrest. He's next due in court Friday.\n\n\"It's a long way to go for justice, but it's a very good first step,\" said Melinda Katz, Queens' district attorney, after the arraignment.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "3 officers convicted in Tyre Nichols' fatal beating - but 2 acquitted of civil rights charges\n\nMEMPHIS, Tenn.  - Three former Memphis officers were convicted Thursday of charges of witness tampering in the 2023 fatal beating of Tyre Nichols , and two were acquitted of federal civil rights violations in a death that sparked national protests and calls for broad changes in policing.\n\nJurors deliberated for about six hours before coming back with the mixed verdict for Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley and Justin Smith.\n\nAll of them were convicted of at least one charge, but Bean and Smith were acquitted of civil rights charges. Haley was acquitted of violating Nichols' civil rights causing death, but convicted of the lesser charge of violating his civil rights causing bodily injury.\n\nThe court remained silent as the verdicts were being read.\n\nThe judge ordered the officers to be taken into custody, but he planned to hold a hearing Monday to hear from the defense lawyers about releasing them pending sentencing. The witness tampering charges carry possible sentences of up to 20 years in prison.\n\nRodney Wells, Nichols' stepfather, told The Associated Press outside the courtroom: \"A win is a win. They're all going to jail.\"\n\nFive officers were charged in Nichols' death , but two pleaded guilty and testified against members of their old crime suppression unit, eliminating any defense strategy that would have relied on them sticking together. Jurors repeatedly watched graphic clips from police video that showed the officers punch and kick Nichols and hit him with a police baton just steps from his home, as the 29-year-old called out for his mother.\n\nProsecutors argued that Nichols was beaten for running from a traffic stop, saying it was part of a common police practice referred to in officer slang a \"street tax\" or a run tax.\" They said the officers lied - to a supervisor, to medical professionals attending to Nichols and in required written reports - about the extent of the force they used.\n\nNichols, who was Black, ran from the traffic stop despite being hit with pepper spray and a Taser. The five officers, who were fired after the beating, also are Black.\n\nSome of the most emotional testimony at trial came from one of the officers, Desmond Mills, who took a plea deal in which prosecutors call for up to 15 years in prison. He testified in tears that he was sorry for the beating, that he left Nichols' young son fatherless and that he wishes he stopped the punches. Later, he testified that he went along with a cover-up in hopes that Nichols would survive and the whole thing would \"blow over.\"\n\nNichols died Jan. 10, 2023, three days after the beating. His son is now 7 years old.\n\nThe other officer who reached a deal with prosecutors, Emmitt Martin, testified that Nichols was \"helpless\" while officers pummeled him, and that afterward the officers understood \"they weren't going to tell on me, and I wasn't going to tell on them.\" Under his plea agreement, prosecutors will suggest a prison sentence of up to 40 years.\n\nDefense attorneys questioned whether the officers were properly trained. They also pointed to Martin, who acknowledged punching and kicking Nichols in the upper torso and head, as a principal aggressor.\n\nThe police video shows the officers milling about and talking as Nichols struggles with his injuries. An autopsy report shows he died from blows to the head. The report describes brain injuries, and cuts and bruises on his head and other areas.\n\nThe five officers also have been charged with second-degree murder in state court, where they pleaded not guilty, although Mills and Martin are expected to change their pleas. A trial date in state court has not been set.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "More police officers relocating to Florida from other states all over the US: 'We back our blue'\n\nFlorida Attorney General Ashley Moody welcomed new police officers to the state after they relocated from Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, New Mexico and New York.\n\n\"Florida is the most pro-law enforcement state in the nation because we back our blue,\" Moody said.\n\n\"We've been spreading the word about all the great incentives to join our ranks, and individuals like the new Sarasota recruits have answered the call - leaving behind places where their service was not as appreciated as it is here.\"\n\nMoody again recognized new recruits who moved to serve in Sarasota through her \"Thin Line Tribute: Sunshine Salute\" initiative after highlighting new recruits from California and New York who joined the St. Petersburg Police Department.\n\n\"This is a law-and-order state. Officers want to be able to do their job,\" Sarasota Police Chief Rex Troche said.\n\n\"There is no better feeling than when you know that you can go out there and be supported in enforcing the law. I've talked with officers all around the country and when state attorneys are not assisting them, it makes those officers not want to do their jobs. Thanks to the work of Attorney General Moody and Gov. [Ron] DeSantis , officers know that when you come to the state of Florida, you are going to be able to do, and be supported in, doing your job.\"\n\nNew recruit Sarasota Police Officer Andrew Capozzi said he left New York for Florida because \"protecting and serving in New York became increasingly difficult over the past several years, as some leaders turned their backs on law enforcement and flawed criminal justice policies allowed many defendants back out on the street within hours of being arrested,\" according to a statement from Moody's office.\n\nNew recruit Sarasota Police Officer Les Kismartoni, who worked for more than 20 years as a programmer in Chicago, decided to make a change to become a police officer in Florida.\n\nKismartoni said it was the leadership at the local and state level of law enforcement that prompted the change.\n\nPolice officers are relocating to Florida through a new Law Enforcement Recruitment Bonus Program created by DeSantis and the state legislature that first launched in April 2022.\n\nDeSantis signed the first bill of its kind into law allocating $125 million for bonuses to benefit local police officers, sheriff's deputies, paramedics, EMTs and firefighters statewide.\n\nThe legislature has since renewed funding for these programs and expanded protections for law enforcement officers.\n\nIn February, DeSantis presented the 4,000th bonus check to Bay County Sheriff's Deputy Matthew Belthrop, who relocated from Virginia to take advantage of the program.\n\nNew recruits receive a $5,000 bonus after taxes, receiving bonuses of $6,693, including the federal taxes owed on the $5,000 bonus.\n\nThe number of new recruits has since jumped to nearly 5,000 since July 2022.\n\nThey include more than 1,200 from out of state and a combined 400 from California, Illinois and New York.\n\nNew recruits have moved to Florida from all 50 states and two U.S. territories, according to the governor's office.\n\nThe SPD also recently announced that Sarasota had no homicides in 2023 and a more than 16% drop in homicides, rapes, robberies, aggravated assaults, burglaries, larcenies and vehicle thefts in 2022.\n\nOverall, Florida is currently experiencing a 50-year crime low.\n\nDeSantis has argued that communities are struggling nationwide in jurisdictions where politicians embraced defunding law enforcement and \"soft on crime policies\" like implementing no cash bail.\n\nIn 2020, the Florida legislature passed protections against defunding law enforcement and began allocating funding to give law enforcement officers $1,000 bonuses for three consecutive years.\n\nIn 2022, the recruitment program was created.\n\nMoody launched the Thin Line Tribute in 2021 to recognize the daily efforts of front-line officers.\n\nIn 2023, she launched the Sunshine Salute Series welcoming 30 new recruits at St. Petersburg College's Southeastern Public Safety Institute, also highlighting new recruits from Philadelphia, Chicago and New York City, The Center Square reported.\n\nIn addition to the new recruit bonus program, law enforcement officers may also be eligible for the Hometown Heroes Housing Program, which provides frontline workers in more than 100 eligible professions with down payment and closing cost assistance to help purchase a primary residence in the communities where they work.\n\nThose interested in applying can find more information here.\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "Tyreek Hill and the continued vilification of the country's police officers\n\nTyreek Hill is not a victim.\n\nTwo weeks ago, a viral video of the NFL wide receiver showed what happened when he broke traffic laws, ignored and disobeyed the commands of police officers, and was arrested. Hill thought he was above the law and instigated a confrontation with law enforcement officers. Despite this, Hill has been allowed to play in every game so far this season.\n\nMany have tried to portray him as a victim, the latest person brutalized by the police force in this country. It's the latest example of the left-wing, anti-police narrative that dominates the country and misrepresents situations to advance this dogma.\n\nAfter calling for the officer he had a confrontation with to be fired, the star player for the Miami Dolphins met with police last week. He said that \"there's been some small steps forward\" with his incident. However, this is problematic. There is no need to \"move forward.\" The police were not the problem. Tyreek Hill was.\n\nUnfortunately, Hill's response and the implied sentiments of \"moving forward\" are indicative of the contemporary despicable propaganda that depicts the police as evil and those in physical confrontations with police officers as docile, innocent victims. And in Hill's case, to perpetuate this anti-police narrative, the fact that it wasn't the police who instigated the situation is being ignored.\n\nHowever, rogue, radical, left-wing politicians have eradicated the notion of respecting police officers long ago. Anyone who suffers the consequences of disrespecting and disobeying the police is now automatically viewed as a victim. Police are essentially expected to acquiesce to anyone who disobeys. The people who risk their lives daily to serve and protect have become targets of contemporary politics and categorized as villains. This is why Hill is being hailed as some kind of victim instead of being viewed as the problem.\n\n\"The reason for the spin is the left-wing anti-police slant that is the bread and butter of the liberal mainstream media outlets which gleefully pushed the 'Defund The Police' agenda without ever stopping to consider the consequences of such lunacy,\" David Gelman, a criminal defense attorney and former deputy district attorney, said. \"Bottom line, serving up the officer as the bad guy serves their purpose. As [for] Hill, he conducted himself like an idiot.\"\n\n\"The officer told him to keep the window down,\" Gelman said. \"That is an easy command to obey. That is a safety issue. He has no idea who Hill is. A raised tinted window presents a huge officer safety issue as the officer can not see what is going on inside the vehicle. This is how officers get shot and killed during seemingly 'routine' motor vehicle stops. All Hill had to do was roll down the window. He did not do that and created the initial circumstances that led to the arrest.\"\n\nHill's claim (and the claim of those who support him) was that the police officer was needlessly aggressive. But this is little more than the perpetual victimization mentality that vilifies responsible residents and lionizes careless and reckless rulebreakers. This is the primary reason for the vitriol directed toward the police in this instance. It's unwarranted.\n\n\"The officer's actions appear to have been driven by legitimate safety concerns and a desire to gain control of the situation as he continued to deal with Hill and simultaneously attempted to deal with random people who were trying to interject themselves into the situation,\" Gelman said. \"Having said that, while the officer could not allow Hill (or any other driver to dictate the situation), the matter escalated very quickly, and there may have been ways to de-escalate the situation. The goal here was to issue the tickets and send him on his way without endangering the officers.\"\n\n\"Hill should have complied,\" the criminal defense attorney said. \"Then none of this happens. Once Hill is non-compliant, the officer must deal with that. The officer is being 'aggressive' to maintain control of the situation. Having said that, since he is issuing him tickets, the officer can keep him there as long as necessary to do that. This gives Hill incentive to comply. Time is on the side of the officers in that regard. But you need to consider the officer safety issue created by Hill's initial compliance. The officer is not required to place his life at risk because a driver is mad about being stopped.\"\n\nThe country has lost sight of this central issue. People view police officers as expendable to justify the disrespectful and ignorant actions exhibited by a wealthy, arrogant professional athlete. Tyreek Hill was not a victim, as he and many in the media have said. He was the aggressor who sought to manipulate the political climate to rationalize his unnecessary antics.\n\nThose who act like Tyreek Hill when interacting with law enforcement are the problem, not the police officers. The sooner everyone recognizes that, the better."

Trump and Vice President JD Vance warned on the campaign trail that 500,000 to a million illegal immigrants with criminal histories would be targeted for arrest and put into deportation proceedings.\n\nThe latest figure has grown to more than 11,000 arrests over the past month.\n\nHOW TRUMP'S ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ARRESTS STACK UP TO 'DEPORTER IN CHIEF' OBAMA\n\nImmigrants are detained in federal custody while an immigration judge determines whether ICE can remove them from the country.\n\nWhite House border czar Tom Homan touted Monday that arrests were up 137% under Trump and that arrests of illegal immigrants who had criminal convictions had doubled.\n\nUpdate: An earlier version of this story cited 600 State employees based on information provided by the DHS. The State Department later responded following publication and said 2,000 employees were part of its Diplomatic Security Service."

Greg Abbott launched his border security mission, Operation Lone Star, in 2021, OLS officers have apprehended more than 530,600 illegal border crossers. They've also made more than 50,000 criminal arrests, with more than 43,000 felony charges reported.\n\nThey've also seized more than 622 million lethal doses of fentanyl - enough to kill everyone in the U.S., Mexico and Canada combined.\n\nThey're also continuing to arrest \"Special Interest Aliens,\" those flagged for potential terrorist ties.\n\nIn Hidalgo County, an OLS Texas Department of Public Safety brush team apprehended four SIAs who illegally entered the U.S. from Turkey, in Mission, Texas. They were led into the country by a coyote from Mexico. DPS arrested the coyote for human smuggling. The Turkish nationals were referred to Border Patrol.\n\nDPS officers have also been arresting SIAs from Afghanistan, the Congo, Egypt and Iran, The Center Square reported. SIAs are noncitizens who, based \"on an analysis of travel patterns,\" are \"known or evaluated to possibly have a nexus to terrorism\" who \"potentially poses a national security risk to the United States,\" the U.S. Department of Homeland Security explains.\n\nOLS Texas National Guard soldiers are also using advanced technology to stop illegal activity along the southern border.\n\nIn a single day, they used a combination of ground surveillance radar and thermal imaging to detect and turn back 62 foreign nationals illegally entering from Mexico.\n\nThey're also conducting \"Migration Operational Readiness Exercises\" (MORE) with DPS and other law enforcement partners along the Rio Grande River. OLS Texas Task Force East - Strike Team is training to provide a quick reaction force to respond to potential mass migration emergencies, 1Lt. Jacob Eggimann said in a recent video announcement.\n\n\"We are conducting a MORE,\" using M2S2, drones, boats, Humvees and other equipment working with law enforcement partners, he said. Many under his command trained as military police and are making \"a clear statement that this is the border,\" he said.\n\n\"This is the line. This is our house. We control our house. We are going to maintain our border and work together with our law enforcement partners to control who is coming in and to protect our communities.\"\n\nThe Modular Mobile Survey System (M2S2) he's referring to enhances their ability to effectively target transnational criminals with infrared, high-definition camera and radar.\n\nFour years into the border crisis, OLS officers are continuing to apprehend human smugglers in Webb County, whose residents overwhelmingly support President-elect Donald Trump and his border policies.\n\nIn one case, the driver of a stolen GMC Sierra led OLS DPS troopers on a high-speed chase on IH-35. During the pursuit, the driver, from San Antonio, crashed into another vehicle while continuing to evade capture. Troopers successfully deployed a tire deflation device, causing the driver to stop. He bailed out and ran toward the brush but was caught and arrested. He was charged with evading arrest, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, reckless driving, failure to stop and render aid, and four counts of smuggling of persons with the likelihood of serious bodily injury or death. Four Mexican illegal border crossers inside the vehicle were turned over to Border Patrol.\n\nIn another case, OLS DPS troopers pulled over the driver of an 18-wheeler on IH-35 who gave consent to search his vehicle. Inside, the trooper found 12 Mexican illegal border crossers, including a 16-year-old.\n\nThe driver and passenger, both from Laredo, were charged with 11 counts of smuggling of persons and one count of smuggling of persons under the age of 18. The Mexicans were turned over to Border Patrol.\n\nWebb County made history in November, voting for Donald Trump and flipping the county red. Its county judge was the latest to switch parties and become a Republican, The Center Square reported.\n\nHispanic Texans, including those living at the border, support Texas border security efforts, according to multiple polls."

      "text": "Police officers have begun using artificial intelligence to write police reports\n\nThe world of artificial intelligence has seemingly entered the realm of law enforcement as some police officers have reported turning to chatbots to write police reports.\n\nSeveral police departments across the nation have sought to implement modern technology into law enforcement and have experimented with using AI to write a first draft of police reports. The Oklahoma City Police Department is one of the units testing the technology and has been pleased with the results so far, according to multiple reports.\n\nOne police officer shared his experience using AI with the Associated Press . Sgt. Matt Gilmore of the Oklahoma City Police Department K-9 unit detailed using the technology after being involved in a suspect search for approximately an hour with his dog Gunner.\n\nThe department's AI tool used the recorded audio picked up from the microphone in Gilmore's body camera to produce a draft of the police report in less than 10 seconds, according to the Associated Press . Gilmore said writing a report without AI usually takes 30 to 45 minutes.\n\n\"It was a better report than I could have ever written, and it was 100% accurate,\" Gilmore said . \"It flowed better. It even documented a fact he didn't remember hearing - another officer's mention of the color of the car the suspects ran from.\"\n\nMany law enforcement officers who have tried AI chatbots to write drafts of political reports share Gilmore's enthusiasm for the technology, according to the Associated Press , expressing delight with how it helps save significant time in otherwise tedious work .\n\n\"They become police officers because they want to do police work, and spending half their day doing data entry is just a tedious part of the job that they hate,\" said Rick Smith , founder and CEO of Axon, the company that developed this AI product known as Draft One.\n\nHowever, others are not so enthralled with AI and have expressed concerns that its use could be problematic within the criminal justice system. Some prosecutors, legal scholars, and police watchdog organizations worry about how the details created by AI in the police report, an integral part of many criminal investigations, could affect a trial, which could determine a suspect's fate and life.\n\n\"Now, there's certainly concerns,\" Smith said. \"They never want to get an officer on the stand who says, well, 'The AI wrote that. I didn't.'\"\n\nCurrent AI technology used by law enforcement, such as those used to scan license plates or recognize suspects' faces, has come under scrutiny because of these concerns. Experts in the criminal justice field and lawmakers have analyzed these tools to develop safeguards and restrictions that protect a person's privacy and civil rights. However, with Draft One, as well as with other AI applications used to produce police report drafts, the technology is such a recent development that there are limited rules and guidelines, if any.\n\nDue to this newness, the Oklahoma City Police Department confirmed that Draft One is not used on \"high-stakes criminal cases.\"\n\n\"So no arrests, no felonies, no violent crimes,\" said Capt. Jason Bussert, the officer responsible for information technology in the department."

A rough criminal, by the way,\" Trump said Tuesday in a preview of the order. \"And I'm actually releasing [them]. I am the friend of police, more than any president that's ever been in this office.\"\n\nThe case in question occurred in October 2020, near the peak of that year's Black Lives Matter protest movement. The incident began when Sutton attempted to speak with 20-year-old Karon Hylton-Brown, who then fled from him on an electric moped. A three-minute chase ensued, which ended in a crash that led to Hylton-Brown's death.\n\nThe case sparked protests in the nation's capital ahead of the election. Sutton was later convicted in September 2024 of second-degree murder and sentenced to 5 1/2 years in prison, while Zabavsky got four years for his role in the incident.\n\nZabavsky's pardon was announced at 5:38 p.m. Eastern time, with Sutton's coming at 6:15 in a moment long sought by law enforcement advocates in the Washington, D.C., area.\n\nPolice officers strongly defended both men during their 2022 trial, and the DC Police Union released a statement this week saying it was working with Trump on the pardons.\n\n\"We are actively working with the White House and President Trump to address two glaring miscarriages of justice involving DC police officers, Officer Terrance Sutton and Lieutenant Andrew Zabavsky, who were wrongly convicted of murder,\" reads the statement, which was obtained by the Washington Examiner. \"These officers - men of integrity and dedication - were targeted by corrupt prosecutors who weaponized the legal system against them.\"\n\nHowever, the same statement criticizes Trump's pardon of Jan. 6 defendants, expressing \"dismay\" for those who assaulted police officers during the Capitol riot.\n\n\"Our stance is clear - anyone who assaults a law enforcement officer should be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law, without exception,\" it reads.\n\nDavid Shurtz, an attorney for Hylton-Brown's family, said Trump was misinformed about the case.\n\n\"A jury of Sutton's and Zabavsky's peers listened to all the evidence and found Officer Sutton guilty of second-degree murder and Sutton and Zabavsky guilty of obstruction of justice and conspiracy,\" he said. \"Last time I checked, juries were supposed to decide guilt or innocence.\"\n\nShurtz said the president is only listening to one side of the story, namely that of the Fraternal Order of Police.\n\n\"Trump is being given bad information by a corrupt police department,\" he said. \"But Trump should know better that citizens who hear the evidence are better triers of facts than political hacks.\""

The day before Thanksgiving, a Border Patrol agent attempted to stop a driver in the far west Texas border county of Presidio. As the agent approached the passenger side of the vehicle, the driver sped off and struck a Border Patrol vehicle, injuring an agent inside, according to the complaint. Authorities were later able to stop the vehicle and apprehend four inside as the driver fled on foot.\n\nThree of the four passengers were in the country illegally from Mexico and Guatemala. The fourth was a passenger stationed at Fort Cavazos. The driver, also stationed at Fort Cavazos, was found the next day at a hotel in Odessa and arrested. A third soldier and alleged recruiter and facilitator of the human smuggling conspiracy was also arrested and charged.\n\nTwo soldiers allegedly traveled from Fort Cavazos to Presidio with the intent of picking up illegal border crossers and transporting them further into the interior. After executing search warrants, law enforcement authorities found text messages the three soldiers allegedly sent to each other about the smuggling operation.\n\nOne soldier was charged with one count of bringing in and harboring aliens, two were charged with one count of bringing in and harboring aliens and one count of assaulting a federal agent, according the complaint.\n\nIn October, a former Border Patrol agent was sentenced to 50 years in prison for 10 counts related to the production, distribution and possession of child sexual abuse material. The former agent produced and distributed hundreds of image and video files depicting a child victim engaged in sexually explicit content, according to the complaint.\n\nAlso in October, a former police officer in Eagle Pass was sentenced to 10 years in prison for her role in harboring illegal border crossers as part of a smuggling operation using multiple rental properties, according to another complaint. Also in October, a former elected Starr County attorney was sentenced to more than three years in prison for extortion.\n\nIn August, a former National Guardsmen from Alabama stationed in the Rio Grande Valley was convicted of providing information to smugglers about counter-smuggling activities. \"He also scouted for vehicles he knew contained individuals who were illegally present in the United States in order to thwart law enforcement from detecting them,\" according to the complaint.\n\nAs part of a plea deal, the former Eagle Pass officer explained how he provided information to a smuggling organization and worked as a scout \"when loads of aliens would move from Starr and Hidalgo Counties to near the Border Patrol Checkpoint in Jim Wells County.\"\n\nAlso in August, a former investigator in the Waller County District Attorney's Office was sentenced to over 12 years in prison for trafficking drugs and cartel money in his marked police vehicle across state lines from Texas to Louisiana, according to another complaint.\n\nIn July, a civilian Army employee working at Fort Sam Houston was sentenced to 15 years in prison for five counts of mail fraud and five counts of filing a false tax return after stealing more than $108 million from a grant program. The program was designed to provide services to military dependents and their families, according to another complaint.\n\nIn May, the former crime victim's coordinator of the Starr County District Attorney's Office pleaded guilty to smuggling illegal border crossers to Houston using a government vehicle. According to a criminal complaint filed by the county DA, she and her conspirators were involved in more than 40 trips over six months smuggling illegal border crossers from Rio Grande City to Houston.\n\nAlso in May, a former Border Patrol agent was sentenced to 18 months in prison for accepting a $5,000 bribe to provide immigration paperwork to illegal border crossers, according to another complaint.\n\nIn April, a Texas National Guard soldier was arrested for alleged human smuggling after a high-speed chase in Brackettville in Kinney County. He was taken into custody by the Texas Department of Public Safety and charged with evading arrest, smuggling of persons and unlawful carry of a weapon.\n\nLast year, a former Army major and seven others were arrested for allegedly trafficking more than 100 military grade firearms to a drug cartel in Mexico. In March, five men were arrested in Laredo, Hebbronville and Falls City for their role in the scheme, according to the complaint.\n\nThe above examples solely highlight cases from the past nine months in the southern and western districts of Texas. They exclude hundreds of U.S. citizens and foreign nationals who've been found guilty of committing similar or worse crimes."

They've also made more than 50,000 criminal arrests, with more than 43,000 felony charges reported.\n\nThey've also seized more than 622 million lethal doses of fentanyl - enough to kill everyone in the U.S., Mexico and Canada combined.\n\nThey're also continuing to arrest \"Special Interest Aliens,\" those flagged for potential terrorist ties.\n\nIn Hidalgo County, an OLS Texas Department of Public Safety brush team apprehended four SIAs who illegally entered the U.S. from Turkey, in Mission, Texas. They were led into the country by a coyote from Mexico. DPS arrested the coyote for human smuggling. The Turkish nationals were referred to Border Patrol.\n\nDPS officers have also been arresting SIAs from Afghanistan, the Congo, Egypt and Iran, The Center Square reported . SIAs are noncitizens who, based \"on an analysis of travel patterns,\" are \"known or evaluated to possibly have a nexus to terrorism\" who \"potentially poses a national security risk to the United States,\" the U.S. Department of Homeland Security explains.\n\nOLS Texas National Guard soldiers are also using advanced technology to stop illegal activity along the southern border.\n\nIn a single day, they used a combination of ground surveillance radar and thermal imaging to detect and turn back 62 foreign nationals illegally entering from Mexico.\n\nThey're also conducting \"Migration Operational Readiness Exercises\" (MORE) with DPS and other law enforcement partners along the Rio Grande River. OLS Texas Task Force East - Strike Team is training to provide a quick reaction force to respond to potential mass migration emergencies, 1Lt. Jacob Eggimann said in a recent video announcement.\n\n\"We are conducting a MORE,\" using M2S2, drones, boats, Humvees and other equipment working with law enforcement partners, he said. Many under his command trained as military police and are making \"a clear statement that this is the border,\" he said.\n\n\"This is the line. This is our house. We control our house. We are going to maintain our border and work together with our law enforcement partners to control who is coming in and to protect our communities.\"\n\nThe Modular Mobile Survey System (M2S2) he's referring to enhances their ability to effectively target transnational criminals with infrared, high-definition camera and radar.\n\nThis week, Soldiers participated in a Migration Operational Readiness Exercise (MORE) along with the Texas Department of Public Safety (DPS). These and other exercises are part of Operation Lone Star's ongoing mission to deter, detect, and interdict transnational criminal activity.\n\nFour years into the border crisis, OLS officers are continuing to apprehend human smugglers in Webb County, whose residents overwhelmingly support President-elect Donald Trump and his border policies.\n\nIn one case, the driver of a stolen GMC Sierra led OLS DPS troopers on a high-speed chase on IH-35. During the pursuit, the driver, from San Antonio, crashed into another vehicle while continuing to evade capture. Troopers successfully deployed a tire deflation device, causing the driver to stop. He bailed out and ran toward the brush but was caught and arrested. He was charged with evading arrest, unauthorized use of a motor vehicle, reckless driving, failure to stop and render aid, and four counts of smuggling of persons with the likelihood of serious bodily injury or death. Four Mexican illegal border crossers inside the vehicle were turned over to Border Patrol.\n\nIn another case, OLS DPS troopers pulled over the driver of an 18-wheeler on IH-35 who gave consent to search his vehicle. Inside, the trooper found 12 Mexican illegal border crossers, including a 16-year-old.\n\nThe driver and passenger, both from Laredo, were charged with 11 counts of smuggling of persons and one count of smuggling of persons under the age of 18. The Mexicans were turned over to Border Patrol.\n\nDuring a traffic stop on IH-35 Webb County, the driver of a truck tractor semi-trailer gave consent to a DPS Trooper to search his vehicle. Upon searching the vehicle, the Trooper discovered 12 illegal immigrants, including a 16-year-old juvenile, being smuggled in the sleeper area. The Trooper arrested the driver and passenger of the vehicle, Armando Vela and June Olivo, both from Laredo, with 11 counts of smuggling of persons and one count of smuggling of persons under the age of 18. The group of 12 illegal immigrants, from Mexico, were referred to Border Patrol.\n\nWebb County made history in November, voting for Donald Trump and flipping the county red. Its county judge was the latest to switch parties and become a Republican, The Center Square reported .\n\nHispanic Texans, including those living at the border, support Texas border security efforts, according to multiple polls."

      "text": "Republican row officers sworn-in after historic sweep\n\n(The Center Square) - It was a full day of celebration in Harrisburg honoring the inaugurations of Treasurer Stacy Garrity, Auditor General Timothy DeFoor, and Attorney General David Sunday.\n\nThis marks the first time all three row officer positions have been held by Republicans.\n\nGarrity and DeFoor both pledged to build from the momentum they'd gained during their first terms in their respective roles, while Sunday outlined his vision  for the state's highest law enforcement office.\n\nGov. Josh Shapiro spoke at each of the three ceremonies, which were otherwise filled with speakers and performers who showed the unique thumbprint of each official.\n\nSeveral times, the phrase, \"All public service is a trust given in faith and accepted in honor,\" was invoked. It is inscribed on the Finance Building, which hosts the offices of the treasurer and auditor.\n\nGarrity's ceremony included a touching tribute to her late father who she took time away from her role to care for at the end of his cancer journey last year. Throughout the ceremony, speakers placed great emphasis on the Iraq War veteran's compassion.\n\nFormer Executive Deputy Treasurer Hugh Allen, who Garrity kept on staff after her Democratic predecessor, called the entire Garrity name \"strong-willed, iron-spined, compassionate people,\" while Shapiro referred to the treasurer as \"mission driven.\"\n\nFor Garrity, that mission includes a strong focus on 529 educational savings plans and returning unclaimed property. A strong Trump supporter, the treasurer struck a hopeful tone for the year to come, drawing a stark contrast to many of the concerns playing out on the national inaugural stage.\n\n\"We must put aside past disagreements, embrace this moment of opportunity, and find common ground,\" she said. \"We cannot grow by division. We can - and will - grow by working together to make Pennsylvania a leader among states, and to make Pennsylvania a place where our next generation can succeed and prosper.\"\n\nAuditor Timothy DeFoor made history in his first term both for being the first person of color elected to statewide office and for being the first actual auditor elected to the Auditor General position. His previous roles include stints as an investigator  in both the Office of the Inspector General and the Office of Attorney General.\n\nFormer Gov. Mark Schweiker lauded DeFoor's work in the position and invoked Martin Luther King, Jr. in his praise. DeFoor himself reflected on his unlikely trajectory from a \"shy kid who hated math.\"\n\n\"I strive to be a leader who does the job the way it is supposed to be done-someone who draws conclusions based on facts, not politics, and serves the people of Pennsylvania by improving government, not tearing it down,\" said DeFoor.\n\nThe auditor also spoke of the importance of financial literacy, creating career pathways within the auditor's office, and his work in exposing the role Pharmacy Benefit Managers play in forcing independent pharmacies out of the market.\n\nDavid Sunday, a former district attorney from York County, received kind words from Sen. Kristin Phillips-Hill, R-Jacobus, who represents his district in the state senate. \"Dave Sunday doesn't just talk about getting stuff done,\" said Phillips-Hill. \"He actually does get stuff done.\"\n\nSunday was later introduced by his wife Lishani and their 10-year-old son.\n\nThe Attorney General is known for his approach to curbing the heroin epidemic in York County. His creation of the York County Heroin Task Force in 2014 incorporated health care professionals along with government and law enforcement to address the problem.\n\n\"I don't care who gets credit, as long as the mission is achieved,\" said Sunday of his work, noting that it makes him a \"terrible politician.\"\n\nSunday promises to bring a similar energy to the state's mental health crisis, citing the impact on public safety. He reiterated the philosophy of \"accountability and redemption\" used throughout his campaign.\n\n\"We absolutely must hold criminals accountable,\" he said. \"At the same time, we need to embrace redemption for those who have been held accountable and seek to better their lives. Remember, 95% of everyone who enters prison will eventually reenter society.\""

      "text": "Federal Judge Declines To Halt Firings Of CIA Officers Tied To DEI Programs\n\nAuthored by Aldgra Fredly via The Epoch Times,\n\nA federal judge declined on Thursday to grant a temporary restraining order that would have extended a block on the termination of dozens of CIA officers who worked in diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility (DEIA) programs, which President Donald Trump had ordered to be dismantled.\n\nU.S. District Judge Anthony Trenga in Virginia previously issued an administrative stay to pause the firings following a lawsuit filed by career intelligence officers who had been assigned to DEIA-related assignments temporarily within the CIA and the Office of Director of National Intelligence (ODNI).\n\nIn the Feb. 27 order , Trenga said that he had denied the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction, which could have prevented the agencies from firing them while the case was ongoing.\n\nThe judge extended a deadline for the plaintiffs to take on a deferred resignation program, which would allow them to receive pay until Sept. 30.\n\nTrenga did not provide a specific reason for his decision in the order. The judge stated that the ruling was made after considering \"the filings, the record in this case, and oral argument\" presented to the court.\n\nKevin Carroll, a former CIA undercover officer representing the plaintiffs, told reporters on Thursday that Trenga has ruled CIA Director John Ratcliffe holds \"sweeping statutory authority\" to terminate CIA officers if he deems it necessary for the national interest.\n\nThe Epoch Times reached out to Carroll and the CIA for comment but did not receive a response by publication time.\n\nCarroll previously revealed that the plaintiffs were among the 51 CIA officers placed on paid administrative leave on Jan. 22, after Trump issued an executive order that labeled existing DEIA programs \"illegal and immoral.\"\n\nAccording to the court filing , the plaintiffs were instructed on Feb. 14 to report to the CIA visitors' center with their intelligence community (IC) access badges and were given three options: retire immediately, accept a deferred resignation program, or be terminated on May 20. They were required to decide by Feb. 19.\n\nThe plaintiffs alleged that their imminent termination was not based on national security reasons but rather due to their temporary DEIA-related assignments and \"a domestic political dispute between the Republican and Democratic parties regarding the efficacy and legality of DEIA initiatives\" within the federal government.\n\nThey alleged that the firings were \"arbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion\" and lacked factual justification, which they claimed violated their constitutional rights under the First and Fifth Amendments.\n\n\"None of these officers' activities was or is illegal. At no time have the agencies employing plaintiffs contended that they individually engaged in any misconduct, nor are they accused of poor performance,\" they stated in the court filing.\n\nIn his order, Trump said the previous administration forced \"illegal and immoral discrimination programs\" into virtually \"all aspects\" of the federal government through DEI initiatives.\n\nThe order mandates that federal agencies terminate all offices and positions related to environmental justice, as well as any equity-focused action plans, grants, and contracts within 60 days of the order's issuance.\n\nIt also requires agencies to compile a list of grantees who received federal funding to implement DEI and environmental justice programs since Jan. 20, 2021, and federal contractors who have provided DEI training to their employees.\n\nFollowing the order, the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) issued a memo on Jan. 21 instructing federal agencies to place DEI employees on paid leave by Jan. 22 and to remove all websites and social media accounts associated with DEI initiatives by that date.\n\nTrump's order aligns with his campaign pledge to eliminate factors such as race and sex in HR decisions in favor of merit-based selection processes.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "DOJ Moves To Drop Lawsuit Seeking to Block Texas Officers From Arresting Illegal Immigrants\n\nAuthored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times,\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has notified a court that it wants a lawsuit against a Texas immigration law dismissed.\n\n\"Plaintiff the United States of America hereby voluntarily dismisses the above-captioned action,\" lawyers for the DOJ said in a March 18 filing.\n\nThe DOJ did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nUnder President Joe Biden, the DOJ in 2024 sued Texas over a state law that enabled state police officers to arrest and deport illegal immigrants.\n\n\"Texas cannot disregard the United States Constitution and settled Supreme Court precedent,\" Brian M. Boynton, the principal deputy assistant attorney general at the time, said in a Jan. 4 statement on the suit.\n\n\"We have brought this action to ensure that Texas adheres to the framework adopted by Congress and the Constitution for regulation of immigration.\"\n\nSenate Bill 4, the law, created state crimes for illegally entering the United States, authorized state judges to order the deportation of some illegal immigrants, and required state officials to carry out the orders.\n\nThe legal challenge resulted in the law being blocked as courts weighed the case brought by the DOJ.\n\nU.S. District Judge David Ezra, who entered an injunction against the statute, said in his February 2024 order that states under the U.S. Constitution \"may not exercise immigration enforcement power except as authorized by the federal government.\"\n\nMore recently, on Jan. 31, Ezra said that in light of developments, Texas law enforcement is permitted \"to cooperate with and act under the direction of Federal authorities in the apprehension, arrest, and detention of undocumented persons found within the borders of the State of Texas without legal authorization from the United States Government.\"\n\nHe also said that Texas judges and officers still cannot deport illegal immigrants and that other portions of the injunction remain in effect.\n\nThe developments included two executive orders from President Donald Trump, one of which stated that it was his administration's policy to deter and prevent illegal immigrants from entering the United States and promptly remove all immigrants who illegally enter or are in the country in violation of federal law.\n\nThe other said that the U.S. secretary of homeland security will work with state and local officials to apprehend and deport illegal immigrants.\n\nThe DOJ previously dropped Biden-era lawsuits that challenged state immigration laws in Oklahoma and Iowa. Similar to the Texas case, officials under Biden had said that the laws violated the U.S. Constitution because they created state-level immigration systems that ran afoul of the federal system.\n\n*  *  *\n\nDown to our last few green Waxed Canvas Hats!\n\n*  *  *\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Pentagon Purge: Trump Fires Chairman Of Joint Chiefs, Navy Chief And Other Top Brass\n\nMaking good on a campaign pledge to shake up the senior military ranks to ensure a focus on his policy priorities, President Trump on Friday night took the extraordinary step of firing the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and five more senior Pentagon officers . The fired chair, Air Force Gen. Charles Q. Brown Jr., had only served two-and-a-half years of his four-year term.\n\nChairmen of the Joint Chiefs usually stay in their posts when control of the White House changes hands. Trump's move immediately triggered accusations that he was politicizing the US military. \"A professional, apolitical military that is subordinate to the civilian government and supportive of the Constitution rather than a political party is essential to the survival of our democracy,\" said Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed in a statement\n\nTo replace Brown, Trump has nominated retired USAF Lt. Gen. Dan \"Razin\" Cain. The selection of Cain is highly unusual: Not only had he already retired from service, but he would be the first three-star general to ascend to the highest post in the US military. Cain is a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute and an F-16 pilot credited with 150 combat hours and two tours in Iraq. From 2021 to 2024, Cain served as the CIA's associate director for military affairs , collaborating on several highly classified initiatives, the New York Times reports.\n\nAnnouncing the nomination on Truth Social , Trump's praised Cain's performance against ISIS:\n\n\"During my first term, Razin was instrumental in the complete annihilation of the ISIS caliphate . It was done in record setting time, a matter of weeks. Many so-called military 'geniuses' said it would take years to defeat ISIS. General Caine, on the other hand, said it could be done quickly, and he delivered.\"\n\nWhile praising Cain, Trump accused his own predecessor for failing to recognize Cain's talents. \"Despite being highly qualified and respected to serve on the Joint Chiefs of Staff during the previous administration, General Caine was passed over for promotion by Sleepy Joe Biden. But not anymore!\"\n\nTrump was gracious, however, toward the fired chairman, thanking Brown for \"his over 40 years of service to our country,\" calling him \"a fine gentleman and an outstanding leader,\" and wishing him \"a great future for him and his family.\"\n\nBrown was just one of six casualties on Friday night. After Trump's announcement, Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth issued a statement indicating that Chief of Naval Operations Adm Lisa Franchetti, Air Force Vice Chief of Staff James Slife have also been removed , along with the judge advocates general of the Army, Navy and Air Force.\n\nWhile no reason was given for the removal of the top lawyers of three largest military branches, the action comes after Hegseth's repeated criticism of what he says are unwarranted restrictions on how soldiers conduct themselves on the battlefield . In his Senate confirmation hearing, Hegseth said military lawyers put \"his or her own priorities in front of the war fighters, their promotions, their medals, in front of having the backs of those making the tough calls on the front lines.\"\n\nAs for the other officers, Trump and Hegseth promised to clear out officers deemed too have embraced woke ideology , to include emphasis on diversity, equity and inclusion over merit and performance. In his book, War on Warriors, Hegseth criticized Brown for \"[making] the race card one of his biggest calling cards,\" and Hegseth questioned whether Brown's ascent resulted from merit or his skin color. Trump himself nominated Brown to become the Air Force chief of of staff in 2020 , and heralded the fact that Brown would be the \"first-ever African American military service chief.\"\n\nIn November, Hegseth called for Brown to be fired, along with others on the wrong side of woke-ism:\n\n\"First of all, you've got to fire the chairman of the Joint Chiefs ...But any general that was involved -- general, admiral, whatever -- that was involved in any of the DEI woke shit has got to go. Either you're in for warfighting, and that's it. That's the only litmus test we care about.\"\n\nIn his book, Hegseth also questioned Franchetti's qualifications to serve as the highest ranking Navy officer, sarcastically writing, \"If naval operations suffer, at least we can hold our heads high. Because at least we have another first! The first female member of the Joint Chiefs of Staff - hooray.\"\n\nMore recently, Hegseth used a Pentagon town hall to declare that diversity initiatives were \"dividing the force as oppose to uniting it.\" Driving the point home, he pointedly attacked one of the most cherished rhetorical cornerstones of woke ideology, saying, \"The single dumbest phrase in military history is 'our diversity is our strength'.\"\n\n*  *  *\n\nYou can support ZeroHedge by picking up a waxed canvas hat !\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "These Are The States Where It's Toughest To Be A Criminal\n\nA study by Summit Defense Criminal Lawyers ranks U.S. states by arrest likelihood, based on police presence and arrest rates.\n\nUsing law enforcement data normalized per 100K people, it calculates a Crime Arrest Risk Score by summing police personnel and comparing it to arrest rates. Higher scores indicate a greater chance of arrest in criminal cases.\n\nAmong the key findings, the study found South Dakota ranks first among states with the highest likelihood of arrest, reporting 5,878 arrests, the highest rate nationwide. Louisiana follows in second place, boasting the largest police presence at 350 officers, increasing the chances of lawbreakers being caught.\n\nIt also found, incredibly, that New York takes third place, with 10,450 first-line supervisors of police and detectives, the highest in the country, making arrests more likely for criminals, the study says.\n\nWyoming ranks fourth, with an arrest rate of 3,681 per 100K and 271 officers per 100K residents, giving it a score of 81. North Dakota takes fifth place, recording 4,033 arrests per 100K, the second-highest among top-ranking states, with a score of 77. Illinois follows in sixth, featuring a strong police presence of 288 officers per 100K and a total of 36,190 officers statewide, achieving a score of 71.\n\nFlorida ranks seventh, with a large police force of 55,310 officers, including 8,310 first-line supervisors, and an arrest rate near 3,700 per 100K.\n\nNew Hampshire takes eighth place with 252 officers per 100K residents and an arrest rate of 3,385 per 100K, earning a score of 68.\n\nTennessee follows in ninth place, reporting 245 officers per 100K and an arrest rate of 3,523 per 100K. Finally, Alabama rounds out the top ten with 269 officers per 100K, 12,600 patrol officers, and a Crime Arrest Risk Score of 67.\n\n\"The criminal justice system can vary significantly from state to state, leading to differing approaches in handling crimes. Arrest rate variations across states may stem from differences in state laws, sentencing guidelines, and enforcement priorities, all of which impact how offenses are handled. In such a complex legal environment, having experienced legal counsel is crucial for ensuring fair treatment and safeguarding one's rights,\" a spokesperson from Summit Defense Criminal Lawyers concluded.\n\nYou can view the whole study here .\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Trump Considers No Taxes For Police Officers, Firefighters And Military\n\nThe race to shock and awe with the greatest number of tax cuts ahead of the November 5 election is nearing its climax.\n\nDonald Trump said he'd consider exempting police officers, firefighters, active duty military and veterans from paying taxes, the Republican nominee's latest campaign trail idea to deliver tax breaks to key groups of supporters.\n\n\"It's something I would think about,\" Trump said in response to a question about excluding first responders and military members from tax bills on an online show Maintaining with Tyrus that aired Friday.\n\n\"You're like my tax person there, but yeah. I mean something has to be done,\" he said. \"It's almost an incentive to where you can get people interested.\"\n\nThe idea to exempt members of the military and first responders from taxation is the latest in a long list of tax proposals Trump has talked about while campaigning against Kamala Harris. He's pledged to i) eliminate taxes on tipped wages, ii) taxes on overtime pay and iii) taxes on Social Security benefits.\n\nTo be sure, Trump didn't give any more details about the service member tax exclusion, and any such ideas would require congressional approval in order to become law, which is why absent a Republican sweep most of Trump's promises will end up as being just hot air.\n\nThe no-taxes-on-military-and-first-responders idea could be among the largest new tax cuts he's discussed to date, exempting more than 20 million people from federal tax payments. According to Bloomberg , there are about 18 million living veterans in the US, roughly 1.3 million active duty troops, approximately 1 million police offers in the US and more than 300,000 professional firefighters, according to several estimates. The US does offer some broad tax exemption to military members, but that is largely limited to people who are serving in active combat zones.\n\nOver the last several months, Trump has rolled out a steady drumbeat of politically beneficial tax cut plans focused on key election constituencies, as a way to appeal to voters in an extremely tight election - particularly, low-and-middle-income Americans frustrated by high prices. The Republican nominee has thrown out such a wide range of tax proposals that even his own advisers are unsure about which ones he intends to enact if elected.\n\nNow that it is clear that neither candidate gives a rat's ass about the war-time US budget deficit which just hit a mindblowing 6% of GDP despite US GDP allegedly growing at a 3%+ rate...\n\n... Trump it taking his tax break promises to the limit while also campaigning on extending the tax cut first passed when he was president. Major portions of that law, including lower tax brackets for households and deductions for small businesses, are set to expire at the end of 2025. Trump has also pledged to further lower the corporate rate to 15% from 21% and expand the state and local tax deduction, a write-off popular in New York and California where Republicans face close House elections to keep their majority in the chamber.\n\nEconomists have warned that his policy portfolio may balloon the federal debt, adding as much as $15 trillion to the debt over the next decade, according to an estimate from the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. Trump contends that economic growth and energy production would offset the loss in tax revenue.\n\nOf course, the only other presidential candidate that could balloon the federal debt more than Trump is Kamala Harris, whose admin has seen US debt grow by $8 trillion, with US debt growth set to double or triple if her promises of reparations to blacks are realized.\n\nIn the Friday interview, Trump also suggested military members should become teachers when asked about measures to secure schools.\n\n\"So what about teachers that are in the military and they're teachers, they leave the military, they become history teachers,\" Trump said. \"They're in the room and they get to know the students and they know how to use a gun. You can't have people that don't have any idea about what to do with guns.\"\n\nSome states, including Iowa and Tennessee, have passed laws allowing teachers to carry concealed weapons on school campuses, a controversial measure that has faced broad criticism from teachers unions and some parents, who say that will make schools less safe.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Decline Of Senior Officer Integrity And Civilian Control Of The Military\n\nAuthored by Keith T. Holcomb via RealClearDefense ,\n\nPublic confidence in the military has slipped. One major reason is the politicization of senior military officers, who show an increasing propensity to compromise their integrity to gain influence and achieve both budgetary and policy goals. Their willingness to spin carefully parsed and knowingly misleading testimony and advice compromises civilian control of the military. Simply stated, these generals and admirals are not providing full and complete representations of plans, concepts, and assessments to senior civilians in the executive and legislative branches, thereby depriving them of the unbiased information they require to make decisions required by the Constitution.\n\nIn an era of increasing complexity, cleverly constructed narratives that present simplified, politicized positions to the general population have taken on out-sized importance . Senior officers increasingly are attempting to manipulate policy making by intentionally reducing complex reality to simple narratives designed to appeal to partisan audiences.\n\nIntegrity has two meanings pertinent to this issue: the common understanding of integrity as honesty and the less common and more formal understanding of integrity as the quality of being whole and complete.\n\nPreparation for and experience in combat develops strong wills. Senior officers motivated by the desire to get the biggest possible piece of the pie for their services are tempted to dissemble to win the internecine budget and policy fights that are the lifeblood of official Washington. When these wills are not properly constrained by higher commitments to integrity and respect for the decision-making province of civilian authorities, generals and admirals can succumb to the temptation to deceive.\n\nThese deceptions can take many forms. A senior officer can choose to highlight some information. Conversely, they can obfuscate, discredit, or ignore other information. They can allude to expert knowledge or classified information to undercut or deflect questions that challenge their assertions. They can use the age-old technique of making strawmen of opposing views. Worse, they can engage in or encourage subordinates or cultivated commentators to engage in ad hominem attacks on the messengers of alternate views.\n\nWhile the hyper-political environment sees daily evidence of such behaviors, some senior officers have exercised considerable self-discipline and have not let advocacy for a position override respect for the prerogatives of senior civilians. In short, just because they have the leadership persona, verbal skills, and communication staffs to construct one-sided positions and perhaps even succeed in the manipulation of some people, they have worked to develop full and balanced representations of the issues at hand. Theirs has been a triumph of professional ethics over the abuse of information to achieve their ends.\n\nRegrettably, that admirable conduct is in decline and that decline is a contributing factor for decreasing public trust in the military. The American public may not know the specific capabilities of various weapons or the operational implications of various policies. But constant exposure to spun narratives has trained them to recognize manipulation when they see and hear it. Many resent being manipulated, and their sense that such techniques are being used by the Nation's most senior officers undermines their trust and confidence in the military. The military was once recognized as a profession culturally apart from the rest of society, but no longer. America's military, and its senior officers especially, are increasingly viewed as no less cynically self-interested than the rest of the elite class.\n\nThe decline of senior officer integrity increasingly impacts civilian decision makers. Not long ago, overbooked national leaders could confidently \"repose special trust and confidence\" in the senior officers providing assessments and recommendations to them. The disciplined and honorable behaviors of past generations of generals and admirals certainly validated this special trust and confidence. But, with a rise in manipulative narratives, civilian leaders and their staffs are more likely to feel compelled to dig into the details of complex military matters to gain the full and complete picture they need to discharge their responsibilities.\n\nIn short, it is past time for senior officers to forego their increasing addiction to the power opiate of clever narratives and work to present full and balanced representations of the issues at hand.\n\nAbsent immediate internal reform by the Department of Defense, civilian leaders will increasingly have to turn, just as they have with other federal agencies, to independent investigations to gain a more complete understanding of national security issues.\n\nBrigadier General Keith T.

      "text": "Judge Strikes Part Of Federal Law, Making It Easier To Remove 'Powerful' Judges\n\nAuthored by Zachary Stieber via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\n\nSome judges can be removed at will, rather than for cause, a federal judge said in a new Dec. 10 ruling as he also removed a layer of protection for the judges.\n\nNational Labor Relations Board (NLRB) administrative law judges have been protected in a complex scheme that requires the board to petition a different agency, the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, to remove the judges. Even if the protection board agrees, the NLRB can only act if \"good cause\" for removal is found.\n\nAdding to the \"byzantine process,\" members of both boards can only be removed themselves for certain reasons, such as neglect of duty, U.S. District Judge Trevor McFadden wrote in the new decision.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution gives the president executive power, which includes, according to Congress and court rulings, the power to remove subordinates. The exceptions are for inferior officers and some boards.\n\nIn 2010, U.S. Supreme Court justices said that a scheme protecting Public Company Accounting Oversight Board officers was unconstitutional because it placed the president two layers away from removal. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which appointed the members, could only remove the members for good cause. SEC commissioners themselves could only be fired by the president for neglect of duty, malfeasance in office, or inefficiency.\n\n\"In short, two protective layers was one too many ,\" McFadden said. \"So too here.\"\n\nThe protection NLRB judges have \"could result in federal officers pursuing unordained and perhaps unwise paths, with the only fear of reprisal shrouded in a maze of red tape,\" the judge said. \"Such attenuation from accountability was precisely what the Framers warned against when they rebuffed calls to fashion a plural executive.\"\n\nThe NLRB said in court filings that the administrative law judges have less power than Public Company Accounting Oversight Board officers and that they are more easily removed than the officers. McFadden said the judges are \"powerful actors in the Executive Branch\" because they can manage cases without oversight, including granting applications for subpoenas, and that the easier removal does not change the multilayer removal scheme.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruling \"was clear in its admonition: Officers of the United States cannot be insulated from the removal power by two or more levels of decisionmakers who themselves enjoy job protection,\" the judge said. \"To find otherwise would poison the soil of Article II and choke off accountability to the President. The removal restrictions are unconstitutional.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court has not weighed in on the matter. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has found SEC administrative law judges, which had similar protections to NLRB judges, were unconstitutionally protected. Three other circuit courts have found administrative law judge protections to be constitutional.\n\nIn two of those rulings, the courts \"placed too much weight on the adjudicatory 'functions'\" of the judges, ignoring how the judges \"were nonetheless exerting executive power, case by case,\" McFadden said. The third ruling was reversed by the Supreme Court, on other grounds.\n\n\" That is a tenuous reed to sustain the NLRB's position, \" he said.\n\nIn a two-page order, McFadden said that NLRB judges can now be removed by the board itself, without input from the Merit Systems Protection Board.\n\nThe ruling came in a case brought by VHS Acquisition Subsidiary Number 7 Inc., which does business as Saint Vincent Hospital.\n\nA spokeswoman for the NLRB declined to comment. A lawyer for the hospital, which is in Massachusetts, did not return an inquiry.\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Man Who Attacked Times Square Police Officers With Machete Sentenced To 27 Years\n\nAuthored by Ryan Morgan via The Epoch Times (emphasis ours),\n\nA federal judge has handed down a 27-year prison sentence to the suspect who pleaded guilty to attacking a trio of New York Police Department (NYPD) officers in Times Square on New Year's Eve 2022 in the name of radical Islamic extremism.\n\nTrevor Bickford, 20, of Wells, Maine, pleaded guilty in January to multiple counts of attempting three attempted murder charges and three charges of assaulting U.S. employees or officers just over a year prior on Dec. 31, 2022. Together, the charges carried a maximum potential penalty of up to 120 years in prison.\n\nOn Thursday, May 9, U.S. District Judge Kevin Castel sentenced Mr. Bickford to serve 324 months in prison for the attack, a period lasting 27 years. The sentence is longer than the 10-year prison term Mr. Bickford's lawyers requested but less than the 50-year prison term prosecutors had sought.\n\nDuring the 2022 attack, Mr. Bickford allegedly shouted \"Allahu Akbar,\" a n Arabic phrase meaning \"God is great,\" that perpetrators have shouted in past Islamic extremist incidents. Federal prosecutors had alleged and were prepared to present evidence at trial, including post-Miranda statements from Mr. Bickford, indicating he had desired to travel abroad to wage \"jihad\" but instead chose to carry out his attack closer to home.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Justice said Mr. Bickford had spent months consuming radical Islamist materials, \"including materials promoting the Taliban and reflecting the teachings of Sheikh Abu Muhammad Al-Maqdisi, a prominent radical Islamic cleric who was a spiritual mentor of al Qaeda,\" prior to carrying out the attack.\n\n\"The defendant's brutal ambush of three New York City police officers keeping watch over New Year's Eve celebrations was a premeditated act of terrorism,\" FBI Director Christopher Wray said Thursday.\n\nThe New Year's Eve attack began near the edge of a high-security zone where revelers were to be screened before joining the celebrations in Times Square. Mr. Bickford admitted to swinging a 13-inch machete-like chopping blade called a khukuri toward the heads of NYPD Officers Michael Hanna, Louis Lorio, and Paul Cozzolino, causing injuries to all three men.\n\nThe three officers sustained lacerations to their heads during the attack.\n\nMr. Lorio said he could barely remain conscious after a large cut to his scalp required seven stitches that night. He told the court he now has migraine headaches several days a week and is likely to be forced into retirement after a decade-long police career as he copes with anxiety and depression that cause him to \"burst out crying for no reason\" or cripple him with waves of sadness. Therapy, though, has helped, he added.\n\nMr. Cozzolino, who had graduated from the police academy only a day before the attack, said some of his physical pain, such as headaches, will last forever.\n\nAs he swung his blade at the NYPD officers, Mr. Bickford also allegedly attempted to take one of the officer's guns.\n\nIt was Mr. Hanna who, despite being injured, reportedly managed to put an end to the attack by drawing his service weapon and shooting Mr. Bickford in the shoulder.\n\nMr. Bickford's legal team pointed to mental illness as a contributing factor in the attack.\n\n\" I understand that I left scars, physical and mental ,\" Mr. Bickford said when given the chance to address the court during his sentencing. \"My mental illness took me down a dark path.\"\n\nDefense attorney Marisa Cabrera said her client is \"deeply remorseful.\" She said her client came from a family with a background in U.S. military service and said her client had sought to join the military before his mental illness prevented that possibility. Ms. Cabrera said her client \"has returned to his old self with the aid of medication and treatment.\"\n\nJudge Castel noted Mr. Bickford's history of mental health issues and his relatively young age as reasons for granting some leniency in his sentence.\n\nNTD News reached out to Ms. Cabrera for comment following the sentencing decision but did not receive a response by press time.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this article.\n\nFrom NTD News\n\nAssistance and Requests: Contact Us\n\nTips: tips@zerohedge.com\n\nGeneral: info@zerohedge.com\n\nLegal: legal@zerohedge.com\n\nAdvertising: Contact Us\n\nAbuse/Complaints: abuse@zerohedge.com\n\nMake sure to read our \"How To [Read/Tip Off] Zero Hedge Without Attracting The\n                        Interest Of [Human Resources/The Treasury/Black\n                        Helicopters]\" Guide\n\nIt would be very wise of you to study our privacy policy and our (non)policy on conflicts / full disclosure .

      "text": "Time to Defund Consent Decrees: Unelected Monitors Do Not Make the Public Safe Unjustified consent decrees inflicted on cities, many by the Biden administration, are costly and remove law enforcement oversight responsibilities from elected officials.\n\nP utting handcuffs on good cops is a bad idea. For too long, the U.S. Department of Justice has forced some American cities to pay wealthy private lawyers to oversee their police departments rather than the officials elected by citizens to do that job. It's time to curb this pernicious trend and President Trump should remove those restraints.\n\nThe Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994 allowed the Justice Department to seek federal oversight of law enforcement agencies engaged in alleged patterns of unconstitutional conduct. Since then, numerous cities have been forced into signing \"consent decrees\" that essentially turn over management of their police to outside \"monitors\" who too often lack a deep and even-handed understanding of police work. Worse yet, many don't even live in the community they oversee.\n\nIn too many cases, these federal bullying tactics are tinged with extremist politics. For example , Louisville, Kentucky just signed a consent decree . It followed a 2020 incident when police officers serving a lawful warrant were shot at by a man in the house they were searching. An officer was hit. The shooter's girlfriend - a woman named Breonna Taylor, who was standing near the gunman - was tragically killed when officers returned fire.\n\nEven though the Kentucky attorney general, David Cameron, announced grand jury findings that the officers were justified in their use of force , Joe Biden's Justice Department, nevertheless used a warped view of that situation and a handful of others as a pretext to allege a pattern of racism in the Louisville Metro Police De partment and forced the city into a consent decree wherein an outsider - typically a lawyer with serious antipathy toward cops - monitors the department. Louisville residents must pay about $1.5 million a year to have someone other than their city leaders manage their police. And that's cheap compared to what New Orleans taxpayers pay - $132 million .\n\nOther cities - most of which are already facing budgetary shortfalls - are also paying for consent decrees, including Los Angeles , Baltimore , Minneapoli s , Albuquerque , and Pittsburgh .\n\nIn Ohio, where I serve as an elected county prosecutor, Cleveland has endured such a consent decree for nearly a decade. The agreement demands that local police change how they conduct searches and seizures, and how they interact with people .\n\nBut it's had little positive effect. Even the Cleveland City Council p resident said it hasn 't made the city safer. And it's about as fiscally sound as turning cash into confetti. Much like agreements in the other cities, Cleveland's consent decree mandates a monitor - essentially a very expensive babysitter who doesn't like the kids much.\n\nHow expensive? Even the far-left ACLU admits the cost may be $11 million per year, and the current monitors charge as much as $750 an hour . The average Clevelander makes about $30 an hour . You do the math.\n\nWho are these richly rewarded monitors? If you guessed they're all local folks who want to help their hometown, you're wrong. It's 19 people, and only a few are from Cleveland. Several are lawyers from a gold-plated Washington, D.C. law firm led by Karl Racine.\n\nRacine has endorsed politicians who want to defund the police . He also helped anti-police rioters hide their arrest records from the public. He's no friend to hard-working police officers who do their job and follow the law.\n\nIn a recent report , Racine and his decadent D.C. comrades explained that: \" We will be establishing additional priorities ... to help us understand exactly what has occurred over the lifespan of this Consent Decree so that we know what is working well and what needs to be fixed .\"\n\nAfter a decade and millions of dollars spent, the monitors should already know what's working and what needs to be fixed. Citizens and police in Cleveland deserve better.\n\nIn a few rare instances, a consent decree might be appropriate. But - like nearly all government regulation that has the potential to be punitive and oppressive - it should be limited in scope, short in duration, and staffed only by local people with genuine insight into police work. That's true everywhere in America and it's particularly true in Cleveland.\n\nIt's time to end the Cleveland consent decree, give taxpayers relief, and remove the handcuffs from the police who do their job well. It's also time for the incoming Justice Department leaders to wind down those consent decrees that are expensive and ineffective. I'm confident that President Trump and Attorney General Pam Bondi are the right people to make that happen.\n\nFBI Caught Gaslighting the Public With Bogus Crime Stats\n\nA Modest Proposal for Police Reform\n\nDestroying Our Criminal Justice System\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

Roy Cooper told the Times what the media selectively forgets: \"Dangerous assignments are part of the job, but [the police] step up and do it anyway to protect our communities and protect our families.\" Danger has always been part of the job. For some young people, it makes the job attractive. If potential recruits steer clear of urban police departments - almost all are perilously understaffed - it is not the fear of bad guys that dissuades them. It is the fear of the algorithms.\n\nHaving served on the Kansas City Police Department (KCPD) in a different era, Master Detective Albert DeValkenaere did not discourage his son Eric from following in his footsteps. For 20 years , Detective Eric DeValkenaere did his job efficiently and honorably while raising a loving family on his modest salary. His virtues, however, offered no protection against the algorithms. The headlines spell out his fate:\n\nThe \"black man\" who died at the hands of DeValkenaere had the same last name - \"Lamb\" - as the ironically named black \"victim\" in Tom Wolfe's 1987 novel Bonfire of the Vanities . What Wolfe wrote as satire has become media boilerplate.\n\nToday, almost every urban area has a DeValkenaere or two, a white police officer presumed guilty of \"killing a black man,\" a grave offense found in no criminal code but applied as though it were. These media dramas inevitably feature black men as innocents - honor students, gentle giants, little boys with Skittles - and whites, ideally cops, as evil. Kansas City's Cameron Lamb, the media told us, was the loving father of three boys.\n\nWhat makes this case noteworthy is that DeValkenaere has a Republican attorney general, Andrew Bailey, willing to fight for him. In the respondent's brief Bailey prepared for the Missouri Court of Appeals, Western District, Bailey described in detail how the algorithms played out for DeValkenaere that December day in 2019.\n\nLamb, 26, began his final day by striking his live-in girlfriend Shanice Reed and throwing her belongings onto the sidewalk. The pair continued to argue outside. When Reed fled in her purple Mustang, Lamb chased her in his red pickup truck. The vehicles flew past KCPD officer Adam Hill on residential streets at speeds up to 90 miles per hour. Hill thought there was a \"rolling disaster going down the streets\" and requested a police helicopter to follow the vehicles.\n\nAt some point, Lamb gave up the chase and headed home. Still angry, he was driving in excess of 60 and blowing through red lights. The call went out to detectives DeValkenaere and Troy Schwalm in separate cars. Independently both concluded, in Schwalm's words, \"there was something more to it versus just driving fast.\"\n\nThe helicopter officer directed Schwalm and DeValkenaere to the back of a house where Lamb seemed to be stashing his truck. \"[B]e careful,\" he told them. \"I last saw him in the area underneath the trees behind the house.\"\n\nSchwalm took the lead. After parking in front of the house, Schwalm walked down a shared driveway toward the backyard, gun in the \"low ready\" position. DeValkenaere walked up the cluttered far side of the house to provide backup.\n\nWhen Schwalm approached, Lamb was trying to back the truck into a garage beneath the house, an uneasy fit. Schwalm told him to put the truck in park. Lamb refused to comply. Walking into a situation \"nature unknown,\" DeValkenaere advanced around the far side of the house, gun at low ready.\n\nLooking down at the truck from a retaining wall, he saw Lamb reach for a gun beneath his seat. He shouted, \"[H]e's got a gun, he's got a gun,\" but refrained from shooting until Lamb brought the gun \"up and around the left-hand side of the steering wheel.\"\n\n\"I can't let this happen,\" DeValkenaere reflected - the \"this\" meaning the shooting of his partner. DeValkenaere fired a shot into the center mass of Lamb's body, retreated briefly around the corner of the house, and fired three more rounds in Lamb's direction. As DeValkenaere testified, he would not have shot the driver \"had he not pointed that gun at my partner.\" Schwalm did not have a clear line of sight into the truck.\n\nAfter the shooting, DeValkenaere did not touch Lamb or his gun. Several other KCPD officers arrived soon after the shooting - two within 30 seconds - and took over the scene. At least four other officers would testify they saw the gun on the ground below Lamb's dangling left arm. One used his foot to pin the gun to the ground in case Lamb was still alive. Crime scene investigators verified the presence of the gun. Later, the medical examiner found two live rounds in Lamb's pocket.\n\nNone of this mattered to Jackson County, Missouri, Prosecutor Jean Peters Baker. Although not an official Soros plant, she might as well be. Appointed prosecutor in 2011, Baker was elected twice thereafter in this heavily Democratic county. Baker's official profile boasts of her \"being unafraid of tackling difficult cases.\" She seems particularly proud of those cases in which she and her colleagues \"convicted a series of police officers accused of wrongly using excessive or deadly force on citizens.\"\n\nDeValkenaere was one of those officers, a trophy on Baker's mantle. Charged with \"involuntary manslaughter in the first degree and armed criminal action,\" he went to trial in November 2021, six months after Derek Chauvin's trial in Minneapolis. Fearing a jury as frightened as Chauvin's, DeValkenaere and his team opted for a bench trial. Circuit court Judge J. Dale Youngs presided.\n\nBaker's prosecutors made the outrageous claim that DeValkenaere or another cop must have planted the gun, but Youngs made no reference to this in his ruling . In fact, he found DeValkenaere's testimony and that of the officers \"very credible.\" He conceded, too, that DeValkenaere had gone to the back of the house \"to provide cover for Sergeant Schwalm who had rushed into the backyard with his weapon drawn.\"\n\nIn sentencing DeValkenaere, Youngs applied the Chauvin standard. Lest the \"community\" think him too lenient, he explained that \"Eric Devalkenaere is not Derek Chauvin who murdered George Floyd.\" As I've argued in these pages and at length, Chauvin did not \"murder\" George Floyd. Like DeValkenaere, he was guilty of policing while white.\n\nFor Youngs, the \"one issue of law that ... countermanded every other factual issue in the case\" was whether Schwalm and DeValkenaere were \"lawfully present on the premises when they engaged Cameron Lamb.\" After reflecting on the nuances of the Fourth Amendment, Youngs found DeValkenaere guilty of involuntary manslaughter in the second degree and armed criminal action and sentenced him to six years in prison. That simple. The community approved.\n\nAttorney General Bailey was stunned. He argued that Lamb had no right under any circumstances to point a gun at the officers. \"In short,\" Bailey contended, \"even if he trespassed or committed a constitutional violation by unlawfully entering the curtilage, DeValkenaere did not act with criminal negligence in shooting Mr. Lamb. To the contrary, DeValkenaere lawfully used force to defend Schwalm from Mr. Lamb's use of unlawful, deadly force.\"\n\nCuriously, a year after the trial, Baker seemed to agree that a person has a right to defend an endangered partner. Said Baker's office , \"Missouri law governs this case, specifically self-defense and defense of others, leading us to decline charges after a careful review.\" The woman they declined to charge had killed a Kansas City fireman.\n\nThe fireman had intervened to stop her beau from harassing a female clerk at a convenience store. Angry, the young man rushed to his car to retrieve a handgun illegally converted to fully automatic. In the parking lot, the two men struggled over the gun. The fireman got the best of the struggle and had the young man subdued when he managed to hand the gun off to his girlfriend. She promptly shot the fireman in the back, killing him. Needless to say, the woman and her beau were black, the fireman white. The algorithms giveth, and they taketh away.\n\nDevalkenaere's father, Albert, understood the political calculus. In a heartfelt missive, he shared several facts of his son's case that the media chose not to. Lamb, it appears, had good reason to flee. Both the gun and the truck were stolen, and he was under the influence of at least two narcotics. He had also beaten his girlfriend that morning and may have suspected the cops were aware of that.\n\nWhat Bailey did not mention in his brief is what the media could not mention enough: The white Devalkenaere shot a \"black man.\" In Democratic strongholds like Jackson County, that is the algorithm that drives justice and that has been driving would-be officers away from Kansas City.\n\nWhile the city's homicides are at a record high - including an embarrassingly visible murder at the Kansas City Chiefs Super Bowl parade - police staffing levels are at a record low, with some 300 spots unfilled . Area mammas have gotten the message: They're not letting their babies become police officers.\n\nBailey was making his pitch as much to Missouri's Republican governor, Mike Parson, as he was to the appeals court, which, for procedural reasons, refused to reverse the ruling by Youngs. The lame duck Parson represents Devalkenaere's last hope. God willing he will find the stones to ignore the mobs and the media and do the right thing.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "The Dark Side of Women in Combat\n\nPete Hegseth's nomination to become Secretary of Defense has reopened the women in combat controversy because of the nominee's views on the subject. Hegseth is a veteran of infantry combat in Iraq, and has expressed concerns about using women in combat roles, particularly in infantry and armor where close combat would be involved.\n\nIn the past few decades, women have been increasingly integrated into units such as artillery, military police, and combat aviation. A female fighter pilot was one of those tasked with the kamikaze mission of crashing her fighter into one of the airliners involved in the 9/11 attacks if all else failed, and the Marine Corps now allows women to lead infantry platoons if they can pass the grueling physical and mental challenge of Infantry Officers' School at Quantico Virginia.\n\nMy personal experience with women in a combat role came in 2009 and 2010 in Iraq. As a civilian State Department field advisor, I had a security detachment led by a female lieutenant for a number of months. Several of the soldiers in the detachment were women as well. We went outside the wire nearly every day to inspect building projects and meet with key local leaders. The women were polite, professional, and ready to kill if necessary.\n\nOn one mission they were detached to take a group of visiting VIPs to a refugee center. On their way back, they were hit by an Iranian built IED which blew the leg off of one of the male soldiers in the team. The lieutenant did an excellent job of handling the MEDEVAC and in restoring morale in her badly shaken unit. She was subsequently put in for an award for heroism.\n\nDespite all of that, I share some of Mr. Hegseth 's concerns on the subject, but perhaps for different reasons. Every female member of that that security team was a volunteer. They actively sought the duty. That is fine in the limited wars we have fought since the turn of the century, but there are some politicians - mostly Democrats - so interested in DEI, that they would actually draft women and put them into combat roles whether the females involved want it or not. That might not matter in peacetime, but if we get into a serious shooting war, I believe that  the whole edifice would collapse.\n\nOf all the women I know, only one or two might want to be involved in a combat role and most would object strenuously to being forced into such a situation. This concern is not entirely academic. Last June the Democrat dominated Senate Armed Forces Committee approved a proposed bill which would require women along with men to register for the draft at age 18.\n\nIf we ever get into a real shooting war with Vietnam-like casualties where a draft is reinstated, we'll likely see that the Democrats and feminists will be the first to change their tune when the body bags come back with large numbers of women in them.\n\nIf there is an analogy, it is the African American experience. In World War II when many black men were kept out of combat roles and largely relegated to being cooks, truck drivers, and other support roles, many complained bitterly. Fast forward to Vietnam with its totally integrated military. By that time blacks were complaining equally bitterly about being used as cannon fodder in disproportionate numbers.\n\nThere is a more recent analogy regarding gender equality in military terms. Women were first assigned to serve on warships shortly before the first Gulf War broke out. When they first joined, most expected to serve on shore duty. For some, sea duty was an unpleasant surprise; but feminists cheered. When deployment orders to the combat zone were issued, many women sailors suddenly became pregnant and undeployable. That is a dirty little secret that feminists and their friends in politics quietly swept under the rug.\n\nA 1997 Rand Corp. study titled New Opportunities for Military Women found that pregnancies can hurt unit readiness for the simple reason that \"pregnancy can affect the availability of women\" and that \"the effect is greater when the unit has many women.\"\n\nAnd combat readiness may not be the only negative effect pregnancy represents. Behavior associated with the romantic attraction necessary for pregnancies to occur - including jealousy, sexual harassment, and reckless daring or protectiveness associated with male gallantry - may also affect cohesion. The Rand study continues, \"When gender negatively affected cohesion, it was generally because gender is one way that people break into categories when conflict surfaces ... or because dating occurred within a unit.\"\n\nSome experts believe that these and other problems - e.g. the particular vulnerability of captured female soldiers to rape and sexual torture - can be managed with competent leadership and preparation. My own view is these kinds of problems are unlikely to overwhelm the services because the number of women who seek combat roles and meet the physical qualifications will be low.\n\nBut keep in mind, if women are forced into combat units involuntarily in large numbers, it will be a very different situation. DEI is unattractive when standards are lowered to include the unqualified. But it looks even worse when the DEI commissars are prodding you into a foxhole.\n\nREAD MORE from Gary Anderson:\n\n7 Ways to Move Toward a Trump Doctrine\n\nWokeness Is Responsible for the Military Recruitment Crisis\n\nGary Anderson is a retired Marine Corps Colonel.

      "text": "Is the ACLU Crazy? The ACLU challenge over the planned St. Michael statue is not due to concerns over the separation between church and state - but George Floyd.\n\nI f there were a proposal to erect a statue of St. Michael the Archangel on a municipal building, it would be understandable if some objected. However, it would not be understandable to object on the grounds that a depiction of St. Michael stepping on the neck of the Devil ineluctably conjures up images of George Floyd. But that is exactly the position of the ACLU of Massachusetts.\n\nHaving authored a Ph.D. dissertation, two books, and a monograph on the ACLU, I am convinced that most of its board members and senior officials harbor a deep animus against religion. Nothing bothers them more than Christianity, especially Catholicism. This is much more than a phobia: religion is seen as a threat to liberty.\n\nWhen the ACLU was founded in 1920 by Roger Baldwin (the ACLU today falsely claims that Baldwin was one of 10 who founded the organization), all the provisions of the First Amendment, save for religious liberty, were listed as part of their ten objectives. That was not an oversight: Baldwin was an atheist.\n\nStill, the reasoning of the ACLU of Massachusetts is off-the-charts, even by ACLU standards. It is challenging a decision made by the mayor of Quincy to erect two statues of Catholic saints outside the Quincy Public Safety Building. Mayor Thomas Koch chose St. Florian and St. Michael the Archangel; they are the patron saints of firefighters and police officers, respectively. The ACLU says the statues violate the separation of church and state.\n\nThe ACLU is well aware that religious statues adorn many buildings in the nation's capital, including the Capitol Building, the Supreme Court, the Library of Congress, the Lincoln Memorial, and other public buildings. Even in Massachusetts, the Boston Public Library features the outstanding work of John Singer Sargent: his religious murals, including  \"Madonna of Sorrows,\" are classic. At the State House, there are statues and paintings of famous Christians, clergy, and laity alike.\n\nBut none of this is enough to allay the fears of the ACLU.\n\nIn the ACLU's letter to Mayor Koch and the Quincy City Council, it said that \"we note that the contemplated statue of Saint Michael is not only troubling ... it depicts a figure stepping on the neck of a demon. Such violent imagery is particularly abhorrent in light of the murder of George Floyd and other acts of police brutality throughout the country.\"\n\nIn other words, the revered saint who battled Satan and who is known as the guardian prince of Israel - he stood ready to defend God's chosen people - reminds the ACLU of a serial violent criminal who resisted arrest and was subdued by the cops; he had four times the lethal dose of fentanyl in his system. Maybe if St. Michael had been depicted as engaging in dialogue with the Devil, instead of crushing his head, the ACLU would have applauded. (RELATED: How George Floyd Actually Died )\n\nWould Baldwin have agreed with the ACLU? Only in part.\n\nWhen I interviewed him in his home in New York City in 1978, we discussed an array of issues. He was cordial and forthcoming. But when it came to religion, he was an extremist. Here is an exchange I will never forget (See my book, The Politics of the ACLU : Transaction Press, 1985).\n\nDonohue: The ACLU has even gone so far as to deny the right of people to voluntarily take the time during the day, as a schoolchild, to say a prayer.\n\nBaldwin: Not on school time.\n\nDonohue: Well, whose rights are being infringed upon if there is a silent prayer voluntarily said by a student?\n\nBaldwin: If they don't say anything? You mean if they don't-\n\nDonohue: Right. Are you afraid they are going to proselytize the rest of the class?\n\nBaldwin: Well, they've tried to get around it. They've tried to get around it even further than you by calling it meditation.\n\nDonohue: What's wrong with that?\n\nBaldwin: You don't say anything about God or religion or anything. I suppose you can get by with that but it's a subterfuge, because the implication is that you're meditating about the hereafter or God or something.\n\nDonohue: Well, what's wrong with that? Doesn't a person have the right to do that? Or to meditate about popcorn for that matter?\n\nBaldwin: I suppose that - it sounds very silly to me because it looks like an obvious evasion of the constitutional provision.\n\nBack to St. Michael. Baldwin surely would have opposed erecting the statue, but he would have done so on conventional church and state grounds. Even if he were appraised of the George Floyd incident, he clearly would not have equated St. Michael stepping on the head of the Devil with a cop kneeling on Floyd. I spent many hours with him. He may have been an extremist on church and state, but he was not crazy.\n\nREAD MORE from Bill Donohue :\n\nWe Are Witnessing a Cultural Shift\n\nThe Politics of Comedy\n\nReassessing Elite Claims This Columbus Day\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "When Seconds Count, the Police Are Only Minutes Away Even with horrendous police response times, progressives don't want you to have a gun.\n\nM y grandmother's grandmother, Martha Heard, was by all accounts a formidable woman. During the lawless period after the Civil War, a gang of rowdies turned up at Grandma Heard's door. Knowing that her husband was away on business, they'd decided to help themselves to a store of good tobacco he was known to keep. \"Miz Heard,\" they shouted, \"we want to try some of your husband's tobacco, you bring it out here or we'll have to come get it.\" Grandma told her children to hide, then took a shotgun from its place by the front door and stepped out on the porch to confront the men. Aiming the shotgun at the loudmouth leader, she told them to leave. He scoffed and said, \"there's just one of you and one gun, you can't shoot us all.\" To which she replied, \"That may be, but it's you I'm aiming at.\" Her resolution, and the big shotgun won the day. \"Let's go somewhere else, boys,\" said the leader. \"I know her and she'll do it.\"\n\nI've been thinking a lot about Grandma Heard lately, as I read more and more articles chronicling the precipitous decline in police response times. In Portland, Oregon, where support for the police tanked at the height of the \"defund the police\" movement, overall response times more than doubled between 2016 and 2022, from an average of 8.1 minutes to an average of 16.4 .  Since 2022, and despite belated efforts to hire more officers, response times in Portland remained stagnant , creating what some described as a \"public safety crisis .\" The situation in Oakland, California has been recently described as \"abysmal,\" with response times to high-priority violent crimes increased by more than 50 percent between 2018 and 2022, with no improvement in sight .\n\nGun control has long ceased to be a meaningful response to the horrible murder rates in our big cities.\n\nIt's not just a problem in these notoriously dysfunctional cities, either. The same trend has been documented across the United States in 15 major cities. Unsurprisingly, the sharp drops in police staffing have contributed mightily to this trend ; predictably, when leftist city administrations stigmatize the whole business of policing, good officers leave in record numbers, and attracting new recruits becomes much harder. It's always been hard to be a police officer, even in times and places where community support exists. It has become much harder over the last several decades as the progressives have rewritten the urban narrative, and particularly so since the George Floyd protests and the effective decriminalization of looting. Who, in these times, would want to take on the dirty and dangerous work of policing? (READ MORE from James H. McGee: There Is No 'Moral Equivalence' Now )\n\nThe solution to the problem of rebuilding our police organizations should be obvious. Greater funding, to be sure, but above all, what's needed is a profound cultural change, one in which public safety returns to center stage and its guardians are respected once again. But despite the fact that even some notoriously progressive cities have started to understand the need for more police, turning the culture around will take time - a great deal of time, particularly when the cultural headwinds remain strong. As I observed in a previous American Spectator article about the collapse of public order in France, we can't simply wait for cultural change; we have to find practical solutions in the here and now .\n\nWhat, then, are the \"in the meantime\" solutions to the problem of police response times? Our major cities now find themselves in a situation that has always afflicted rural communities. Chief among these was response time, an immense challenge when a handful of officers must cover a huge county. It was in this context that I first heard the title phrase of this article, uttered by a sheriff who'd done his utmost to shorten response times, in a moment when the sheer futility had been made heartbreakingly clear.\n\nOne afternoon his despatcher received a 911 call from an elderly farm couple, the wife on the phone as a young, muscular hired hand was in the process of beating her husband senseless in an angry dispute over wages. The young man then knocked the phone away, and proceeded to beat the woman, while the dispatcher listened helplessly to her cries and then to her silence.\n\nThe responding deputies arrived to find the couple dead, their bodies so sickeningly mishandled that both responders subsequently needed counseling, and one left law enforcement altogether. The arrest and murder conviction of the hired hand provided only the coldest of comforts for the little community. Telling me the tale, the sheriff concluded by confessing despair at his inability to make a difference in the moment, and then remarked \"if only she'd had a gun instead of a phone.\"\n\nWe hear a lot these days about concealed carry, and open carry, and Supreme Court decisions affirming our Second Amendment rights. And yet, a kind of mindless gun control fanaticism still holds sway among progressive elites. Governor Gavin Newsom recently signed into law a radical package of gun control measures, e ven as some California law enforcement officials decry the new laws as meaningless virtue signaling , measures that target law-abiding gun owners - for example, the millions who own AR-15-style rifles - while having minimal impact on the criminal problem it purports to solve. (READ MORE from James H. McGee: Special Kind of Heroism: WWII 'Last Survivor' Leaves Us )\n\nYet Newsom has doubled down, and is now calling for a 28 th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution , one that would effectively gut many Second Amendment rights. Newsom dresses up his proposal as representing only modest restrictions, compatible with the Second Amendment, but the devil is in one particular detail. In addition to specific restrictions, it also contains a provision affirming that Congress, states, and local governments can enact additional \"common sense\" gun safety regulations. This creates a loophole large enough to drive through a truckload of harassment for responsible gun owners.\n\nThere's no realistic solution that interposes a police officer between a law-abiding citizen and a miscreant bent on doing them harm.\n\nHarassment such as that recently attempted by New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham. Back on September 8 th , she initiated a largely pointless - and patently unconstitutional - public health order limiting the right to carry firearms, yielding ground only under the pressure of a court order . Even before the temporary court order, her proposal had drawn bipartisan backlash . Raul Torrez, New Mexico's Attorney General and a fellow Democrat , refused to back Lujan Grisham's measure, calling it \"unconstitutional .\" The court order has been extended, allowing for much further debate, including examination of the revisions limiting the application of Lujan Grisham's order to parks and playgrounds in Albuquerque . One suspects that this ridiculous exercise in progressive posturing may ultimately find its way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOne might also suspect that this will also happen following a similarly inane undertaking in Illinois. In January of this year, Illinois's radical progressive governor, J.B. Pritzker, signed into law a comprehensive ban on so-called \"assault-type\" weapons, including both a  prohibition on future sales and required registration of current owners of such weapons. On August 14, the Illinois State Supreme Court upheld the law , but multiple challenges are now working their way through the lower Federal courts . In the meantime, however, heretofore law-abiding Illinois gun owners face harassment from state authorities.\n\nAnd so it goes. In spite of a nationwide trend in favor of increased firearms ownerships, as demonstrated by year upon year of record firearms sales, the left seems determined to pursue its assault on responsible gun ownership. In spite of very explicit instruction from the U.S. Supreme Court in the Bruen case , among other rulings, progressive politicians like Newsom, Lujan Grisham, and Pritzker seize every opportunity to subvert the Second Amendment. Ironically, the only gun owner whose rights the progressive media seem disposed to protect is a certain Hunter Biden, and anyone who has ever filled out the current required paperwork for purchase or transfer of a firearm will understand just how lame his legal excuses really are.\n\nAmericans in recent years have increasingly come to understand the wisdom of the old saying, \"God created man, but Colonel Samuel Colt made men equal.\" This understanding has been reflected the passage in many states of laws enabling self-defense. Despite the moaning of the Newsoms and Pritzkers, in many instances the very best home defense weapon is the progressive's much-hated AR-15, which, as anyone who has ever fired one knows, is easy to handle and to shoot, even for the old or the weak. I suspect that, had it been available in the late 1860s, Grandma Heard would have kept one by the front door instead of the shotgun.\n\nBy all means, we should enact and enforce laws designed to keep firearms away from criminals and to punish severely those who use a firearm in the commission of a crime. But we should disabuse ourselves, once and for all, of the notion that depriving law abiding citizens of the right to defend themselves is good public policy. Gun control has long ceased to be a meaningful response to the horrible murder rates in our big cities. It is instead nothing more than a progressive cultural totem and an excuse to do nothing about the drug and gang problems that are at the heart of the current murder epidemic. Addressing these problems raises inconvenient questions for our Soros -funded DAs and the social justice warriors who elect them to office, who sometimes seem bent on enabling criminality rather than ending it. If they don't want effective policing, and they don't want to allow their fellow citizens the means to defend themselves, then one is left to conclude that they simply wish we were all dead - certainly, it often seems that way.\n\nI lost touch with my sheriff friend many years ago, but I've never forgotten his story of the elderly couple, and his lament about response times. Even if we could wave a magic wand and repair the damage wrought by \"defund the police,\" there's no realistic solution that interposes a police officer between a law-abiding citizen and a miscreant bent on doing them harm. Instead, with the sheriff, I wish she'd had a gun in hand instead of a phone, a pistol, or perhaps one of the many AR-15 clones.\n\nOr maybe even Grandma Heard's double-barreled shotgun.\n\nJames H.

      "text": "MSNBC Article Claiming DEI Is Based on the Gospels Gets It All Wrong DEI preaches resentment.\n\nP resident Donald Trump is waging war on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs. Many argue that DEI is a religion in itself, complete with sacraments, dogmas, and heretics. It demands faith, repentance, and retribution. It even has its own version of original sin - privilege - and its unique concept of salvation - allyship. Nonetheless, it's entirely incompatible with Christianity.\n\nThere's a strange irony in watching progressives declare that rejecting DEI is somehow un-Christian. A recent MSNBC article by Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons leans hard into this claim, insisting that DEI is a natural outgrowth of the Gospels. But it's not. DEI does not preach love. On the contrary, it preaches resentment. It does not promise redemption. Instead, it promises endless guilt. It does not offer grace; it demands retribution. It is, I argue, the opposite of Christianity in every meaningful way.\n\nIt's important to note that Graves-Fitzsimmons is not a neutral commentator. Far from it.\n\nHe's the senior director of policy and advocacy at Interfaith Alliance , a national organization that advocates for \"inclusive democracy\" and firm boundaries between religion and government. His argument rests on the premise that social justice movements like DEI are modern manifestations of biblical teachings. However, in doing so, he commits several cardinal errors, such as confusing Christian charity with bureaucratic coercion, personal mercy with institutionalized grievance, and faith in Christ with faith in diversity officers.\n\nAs any honest observer can confirm, DEI programs don't unite people. They do the opposite. They drive people apart, dividing them into factions based on grievances. They tally up historic wrongs, then assign moral worth accordingly. If DEI is a religion, it focuses on scorekeeping. On the other hand, Christianity preaches that in Christ, \"there is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female\" (Galatians 3:28). The Gospel erases divisions; DEI cements them.\n\nThe MSNBC article claims you \"can't read the Gospels and not come away with a strong sense of God's preference for diversity, equity, and inclusion.\" Having read the Gospels, I beg to differ. Christ did not come to preach \"inclusion\" in the modern progressive sense. He came to call sinners to repentance. The Pharisees were \"included\" in Christ's presence, but they weren't given a free pass for their hypocrisy. Inclusion without genuine transformation is utterly meaningless.\n\nChristianity was not founded on quotas or social engineering; DEI was. Its proponents argue that, irrespective of their individual circumstances, a wealthy minority student at Harvard is inherently oppressed, while a working-class white Christian from Appalachia is an oppressor.\n\nAt its core, DEI is about power - who gets it, who loses it, and who must atone for the past. It teaches that history is an unbroken chain of oppression and that the only way forward is to dismantle existing structures. DEI is obsessed with the redistribution of authority and the enforcement of ideological purity. Christianity, in its purest form, teaches the very opposite. Christ did not tell the poor to seize power from the rich. He told them, \"Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth\" (Matthew 5:5). He did not tell his followers to demand reparations; he told them to forgive \"seventy times seven\" (Matthew 18:22).\n\nDEI offers no such path to forgiveness. Once accused, as many victims of the anti-merit madness will tell you, there is no redemption. Absolution is impossible. There is only confession, struggle sessions, and perpetual shame. Flagellation, including self-flagellation, is mandatory. This ideology thrives on endless recrimination, keeping old wounds open instead of healing them. Christianity offers a compelling alternative: mercy.\n\nThe MSNBC piece insists that Georgetown University's Jesuit tradition supports DEI. But, if we are being completely honest, Georgetown, like many other elite institutions, has long since abandoned Christian principles in favor of progressive politics. When institutions attempt to disguise DEI in Christian language, they aren't defending faith. They're co-opting it; they're corrupting it.\n\nThe early Christians didn't have time to enforce diversity quotas. They were - you know - too busy being persecuted, tortured, and executed for their faith. Yet, they prayed for their enemies, spread the Gospel, and transformed the world through compassion, not coercion. Compare that to modern DEI crusaders, who seek to impose compliance through corporate mandates, government policies, and professional blacklists.\n\nThe most obvious difference between Christianity and DEI is whom followers worship. Christianity teaches that our primary identity is as children of God. DEI asserts that our defining trait is tied to the unholy trinity of race, gender, and sexual orientation. Christianity teaches that our sins can be forgiven and that we can be made new. DEI teaches that some are irredeemable because of their privilege, while others are perpetual victims with no personal responsibility. Moreover, DEI focuses on superficial characteristics, while Christianity is more concerned with the soul. These are not small differences; they are foundational contradictions.\n\nChristians can follow the Gospel, which calls for unity and faith in something greater than themselves, or they can follow DEI, which demands resentment, division, and faith in a pathetic priesthood of diversity officers.\n\nThey cannot follow both.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

      "text": "Stuart Scheller's Tragic Truth-Telling About Military Hypocrisy The former lieutenant colonel's upcoming book shows the high price of bad leadership.\n\nCrisis of Command: How We Lost Trust and Confidence in America's Generals and Politicians By Stuart Scheller (Knox Press, 272 pages, $28)\n\n\"He was following the orders he was given.\" At this point, former Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller despises those words and carries special disdain for officers who use some configuration of the phrase to justify why they did something that ultimately hurt someone or harmed the mission.\n\nIn many ways, it was the persistent echo of these words that sparked his (some would say ill-fated) decision to post a YouTube video a year ago this week that eventually landed him in the brig with a special court martial and an abrupt end to a long, promising career in the Marines before his 20-year retirement. It also cost him his wife, separation from his young boys, and rebuke from colleagues and former officers indulging in seeming schadenfreude during the ensuing spectacle.\n\nIn his forthcoming book , Crisis of Command: How We Lost Trust and Confidence in America's Generals and Politicians, Scheller recounts watching the news coverage of the U.S. military withdrawal from Afghanistan last August. A lieutenant colonel with 17 years in the Marine Corps, including combat in Iraq and Afghanistan, Scheller had just taken over his first command of the Advanced Infantry Training Battalion in North Carolina in June 2021. He writes:\n\nI watched multiple units, including my first unit, First Battalion, Eighth Marines, rapidly respond to a situation poorly planned for months. I knew from experience junior service members on the ground would rise to the occasion despite failures at the general officer level, but I remained frustrated at the situation.\n\nHe recalls his confusion over the military's decision to leave the massive Bagram Airfield to an overrunning Taliban in July. He said he became angry when messages from the commandant of the Marine Corps, and then from the Pentagon, given to service members not only suggested a complete lack of understanding of what the rank and file were feeling, but \"victimized the service members by projecting mental health problems as a source of [their] frustration.\"\n\nAfter an Aug. 26, 2021, terror attack outside the Kabul airport left 11 of his fellow Marines, some of whom he knew, dead, Scheller said that he had a \"deep rage in my belly\" and that his battalion executive officer, who had come into his office upon seeing the news, felt it too.\n\nScheller writes:\n\nEveryone was angry. Everyone was disappointed with our senior leaders. They continued to let us down. They continued placing career progression over warfighting capability. They continued redirecting blame in every direction but at themselves. They were all hypocrites. They didn't represent anything about our core ethos.\n\nHe spent the evening writing his thoughts down. He dismissed the idea of sending it up the chain of command, saying: \"I knew those processes would be blocked by the same bureaucratic red tape that got us into the mess in the first place. I was trapped in a midlevel position, with no real authority or recourse to address our systemic failures.\" He guessed that any military publication, leashed to the influence of senior officers and retired poobahs, would reject it outright. So, he made his first YouTube video , in which he took particular aim at the institution:\n\nThis amalgamation of the economic/corporate/political/higher military ranks are not holding up their end of the bargain. I want to say this very strongly: I have been fighting for seventeen years. I am willing to throw it all away to say to my senior leaders, \"I demand accountability.\"\n\nHe then made second and third videos after he was relieved of duty, and the backlash was unleashed. The rest, as they say, is history.\n\nScheller's court martial was a bit of a circus, and the judge for his case, Col. Glen Hines, knew it. He blasted the prosecution for Scheller's treatment, scolding the prosecution during Scheller's sentencing, and reducing his agreed-to fine from $30,000 to $5,000.\n\nScheller writes: \"I was fortunate to have him look at all the facts of the case. It appeared to me that he didn't want me to plead guilty. He stated that, in his over thirty years as a JAG officer, he 'had never seen someone sent to pre-trial confinement for these types of charges.'\" Hines called out the anonymous leak of Scheller's Marine Corps charge sheet, including medical records, to the online magazine Task & Purpose. Like Scheller's supporters, Hines said that Scheller's words had been twisted and \"taken out of context\" to make him look mentally unstable and extremist.\n\nEven his comments about the Capitol on Jan. 6 were reported to suggest radical intent. \"It's unfair. It's illegal. And it needs to be investigated,\" Hines told the court according to Scheller's account, retold in several news stories from the time . \"It creates the specter of unlawful command influence.\"\n\nIn the end, Scheller pleaded guilty and was convicted of violating multiple Uniform Code of Military Justice articles. These include :\n\nArticle 88 (contempt toward officials), Article 89 (disrespect toward superior commissioned officers), Article 90 (willfully disobeying a superior commissioned officer), Article 92 (dereliction in the performance of duties), Article 92 (failure to obey an order or regulation) and 27 specifications of Article 133 (conduct unbecoming an officer and a gentleman)\n\nHe was given a general discharge under honorable conditions and the pension that a 20-year marker would have afforded him and his family was withheld.\n\nWithout the judge's intercession, it would have been a lot worse, Scheller suspects. And, honestly, he should have known. Whether he began to write Crisis of Command in order to prove it or whether it came out in the telling, it is obvious by the end that his career, from a young man seeking purpose after 9/11 to a seasoned battlefield leader, is pockmarked by a series of relationships and incidents he was forced to manage on institutional terms and by rules he found arbitrary and counterproductive, sometimes illogical and unjust. Uphold the system and be rewarded. Question or disparage it and expect the leadership to close ranks like a vise. Scheller was obviously an exemplary Marine, with strengths that allowed him to navigate as far as he did. But he must know that his idealistic standards would never have allowed him to rise further beyond his rank. He writes:\n\nReflecting the status quo ideology of a boss is the easiest way to promotion. Currently, warfighting capability and winning wars are not priorities for promotion. A warfighting focus may factor into the boss's impression of a military employee, but it is a small slice at most. I witnessed several talented officers wash out of the system because their warfighting focus detracted from the peripheral tasks prioritized by superiors.... Unfortunately, it is almost impossible for renegade warfighters to penetrate the barriers of the system.\n\nScheller's thrust into the spotlight came because of his questioning of decisions that led to the botched withdrawal of Afghanistan. Crisis of Command illuminates a longstanding frustration within the military with how the 20-year wars were conducted, how strategy was subverted in favor of politics and process, and how generals, promoted for anything but battlefield skills and intellectual capabilities, are nothing but slaves to career progression.\n\nScheller's story is instructive in that it covers what seem to be mundane but are really revelatory experiences with high-handed officers in Iraq, wound tight and overworked, who let toxic ego get in the way of clear-eyed combat decisions and put men and women at risk, all the way up to his time at the Command and General Staff College, where \"too much importance was placed on academic PhDs with zero military experience.\" He writes: \"It was hard to take them seriously when they lectured me about my views. The PhDs also acted like tenured instructors only willing to put in the minimum effort.\"\n\nHe also criticizes the idea that the U.S. is stronger because of its moral righteousness and its theory of the \"just war.\" He feels that both, combined with the culture of mindlessly following orders and the aforementioned promotional path, have allowed for a foreign policy that seeks conflict over diplomacy (but then does not unleash lethality in order to maintain some moral ideal) and a military institution that deviates from actual skill building necessary to win wars. He points early in his book to his time in Officer Candidate School (OCS), saying:\n\nResiliency is important for military leadership, but it always bothered me that critical thought wasn't emphasized more. A candidate could be a deep-thinking, geopolitical analyst with a bountiful knowledge of science, but he wouldn't make it through [OCS] if he couldn't withstand beratement, yell programmed responses, and dance in a coordinated manner thirty inches behind another man.\n\nFurthermore, Scheller excoriates the military-industrial complex for fostering an \"oligopoly within the government contracting world reaping exorbitant amounts of money off the war industry.\"\n\nHe points to the revolving door in which senior officers like retired Gens. James Mattis and Lloyd Austin go from industry boards to the Pentagon and back again, influencing expensive programs that ultimately fail and policies that do too. Meanwhile, \"a young, enlisted infantryman cannot receive basic technology in a timely manner due to bureaucratic red tape in procurement.\" Scheller continues, \"Instead, the junior service member consistently and unknowingly assumes unnecessary risks because the procurement process cannot be navigated effectively by senior military leaders.\"\n\nIt is clear that Scheller has long judged the military against his own sense of right and wrong and sees its inability to stand accountable to mistakes and the use of \"just obeying orders\" as not only the most egregious of transgressions but also the manifestation of corruption within the system. Certainly, there are a number of his fellow officers and infantrymen who agree , standing up for him during the trial, and many others who consider him a truth-teller, albeit a tragic one.\n\nWhether he is seen as writing the book to justify his own illegal behavior and make a buck or to raise alarms about systematic degradation from the top will likely depend on one's impression of Scheller from the beginning. But it is a compelling story, regardless, with Scheller as the proverbial canary in the coal mine. As he writes:\n\nAs you may have heard in the media, the military depicted me as the bad guy.\n\nYes, I did break the rules.\n\nYes, I should have been held accountable.\n\nAnd so should every senior leader for their violations. However, they only acknowledge the failures of those below them and lack the courage, fortitude, and wherewithal to acknowledge the failures of their counterparts at the top. My story is a microcosm for the hypocrisy of the system.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit... Read More\n\nIt's been a busy few weeks for Bernie Sanders, traveling...

      "text": "Right Shrugs, as Left Protects Bad Cops\n\nS acramento\n\nThe late Israeli diplomat Abba Eban reportedly quipped that Palestinians \"never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity.\" I thought of that zinger after watching California conservatives pass on yet another opportunity to take advantage of egregious Democratic failings. The GOP - and not just here in California - seems incapable of tapping into any legitimate public concern about government secrecy and abuses, provided such abuses come at the hands of police officers and other law enforcement.\n\nIn the latest news , two reporters from UC Berkeley's Investigative Reporting Program made a routine public-records request to the Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training. POST provided the reporters with a list of thousands of current and past officers and police job applicants with criminal convictions in the past decade, which are used in background checks when hiring officers. This is how the system should work: Reporters make a legitimate request and receive important information from a public agency, which provided the information.\n\nUnfortunately, the story doesn't end there. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra, a progressive Democrat, ordered the reporters to destroy the records they legally obtained. He has threatened legal action, claimed the records were confidential, and said that POST inadvertently released them, according to news reports. Becerra also has been resisting immediate compliance with a new law that gives the public the right to view disciplinary records. This is typical. Despite some newfound enthusiasm for criminal-justice reform, the state's Democrats have largely been the tools of police unions.\n\nRepublicans should be touting the scandal, as a leader in the Trump resistance bullies reporters, quashes records, and defends criminals. Sadly, conservatives usually let leftists, such as Becerra and former Attorney General Kamala Harris , get away with such hypocrisy even though there's little reason for it. Public-safety unions dumped $5.7 million into California campaigns in the last political cycle alone, according to news reports . That money goes mostly to Democrats, yet law-and-order Republicans apparently do the union bidding on the cheap.\n\nWhenever there's a high-profile police use-of-force incident , both sides take their predictable sides. Republicans \"back the badge,\" even in shooting cases that are hard to fathom. Democrats sympathize with Black Lives Matter and feign outrage. Democrats are pulling a con job, but the GOP is too addled by its own hypocrisy to point it out. Why aren't Republicans spotlighting how presidential candidate and current U.S. Sen. Harris \"fought tooth and nail to uphold wrongful convictions that had been secured through official misconduct,\" as a New York Times columnist put it?\n\nConservatives claim to be supporters of limited government and individual freedom, yet California's government increasingly is unlimited and hostile to liberty. There's no reason to give a blanket pass to the state's enforcement arm. Democrats know they need the support of the people who will enforce all the new laws they pass, but Republicans should know better than to allow these powerful police agencies to operate without accountability.\n\nAs CALmatters noted last year, many of California's policies are, quite obviously, the most liberal in the nation, \"But even with a statehouse controlled entirely by Democrats, California laws are friendlier to law enforcement - and less transparent to the public - than those in Wisconsin and Florida, states with Republican governors and legislatures.\"\n\nBack to those documents that Becerra wants destroyed. \"Their crimes ranged from shoplifting to embezzlement to murder,\" reported KQED. \"Some of them molested kids and downloaded child pornography. Others beat their wives girlfriends or children.... The list includes cops who trafficked drugs, cops who stole money from their departments and even one who robbed a bank wearing a fake beard. Some sexually assaulted suspects. Others took bribes, filed false reports and committed perjury. A large number drove under the influence of drugs and alcohol - sometimes killing people on the road.\"\n\nThere were 12,000 names on the list, with 3,500 names that \"appear to match the names of police officers in state personnel databases, and about 2,250 of those have been on the force within the last five years,\" according to the report . It's unclear which were applicants and which might have jobs. But would you want your family member pulled over on a dark two-lane highway by a police officer who happens to be a convicted rapist or murderer? The public ought to know.\n\nFor a parallel, conservatives know that most public-school teachers are decent people but that they are members of unions and are part of a system that protects the worst performers. In one Los Angeles case, a judge noted that only 1 percent to 3 percent of teachers are \"grossly ineffective,\" but they do much damage to thousands of students. Yet, California Democrats - thanks to their close alliance with the California Teachers' Association - won't seriously address this problem even as they present themselves to voters as advocates for better education.\n\nIt's the same concept when it comes to police agencies. Most cops do their jobs well, but they are members of unions and part of a system that protects the worst among them. Some unions provide insurance programs that fund legal defenses for police accused of wrongdoing. Union work rules make it nearly impossible to fire bad actors. Even though a small percentage of officers may be involved in a large number of incidents, Democratic attorney generals keep the information secret, protecting these cops at the expense of the public.\n\nThe situation is a travesty, but it offers conservatives an opportunity to burnish their limited-government credentials, highlight the hypocrisy of their Democratic opponents, improve public safety, and make inroads in poorer communities that take the brunt of police misbehavior. This much is for certain , however: They'll miss this opportunity to take advantage of that opportunity.\n\nSteven Greenhut is Western region director for the R Street Institute.

      "text": "Implicit Bias Training: A Pseudoscience Scam A total waste of taxpayer dollars.\n\nP olice officers in a majority of states are now mandated to receive \"implicit bias training,\" where they are informed they are subconsciously racist and must admit to and deliberately overcome their racism.\n\nThe trainings, which exploded in popularity following the Ferguson riots in 2014, directly respond to accusations that racist police officers are shooting unarmed African Americans. Following the death of George Floyd, multiple states, including Michigan , New Jersey , and Texas , joined the list of states mandating the training for all their officers.\n\nHarvard's University's Implicit Association Test , the foundation of the idea of implicit bias, shows that a majority of Americans associate African Americans more quickly with negative words than white Americans when measured in milliseconds. The theory is that these unconscious biases can cause police officers to use a disparate amount of force against African Americans or use racial profiling to stop and arrest African Americans at greater rates.\n\nBut we know from study after study that so-called \"implicit bias\" has only the slightest link to how a person actually behaves towards people of different races.\n\nSo it's no surprise that a new study shows that the NYPD's $5.5 million implicit bias training program, which began in 2018, has absolutely no impact on officer behavior.\n\nProponents of the training expected that New York's police officers would interact with and arrest fewer African Americans after becoming aware of their supposed deep-seated and unconscious racism. However, stops, frisks, summonses, and arrests of African Americans in New York remained at almost the same proportion of police actions following the implementation of the implicit bias training.\n\n\"It's fair to say that we could not detect effects of the training on officers' enforcement behaviors,\" said Robert E. Worden, the lead researcher of the study.\n\nOne explanation for the failure of implicit bias training to have any tangible effect is that the quality of the training is low. Mahzarin Banaji, a psychology professor at Harvard who helped create the Implicit Association Test, subscribes to this belief.\n\n\"The teaching has been in the hands of people called 'diversity trainers,' and they're like politicians - they don't have to have any expertise,\" Banaji told NPR.\n\nThis excuse, while lacking in substance, does drive at an important question. How could an hours-long training session - whatever the quality of its techniques or the expertise of its teachers - fundamentally alter a person's behavior towards certain races if they truly have deep-seated racism?\n\nIn fact, many liberals have argued in recent months that people are too deeply racist for implicit bias training to have any effect. For instance, Dave Bicking, the vice president of Communities United Against Police Brutality, said in June that implicit bias training is \"unscientific fraud\" because \"it's not actually going to threaten any entrenched interests or cause any significant change in policing.\"\n\nBut that argument goes in the wrong direction. The reality is that \"implicit bias\" cannot be reliably determined and, further, it does not have real-life consequences. That is, implicit bias' existence as a meaningful descriptor is in serious question.\n\nThe Implicit Association Test serves as the basis for implicit bias theory, but people routinely get different results when they take the test multiple times. The first two times I took the test , it told me I had \"little to no automatic preference between White people and Black people.\" The third time I took the test, however, I was told I have \"a slight automatic preference for White people over Black people.\" Apparently I was judged not racist one minute, but racist the next.\n\n\"The IAT isn't even predicting the IAT two weeks later,\" Hart Blanton, a social psychologist critical of implicit bias, told the Chronicle of Higher Education . \"How can a test predict behavior if it can't even predict itself?\"\n\nThat lack of consistency has caused many to question the scientific validity of the test. Multiple studies published in highly regarded journals have found that the IAT does not meet the quality-control standards expected of psychological instruments. This h as further caused many to question whether such a test, which labels people as racist, should be distributed by Harvard and marketed as legitimate.\n\nIndeed, the test seems to be more effective at testing people's ability to sort pictures of people and words than discovering unknown prejudices.\n\nIn 2017, a meta-analysis of 492 studies with 87,418 participants found that there is only the slightest correlation between a person's level of implicit bias and their level of discriminatory behavior. Additionally, the researchers found that there is very little evidence that changes in implicit bias have anything to do with changes in a person's behavior.\n\nEssentially, the researchers found that implicit bias fails to describe anything meaningful about human behavior.\n\n\"When you actually look at the evidence we collected, there's not necessarily strong evidence for the conclusions people have drawn,\" said a co-author of the study, Patrick Forscher.\n\nAnother study, a 2013 meta-analysis , found a similar result. Those researchers said, \"the IAT provides little insight into who will discriminate against whom.\"\n\nIn fact, the 2017 study found that the correlation between implicit bias and behavior is even smaller than what the 2013 study found.\n\nSo the null effect of the NYPD's implicit bias training is actually caused by the fact that the training is based entirely on pseudoscience. A police officer can be measured by the IAT to more quickly associate African Americans with negative words, but this has no statistical bearing on how he will interact with African Americans. Making the officer fess up to his supposed racism just confuses his judgment.\n\nYet Black Lives Matter activists and left-wing academics continue to make calls for implicit bias trainings one of their central demands . And those demands have made implicit bias training into a big business. Consultants offer to help everyone from health-care professionals to corporations to university students to police departments overcome their racism in exchange for large sums of money.\n\nAnd it comes at the cost of millions in taxpayer dollars.\n\nPatricia Devine , who studies prejudice at the University of Wisconsin, said that implicit bias training for police departments is a \"multimillion, maybe billion, dollar industry.\" For example, $5.5 million was spent on two years of implicit bias training for the NYPD, the nation's largest police force.\n\nIn 2019, CBS News contacted 155 police departments across the country and learned that 69 percent of departments offer implicit bias training. Ninety percent of those departments make the training mandatory. And that number has only grown following the death of George Floyd.\n\nSo why are these activists so motivated to convince us that we, and our law enforcement officers, are secretly racists? Well, for diversity consultants and trainers, it's their business model. But for ideologues, it's a huge component of critical race theory.\n\nCritical race theory posits that our entire society is systemically racist and that this racism animates our society. Implicit bias is central to the ideology because it allows critical race theorists to find racism in every person, regardless of their actual behavior. Thus both Ibram X. Kendi and Robin DiAngelo, the arbiters of critical race theory, demand that their disciples confess their racism. \"The claim of 'not racist' neutrality,\" Kendi says in his book, \"is a mask for racism.\" (It should be noted that Kendi is made wealthy by critical race theory.)\n\nThe fact that taxpayer money is spent on this poisonous ideology is shameful. It's tearing our country apart and leading us to believe that everyone is secretly biased against people of other races.\n\nPresident Trump issued an executive order this month banning critical race and implicit bias trainings for federal employees and contractors. But we must also work to end the implicit bias training locally in states, cities, schools, and companies.\n\nThese counterproductive, ineffective trainings are in particular a problem for police, who are called to serve and protect the public. Police should be freed from the lie that they could be unknowingly racist and emboldened to act with right judgment towards all citizens.\n\nIf you guys will forgive me, this is a bit...

Aquilino Gonell claimed that \"five officers\" were killed \"as a result\" of the riot at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021.\n\nVERDICT: Mostly false. No police officers died on January 6. One died of natural causes the day after, and four took their own lives later that same year.\n\nDuring his speech at the Democratic National Convention (DNC) on Wednesday, Gonell claimed that he \"nearly died\" while protecting the Capitol from rioters in 2021, and that \"five officers\" had \"died as a result of January 6.\"\n\n\"Before I begin, I need to acknowledge the sacrifices that five officers, who died as a result of January 6, made on that day,\" Gonell told the crowd. \"My name is Aquilino Gonell. I immigrated to the U.S. from the Dominican Republic when I was 12. I became an American citizen, I was a sergeant in the U.S. Army and a Capitol police officer, and I've seen violence while serving in Iraq. But, nothing, nothing prepared me for January 6.\"\n\n\"We officers risk everything to protect innocent people,\" Gonell continued. \"We were beaten and blinded. I was assaulted with a pole attached to the American flag. President Trump summoned our attackers and sided with them. He betrayed us. When I joined the Army and Capitol Police, I took an oath to defend the Constitution. I did so with duty in my soul and I still feel it. To Donald Trump, I ask, why don't you? On January 6, I nearly died protecting the Capitol, and I would do it again for our democracy.\"\n\nAs Breitbart News has previously reported , Democrats such as President Joe Biden and Attorney General Merrick Garland have stated that five Capitol Police officers died while defending the Capitol from rioters on Jan. 6. However, none of the officers were killed during the violence.\n\nOne of the U.S. Capitol Police Officers, Brian Sicknick, ended up dying a day after the riot. However, a medical examiner later revealed that Sicknick had died from natural causes: \"two strokes at the base of the brain stem caused by a clot in an artery that supplies blood to that area of the body,\" according to the Washington Post .\n\nAs Breitbart News previously reported , \"four Capitol Police and Washington Metropolitan Police Officers\" who had responded to the January 6 riot, died from \"suicide\":\n\nIn the weeks after the attacks, four Capitol Police and Washington Metropolitan Police Officers died by suicide. The Capitol Police officer's union has said about 140 officers were injured during the protests.\n\nThe death of Metropolitan Police Officer Jeffrey Smith, who died by suicide, was ruled as a line-of-duty death, according to NBC News. This allowed Smith's widow to be eligible to receive survivor benefits.\n\nIn November 2022, the Department of Justice classified Capitol Police Officer Howard Liebengood's suicide as being eligible for line-of-duty benefits, according to the New York Times .\n\nTwo other officers, Gunther Hashida and Kyle DeFreytag, who had responded to the January 6 riots, were reported to have died by suicide in July 2021, according to CNN.\n\nOne person, Air Force veteran and Trump supporter Ashli Babbitt, was killed as a result of the January 6 riots, after being shot by a Capitol Police officer.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

The officers quickly checked the rooms for people, calling out to alert them to the blaze and get them to safety.\n\nHowever, once the officers cleared the home, they learned that one last person was still inside. Therefore, they re-entered the building a second time to rescue the individual.\n\nThe body camera footage showed the officers working together to locate the man who appeared to have been in an upper part of the house. Their efforts resulted in every person being evacuated from the home.\n\n\"One officer at the scene required treatment for smoke inhalation,\" the police agency said:\n\nOfficers Brave Flames to Save Residents\n\nOfficers Brave Flames  to Save Residents On March 7, 2025, Atlanta Police Zone 6 officers were flagged down regarding a residential fire at 329 Hill St. SE. As officers approached the burning home, they were informed that residents were still inside. Multiple officers entered the smoke-filled home to evacuate its occupants to safety.After clearing the house, officers learned that one more person remained inside. Without regard for their own safety, officers re-entered the burning home to rescue the individual from danger.Thanks to the brave actions of these officers, all residents were safely escorted away from the fire. One officer at the scene required treatment for smoke inhalation.\n\nPosted by City of Atlanta Police Department on Thursday, March 13, 2025\n\nMabry recalled, \"There was definitely an adrenaline dump after the fact, and then the realization that we did save a life-that I was in a house literally in flames, and anything could have happened. So it's a gratifying feeling, absolutely.\"\n\nShe later added that \"I don't do this for the praise of the public or the praise of anybody. I do it because it's my job, and I have a sincere yearning to serve.\"\n\nWhen Ireland was asked about the job and responsibility that comes with it, he said , \"You got to have that ability to put yourself second. I come second and all those people you serve come first.\"\n\nSocial media users were quick to share their thoughts on the rescues, one person writing , \"I hope the city recognizes these outstanding officers!

      "text": "Exclusive Poll: Majority of Americans Oppose ESG as State Financial Officers Fight Against It\n\nA majority of Americans oppose controversial environment, social, and governance (ESG) policies, which state financial officers across the nation have committed to fighting, Breitbart News has learned exclusively.\n\nA survey conducted by TargetPoint, exclusively obtained by Breitbart News, found that 56 percent of Americans agree that \"ESG is a highly subjective, politically charged idea that is forcing progressive policies on everyday Americans resulting in higher prices for nearly everything.\" In contrast, 27 percent disagreed with that statement, and 17 percent did not know enough to register an opinion.\n\nEighty-eight percent agreed that the government should focus more on protecting individual rights so that Americans can achieve prosperity, and 86 percent agreed that open debate and civil discourse should be encouraged to find solutions to financial and policy challenges.\n\nESG has become the latest vector through which Wall Street asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, State Street, Baillie Gifford & Company, and others push companies to adopt leftist policies they otherwise would not back. Asset managers often push companies to adopt policies intended to fight climate change, diversity requirements, and other policies advocating for racial justice.\n\nO.J. Oleka, the CEO of the State Financial Officers Foundation (SFOF), said in a statement to Breitbart News that the poll reveals that Americans are increasingly tired of corporations becoming politicized.\n\nHe said:\n\nWhen asked who they might trust most to make the right decisions on fiscal and financial matters, 47 percent pointed to state financial officers, 31 percent said governors, and 22 percent said congressional lawmakers.\n\nAmericans trust state financial officers more than governors, attorneys general, and legislators when it comes managing a state's finances, overseeing state investments, ensuring taxpayer dollars are efficiently spent, and ensuring financial transparency.\n\nMany large asset managers such as BlackRock, Vanguard, and State Street have infamously pushed controversial policies through proxy voting.\n\nHere are some of BlackRock and Baillie Gifford's most egregious proxy votes:\n\nState financial officers have fought back against this sort of leftist encroachment in corporate America.\n\nThe same year, Oklahoma State Treasurer Todd Russ (R) blacklisted 13 financial institutions deemed to be boycotting the energy industry.\n\nIn 2022, Glenn Hegar, the Texas state comptroller, banned BlackRock and nine other finance firms from working with the Lone Star State after they declared their hostility to fossil fuels.\n\n\"The environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) movement has produced an opaque and perverse system in which some financial companies no longer make decisions in the best interest of their shareholders or their clients, but instead use their financial clout to push a social and political agenda shrouded in secrecy,\" Hegar said in a statement at the time.\n\nThe strong pushback against ESG, in part from state financial officers, led BlackRock CEO Larry Fink in 2023 to lament that he no longer uses the term \"ESG\" as it has been \"weaponized.\"\n\n\"We have a mandate to keep fighting to protect the American people's money from the disaster that is woke political ideology,\" Oleka concluded.\n\nUtah State Treasurer Marlo Oaks, the State Financial Officers Foundation national chairman, told Breitbart News, \"These results are certainly encouraging, but not surprising. Families in Utah and nationwide care deeply about their financial security, not just for themselves but for future generations,\" he said. \"They see radical forces and ideologies being financed with their dollars and rightly expect us to push back. That's what every SFOF member is doing.\"\n\n\"We won't rest until these political movements are no longer threatening Americans with our own money to put far-left politics over retirement profits,\" he vowed.\n\nSean Moran is a policy reporter for Breitbart News.

Officers Sentenced in Connection to Car Chase Death\n\nPresident Donald Trump gave full pardons to former Washington, DC, Metropolitan Police Department (MPD) officers convicted in connection to the death of Karon Hylton-Brown, 20, who was fatally struck while being chased by one of the officers in 2020.\n\nTrump, on Wednesday night, announced full and unconditional pardons for former officer Terence Sutton and Andrew Zabavsky, who was a lieutenant for the metropolitan police.\n\n\"I HEREBY DESIGNATE , direct, and empower, the Pardon Attorney, as my representative, to sign a grant of clemency to the person named herein. The Pardon Attorney shall declare that her action is the act of the President, being performed at my direction,\" Trump declared in both pardons.\n\nIn a release published by then-President Joe Biden's Justice Department in September 2024, prosecutors said on the night of October 23, 2020, Sutton pursued Hylton-Brown, who was operating a moped, in a vehicular chase after Hylton-Brown refused to stop for Sutton. WUSA reported the chase deviated from MPD policy.\n\nToward the end of the chase, Sutton followed Hylton-Brown down a narrow alley and turned off his lights and siren, prosecutors said. Sutton accelerated, and Hylton-Brown was struck by a third vehicle, which was not part of the chase, when he drove onto a street at the end of the alley, per the release.\n\nSutton was found guilty of second-degree murder. He and Zabavsky were both convicted of conspiracy to obstruct justice and obstructing justice for what jurors found was a conspiracy \"to hide from MPD officials the circumstances of the traffic crash leading to Mr. Hylton-Brown's death,\" the Biden Justice Department release said. Sutton was sentenced to 66 months in prison in September 2024, while Zabavsky received a 48-month sentence.\n\nAt his press conference on Wednesday alongside tech leaders announcing a half trillion dollar investment in the artificial intelligence infrastructure in the United States, Trump hinted that he would be pardoning both men:\n\nIn fact, I'm going to be letting two officers...I believe they're from D.C., but I just approved it. They were arrested, put in jail for five years because they went after an illegal, and I guess something happened, where something went wrong, and they arrested the two officers to put them in jail for going after a criminal, a rough criminal, by the way.\n\nA filing in the case from one of Sutton's attorneys said that \"on the day of his death, Hylton-Brown was identified in a 'beat book' prepared by DC Police's Intelligence Unit as a verified member of KDY\" or the Kennedy Street Crew gang, WUSA reported .\n\nThe attorney, J. Michael Hannon, \"argued at trial that another officer had flagged suspicious behavior by Hylton-Brown earlier in the day and said Sutton and Zabavsky believed he had returned to Brightwood Park that evening to retaliate after a dispute,\" per the outlet.\n\nNBC News Washington obtained a statement from Zabavsky's representation expressing his gratitude to Trump.\n\n\"Lt. Andrew Zabavsky thanks President Donald J. Trump for his decision to grant him a full and unconditional pardon,\" the statement said.\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

The shooter, now identified as a 15-year-old female student, is also deceased.\n\nALCS is a K-12 school, which means students of all ages were at school when the attack occurred.\n\nChannel 3000 aired the Monday night press conference in which Barnes said, \"At 10:57 a.m., a second-grade student called 911 to report a shooting had occurred at school.\"\n\nHe said, \"A deputy with the Dane County Sheriff's Office was the first officer to arrive on the scene at 11 a.m. Twenty-four seconds later, the first Madison police officer arrived on the scene, at 11:01 a.m. and immediately entered the school.\"\n\nBarnes noted, \"At 11:05 a.m. officers inside the school alerted people that the shooter was down and a gun had been recovered.\"\n\nThe attacker allegedly used a handgun.\n\nAWR Hawkins is an award-winning Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and the writer/curator of Down Range with AWR Hawkins , a weekly newsletter focused on all things Second Amendment, also for Breitbart News.

      "text": "'Sharp Increase': More Than 100K Police Officers Attacked on the Job in Two Years\n\nMore than 100,000 law enforcement officers have been attacked on the job in the last two years, and more were killed in the last three years compared to any other period within the last 20 years, FBI statistics show.\n\nA shocking 194 officers were feloniously killed between 2021 and 2023 - more than in any other consecutive three-year period in the past two decades - a special report that the FBI released on Tuesday revealed.\n\nLaw enforcement agencies around the country reported to the bureau that a total of 79,091 officers were assaulted in 2023, marking the highest officer assault rate in the past decade.\n\nThe top two most common circumstances during which these assaults occurred were when cops responded to simple assaults against non-officers and when cops responded to drug violations.\n\nSo far in 2024, 12 law enforcement officers have been feloniously killed, and 21 were killed in accidents in the line of duty, according to recent data .\n\nThe special report was released during National Police Week, as police groups raise awareness for the uptick in violence cops have been facing while doing their jobs.\n\nRetired Lt. Randy Sutton, the founder of the Wounded Blue, said to the National Desk's Jan Jeffcoat:\n\nThe reality is that the dehumanization of law enforcement that's taking place over the last few years - the defunding of law enforcement and the demonizing of law enforcement by political elites, by the media by \"activists\" who have pushed a policy of not supporting law enforcement in meaningful ways.\n\n\"What this means is that law enforcement officers are afraid to defend themselves.\"\n\nSutton's Las Vegas-based organization works to support injured cops and their families by fighting for worker's compensation, providing health support, and advocating for stronger legislation.\n\n\"That number of 79,000 law enforcement officers being physically assaulted in 2023 is a sharp, sharp increase from previous years,\" Sutton told the outlet. \"Many of these attacks wind up in disabling injuries or serious injuries, which can have dramatic effects on the life [and] on the mental and physical well-being of these law enforcement officers.\"\n\nPlease let us know if you're having issues with commenting.\n\nCopyright © 2025 Breitbart"

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: GOP Rep Unveils Bill To Honor Nation's Law Enforcement Officers\n\nPhoto by Nathan Howard/Getty Images\n\nRepublican Texas Rep. Troy Nehls reintroduced a bill Thursday that seeks to honor the service of the nation's law enforcement officers.\n\nNehls' National Law Enforcement Remembrance, Support and Community Outreach Act directs the Department of Interior to establish a program to enhance the community outreach and public education efforts of the National Law Enforcement museum by awarding grants to a memorial fund that supports the museum. The legislation seeks to increase public support for law enforcement by aiding the museum's education and outreach efforts, according to the bill text.\n\nNehls, a former law enforcement officer, introduced the bill Thursday on national law enforcement appreciation day.\n\n\"I'm proud to reintroduce bipartisan legislation alongside my colleague, Congressman Panetta, to memorialize and honor our nation's law enforcement officers,\" Nehls told the Daily Caller News Foundation. \"Day in and day out, our nation's law enforcement officers put their lives on the line to protect our communities, often without recognition. The National Law Enforcement Remembrance, Support, and Community Outreach Act will pay tribute to and honor our brave law enforcement officers and bring public awareness to their service and sacrifices. As a former law enforcement officer, I will always back the blue.\" (RELATED: 'No Warning': Deadly LA Wildfires Leave Thousands With Nothing As Entire Neighborhoods Burn)\n\nNLEOMF Bill Text (119th) [75] by adam on Scribd\n\nNehls' reintroduction of the bill comes as Americans' confidence in law enforcement is historically low. Just over half of Americans have a \"great deal\" or \"quite a lot\" of confidence in law enforcement, according to a Gallup survey conducted in July 2024.\n\nNearly 150 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty in 2024, amounting to a 25% increase from 2023, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund.\n\nDemocratic California Rep. Jimmy Panetta is co-leading the bill, which has 28 cosponsors.\n\n\"Law enforcement officers across the nation work hard to protect our communities and serve the public,\" Democratic California Rep. Jimmy Panetta told the DCNF. \"The bipartisan National Law Enforcement Remembrance, Support, and Community Outreach Act honors the bravery and sacrifice of those who have fallen in the line of duty by preserving their legacy, commemorating their service, and fostering stronger bonds between law enforcement and the public. This legislation is bipartisanship recognition for the courage and service of law enforcement.\"\n\nThe law enforcement support bill is endorsed by many law enforcement organizations, including Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, Fraternal Order of Police, Fraternal Order of Police Auxiliary, International Brotherhood of Police Officers, International Union of Police Associations/AFL-CIO, National Association of Police Organizations and the National Sheriffs Association.\n\nNehls previously introduced the bill in May 2023. That bill obtained widespread support in the House with more than a third of lawmakers - 156 in total - signing on as cosponsors of the bill.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Dem-Run Cities See Massive Exodus Of Police Officers As Crime Rages On\n\n(Photo by LEONARDO MUNOZ/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nSome of the largest Democrat-run cities in the country saw their police forces shrink as they grappled with persistently high homicide rates following the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a Daily Caller News Foundation analysis of Census Bureau data.\n\nNew York City , Los Angeles , Portland , Austin and Washington, D.C. , all run by Democrats, collectively had about 1,500 fewer law enforcement officers on staff in 2023 than they did prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to a DCNF analysis of the Census Bureau's 2019 and 2023 Annual Survey of Public Employment and Payroll.\n\nPolice departments shrunk in these cities as they failed to reverse the spike in homicide rates coinciding both with the COVID-19 pandemic and with the wave of racial justice movements seeking to reform law enforcement that cropped up following the death of George Floyd.\n\nPortland, for instance, had a homicide rate of 13.2 per 100,000 residents as of 2023, an almost 140% increase from its pre-pandemic rate of 5.5 per 100,000, according to Census and city data. Concurrent with the increase in murder rates, the number of police officers in Portland shrunk by 183 between 2019 and 2023, falling from 911 to just 728.

Following the cuts, homicides in Portland jumped by 83%, which was among the highest of any major city that year, Oregon Public Broadcasting reported .\n\nDemocratic Mayor Ted Wheeler supported law enforcement cuts at the time but, less than a year later, he reversed course and attempted to restore some funding to Portland's police department.\n\nAs crime remains persistently high, many are opting to leave Portland, with the city losing over 4,000 residents between July 2022 and July 2023, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nPortland police officers and pro-Palestinian students face off during a demonstration on the campus of Portland State University (Photo by JOHN RUDOFF/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nD.C. also bent the knee to racial justice activists in 2020, likewise reducing its budget by $15 million, according to local outlets. D.C. had 113 fewer officers on payroll in 2023 than it did in 2019, according to Census data.\n\nD.C.'s city council was controlled by Democrats at the time of the budget cuts.\n\nThe homicide rate in the nation's capital, meanwhile, was 72% higher in 2023 than it was in 2019, rising from 23.5 murders per 100,000 residents to 40.4 murders per 100,000, according to police and Census data.\n\nDemocratic D.C. Councilman Charles Allen, who led the effort to cut police funding in the city, is the target of a recall campaign , with critics arguing his approach to public safety helped lead to the increase in violent crime.\n\nNew York City, which has the largest police department in the country, lost 843 officers between 2019 and 2023, according to Census data. New York, like Portland and D.C., has also failed to bring its homicide rate below pre-pandemic levels.\n\nNew York's homicide rate per 100,000 inhabitants remains 23% higher than it was in 2019, according to municipal and Census data. The New York Police Department (NYPD) is understaffed, which is creating concerns for public safety, the NYC Police Benevolent Association said in March.\n\nMonths earlier, in January, Democratic Mayor Eric Adams rolled back plans to cut funding to the NYPD, the New York Post reported .\n\nLos Angeles, which also has one of the largest police departments in the country, saw its force shrink by 242 members between 2019 and 2023, according to Census figures. The homicide rate in the city, meanwhile, was 32% higher in 2023 than it was in 2019, per city and census data.\n\nMany Los Angeles residents are discontent with the state of law enforcement in their city, with 51% of voters saying in a February poll that they disapprove of the job Democratic District Attorney George Gascón is doing.\n\nAustin, which lost 104 police officers between 2019 and 2023, saw its homicide rate jumping by 76% during that period, Census and municipal shows. The city cut its police budget by roughly a third in 2020, the Texas Tribune reported .\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott sent in state police to aid Austin as it faced a police staffing shortage in March 2023, according to the Texas Tribune. City leaders pushed to end that partnership after data showed state police were disproportionately arresting Black and Hispanic residents with state police eventually pulling out in December 2023, according to Texas Public Radio.\n\nThe mayor's offices in each of these cities did not respond to the DCNF's requests for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: New Docs Shed Light On Air Force's 'Goal' To Reduce 'White Male Population' Joining Officer Ranks\n\n(Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nThe Air Force finally handed over a trove of documents pertaining to its sweeping \"goal\" of reducing the number of white male applicants in a popular officer program after spending months stonewalling requests for their release.\n\nJoint Chiefs of Staff Chairman C.Q. Brown - at the time the highest-ranking member of the Air Force - issued a memorandum in 2022 that the branch was updating its racial and gender demographic goals for applicants seeking to become officers, in a bid to prioritize \"diversity and inclusion.\" Internal documents obtained by the Daily Caller News Foundation include a slideshow from 2022 where the Air Force outlines racial and gender quotas and details how it hopes to \"achieve\" a reduced number of white males in its Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) officer's applicant program. (RELATED: US Is 'Dangerously Reliant' On Chinese Cranes Deeply Embedded In America's Major Ports, House Investigation Finds)\n\nThe documents reflect the Biden-Harris Pentagon's intense focus on implementing diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) policies in the armed forces, even as the military continues to combat dwindling morale among its rank-and-file, recruiting and retention shortfalls and low pay .\n\nARLINGTON, VIRGINIA - APRIL 26: U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin (C) and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. C.Q. Brown, Jr (R) answer questions during a press briefing at the Pentagon April 26, 2024 in Arlington, Virginia. (Photo by Win McNamee/Getty Images)\n\n\"The American people are rightly concerned that, at a time when our country is facing dangerous and increasing threats throughout the world, the Air Force is focused on recruitment efforts based on arbitrary racial diversity goals - not merit or increasing the force's lethality,\" James Fitzpatrick, director of the Center To Advance Security In America (CASA), told the DCNF.\n\nCASA requested records regarding the Air Force's new officer applicant standards through a federal transparency request, called a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request in 2023. At the time, the Air Force said it couldn't find any records, according to a letter obtained by the DCNF.\n\nCASA then sued the Air Force for the records in April 2024 and received hundreds of documents and slides in response, which the DCNF subsequently obtained.\n\nA spokesperson for the Air Force told the DCNF \"The FOIA request was being processed at multiple levels within the Air Force.\"\n\n\"One of the units responded to the FOIA request with a 'no responsive records' response after conducting their own local search, while the remainder of the units continued to process the responsive documents that were ultimately provided,\" the spokesperson told the DCNF.\n\nOne of the slides in question, labeled \"AFROTC White,\" depicts a graph that shows the percentage of white male ROTC officer applicants declining from approximately 60% in fiscal year 2019 to a projected 50% in fiscal year 2023. The graph further details how the Air Force's goal is to reduce that percentage down to approximately 43% by fiscal year 2029, denoted by a star with the label \"achieve(d) goal.\" (RELATED: 'Worth Billions': Defense Contractors Set To Hit Gold Rush Amid Record Weapons Orders)\n\n\"White male population will decline as other demographics increase,\" the slide reads.\n\nA screenshot of an internal Air Force slide deck titled \"Officer Accession Applicant Pool Goals Diversity & Inclusion Outreach Plans\" from January 2022.\n\nThe respective slides in question also explain that the Air Force is either on track or needs to do more to hit racial and gender quotas in the ROTC's officer applicant pool.\n\nFor example, with the African American population, the slideshow suggests the Air Force \"target [the] male population through ongoing programs and marketing\" and notes it has already met its \"female goal\" for ROTC officer applicants. For the American Indian, Asian and Hispanic applicants, the slideshow says the Air Force is \"on track to grow diversity.\"\n\n\"These documents show us that the Air Force has taken steps toward implementing their new directive of specific racial quotas for officer recruitment and enrollment throughout the branch,\" Fitzpatrick told the DCNF.\n\nIncluded in the slide deck are funding requests for diversity recruiting initiatives, including $500,000 for \"diversity advertising campaigns\" and $250,000 for \" influencer engagements.\"\n\nIn a separate set of documents from as early as 2022, the Air Force outlines its efforts to modify ROTC scholarship programs, which \"play an important role in accession and diversity goals.\" The Air Force suggests modifying the scholarship models could remove certain \"testing barriers\" to entry for under-represented groups.\n\nA screenshot of an internal Air Force slide deck titled \"Officer Accession Applicant Pool Goals Diversity & Inclusion Outreach Plans\" from January 2022.\n\nThe diversity plans extend to the Air Force's Aim High Flight Academy (AHFA), an aviation scholarship program for high school, ROTC and Air Force Academy students, according to the documents. The Air Force notes that the AFHA applicant pool should be made up of a \"minimum\" of 60% underrepresented groups, further noting that it must be at least 35% minorities. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Former Navy SEAL Says Biden, Harris Haven't Learned 'Any Lessons' From Afghanistan Withdrawal)\n\nLike other branches of the military, the Air Force has struggled to keep up with recruiting and retention targets in recent years. The Navy is expected to miss its recruiting goals in 2024; the Marine Corps, Army and Air Force are on on track to meet their goals, although the latter two branches missed their targets in 2022 and 2023, according to Military Times.\n\nOnly approximately 57% of servicemembers or military families polled by the Military Family Advisory Network in 2023 said they'd recommend joining the service, compared to 74% in 2019. Among some of the reasons the respondents wouldn't recommend service were the politically charged nature of the military, differences and divisions, and low pay, among others.\n\nA year-long study from the Arizona State University Center for American Institutions found that the Pentagon has turned into a \"vast DEI bureaucracy\" in the last four decades, a challenge that has been exacerbated by the Biden-Harris administration.\n\n\"It's no surprise that young people are turning away from military service in record numbers... DEI indoctrination has become a core component of military training that begins for officers even at the service academies,\" Matt Lohmeier, former Space Force commander, said in a statement in June.\n\nEditor's note: This article has been updated with comment from the Air Force.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Police Officer Hiring Increased For First Year Since 2020, Survey Says\n\nREUTERS/Jonathan Ernst\n\nThe hiring of police officers is rising for the first year since 2020, a new survey shows.\n\nPolice departments across the U.S. have struggled to remain staffed for the past few years as officers left in droves following the Defund the Police movement and the Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests and rioting that peaked after the death of George Floyd in 2020. For the first time since the nationwide unrest and lockdowns, total staffing has increased among police agencies with some small and medium bodies reporting more sworn officers than in January 2020, according to data obtained by the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF).\n\n\"For the first time since the start of the pandemic, agencies reported a year-over-year increase in total sworn staffing. Responding agencies reported hiring more sworn officers in 2023 than in any of the previous four years. Agencies saw fewer resignations in 2023 than they did in 2021 or 2022, though they still had more officers resign last year than in 2019 or 2020. And retirements dropped back down to roughly where they were in 2019 after being elevated for the previous three years,\" the survey reads.\n\nTrending: New PERF survey shows police agencies have turned a corner with staffing challenges https://t.co/CIDihkx36X\n\n- Chuck Wexler (@CWexlerPERF) April 28, 2024\n\n\"Small and medium agencies now have more sworn officers than they had in January 2020.  In large agencies, sworn staffing slightly increased during 2023, but it is still more than 5 percent below where it was in January 2020,\" the survey continues. (RELATED: EXCLUSIVE: Police Report Contradicts Pro-Defund The Police DC Councilman's Mugging Story)\n\nTotal sworn officers hired by police agencies landed at 11,098 in 2023, the survey shows. This rebound was nearly 30% more than in 2020, when only 8,558 total sworn officers hired were reported. In 2020, police agencies hired nearly 18% less total sworn officers than in 2019, when 10,430 were hired.\n\nPolice agencies reported 151,335 total sworn officers on January 1, 2024, a 0.4% increase from 150,714 total sworn officers reported on Jan. 1, 2023, according to PERF. Sworn staffing data from 2024 was still 4.9% lower than Jan. 1, 2020, when there were 159,199 reported total sworn officers.\n\nIn 2022, a total of 6,492 sworn officers resigned from police agencies, according to PERF's survey. In 2023, 5,090 sworn officers resigned - a 21.6% decrease from the year prior.

We humbly ask you to consider joining us in this fight.\n\nNow that millions of readers are rejecting the increasingly biased and even corrupt corporate  media and \n\t\t\t\t\tjoining us daily, there are powerful forces lined up to stop us: the old guard of the news media hopes \n\t\t\t\t\tto marginalize us; the big corporate ad agencies want to deprive us of revenue and put us out of business; \n\t\t\t\t\tsenators threaten to have our reporters arrested for asking simple questions; the big tech platforms want \n\t\t\t\t\tto limit our ability to communicate with you; and the political party establishments feel threatened by our \n\t\t\t\t\tindependence.\n\nWe don't complain -- we can't stand complainers --  but we do call it how we see it.

      "text": "'Total Failure Of Leadership': Hochul Fires Thousands Of Corrections Officers Striking For Safety\n\nNY prisons were already suffering from understaffing and low recruitment.\n\nNew York Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul on Monday fired thousands of officers for continuing to strike over unsafe work conditions, including complaints about days-long shifts and increased violence sparked by the implementation of the Democrat-backed Humane Alternatives to Long-Term Solitary Confinement (HALT) Act.\n\nHochul terminated some 2,000 officers on Monday for not returning to work following the governor claiming she struck a deal with officers on March 6. Most striking officers, though, refused that deal, and their government-affiliated union, the New York Correction Officers' Benevolent Association (NYCOBA), said Hochul cut them out of negotiations and only worked with the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS).\n\nThe March 6 deal, which included a 90-day suspension of the HALT Act and a commitment toward cutting days-long shifts, was largely rejected by the rank and file, with about 8,000 officers continuing to strike last week. In response, Hochul terminated health insurance coverage for more than 5,000 officers and their dependents. This sparked reports of children, pregnant wives, and a mother battling cancer without treatment.\n\nOfficers told The Daily Wire that this was why some men and women went back to work; they hated the \"deal\" but decided to risk their own safety and return to the prisons because they couldn't afford the health care termination.\n\nNotably, the deal struck on March 6 needed 85% of those on strike to return to work by Monday for it to go into effect and end the strike. DOCCS Commissioner Daniel Martuscello admitted on Monday that this threshold was not met, with thousands still on strike. He deemed the strike \"over,\" anyway.\n\n\"We are committed to building a dedicated, resilient workforce and attracting the next generation of correctional leaders,\" Martuscello said. \"We will work to ensure the new department will be safer and more effective for everyone involved.\"\n\nHochul has had to summon the National Guard to work in dozens of New York prisons during the strike, and thousands of members will have to continue to help since the already-understaffed prisons have been cut by another 2,000 workers.\n\n\"The New York state Department of Corrections fired 2,000 officers yesterday, and was already down 2,000 officers,\" journalist and radio host Bob Lonsberry posted Tuesday morning. \"The last academy class graduated 57 officers and was held in July 2024.\"\n\n\"They will have to graduate 35 academies to replace the 2,000 just fired,\" he added. \"Though the average is two academies a year, if they run the 8-week academy continuously, they can do six academies a year, meaning they can catch up to their dramatically understaffed level of a month ago in six years.\"\n\nScreenshot: Bob Lonsberry on X\n\nNY Rep. Mike Lawler (R) criticized Hochul for the move on X, calling it \"a total failure of leadership.\"\n\n\"Gov. Hochul,⁩ who continues to use taxpayer money to provide free housing, clothing, food, education, and healthcare to illegal immigrants, just fired over 2,000 Corrections Officers and took away their healthcare,\" he posted.\n\nAnother NY representative, Nick Langworthy, called for a federal investigation by the U.S. Department of Labor into Hochul's \"harmful labor practices against New York State corrections officers.\"\n\n\"I am calling for a federal investigation by the Department of Labor into Governor Hochul's harmful labor practices against New York State corrections officers, relating to the suspension of health insurance benefits and excessive mandatory overtime for corrections officers,\" the congressman said. \"I will not stand by while corrections officers are being denied a right to reasonable working conditions and policies to keep them safe.\"\n\nRelated: Woman Can't Get Chemo After Hochul Cuts Health Insurance For Correctional Officers\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Hochul Presser Spirals With Arrest Threats For Striking Officers: 'Catch Every Single One Of Them'\n\nHochul said she's started arrest proceedings for 380 officers striking over unsafe conditions.\n\nNew York Democrat Gov. Kathy Hochul on Tuesday repeatedly attacked corrections officers across the state for striking over unsafe work conditions and long mandated shifts that officers say can last numerous days at a time.\n\nAbout 15,000 corrections officers statewide are on strike and protesting over their concerns about safety being ignored for too long, officers say. Specifically, officers have cited Democrat-backed legislation, such as the HALT Act, and the closing of numerous prisons, for creating an unsafe work environment.\n\nSpeaking to the press about the escalating strike, Hochul confirmed that she's taking legal moves to have striking officers arrested.\n\n\"Has anyone been arrested?\" a reporter asked the governor, to which she responded, \" The proceedings have started. I think we have 380 people on the first list through the attorney general's office and they're being served by state police as we speak. This is in violation of law.\"\n\nHochul suggested that she had state troopers serve papers with the threat of arrest to striking officers as a scare tactic, but since they didn't back down, she'd continue down the path to having these officers arrested \"in batches.\"\n\nThe governor brought up Marcos Gonzalez Soler, who serves as Deputy Secretary for Public Safety, for more details on the legal proceedings. He suggested all 15,000 would be addressed legally if need be.\n\n\"We will go to catch every single one of them until they've returned to work,\" Gonzalez Soler told the media.\n\nHochul further claimed that officers are the ones creating safety issues and repeatedly said that she doesn't know what striking officers want.\n\nThe work stoppage started on February 17, with officers from two New York prisons striking over unsafe conditions. The movement quickly swelled in support, and now nine out of ten officers across 38 of the state's 42 prisons are participating.\n\nThe strike has not been sanctioned by the New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association (NYSCOPBA), which is the government-affiliated union for corrections officers, making this a \"wildcat strike.\" Hochul has repeatedly called the strike \"illegal,\" citing violation of the Taylor Law.\n\nThe strike was sparked just days after officials locked down the Collins Correctional Facility in Erie County due to an inmate uprising, and a memo was circulated by the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS), with Commissioner Dan Martuscello writing that \"70% of our original staffing model is the new 100%\" and to \"identify where we can eliminate and/or realign posts and associated duties.\" The DOCCS has since said that the posts referenced in the memo would mainly apply to \"vacant positions.\"\n\nThe governor has deployed 6,500 National Guard members to run the prisons and is working to consolidate inmates due to the lack of coverage. Hochul has ordered the state to stop paying for health insurance for those on strike, and the DOCCS is docking two days of pay for every day an officer remains on strike.\n\nMediation between the two sides began on Monday, with a reported offer from the state for two times the hourly rate for overtime, the nixing of that controversial staff-reduction memo, and suspension of certain provisions in the HALT Act. However, t he New York State Senate blocked a proposal to repeal the HALT Act on Tuesday.\n\nOfficers, though, reportedly want more guarantees for safety and are skeptical of promised concessions due to Hochul's comments and actions.\n\nRelated: Everything You Need To Know About The Corrections Officers Strike In NY\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

The 25-year-old has since been controversially charged with second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide in Neely's death and is facing up to 19 years behind bars if convicted on both counts.\n\nIt was revealed in court that Neely was still alive when officers arrived on the scene and that he was administered Narcan, a drug used to reverse opioid overdoses. Moreover, jurors learned that, as a safety precaution, officers did not give Neely mouth-to-mouth because Neely looked dirty and disease-ridden.\n\n\"He was an apparent drug user and he was very dirty,\" NYPD Sgt. Carl Johnson testified, according to the New York Post. \"I didn't want my officers to put their lips on his mouth. They could get hepatitis or AIDS ... chest compressions would be enough to get him awake.\"\n\nMATT WALSH'S 'AM I RACIST?' NOW STREAMING ON DAILYWIRE+\n\nPressed by Penny's attorney Thomas Kenniff about why only chest compressions were administered, Johnson reportedly said he \"didn't have a mask to wear to protect himself from potentially being infected by any 'number of diseases,'\" a Daily Mail report said .\n\n\"There's a certain line where you have to protect your officer,\" Johnson told the court. \"Look at 9/11. I wouldn't want one of my officers getting sick from this.\"\n\nIf Neely did wake up, the sergeant explained, \"he would have been vomiting.\"\n\n\"I didn't want my officers to do that,\" Johnson said. \"He was filthy. He looked like a homeless individual. You have to protect your officer. I wouldn't want my officer to get sick if the person throws up.\"\n\nNotably, a synthetic cannabinoid called K2 was found in Neely's system, according to a toxicology report ordered by the prosecution.\n\nKenniff, Penny's attorney, spoke to The Daily Wire last month and said this would likely be disclosed by the state.\n\n\"I don't think it would be a smart tactical move for the prosecution to try to hide it,\" Kenniff said. \"So I think it's coming out one way or another. I think it's gonna come out through the government's case, but certainly, that is going to be part of what the defense will point to [as one of] many other factors to describe the [circumstances].\"\n\n\"It's very important that the jury be aware of that drug in Mr. Neely's system, and the effects of that drug, because it affects behaviors, particularly when Mr. Neely was likely in a psychotic episode to begin with, which he has a history of,\" the attorney added. \"It's going to affect how threatening Neely appeared.\"\n\nUse of K2, sometimes referred to a \"spice,\" has been linked to psychosis.\n\nRelated: EXCLUSIVE: Daniel Penny's Lawyer Talks Strategy Ahead Of Chokehold Death Case\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

The following day, in a widely criticized move, she signed an executive order banning them from future work in New York, including even county governments.\n\nOfficials in Chemung County, Oneida County, and Rensselaer County have all indicated that they will outright defy the order or move to challenge it legally to regain control of their hiring processes.\n\nChemung County has issued a lawsuit this past week over the action, arguing that the order is unlawful. \"We are taking this action to protect our ability to staff our jail with experienced personnel and to stand against unconstitutional overreach,\" Sheriff William Schrom said .\n\nIn Oneida County, the Board of Legislators approved a resolution allowing them to sue New York state over Hochul's order. County Executive Anthony Picente said the resolution was approved because lawmakers believe Hochul overstepped, Spectrum News reported .\n\n\"Executive order no. 47.3 is an abuse of the governor's authority and discretion, and unlawfully intrudes upon the county's powers of home rule,\" Picente said.\n\nSteve McLaughlin, who serves as county executive for Rensselaer County, said he would outright defy the order, calling it \"reprehensible and vicious.\"\n\n\"Just when you think Hochul can't get worse, she finds a way,\" he posted to X, captioning the executive order signed by Hochul. \"Preventing Corrections Officers from seeking employment with counties is reprehensible and vicious but that's exactly who Kathy Hochul is.\"\n\n\"Like I do with everything else regarding her idiotic statements and actions, I will ignore this as well,\" he said. \"I will hire as many as I can here in #RensselaerCounty and I dare you to sue me and the individual CO's as they seek gainful employment Hochul.\"\n\nHochul's decision to fire these officers in the first place has raised alarm, considering the understaffing and low recruitment already plaguing New York prisons across the state. Even before the strike started last month, there were about 2,000 vacant positions inside the prison system.\n\nHochul has National Guard members - without proper training - helping to man the prisons, with no end-date in sight. The governor activated thousands of members on the second day of the strike, and their inclusion has been controversial from the start. In some cases, they've been sleeping on gym floors and members have leaked photos of their rough conditions.\n\nMoreover, State Sen. Daniel Stec (R) said that these guardsmen were \"activated on state orders,\" which makes them ineligible for care from Veterans Affairs if they were to get injured.\n\nRelated: 'Vindictive Tyrant': Hochul Bars Corrections Officers She Fired From Ever Working For New York Again\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Hochul Threatens To Arrest Correction Officers Striking Over Unsafe Work Conditions\n\nDemocrat 'prison reform' measures have made prisons unsafe for inmates and officers, those on strike say.\n\nDemocratic Governor Kathy Hochul is threatening New York state correction officers who are striking over unsafe working conditions with arrests if they do not return to their jobs.\n\nFollowing a rise in violent incidents inside state prisons - which officers say is due to Democratic prison reform measures - correction officers and sergeants from two NY prisons started to protest and strike last Monday. The movement has since swelled in support, and now thousands of officers and sergeants from more than 30 prisons across the state are participating.\n\nHochul reacted by suing the officers, which ultimately led to her administration directing state troopers to serve papers on striking officers.\n\n\"State troopers began serving judicial orders on striking correction officers over the weekend that threatened they could be arrested if they do not show up to court this week and subsequently return to work,\" the Times Union reports . \"The service of the court orders is the first step in enforcing a temporary restraining order issued by a state Supreme Court justice in Erie County in a ruling that found the workers who began striking on February 17 are violating New York's Taylor Law governing public employees that prohibits job walkouts.\"\n\nAdditionally, Hochul has moved to stop paying for health insurance coverage for those striking. They'll now have to cover their entire share of their health insurance premium, which can be hundreds to thousands of dollars more a month. If an officer can't cover it, their insurance will be canceled.\n\nOfficers say the strike is a long overdue reaction to Hochul - and before her, Democratic Governor Andrew Cuomo - ignoring their complaints about safety and mandated work shifts that can sometimes exceed 48 hours at a time, according to a statement from New York Congresswoman, Elise Stefanik.\n\nIn the days leading up to the strike, officials locked down the Collins Correctional Facility in Erie County due to an inmate uprising. There was also a memo circulated by the Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) \"advising prison superintendents that 70% of DOCCS' original staffing model is the new 100%.\"\n\nNotably, those on strike do not have the support of the New York State Correctional Officers and Police Benevolent Association (NYSCOPBA), which is the government-affiliated union for correctional officers, making the strike a \"wildcat strike.\"\n\nWill Waldron/Albany Times Union via Getty Images\n\nOfficers are calling for the HALT Act to be repealed. The law went into effect in 2022 and mandates what proponents say are \"more humane alternatives\" to solitary confinement while also limiting which inmates can be placed in solitary at all.\n\nSupporters of the officers say the HALT Act hasn't worked and has made prisons unsafe, not only for officers but for inmates and other workers, like nurses, social workers, maintenance staff, and more.\n\nThey've cited DOCCS stats, arguing that there's been a 169% increase in inmate-on-inmate assault, a 76% rise in inmate-on-staff assault, and a 32% bump in contraband cases since the HALT Act was implemented.\n\nMost officers will not speak to the media out of fear of retribution, but there are retired officers participating in protests and expressing their former colleagues' frustrations. For example, Suzanne Furman, a recently retired sergeant, told CBS, \"You go to work and you don't know if you're gonna go home, and that's a true statement. The general public does not know how dangerous this job has become.\"\n\nThere are also message boards for officers, and some people are speaking out there. A woman named Sarah Tompkins said that while she was working at Green Haven Correctional Facility last year, an inmate tackled her to the floor and ripped out her hair. She provided photos of her injuries and said the inmate was only hit with harassment in the second degree, which is a violation, not a crime.\n\nA male officer also shared photos of his injuries from the job and wrote, \"I got punch[ed] in the face 3 times in a 30 day span.\"\n\nRepublican state Senator Pamala Helming said earlier this month that a female officer at Groveland Correctional Facility was sitting at her desk when an inmate attacked her; she was choked, punched, and kicked in the face and body.\n\nMediation between both sides began on Monday, with a reported offer from DOCCS for two times the hourly rate for overtime, the nixing of the controversial staffing reduction memo, and the suspension of certain provisions in the HALT Act.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

In a second attempt to detain Yoon, more than 3,000 police officers were sent to the president's compound and arrested him with \"no significant physical clashes,\" the Corruption Investigation Office for High Ranking Officials (CIO) said, according to CNBC . The CIO added, \"This time, there were no individuals or security staff actively obstructing the execution.\"\n\nYoon was questioned by officials and sent to a detention center after his arrest, the Associated Press reported . Before his arrest, Yoon said in a recorded video that the \"rule of law has completely collapsed in this country,\" arguing that the CIO investigation into his actions was \"illegal.\" The president added that he would willingly appear before the CIO for questioning to \"prevent an unpleasant bloodshed.\"\n\nHundreds of Yoon's supporters showed up outside the CIO office where he was being questioned, with some protesters holding signs that read, \"We will fight alongside President Yoon Suk Yeol,\" according to the AP.\n\nThe CIO was granted an arrest warrant for Yoon by a Seoul court late last month. Yoon is accused of abusing his power when he declared martial law and dispatched the military to the National Assembly as lawmakers gathered to undo the martial law decree on December 3. He was later impeached , and his presidential powers were suspended. To be removed from office, six of the nine justices on South Korea's Constitutional Court must vote in favor of his removal.\n\nCELEBRATE #47 WITH 47% OFF DAILYWIRE+ MEMBERSHIPS + A FREE $20 GIFT\n\nThe CIO has 48 hours to request a court order for Yoon's formal arrest, which, if granted, could lead to the impeached president being detained for up to 20 days before his indictment. An indictment on rebellion and abuse of power charges could keep Yoon in police custody for up to six months or when the court makes its initial ruling on the case, the AP reported.\n\nYoon declared martial law last month, arguing it was necessary \"to defend the free Republic of Korea from the threats of North Korean communist forces and to eradicate the shameless pro-North Korean anti-state forces.\"\n\nYoon cited an unworkable relationship with the opposition-led National Assembly, which had targeted 22 officials for impeachment since Yoon took office in 2022 and, according to Yoon, planned to target 10 more officials. The president also cited National Assembly reductions in the national budget, which he said \"undermined the essential functions of the state and turned Korea into a drug paradise and a public order panic.\"\n\nTim Pearce contributed to this report.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

The guidance previously read that leaders should \"consider diversity to ensure leaders represent our formations.\"\n\nAs Military.com noted, the new guidance also included mundane provisions such as physical fitness being a determining factor for top enlisted leaders in airborne roles.\n\nThe cut diversity line, however, comes after pressure from Republican lawmakers and others, who have insisted the military under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris has prioritized leftist ideology over military readiness.\n\nAm I Racist? Is In Theaters NOW - Get Your Tickets Here!\n\nFor example, as The Daily Wire exclusively reported in August, the Biden-Harris administration paid third-party organizations millions of taxpayer dollars to implement diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. In documents reviewed by The Daily Wire, it was revealed that part of the DEI initiatives included race-based career advancement programs.\n\n\"The documents, first obtained by the Functional Government Initiative, highlight the extent of the Pentagon's efforts to embed leftwing, race-based ideology in the military, in partnership with academic institutions and consulting firms,\" The Daily Wire reported. \"The outside organizations received taxpayer dollars to set up hiring pipelines that gave candidates preferential treatment on the basis of race and sex, advise the government agency on DEI policy, and combat internal and external resistance to said policies.\"\n\n\"The U.S. and its allies are facing challenges and threats all over the globe. Despite the increased concern for military preparedness, the DOD continues to prioritize DEI initiatives,\" FGI spokesman Peter McGinnis told The Daily Wire.\n\n\"Rather than maximizing readiness training to ensure a capable military, the DOD's training seems calculated to foster sowing internal discord with aggressive efforts to promote controversial ideologies,\" he added. \"Americans join the military to serve their nation and protect the homeland, not to sit through sensitivity training. The DOD owes them better.\"\n\nIn November 2023, The Daily Wire reported that the Department of Defense planned to spend nearly $270 million on DEI initiatives between fiscal years 2022 and 2024.\n\nIn addition to the removal of the diversity requirement in Weimer's guidance, he and Chief of Staff Gen. Randy George also replaced the Army slogan \"People First,\" which focused more on soldier and family needs than war preparedness. This attitude, which has been in place for the past four years, has led to reduced standards for women recruits, Military.com reported.\n\nSpencer Lindquist contributed to this report.\n\nAlready have an account?\n\nYour information could be the missing piece to an important story.

      "text": "Tyre Nichols' Alleged Killers Already Broke The Law, So More Laws Aren't The Answer - Accountability Is\n\nBy all accounts, what happened to Tyre Nichols last month was a crime and not a reflection of standard police policy.\n\nTyre Nichols was allegedly brutally beaten to death by several Memphis police officers, and it was all caught on tape. As a former prosecutor and state attorney general, I customarily reserve judgment even when incidents are video recorded - as proper investigations to ensure fair play do take time and patience.\n\nIn this case, however, I do not think it much of a stretch to say the video makes it clear that the police officers involved will go to jail, the city of Memphis is going to pay out millions of dollars to Nichols' family, and the Memphis Police Department is going to undergo severe and public scrutiny - reflecting its responsibility in the failed training and supervision of these rogue officers. This is accountability as it should be.\n\nYet, as has become the usual practice, Congress is now being called upon again to enact federal legislation to reform policing - ostensibly to prevent another Tyre Nichols or George Floyd or Rodney King tragedy from occurring.\n\nHad the officers who appeared to beat Nichols to death been white officers, these calls to Congress would have been accompanied by broad assertions of systemic racism and the disproportionate targeting of black victims. But in this instance, with the primary offending officers all appearing to be black, the usual specter of race as a motivator takes a backseat to what is readily apparent - these are just bad cops.\n\nThus, a proper question is: What should happen now? Do the circumstances of Nichols' death require national police reform to prevent a similarly deadly occurrence?\n\nBy all accounts, what happened to Nichols was a crime and not a reflection of standard police policy. The now-former police officers face criminal charges, including murder.\n\nWould a national ban on police chokeholds have prevented Nichols' death? That's what reformers wanted after Floyd's death - as if that would have saved him from a bad cop. Would a prohibition against specialized police units like the now-disbanded Memphis Police Department's Scorpion unit have prevented Nichols' death?\n\nNichols is dead because, by all appearances, at least five members of the Memphis Police Department violated their oath, broke the law, and beat him to death. If there is some actual demonstration that policing in the United States generally condones this type of behavior, then perhaps calls for sweeping reforms might be worthy of review.\n\nBut, as evidenced by the fact that the system is currently in the process of holding the officers involved accountable for their apparent crimes, this case does not indicate a need for wholesale reform of the entire policing system. Rather, Nichols' death demands accountability for gross deviations from proper conduct by corrupt individuals within the criminal justice system.\n\nThere is presumably not a police department in the country in which the apparent actions of the officers involved in Nichols' death would not already be violating the law. As The Washington Post acknowledged , the Memphis Police Department \"already has a policy on the books requiring officers to 'take reasonable action to intervene' if they observe a colleague 'engaged in dangerous or criminal conduct or abuse of a subject.'\"\n\nObviously, that law was not followed; to pass more laws that will not be followed by deviant officers will not prevent those officers' actions any more than gun bans stop criminals who are already willing to break the law. As Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, noted , the policing reforms that Democrats pushed for after the death of Floyd would not have kept Nichols' death from happening.\n\nNo matter what laws are passed, bad cops bent on breaking the law will not consider those laws as they are breaking them.\n\nMemphis and Tennessee officials have thus far acted appropriately by moving swiftly toward transparency and accountability in the aftermath of Nichols' beating and death. The police officers in question were fired. They have each been charged with causing or facilitating the death of Nichols. Almost certainly, they will go to prison.\n\nThere does not appear to be any sugarcoating of responsibility by the department or the city of Memphis for civil liability for causing Nichols' death - and further and necessary scrutiny will likely produce meaningful changes in the training and supervision of Memphis police officers, as it should.\n\nWe should always look for meaningful ways to improve our public safety functions. I recall years ago being a skeptical prosecutor when body cameras were first recommended for wider deployment. I was then of the opinion that a video clip of only a portion of an event might be taken out of context and skew the evidence.\n\nHowever, I have long since learned to embrace the value of the body camera and the dashboard camera as not only solid evidentiary tools for evaluating the potential criminal behavior of suspects but - just as importantly - as reliable and necessary checks on police conduct and procedures.\n\nThe job of a police officer is to protect and serve. It is one of the most dangerous jobs in existence. Police across the nation deserve our utmost respect and gratitude - just as we all deserve that they be held accountable for upholding the same laws they are sworn to enforce.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Trump Should Pardon D.C.'s Good Cops Victimized By Biden's Soft-On-Crime DOJ\n\nWashington, D.C., Police Officer Terrence Sutton was sentenced to jail because a gang member died trying to escape police.\n\nOn day one, President Donald Trump's administration should issue immediate pardons to Washington, D.C., Police Officers Terence Sutton and Andrew Zabavsky.\n\nSutton, a 13-year veteran of the Metropolitan Police Department (MPD), was sentenced to jail for five years because a gang member died trying to escape police. Zabavsky was convicted of conspiracy to obstruct and obstruction of justice, receiving a four-year sentence.\n\nA pardon would send the message that changes are coming to the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office and that the incoming Trump administration backs the blue. In turn, MPD officers will focus on fighting violent criminals without being worried that some progressive prosecutor will view them as the defendant.\n\nJoe Biden's Justice Department presided over D.C.'s deadliest year in more than two decades. According to crime data , 274 people were murdered in our nation's capital, many of whom were innocent children. Compared to other large cities, D.C. had the fifth-highest murder rate . Armed carjackings, one of the most violent crimes imaginable, nearly doubled from the previous year. The city that loudly championed defunding the police was forced to quietly pass emergency pro-law enforcement legislation in the face of a skyrocketing epidemic of violent crime.\n\nWhat has America's largest U.S. attorney's office done to respond to this violent outbreak?\n\nShort answer: not much.\n\nIn Sutton's case, after a nine-week jury trial in D.C. in December 2022, the U.S. attorney's office made the incomprehensible decision to prosecute Sutton for second-degree murder. It recommended an 18-year prison sentence.\n\nOn October 23, 2020, Sutton (\"the defendant,\" according to the DOJ) was on routine patrol on Kennedy Street, N.W. That night, a female MPD official informed Sutton that she observed Karon Hylton-Brown (\"the victim,\" according to the DOJ) in an altercation earlier that day and was concerned Hylton-Brown would return with a gun to finish the fight.\n\nMoments later, Sutton and three other members of MPD observed Hylton-Brown riding an electric moped and tried to speak with him to ensure he did not have a firearm. Hylton-Brown refused to stop and instead drove through a red light, which caused an oncoming car to have to stop to avoid hitting him. For the next three minutes, law enforcement pursued Hylton-Brown. During that time, he blew past stop signs, drove the wrong way on one-way streets, and committed other traffic offenses. Another officer observed Hylton-Brown \"blading\" his body, a tactic in which criminals turn their body to hide their firearms. Ultimately, Hylton-Brown failed to yield the right of way and was killed by an oncoming vehicle.\n\nSutton never made physical contact with Hylton-Brown. Moreover, Hylton-Brown fled police, committed numerous traffic infractions, appeared to be holding a firearm, and may have been intoxicated . Yet the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office charged Sutton with second-degree murder .\n\nThe assistant U.S. attorneys prosecuting the case, Risa Berkower and Ahmed Muktadir Baset  - who referred to alleged gang member Hylton-Brown as \"not very dangerous\" - hysterically accused Sutton of killing Hylton-Brown \"in cold blood.\" Berkower was a member of the Fraud, Public Corruption, and Civil Rights group in the D.C. U.S. Attorney's Office. The section's purported mission is to prosecute fraud and corruption. In reality, it serves to satisfy the whims of the political left. It should be reassigned to fight violent crime.\n\nThis is the same attorney's office that used thousands of taxpayer dollars to prosecute two of President Trump's closest allies - Steven Bannon and Peter Navarro - and seek six months of federal incarceration for both. The same group that sent four prosecutors, including Berkower , the prosecutor from the Sutton case, to Jack Smith's failed special counsel team. This \"elite\" group of prosecutors has wasted millions of taxpayer dollars.\n\nEven after securing a quick conviction of Sutton, the DOJ was not satisfied. At sentencing, the same Jack Smith acolyte asked that Sutton serve 18 years in prison - a sentence higher than what convicted murderers routinely receive in D.C. courts. Ultimately, even leftist D.C. Judge Paul Friedman found the recommendation too much, deciding on five years of incarceration for Sutton, a sentence he's currently serving.\n\nYears and years of taxpayer money funded the prosecution of a police officer while the DOJ watched D.C. burn to the ground.\n\nThe city is owed better. Our nation's capital is rife with gangs, carjackings, and shootings. The criminal justice system is so backlogged that trials for murders and rapes are often delayed for years, denying justice to victims and their families while greatly reducing the likelihood of conviction.\n\nRather than focus on violent crime, corrupt prosecutors prefer to grab the low-hanging fruit of prosecuting cops for an all-too happy leftist audience.\n\nAfter all, who benefits from the conviction of Sutton? Not the people who live on Kennedy Street. Those residents - a majority are black - are subject to indescribable violence and crime on a daily basis. This pathetic prosecution incentivizes law enforcement to look the other way and not pursue criminals they know are armed and dangerous. The only people who benefit are publicity-seeking prosecutors who want fame for their roles as progressive prosecutors. They win and the residents of Washington lose.\n\nA letter written in support of Sutton at his sentencing aptly summarizes the current environment in D.C. \"The community is suffering. The drug dealers, violent offenders, and other nefarious characters feel emboldened to operate with impunity. Every day is a zero-consequence holiday for them. For the community they feed off of and terrorize, it's another day of fear and pain.\"\n\nChange is coming. Beginning on January 20, 2025, the four-year, zero-consequences nightmare is over. The violent crime terrorists and their political enablers should be on notice.\n\nThis article has been updated since publication.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Military Officers: To Combat 'Disinformation,' The Government And Its Big Tech Buddies Should Tell You What To Think\n\nFour military officers who describe themselves as \"researchers\" at the Army's highly respected Cyber Institute have published an article that adds to the growing concern about the ongoing politicization of the military. Published by the military's National Defense University (NDU), their article purports to analyze the dangers of misinformation and disinformation and to advise the Biden administration about how to counter it.\n\nThe article's authors all are military officers and at least two are professors at West Point. They say their article \"is written in response to the Capitol insurrection.\"\n\nIronically, the article is itself misinformation. That this misinformation is published by military officers associated with two highly prestigious institutions, the NDU and the Cyber Institute, makes it all the more inappropriate and dangerous.\n\nThe article attempts to address a real and dangerous issue: how mis- and disinformation can endanger national security. Preparing for and combatting disinformation is a complex issue that involves disciplines from sociology and psychology to highly technical cyberwarfare issues.\n\nThe difference between misinformation and disinformation is generally understood to be a matter of intent; disinformation is intentionally and maliciously deceptive . Disinformation is as old as warfare itself; only the techniques vary. The U.S. military has been practicing and studying it and related disciplines for many years. Misinformation has been a staple of military operations since the days of the Trojan horse and Sun Tzu.\n\nThe Cyber Center authors' thesis is that the \"insurrection\" at the Capitol building on Jan. 6 was a mortal danger to the country that was caused by disinformation, namely the idea that the 2020 presidential election was rigged or stolen. The \"insurrection\" spawned by this alleged disinformation then becomes the justification for the authors' proposed government censorship (although they eschew the term) of free speech.\n\nThe article suffers from a number of flaws. One of the most notable - and dangerous - is that the authors wade deeper into the political wars by advocating more government control over speech that they regard as outside the mainstream or, as they put it, contrary to a desired \"shared reality.\"\n\nThe authors' misinformation begins in their very first paragraph: \"On January 6, 2021, long held assumptions about the meaning of American national security were challenged when insurrectionists stormed the United States Capitol, attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 Presidential election\" (bolded emphasis added here and elsewhere).\n\nWarming to their theme, the authors then claim \"recent polls indicate that nearly 20 percent of Americans approved of the insurrection \" and that their article is \"written in response to the Capitol insurrection .\" This purported support for an \" insurrection \" then becomes the compelling force for the authors' advice to the Biden administration that it should clamp down on free speech.\n\nBut that initial premise is false: Although some politicians have used the term, there was no \"insurrection.\" \"Insurrection\" is a violation of the federal criminal code, 15 U.S.C. §2383. If there had been an insurrection on Jan. 6, Attorney General Merrick Garland would have brought related criminal charges against the alleged insurrectionists. Although almost 300 people arrested for the events of Jan. 6 have been charged with \"parading \" in the Capitol building, not a single one has been charged with insurrection, indicating prosecutors don't have evidence to charge them of this crime.\n\nAdditionally, the authors' citation does not support their claim that almost 20 percent of Americans support the \"insurrection.\" The polling data that they cite in their very first footnote does not even mention the word \"insurrection,\" much less claim that one occurred on Jan. 6.\n\nAs these Cyber Institute scholars fully appreciate, in disinformation warfare, words matter. Yet they falsely equate \"insurrection\" with \"riot\" or \"protest.\" It is ironic that, in an article decrying the dangers of mis- and disinformation, the authors engage in misinformation by falsely claiming that 20 percent of Americans support an \"insurrection.\"\n\nThe authors then use that frightening but false statistic to support their call for more government control over speech. Because they argue the \"insurrection\" was caused by the false idea that the presidential election was rigged or stolen, they use that purported crisis to call for the government - aided by private actors - to squelch views of which they disapprove. They urge such censorship because they say mis- and disinformation are \"America's most urgent national security challenge.\"\n\nSo, how would these military officers identify \"disinformation\"? It is difficult to know, since the authors never define either mis- or disinformation. But apparently it is anything that is contrary to what they call \"shared reality.\"\n\nThey repeatedly call for a \"shared reality,\" which can be aided by, in their words, government \"pressure, if not regulation\" to \"bury spurious sources.\" They give an example: \"It may be necessary to consider requiring social media companies to adjust their algorithms to ensure users view a variety of legitimate professional news sources.\"\n\nThe authors acknowledge (in a footnote) that it may be difficult to secure \"universal agreement\" on just which news sources are \"legitimate.\" They never identify just who should be the arbiter of truth; they just leave that to unidentified actors in \"the private sector, the government, and the public.\" And they do not say how they would identify what needs to be censored, other than speech that departs from groupthink shared reality.\n\nBut, of course, some person must be the arbiter, even if only by writing the tech companies' algorithms. Who shall it be? A 23-year-old intern at Twitter? A committee of Mark Zuckerberg-approved techies? The Chairman of the House Intelligence Committee and serial liar Adam Schiff? Government bureaucrats such as Anthony Fauci, who lied to the American people because he thought they \" can't handle the truth \"? The authors provide no answer.\n\nThe folly inherent in the Cyber Institute researchers' heavy-handed proposals for government and private collaboration to limit speech to some \"shared reality\" was on full display in a disinformation campaign the authors ignore. That is the successful efforts by the Biden team (which includes the media and much of the intelligence community) to effectively censor The New York Post's revelations about Hunter Biden's laptop and emails evidencing his and President Biden's corruption.\n\nJust two weeks before the presidential election, and while early voting was in progress, Biden allies falsely portrayed the New York Post's revelations about Hunter's laptop and emails as Russian disinformation. In an article headlined \"Russian Disinfo,\" Politico reported that \"More than 50 former senior intelligence officials have signed on to a letter \" outlining their shared reality that the recent disclosure of Hunter Biden's emails \"has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\" They concluded: \"It is high time that Russia stops interfering in our democracy.\"\n\nThese former \"senior intelligence officials,\" including former Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and former Central Intelligence Agency Director John Brennan, claimed that they were doing exactly what the learned researchers at the Cyber Institute advocate in their article - countering the Post's alleged disinformation. And their bogus \"Russian Disinfo\" theme quickly became a \"shared reality\" among Democrats, the media, and other Biden supporters.\n\nBut they were dead wrong . It can no longer be seriously disputed that the laptop was indeed Hunter's and the emails were genuine. The \"shared reality\" published by the 50-plus learned \"senior intelligence officials\" was itself disinformation that, unlike the Capitol riot, may well have been decisive in the election.\n\nA serious and intellectually honest article about the dangers of disinformation would also have mentioned the biggest and most effective disinformation campaign in recent history - the Big Lie that Donald Trump colluded with the Russians. That was disinformation of the first order. It was spread by lies concocted by Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign in collusion with Russians, to overturn the results of the 2016 election.\n\nYet these Cyber Institute researchers ignore this disinformation and that Biden allies such as Clapper publicly spread disinformation about Trump's supposed collusion with Russians to undermine the election, while admitting under oath in closed-door sessions they knew of no evidence to support that. Such glaring omissions create, at a minimum, the appearance that the authors are reluctant to accuse prominent Democrats of disinformation lest they be perceived as aiding Trump when they are seeking to advise the Biden administration.\n\nAs this author has previously pointed out in The Federalist, there is no greater long-term danger to the country than the politicization of the military. For that reason, the military has a culture of not publicly wading into partisan disagreements.\n\nThe regrettable direction of the NDU article by the Cyber Center authors creates an unfortunate appearance that this nonpartisan culture may be at risk. These authors have shown little hesitation about wading into partisan thickets. Let us hope that this is an outlier, not a trend.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Our Military Needs Officers Chosen For Their Qualifications, Not Skin Color\n\nTo avoid racial tensions that weaken morale and cohesion, the Defense Department should eliminate all CRT programs, discontinue the use of racial preferences, and end all forms of race-based discrimination.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court recently heard oral arguments in two cases challenging race-based affirmative action practices at Harvard and the University of North Carolina (UNC). A group called Students for Fair Admissions (SFFA) sued those civilian schools for discriminatory admission policies, but the high-stakes legal drama also involves the military.\n\nArguing for the Department of Defense, U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar insisted (without evidence) that military officer corps diversity \"is a critical national security imperative\" and that \"it's not possible to achieve that diversity without race conscious admissions, including at the nation's service academies.\"\n\nHow did the military get roped into this legal debate?\n\nThe controversy started with a 2003 case called Grutter v. Bollinger, when a group of retired defense officials and military officers filed a friend of the court (amicus) brief arguing in support of racial preferences at the University of Michigan Law School.\n\nIn Grutter , the Department of Defense (DOD) surrogate brief claimed that racial preferences in admissions to the service academies and colleges having Reserve Officers' Training Corp (ROTC) scholarship programs were \"essential to national security.\" It was a far-fetched, disingenuous argument, but absent rebuttal, some justices bought it.\n\nThe 5-4 Grutter ruling allowed Michigan Law to consider race in choosing applicants, relying on the contrived claim that racial preferences in admissions were necessary to achieve racially diverse ROTC and military service academy programs. The alleged \"national security imperative,\" unfortunately, was deemed sufficient to satisfy the \"compelling state interest\" requirement needed to survive strict scrutiny.\n\nJustice Sandra Day O'Connor supported the Grutter ruling, but she cautioned that race-conscious practices should end in about 25 years. Nineteen years later, SFFA is petitioning the court to overturn Grutter and end discriminatory admissions policies now .\n\nThe students' case presents specific evidence of race-based discrimination against higher-scoring Asian applicants at Harvard and higher-scoring Asian and white applicants at UNC, arguing that such practices violate the equal protection clause of the U.S. Constitution and Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.\n\nThe Biden administration is supporting the pro -discrimination side, not the white and Asian students seeking non-discrimination and recognition of merit. Another DOD surrogate group filed an amicus brief like the one submitted in Grutter .\n\nEnter a group called Veterans for Fairness and Merit (VFM), which advocates for equal opportunity and merit and condemns all forms of racism. VFM filed a new amicus brief disputing the claim that effectiveness in combat depends on policies that are race-conscious instead of colorblind.\n\nThe VFM brief, filed on behalf of its more than 600 distinguished veteran members including 21 Medal of Honor recipients, presents persuasive facts countering the claim that the military officer corps lacks diversity. The percentage of black Army officers (12.3 percent), for example, is only one point shy of the approximately 13 percent of black people in the general population. VFM also argues that increased officer diversity is not essential to national security and that our military can defend America without suspending the equal protection clause.\n\nVFM's brief further states that discriminatory racial preferences are \"unquestionably harmful to our national security,\" explaining that such preferences are antithetical to the \"selfless servant, colorblind culture necessary for our military to prevail on the battlefield.\"\n\nWhen Justice Clarence Thomas asked Solicitor General Prelogar to describe the education benefits of race-conscious admissions, she noted intangibles such as \"cross-racial understanding.\" She also warned that smaller percentages of minorities in the officer corps than the enlisted ranks would lead to \"tremendous racial tension and strife\" as the armed forces have experienced in the past.\n\nIt was an astonishing argument. Unsurprisingly, it falls apart under closer examination. Racial strife in the armed forces did occur in the late 1960s and early 1970s, but it was largely caused by conscription, anti-Vietnam War radicalism, widespread drug abuse, racial suspicions, and Great Society failures like Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara's \"Project 100,000.\"\n\nLaunched in 1966, this disastrous social experiment did not target racial minorities, but it was supposed to help inner-city and rural men to escape poverty on the ladder of military service . Because standards were lowered to achieve social goals, \"Category IV\" inductees who scored low on aptitude tests became known as \"New Standards Men.\" Many of the disadvantaged Project 100,000 men were Black and Latino , and thousands died in disproportionate numbers. Those who survived did not fare well in civilian life.\n\nIn the early 1970s, the Navy also lowered standards to enlist a greater percentage of Category IV recruits with disciplinary problems and no high school diploma. According to a 1973 House Armed Services Subcommittee report , the carrier U.S.S. Kitty Hawk experienced severe insubordination and racial violence that shattered the chain of command.\n\nRacially polarized riots also occurred on the carrier U.S.S. Constellation , but the House subcommittee found no evidence of racial discrimination. Instead, agitators incited riots by convincing minority sailors that commanders were victimizing them because they were black.\n\nConditions of that era do not exist today. Since Vietnam, the all-volunteer force has fought several wars without race riots or combat refusals. However, the Defense Department risks heightening racial tensions with its critical race theory (CRT) instructions .\n\nIn \"anti-racist\" CRT programs, white participants must confess their \"white supremacy,\" and minorities are indoctrinated in woke victimology. Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., has quoted servicemember whistleblowers who said they were forced to participate in race-conscious \"privilege walks\" and viewings of videos re-writing American history as a \"fundamentally racist and evil nation.\"\n\nCRT \"anti-extremist\" programs and divisive use of racial preferences weaken mutual trust and cohesion, which are essential for combat effectiveness. To avoid racial tensions, the Defense Department should eliminate all CRT programs, discontinue the use of racial preferences, and end all forms of race-based discrimination.\n\nThe nine Supreme Court justices did not mention the competing military amicus briefs during oral arguments, but advocates of equality and meritocracy are raising a simple question: If a friend or family member is in combat, should their commanding officer be the best qualified, regardless of race? Or would it suffice to be led by lesser qualified officers whose skin color was used to achieve \"demographic parity\" between officers and the enlisted ranks?\n\nGiven what is at stake, the choice should be easy to make.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Police Will Keep Quitting In Droves Until The Left Stops Neutering Them With Nonsense 'Reforms'\n\nUntil the left departs from its radical racial ideology, police officers will keep departing from their jurisdictions.\n\nThe New York Police Department (NYPD) is experiencing a record number of resignations. As of June 2022, more than 1,500 officers have either resigned or retired. This marks \"the largest exodus of officers since the statistics have been available,\" according to the New York Post .\n\nAn August report noted that many of New York's finest are quitting before they even get their pensions. Oakland, California, is also experiencing a record number of police departures, according to a report from March . And last month, the entire police force of Kenly, North Carolina , quit.\n\nAcross the country, America is witnessing the same trend: Police forces are having unprecedented, catastrophic problems with retaining personnel. Consequently, homicide numbers for the first half of 2022, based on data from 23 cities, are 39 percent higher than they were in the same time period of 2019, according to a July report in Time magazine .\n\nWhat is going on?\n\nMuch of the blame seems to lie at the feet of progressive politicians and police chiefs who were installed to \"reform\" police departments following widespread calls to \"defund the police\" in the aftermath of the 2020 death of George Floyd. Media reports indicate these ideologues are applying the same blinkered, anti-racist, leftist strategies across the country, with predictable results.\n\nTake Charlottesville, Virginia, which hired RaShall Brackney , its first black female police chief, following waves of violence in 2017 \"to restore public trust\" in the city's police force. A self-described \"liberal Democrat,\" Brackney implemented radical change by disbanding highly coveted special units and taking disciplinary action against six members of the city's SWAT team, which she later disbanded.\n\nMany officers called Brackney \"heavy-handed,\" and her leadership style was alienating. Mike Wells, president of the Central Virginia chapter of the Police Benevolent Association, noted the city's force has \"lost faith\" in Brackney. A survey of the entire force found that an overwhelming majority of officers distrusted her. She resigned last year.\n\nIn New York, officers have cited \"anti-cop hostility, bail reform, and rising crime\" as reasons for quitting. \"The city is out of control - especially since bail reform,\" according to a former cop from Queens. This same officer told the New York Post that a common ethos is \"get out while you still can.\"\n\nNew York City even has a council member who has demanded the \"racist\"' NYPD be closed down. And last week , Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a member of the U.S. House who represents parts of New York City, further delayed a public-safety bill that would have provided fund grants for local police departments to bring on new hires. AOC is a longtime proponent of defunding the NYPD.\n\nIn Oakland, a police union has blamed the recent exodus of officers on the lack of support from the Oakland City Council. \"Just stop the rhetoric,\" urged Oakland officer and president of the police union Barry Donelan in a recent letter. \"Don't blame Oakland Police Officers for everything that ills Oakland. That's what we see from the council on a regular basis.\"\n\nIn Kenly, North Carolina, the entire police force resigned in July in response to the town's \"progressively responsible\" town manager - whom police chief Josh Gibson accused of creating a \"hostile work environment.\" And in Hillsborough County, Florida, State Attorney Andrew Warren developed a reputation for letting criminals go and not prosecuting crimes, angering police and leading Gov. Ron DeSantis to remove him from his post earlier this month.\n\nThe bevy of nonsensical police reforms pushed for by leftists reveals the left's blatant disrespect for America's police forces.\n\nLeftists have been downplaying their \"defund the police\" rhetoric for many months, given the alarming rise in crime across the country, especially in increasingly unpoliced urban areas. \"Even Democrats are now admitting 'Defund the Police' was a massive mistake,\" wrote CNN editor-at-large Chris Cillizza last November . But recrafted messaging can't disguise the fact that the left's ideology is one inherently at odds with what American police forces represent.\n\nPolice forces are necessary to address crime and in upholding equality before the law. And given that a disproportionate amount of crime occurs in black communities and is committed by black criminals, police officers will spend a disproportionate amount of their time addressing issues that arise in these communities.\n\nBut left-wing ideology, which is now fully under the sway of anti-racism ideologues, demands that the country's police departments must be dismantled.\n\nPolice work is also inherently violent and physically coercive, which is why it's no surprise that women make up less than 13 percent of police officers nationally.\n\nPolicing naturally lends itself to men because it is a profession that demands a high degree of physical and mental tenacity that is most readily found in those with high testosterone and who are physically able to engage wild drunks, abusive boyfriends, and the mentally unstable. Yet liberal ideology indicts men who manifest such traits as guilty of \"toxic masculinity,\" \"heteronormativity,\" and perpetuating \"the patriarchy.\"\n\nIn other words, as much the left tries to present itself as pro-police, its underlying ideology is decidedly against them, their identity, and their mission. Thus even when they don't defund them, they can't help but lecture them about how terrible they are.\n\nIn May, Adam Graham, a mayor from the state of Oklahoma, aggressively confronted two police officers in the middle of a routine traffic stop because he assumed they were engaged in racial profiling of a black driver despite one of the officers being black.\n\nUntil the left departs from its radical racial ideology, police officers will keep departing from their jurisdictions.\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media.

      "text": "Justice For Breonna Taylor Isn't Indicting Police Officers For Acting In Self-Defense\n\nDespite what some protesters and rioters maintain, justice is not indicting officers for defending themselves.\n\nAfter Kentucky Attorney General Daniel Cameron announced that a grand jury declined to file charges against the police officers involved in the shooting of Breonna Taylor, civil unrest broke out in the streets. Two police officers were shot and miraculously survived.\n\nMany felt that the single indictment of Detective Brett Hankison - which was based on charges related to endangering Taylor's neighbors, not charges linked to Taylor's death - fell short of justice.\n\n\"NOTHING for the murder of Breonna Taylor,\" Ben Crump, attorney for the Taylor family, said shortly after Cameron's announcement. \"This is outrageous and offensive! If Brett Hankison's behavior was wanton endangerment to people in neighboring apartments, then it should have been wanton endangerment in Breonna Taylor's apartment too. In fact, it should have been ruled wanton murder!\"\n\nThe emotional outrage surrounding Taylor's death is understandable. The 26-year-old emergency room technician should not have died at the hands of police, an incident that possibly could have been avoided if the police had more clearly identified themselves. The blame shouldn't fall on the grand jury's decision not to charge the three officers with Taylor's death, however. The two officers were justified in firing their weapons because Taylor's boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired one shot at them first. Because of that fact, the officers were acting in self-defense.\n\n\"When we all got up in line, I knocked on the door,\" Sgt. Jon Mattingly told investigators, according to the New York Times . \"Our intent was to give her plenty of time to come to the door because we said she was probably there alone,\" he said. \"Banged. No response. Banged on it again. No response. At that point we started announcing ourself, 'Police, please come to the door!'\"\n\nPrior to yesterday, it was widely reported that the police officers didn't announce themselves before barging into Taylor's home. Cameron said yesterday, however, that police did knock and announce themselves before coming in, which a civilian witness corroborated. It's worth noting, however, that it wasn't until 12:35 a.m. on March 13 when officers began their raid.\n\nNevertheless, Taylor's boyfriend, Walker, maintains neither of them could hear who was at the door. When it's past midnight, and a person wakes up frazzled with someone banging at his or her door, it's reasonable to grab a legally-owned gun.\n\nWalker told police he assumed the person at the door was Taylor's ex-boyfriend, who was at the center of the criminal drug case. When police entered, Walker said he fired to protect his girlfriend, and the police fatally shot back.\n\nMuch of the blame and justification for civil unrest is falling on the police officers and the life-and-death decisions they made in that moment. The assumption, it seems, is that unless the officers are charged with murdering Taylor, there is no justice.\n\nHowever, instead of blaming the police officers for acting in self-defense, a better question surrounds law enforcement's decision to raid her home in the first place - especially with a no-knock warrant so late at night. Yes, the investigation found the police did knock and announce themselves, but when people are half-asleep inside, the margin for error or a fatal misunderstanding is high.\n\nAnother important question to ask is why the police weren't wearing body cameras that night. In 2020, that is inexcusable.\n\nIn June, two months after her death, the Louisville City Council voted unanimously to enact Breonna's Law, which bans no-knock warrants, requires police to wear body cameras when serving warrants, and mandates that they activate the cameras five minutes before starting an operation. On the same day, Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., introduced similar legislation at the federal level.\n\nLast week, Louisville city officials agreed to pay Taylor's family $12 million and committed to instituting police reforms to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again. Among the changes is a requirement that commanding officers review and give written approval for all search warrants, and an agreement to \"overhaul how simultaneous search warrants are conducted.\"\n\nThis is all good. No-knock warrants can be a life-saving tactic for cops in the fight against drug traffickers, kidnappers, and other criminal offenders, but they're not a more valuable tool than Taylor's life.\n\nThe fact that Taylor's family received $12 million and a commitment to institute reforms to prevent future botched police raids is, sadly, as much justice as Louisville city officials can offer her grieving family. Despite what some protesters and rioters maintain, justice is not indicting officers for defending themselves.\n\nIf protesters aren't satisfied with the legal outcome, where do we go from here? If instituting change in Breonna Taylor's name isn't enough to quell unrest in Louisville, what will?\n\nAs Cameron said yesterday, \"Criminal justice isn't the quest for revenge. It's the quest for truth.\"\n\n© 2025 The Federalist, A wholly independent division of FDRLST Media. All rights reserved."

One of the officers returned fire and hit Mata in the ankle. He was taken to New York-Presbyterian in Queens to undergo medical treatment.

      "text": "14 current and former Minneapolis cops say Assistant Chief Katie Blackwell LIED during trial of Derek Chauvin\n\n\"Every MPD officer knows that restraint was trained.\"\n\n\"Every MPD officer knows that restraint was trained.\"\n\nA group of 14 current and former Minneapolis Police Department Officers signed sworn declarations attesting to their belief that Assistant Chief Katie Blackwell committed perjury during the trial of Derek Chauvin over the death of George Floyd on May 25, 2020. Blackwell testified that the method of restraint used by Chauvin was not part of MPD officer training. Blackwell had said at the trial \"that's not what we train.\" However, others say that the \"knee-on-neck restaint Chauvin employed was trained under the maximal-restraint technique (MRT), a restraint the MPD taught and allowed until 2023.\" The officers who signed the declarations \"swore that this training was well known-indeed, common knowledge-and omnipresent,\" Alpha News said. Reporting on the declarations, Alpha News said that these 14 statements \"were among dozens of declarations submitted by lawyers representing Alpha News in a defamation lawsuit brought by Blackwell last October against Alpha News, Alpha News reporter Liz Collin, producer J.C. Chaix, and a publishing company.\" Blackwell brought suit against Alpha News in response to their documentary \"The Fall of Minneapolis,\" which indicated that Blackwell had not been truthful in her testimony. In a lengthy motion asking for the case to be dismissed with prejudice, attorney for Alpha News Chris Madel wrote \"With this motion, 33 former MPD officers who served with Blackwell, and one who currently serves with her, have sworn that MPD trained this restraint as part of the 'maximal-restraint technique' ('MRT') and otherwise. Indeed, 14 of these officers have sworn-under oath-their belief that Blackwell perjured herself.\" \"Blackwell remarkably claims that Collin and Chaix defamed her when they opined that it 'seemed' like Blackwell lied. In reality, this opinion was far more generous than necessary. It is a fact,\" the motion further reads. Floyd died in police custody after he was arrested in a parking lot on that fateful day in May 2020. Chauvin restrained him and Floyd later died. His death was deemed by the court of public opinion to be a racially motivated murder and within two days of his death, as cell phone footage of the arrest circulated online, riots began in Minneapolis and quickly spread across the country. Floyd's death was about 10 weeks into the Covid-19 pandemic which inspired local government leaders to insist on lockdowns, business, school and church closures. The riots began at the tail end of a spring as weather turned warm after the winter months. In many areas, lockdowns were still imposed except in the case of protests. Dozens of doctors signed a letter claiming that racism was a bigger health threat than Covid and that those who were out protesting were in the right. Anyone who wasn't protesting for racial justice was told to stay home and churches, schools, and businesses remained closed. In Minneapolis, riots were so bad that the MPD relinquished a precinct building to the mob. Former MPD officer Ken Tidgwell, Alpha News noted, said \"that he nearly lost a leg from an injury he sustained furing the riots that followed Floyd's death.\" He said that he had been trained to use the technique Chauvin employed when subduing Floyd. A toxicology report later revealed that Floyd had Fentanyl and other drugs in his system. \"Specifically, we were trained that when two officers were trying to handcuff a person that was resisting arrest, one officer should use his or her knee to employ a knee-to-neck/upper shoulder restraint to control the subject's head, and the other knee should be used to control one of the subject's arms during handcuffing,\" Tidgwell said.\n\n\"If by 'we' Katie Blackwell referred to the MPD,\" Tidgwell said, \"then I believe that she perjured herself. Every MPD officer knows that restraint was trained, and every MPD officer knows it was trained as part of the MRT process. We were trained that 'where the head goes, the body will follow.'\" Chauvin's trial was one in which he was publicly believed to be guilty before he was tried. Chauvin has appealed his conviction , in which he was found guilty of second-degree unintentional murder, guilty of third-degree murder and guilty of second-degree manslaughter in the death of George Floyd. At the time, President Joe Biden commented on the verdict, saying that he prayed that the verdict is the \"right verdict, which is I think it's overwhelming in my view. I wouldn't say that unless the jury was sequestered now, not hearing me say that.\" Chauvin's appeal has been allowed to go forward despite opposition from the Biden administration's Department of Justice. U.S. District Court Judge Paul Magnuson in December \"ordered that Chauvin's lawyers be allowed access to Floyd's heart tissue and histology slides, photographs of his heart and samples of Floyd's bodily fluids, as his legal team is investigating the possibility that Floyd died from a heart condition and not Chauvin's actions.\"\n\nPowered by The Post Millennial CMSTM Comments\n\nWe're independent and can't be cancelled.
