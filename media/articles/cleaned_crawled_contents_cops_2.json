(AP video by Bruna Prado and Diarlei Rodrigues)\n\nRIO DE JANEIRO (AP) - A judge on Thursday handed down long sentences to two former police officers for the 2018 murder of Rio de Janeiro city councilwoman Marielle Franco, an icon of Brazil' s political left whose killing sparked outrage.\n\nRonnie Lessa and Élcio de Queiroz were sentenced to almost 79 years and almost 60 years, respectively, for the March 14, 2018 drive-by shooting that killed Franco and her driver, Anderson Gomes. Jurors found that Lessa fired the gun and de Queiroz was the wheelman on the night of the crime.\n\nLessa and de Queiroz, arrested in 2019, previously signed plea bargains confessing their roles, but the jury had final word on their guilt on homicide and other charges. The verdict, although expected, comes as a measure of solace to the many who saw the martyrdom of the Black, bisexual woman as an attack on democracy, and worried that the crime would go unpunished.\n\nThe prosecutors had argued each man should be sentenced to the maximum possible 84 years for the three counts - double homicide, attempted homicide and driving a cloned vehicle.\n\n(AP video by Bruna Prado and Diarlei Rodrigues)\n\nAs Judge Lucia Glioche finished reading the sentence, applause erupted in the room as victims' families began to cry. Marielle's sister, Anielle Franco, Brazil's minister for racial equality, held a long, tearful embrace with her parents and Marielle's daughter, Luyara Franco. Her father rested his head on the chest of former congressman Marcelo Freixo, who was her political mentor.\n\nBrazilian law does not allow for life imprisonment, and each man will serve no more than 30 years of their sentences. Due to their sealed plea bargains, local media has reported that Queiroz and Lessa may serve 12 and 18 years in prison, respectively, including time already served. Prosecutors have denied their sentenced would be reduced.\n\nEither way, Thursday's sentencing is seen as only a step toward justice being done, with another trial yet to come for the men accused of ordering her killing. They will also have to pay 706,000 reais ($122,000) in moral damages to several of the victims' family members and provide an allowance to the young son of Gomes until he turns 24, according to a statement on the court's website.\n\nLuyara Santos, the daughter of slain councilwoman Marielle Franco cries after a judge sentenced two former police officers for the 2018 murder of Franco and her driver Anderson Gomes, at the Court of Justice in Rio de Janeiro, Thursday, Oct. 31, 2024. (AP Photo/Bruna Prado)\n\nKnown universally by her first name, Marielle, she was raised in one of Rio's poor communities known as favelas . She became known for her efforts to improve the lives of ordinary residents. Following her election in 2016, she fought against violence targeting women while defending human rights and social programs.\n\nTestimony Wednesday during the first day of the trial offered details about the moments preceding and following the shooting. Franco's assistant and friend who was also in the car, Fernanda Chaves, was among those giving testimony, as was Franco's mother and her partner Mônica Benício.\n\nChoked up and often unable to talk, Benício said the last thing Marielle ever said to her was \"I love you.\"\n\n\"We had plans to get married with a wedding party. When Marielle died, what I felt was that they had taken away our promise of the future,\" she said, later adding that the right to a just city was one of Marielle's causes.\n\n\"Marielle also defended the right to decent housing from the perspective of the favela, the periphery, this was the theme of the city's rights agenda.\"\n\nBoth defendants participated in the trial by videoconference from prison. Lessa is in Sao Paulo while de Queiroz is in Brazil's capital, Brasilia.\n\nFederal authorities started investigating the case in earnest once leftist President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva took office in 2023.\n\nWith Lessa and de Queiroz sentenced, attention will now turn to the men accused of ordering the hit: two brothers with purported ties to criminal groups known as militias, which illegally charge residents for various services, including protection.\n\nFamily members of slain councilwoman Marielle Franco embrace after a judge sentenced two former police officers for the 2018 murder of Franco and her driver, at the Court of Justice in Rio de Janeiro, Thursday, Oct. 31, 2024. (AP Photo/Bruna Prado)\n\nGuilhermo Catramby, a Federal Police detective, told the court Wednesday that the assassination was \"undoubtedly\" motivated by Marielle's work regarding land rights, especially in the west side of Rio de Janeiro. Her work there was \"a thorn in the side of militia interests,\" Catramby said.\n\nIn March, Federal Police detained the two brothers, federal lawmaker Chiquinho Brazão and his brother Domingos Brazão , a member of Rio state's accounts watchdog. They have denied any involvement in the killing or with militias and have yet to go on trial.\n\nIn his plea bargain, Lessa told police that the politician brothers hired him and informed him that the then-chief of the state's civil police, Rivaldo Barbosa, had signed off beforehand. Barbosa, who also denies any involvement, was arrested in March.\n\nMarielle's family and Ágatha Arnaus, widow of Gomes, spoke to journalists after the trial. Holding hands, they said that while the conviction offered some reparation after years of struggle and pain, it was just the first step in a long journey toward justice.\n\n\"I wanted my mother here, but today will certainly go down in this country's democratic history,\" said Luyara, the councilwoman's daughter, holding back tears.\n\n\"If the justice system had not convicted these two cruel murderers, we wouldn't have a moment of peace. But this doesn't end here,\" said Antonio Francisco da Silva, Marielle's father. \"There are those who ordered the crime. Now the question is: when will those who ordered it be convicted?\"\n\n___\n\nSá Pessoa reported from Sao Paulo.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP) - Four of five former Memphis police officers charged in the killing of Tyre Nichols , a Black man who was handcuffed, brutally beaten and ignored by first responders for crucial minutes despite being barely conscious, can no longer work as law enforcement in Tennessee.\n\nThe Peace Officer Standards & Training Commission, or P.O.S.T., voted Friday to decertify Demetrius Haley, Emmitt Martin and Justin Smith.

The commission subsequently released documents showing that Haley dragged Nichols from his vehicle and never explained why he was stopped , and that he also took photos of Nichols slumped against the car after he was pummeled by officers and sent the pictures to colleagues.\n\nNichols died at a hospital Jan. 10.\n\nEarly police accounts minimized the violence of the traffic stop - accounts since disproven by witness statements and police and surveillance video - and their specialized unit was disbanded . Two Memphis Fire Department emergency medical workers and a lieutenant were also fired.\n\nThe five former police officers charged with second-degree murder have all pleaded not guilty.\n\nThe Memphis Police Department requested the decertification of seven of the former Memphis officers involved, including one who retired before he could be fired.\n\nNone of the fired officers or their attorneys attended their hearings before the commission on Thursday or its vote on Friday.\n\nMills' attorney said his client had been wrongly indicted and was \"focusing on his freedom.\"\n\n\"It's a waste of time,\" attorney Blake Ballin said of the decertification attempt. \"It is meaningless to him at this stage in his life.\"\n\nAn attorney for Haley declined to comment on the decertification vote.

But the fact that Black officers killed a Black man didn't remove racism from the situation. (AP Photo/Wong Maye-E, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - That the death of Tyre Nichols - young, Black, just trying to get home - came at the hands of Memphis police officers was a familiar refrain in the nation's seemingly endless lamentation of racism and police brutality aimed at Black people.\n\nThis time around, though, it was five Black officers who were fired and charged with second-degree murder in the horrifying Jan. 7 beating that was caught on video and led to Nichols' death in a hospital bed three days later.\n\nBut the fact that Black officers killed a Black man didn't remove racism from the situation. If anything, say reform advocates , it showed that a police culture of racial bias and dehumanization is pervasive enough to spread in all directions, even among minority officers whose presence in law enforcement is often touted as proof of reform efforts.\n\n\"What we have to understand is it is not the color of the officer,\" said Joshua Adams, an activist in Memphis. \"It is the color of who's being policed. That's what creates the difference.\" The key question is \"why does policing show differently for Black people?\"\n\nBlack and brown officers can be conditioned to view Black and brown people as suspect, advocates say.\n\n\"With any organization or institution, there is a period of orientation where you are being introduced to core values and philosophies,\" said the Rev. Earle J. Fisher, senior pastor at Abyssinian Baptist Church in Memphis.\n\n\"I think this happens with police regardless of the color of the police officer. You have spent time in the indoctrination process, and part of that indoctrination is certain people on their face - from what some would call cultural bias, or others would call internalized white supremacy - you're indoctrinated to believe that certain groups are more prone to criminal behavior than others,\" he said. \"And so you treat Black people as if they are guilty until proven innocent. You treat white people as if they are innocent until proven guilty.\"\n\nLegal scholar Amara Enyia said \"being Black and a police officer does not undo the inherent anti-Blackness in the policing system.\"\n\n\"That's one of the most insidious characteristics of the system, because we may buy into a notion that because they're Black means they can't possibly have adopted the norms and values of the system,\" said Enyia, policy and research manager for the Movement for Black Lives, a national advocacy coalition aligned with the broader Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nMany of the highest-profile deaths, such as George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Michael Brown, were due to the actions of white officers. But other deaths, including Philando Castile, Freddie Gray and Sean Bell, showed that the officers responsible could come from a range of racial backgrounds.\n\nAnd more broadly, in a country riven with as many racial fault lines as the United States, no one is exempt from absorbing some brand of racial messaging throughout their lives, said Derald Wing Sue, professor of psychology and education at Columbia University's Teachers College.\n\n\"We are all socialized into a society that imbues in us these images of one another,\" he said. \"We can, as people of color, inherit these biases toward one another and often times to our own group as well. ... They come out in ways that can be very harmful unless we get in touch with them and give ourselves counter messages.\"\n\nThe officers charged in Nichols' death drew condemnation for being Black men who committed fatal violence against another Black man.\n\nAt Nichols' funeral on Wednesday, the Rev. Al Sharpton said that while he was in Memphis for the service, he visited the site where the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in 1968. He said King was in Memphis to fight for Black city workers to be able to work in sanitation and as police.\n\nIf not for the efforts of King and others in the civil rights movement, the five officers would not have had jobs in law enforcement or been assigned to an elite police squad, Sharpton said.\n\nNot far away from the hotel balcony where King was fatally shot, the Black officers \"beat a brother to death,\" Sharpton said in a eulogy.\n\nAddressing the officers, he said: \"There's nothing more insulting and offensive to those of us that fight to open doors that you walk through those doors and act like the folks we had to fight to get you through them doors.\"\n\n\"You didn't get on the Police Department by yourself. The police chief didn't get there by herself,\" he added. \"People had to march and go to jail - and some lost their lives - to open the doors for you. And how dare you act like that sacrifice was for nothing?\"\n\n\"You ain't in no New England state. You're in Tennessee, where we had to fight for you. And you take that position and do what we saw?\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Gary Fields, Aaron Morrison and Noreen Nasir contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nHajela is a member of the AP's team covering race and ethnicity.

(Hennepin County Sheriff's Office via AP, File)\n\nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - A federal judge on Wednesday sentenced two former Minneapolis police officers who were convicted of violating George Floyd's civil rights to lighter terms than recommended in sentencing guidelines, calling one \"truly a rookie officer\" and describing the other as \"a good police officer, father and husband.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson sentenced J. Alexander Kueng to three years in prison and Tou Thao to 31⁄2 years for violating Floyd's rights in the May 25, 2020, killing in which then-Officer Derek Chauvin pinned Floyd's neck with his knee for more than nine minutes as the 46-year-old Black man said he couldn't breathe and eventually grew still. The killing, captured in bystander video, sparked protests worldwide and a reckoning of racial injustice.\n\nKueng pinned Floyd's back, Thao held back concerned bystanders, and a fourth officer, Thomas Lane, held Floyd's feet. Lane was sentenced last week to two years - also below guidelines and a sentence that Floyd's brother Philonise called \"insulting\" - while Chauvin was sentenced earlier to 21 years. Floyd's immediate family members did not attend Wednesday's hearings in person or comment afterward.\n\nFloyd's girlfriend, Courteney Ross, made statements at both men's sentencing hearings and said afterward that she was disappointed, particularly with Thao's sentence. It \"didn't really seem to match the crime to me. I was asking for the maximum sentence,\" she said.\n\nThe lower sentences for Kueng, who is Black, and Thao, who is Hmong American, raise questions about whether they would consider a plea deal or risk a state court trial on Oct. 24, when they face counts of aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. Lane, who is white, pleaded guilty to a state charge of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter and is awaiting sentencing in that case.\n\nFederal sentencing guidelines - which judges do not have to follow - recommended 41⁄4 to 51⁄4 years for Kueng and 5 1⁄4 to 6 1⁄2 years for Thao. For both men, prosecutors argued for sentences higher than that. Prosecutor Manda Sertich argued that Kueng \"didn't say a word\" as Floyd lay dying. Prosecutor LeeAnn Bell said Thao had \"a bird's-eye view of what was going on\" with Floyd, and had \"years on the force\" that meant he should have known better.\n\nThe federal government brought the civil rights charges against all four officers in May 2021, a month after Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter in state court. They were seen as an affirmation of the Justice Department's priorities to address racial inequities in policing, a promise made by President Joe Biden before his election. They came a week after federal prosecutors brought hate crimes charges in the killing of 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery in Georgia and announced sweeping probes into policing in Minneapolis and Louisville, Kentucky.\n\nMagnuson said there was no question that Kueng violated Floyd's rights by failing to get off him when Floyd became unresponsive. But he also mentioned what he called \"an incredible number\" of letters from other officers supporting Kueng.\n\n\"You were truly a rookie officer,\" Magnuson told Kueng.\n\nAt his subsequent hearing, Thao spoke for more than 20 minutes, frequently quoting from the Bible as he said his arrest and time in jail led him to turn toward God, but did not directly address his actions or offer any words to Floyd's family. Thao - like Lane and Kueng - remains free on bond, but spent several weeks in jail after his 2020 arrest on the state charges.\n\nMagnuson again acknowledged letters supporting the former officer, including one with 744 signatures, and cited what he called Thao's \"completely clean record.\"\n\n\"You had a difficult childhood and have done well to become a good police officer, father and husband,\" the judge said.\n\nNekima Levy Armstrong, a civil rights attorney and activist, said the sentences were \"especially light.\"\n\n\"This little punishment signals to other law enforcement officers that they could receive a slap on the wrist if they violate people's rights and engage in extreme abuse towards defenseless people,\" she said.\n\nBut Mark Osler, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law and former federal prosecutor, called the sentences \"groundbreaking\" and noted that it's rare for officers to be held accountable for killings they didn't directly commit.\n\n\"We should hope that it has the impact of changing behavior and prodding them to intervene when a life can be saved,\" he said.\n\nOsler said it's likely that Kueng and Thao will seek a plea deal on the state charges that would not exceed the federal sentence and would let them serve the sentences concurrently.\n\nBoth men are due to report to federal prison on Oct. 4, though Magnuson noted that could change because of their state trial. Magnuson said he would recommend that they be allowed to serve their time at minimum-security federal facilities in Duluth or in Yankton, South Dakota, to be near family. The final decision is up to the Bureau of Prisons.\n\nChauvin, who is white, was the most senior officer at the scene and was sentenced to a 22 1/2-year state sentence that he's serving concurrently with his federal sentence. He's been held in solitary confinement in the state's maximum security prison at Oak Park Heights for his own safety since his murder conviction and will eventually be transferred to federal prison.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press/Report for America reporter Trisha Ahmed contributed.\n\n___\n\nFind AP's full coverage of the killing of George Floyd at: https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Jeenah Moon, File)\n\nNEW YORK (AP) - In late August, less than a week before federal agents arrived at his home with a search warrant, New York Police Department Commissioner Edward Caban cleared three officers found to have engaged in misconduct during a raid on a Brooklyn bar.\n\nIt would be one of his last official acts before resigning under a cloud of suspicion, as federal prosecutors probe allegations of influence peddling within the police department and City Hall.\n\nThe previously unreported move might be unremarkable for a leader who routinely ignored recommendations for disciplinary charges against officers, but for one fact: The owner of the same Brooklyn bar recently came forward to publicly accuse the former police commissioner's twin brother, James Caban, of trying to \"extort\" him in exchange for his help in smoothing relations with local police.\n\nThe bar owner, Shamel Kelly, says he is now speaking with prosecutors as a potential witness.\n\nThat investigation is one of several underway tied to the administration of Mayor Eric Adams, who faces federal charges of accepting bribes and illegal campaign contributions from foreign nationals. Adams has pleaded not guilty.\n\nEdward and James Caban have denied wrongdoing and have not been charged with any crimes. Federal prosecutors have not explained why they seized phones from both Caban brothers.\n\nIn Kelly's telling, his problems with the police began shortly after his juice bar secured a temporary liquor license in 2023. Throughout that spring, officers from the local precinct would arrive at the bar multiple times each week, levying expensive fines for loud music and other infractions.\n\nOn one of those nights, in April of 2023, Kelly said officers tackled a man who refused to provide identification, shouted at customers to leave, broke a door and searched the bar without a warrant. \"They came in like a gang,\" Kelly recalled.\n\nWhen he went to the precinct to complain, Kelly said an NYPD lieutenant told him he would \"make his life a living hell and send inspections to his business every day,\" according to a copy of the complaint he filed days later with the Civilian Complaint Review Board, an independent panel that investigates cases of police misconduct.\n\nDesperate for assistance, Kelly said he reached out to an associate of the mayor, who offered to put him in touch with a coordinator in City Hall's nightlife office, Raymond Martin. In August 2023, Martin connected Kelly to James Caban, who he identified as a \"security consultant,\" according to text messages shared with The Associated Press.\n\nCaban touted his ties to the local precinct, Kelly said, but he did not mention that his twin brother, Edward Caban, was the commissioner.\n\nAfter exchanging text messages, James Caban told the bar owner by phone he could broker a meeting with the precinct commander for an initial fee of $2,500, according to Kelly.\n\nKelly declined the offer, which he likened to a \"shakedown scheme.\" Soon after, local police seemed to ramp up their enforcement against the bar, he said.\n\n\"It just got worse,\" Kelly told The Associated Press. \"The officers were even more consistent in standing in front of the establishment in groups of 15 to 20 at a time, intimidating the business and harassing customers.\"\n\nA lawyer for James Caban, Sean Hecker, said his client had run a \"perfectly legal\" consulting firm, acting as a liaison between private companies and the police department, where he previously served as an officer. James Caban was fired in 2001 after the department determined he had threatened and wrongfully detained a cabdriver.\n\nMartin, the mayoral aide who first connected Kelly with James Caban, was fired by the city after Kelly's allegations were reported last month. He did not respond to an emailed request for comment.\n\nKelly said he eventually shuttered his business as a result of the fines and harassment. Records show officers visited the bar more than 60 times in the course of the year, issuing tickets for infractions that included \"loud talking\" and \"truck music.\"\n\nAfter reviewing body-camera footage and interviewing witnesses, the Civilian Complaint Review Board substantiated misconduct allegations against three of the officers involved in the episode at the bar on April 7, 2023, in which a man was tackled, concluding they had violated department policies around the use of force and courtesy, and that one officer had used a sexually offensive slur.\n\nThe board recommended the officer who used the slur face administrative charges - the most serious penalty - and that the others receive a type of discipline that could have led to the loss of vacation days.\n\nBut on Aug. 30, Edward Caban intervened to ensure the officers would not face discipline, exercising a power to override the board's recommendations that he invoked more often than any police commissioner before him. The decision was communicated to Kelly in a letter dated Sept. 24, 2024.\n\nA police department spokesperson said the recommendations were tossed out because the board had not provided enough time for NYPD officials to conduct their own \"thorough and diligent investigation.\"\n\nKelly said Caban's decision to override the discipline was \"unjust,\" if also unsurprising.\n\n\"Looking back at the situation, knowing the brothers' connection, I could see why he would deny that,\" Kelly said. \"I was just hoping they'd do the right thing.\"\n\nInquiries to the U.S. Attorney's Office in Manhattan were not returned.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Christian Monterrosa)\n\nST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) - Three former Minneapolis police officers were convicted Thursday of violating George Floyd's civil rights, as a federal jury rejected their arguments that inexperience, improper training or the distraction of shouting bystanders excused them from failing to prevent Floyd's killing.\n\nTou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane were convicted of depriving Floyd of his right to medical care as the 46-year-old Black man was pinned under fellow Officer Derek Chauvin's knee for 9 1/2 minutes while handcuffed, facedown on the street on May 25, 2020. Kueng knelt on Floyd's back, Lane held his legs and Thao kept bystanders back.\n\nThao and Kueng were also convicted of failing to intervene to stop Chauvin in the videotaped killing that sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the globe as part of a reckoning over racial injustice.\n\nFloyd's brother Philonise Floyd called the verdicts \"accountability,\" but added: \"There can never be justice because I can never get George back.\"\n\nAnd Floyd's nephew Brandon Williams said he hoped the verdicts would change laws and policies to \"protect people from these situations.\" He also said the outcome \"sends a message that says, if you murder or use excessive or deadly force, there's consequences that follow.\"\n\nLane shook his head and looked at his attorney as his verdict was read. Thao and Kueng showed no visible emotion. Their attorneys declined to comment immediately afterward.\n\nCharles Kovats, acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, called the convictions a reminder that all sworn law enforcement officers have a duty to intervene.\n\n\"These officers had a moral responsibility, a legal obligation and a duty to intervene, and by failing to do so, they committed a crime,\" Kovats said.\n\nChauvin and Thao went to the scene to help rookies Kueng and Lane after they responded to a call that Floyd used a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store. Floyd struggled with officers as they tried to put him in a police SUV.\n\nDuring the monthlong federal trial, prosecutors sought to show that the officers violated their training, including when they failed to move Floyd or give him CPR. Prosecutors argued that Floyd's condition was so serious that even bystanders without basic medical training could see he needed help, but that the officers \"chose to do nothing.\"\n\nThe defense said their training was inadequate. Kueng and Lane both said they deferred to Chauvin as the senior officer at the scene. Thao testified that he relied on the other officers to care for Floyd's medical needs as his attention was elsewhere.\n\nA jury of eight women and four men that appeared to be all-white reached the verdicts after about two days of deliberations. The court did not released demographics such as race or age. Lane is white, Kueng is Black and Thao is Hmong American.\n\nThe former officers remain free on bond pending sentencing, which has not yet been scheduled. Conviction of a federal civil rights violation that results in death is punishable by life in prison or even death, but such sentences are extremely rare. Federal sentencing guidelines rely on complicated formulas that indicate the officers would get much less.\n\nChauvin, who is white, was convicted of murder last year in state court and pleaded guilty in December in the federal case. He was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in the state case. A sentencing date has not yet been set in the federal case, but both sides agreed Chauvin should face a sentence ranging from 20 to 25 years.\n\nPublic reaction to Thursday's verdicts was muted, with only a tiny handful of protesters visible outside the courthouse, which was surrounded by fencing throughout the trial. On the day Chauvin was convicted, many people listened live as his verdicts were read and crowded into the square where he died for a celebration afterward. That trial was livestreamed, while this one was not.\n\nLane, Kueng and Thao also face a separate trial in June on state charges alleging that they aided and abetted murder and manslaughter.\n\nThe verdicts come just days after the conviction of three white men on hate crimes charges in Georgia in the death of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man who was chased and shot in February 2020.\n\n___\n\nWebber reported from Fenton, Michigan.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to reflect that Williams is Floyd's nephew, not his cousin, and to say Kueng, not Lane, was charged with failing to intervene.\n\n___\n\nFind AP's full coverage of the killing of George Floyd at: https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nPHILADELPHIA (AP) - The Philadelphia police department did not violate the First Amendment rights of several officers who were fired or suspended for racist and violent social media posts, a federal judge has ruled.\n\nU.S. District Judge Wendy Beetlestone issued her ruling Monday, just days before the case was set to go to trial. She determined the officers' posts and comments were \"likely to cause significant interference\" with the police department and the city's operations and did not constitute protected speech.\n\nThe officers' social media accounts were included in a database, published in 2019 and known as the Plain View Project, that catalogued thousands of bigoted or violent posts by active-duty and former police officers in several states.\n\nIn Philadelphia, nearly 200 officers were disciplined, including 15 who were forced off the job. Most of those who were fired ultimately had their dismissals overturned by an arbitrator and were permitted to return to the force, while some retired. The firing of one officer was upheld by an arbitrator.\n\nTwenty of the disciplined officers eventually filed a federal civil rights lawsuit against the city, asserting the police department had retaliated against them for exercising their First Amendment rights.\n\nA federal judge dismissed the lawsuit in February 2022, but the 3rd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed that decision in June 2023, saying the lawsuit had been tossed prematurely. The city then argued that the case should not go to trial and that Bettlestone should determine the outcome, a motion she approved.\n\nIn her ruling, Beetlestone described in detail how each officer's statements could degrade public trust, demean populations they are tasked with protecting, and make the officers unreliable witnesses if called to testify in court cases.\n\nLawyers for the city and the attorney who represents eight of the officers declined comment on the ruling, while the attorney for the other officers did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe Facebook posts, all of which were public, were uncovered by a team of researchers who spent two years looking at the personal accounts of police officers from Arizona to Florida. They found officers bashing immigrants and Muslims, promoting racist stereotypes, identifying with right-wing militia groups and, especially, glorifying police brutality.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Tou Thao and Kueng face a late October trial. (David Joles/Star Tribune via AP, File)\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (AP) - Two former Minneapolis police officers charged in George Floyd's killing told a judge Monday that they have rejected plea deals that would have resulted in three-year sentences, setting the stage for trial in October.\n\nTou Thao and J. Alexander Kueng are charged with aiding and abetting both second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter in Floyd's death. They and Thomas Lane were working with Derek Chauvin when he pinned Floyd's neck with his knee for more than nine minutes as the 46-year-old Black man said he couldn't breathe and eventually grew still.\n\nThe killing, captured on bystander video, sparked protests worldwide and a reckoning on racial injustice. Chauvin, who is white, was convicted of second-degree murder last year and sentenced to 22 1/2 years on the state charge.\n\nHennepin County Judge Peter Cahill had set a limited window for accepting a plea deal ahead of trial, and Monday's brief hearing served to formalize the two ex-officers' rejections of the state's offers.\n\n\"It would be lying for me to accept any plea offer,\" said Thou, who held back concerned bystanders as Chauvin pinned Floyd. Kueng did not give his reasons for rejecting the state's offer.\n\nThao, Kueng and Lane were convicted in federal court in February of violating Floyd's civil rights. Lane, who is white, held Floyd's legs and twice asked if he should be turned on his side, and was sentenced to 2 1/2 years. Thao, who is Hmong American, was sentenced to 3 1/2 years. Kueng, who is Black, pinned Floyd's back, and was sentenced to 3 years. Thao and Kueng are appealing their federal convictions.\n\nIn rejecting the plea agreements, Thao and Keung are risking state sentences that could be significantly longer than their federal sentences if they're convicted on both counts. Assistant Attorney General Matt Frank pointed out in the hearing that the state's sentencing guidelines recommend sentences of 12 1/2 years on the murder count and 4 years on the manslaughter count, but that prosecutors have already said they'll seek longer sentences if they get convictions.\n\nIn Minnesota, assuming good behavior, defendants typically serve two-thirds of their sentences in prison and one-third on parole.\n\nFrank said plea negotiations began in earnest in May and continued into June. The offers would have dropped the most serious charge of aiding and abetting murder, and the officers' state time would have run concurrently with the federal sentences. Both defendants confirmed that they understood that the state has now withdrawn its offers.\n\n\"It's a standard best practice to make a record in court when the State offers a plea agreement, in order to ensure the defendant's decision is freely and knowingly made,\" Attorney General Keith Ellison said in a statement afterward. \"The defendants have a right to decline the offer and proceed to trial. The State is ready for trial.\"\n\nDuring the hearing, Kueng's attorney, Thomas Plunkett, said that Ellison at one, unspecified point in the negotiations, offered Kueng a deal that would have resulted in 2 years in prison. Kueng confirmed that Plunkett had told him about the offer, and that they rejected it. Frank did not comment about the purported offer.\n\nThao's attorney, Robert Paule, said that they, at an unspecified point, proposed a deal for 2 years, but that the state rejected it. Frank said that wasn't how he recalled the discussions, and that his recollection was that Thao's offer had included dropping the charges. Neither side elaborated on the discrepancies.\n\nThe trial is scheduled to begin Oct. 24, with opening statements Nov. 7.\n\nLane avoided a state trial by pleading guilty in May to aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter in a deal that calls for a three-year sentence. His sentencing is Sept. 21.\n\nChauvin was sentenced to 21 years on the federal civil rights charge. He remains in the state's maximum security prison at Oak Park Heights pending his transfer to federal prison. The other three remain free on bail.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writer Amy Forliti contributed to this story.\n\n___\n\nFind AP's full coverage of the killing of George Floyd at: https://apnews.com/hub/death-of-george-floyd\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Luigi Mangione Claims Cops Used Dirty Tricks During McDonald's Arrest\n\nNight Editor\n\nCops pulled a number of dirty tricks on Luigi Mangione during their first encounter with him at a McDonald's in Pennsylvania and later at a local police station, the 26-year-old's lawyer claimed in new court filings this week.\n\nThe purportedly illegal tactics included tricking him into accepting a snack to obtain his DNA and seizing his bag at a McDonald 's in Altoona, Pennsylvania, as a pretext to rummage through his belongings.\n\nThe actions violated protections afforded to Mangione under the Fourth and 14th Amendments, lawyer Thomas Dickey alleged in the documents .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nMangione is accused of carrying out the high-profile murder of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson in Manhattan last December.\n\nHe faces charges in Pennsylvania including possessing an unlicensed firearm, forgery, and providing false identification to police. Mangione is facing trial in New York first, however, on separate charges in both federal and state courts, including homicide and terrorism.\n\nOne of the federal charges, murder through use of a firearm, means Mangione could face the death penalty if convicted.\n\nDickey claimed cops formed \"a human law enforcement wall\" at the Altoona McDonald's where Mangione was spotted, questioned, and eventually arrested-though they did not have a legal basis to seize his belongings: a backpack, plastic bag, and other items.\n\n\"Prior to this stop, arrest, seizure and/or detention of the Defendant, the APD Officers had no articulable facts and observed no criminal conduct on the part of the Defendant, nor any other evidence indicating that any criminal activity was afoot,\" the document states. \"Accordingly, APD lacked reasonable suspicion to engage in this activity. At no time did the Defendant exhibit any threatening gesture or show of force. These actions by APD, were in violation of the protections afforded to the Defendant under the Fourth Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and under Article 1, Section 8, of the Pennsylvania Constitution.\"\n\n\"Other than the anonymous 911 call, the APD had no independent corroborating evidence that the Defendant was in fact the suspect sought in New York, prior to, or at the time of their stop and/or the investigatory detention of the Defendant.\"\n\nIn the 36-page document, Dickey writes, \"Any purported identification of the Defendant as the person wanted in New York was speculative and based on a hunch,\" and describes actions by APD officers and other law enforcement personnel, as \"coercive.\"\n\nDickey said the discovery of numerous items was illegal and should be removed from the case, including a computer chip, a clip containing bullets which was wrapped up in some undergarments, 9mm handgun with printed lower receiver, mechanized upper receiver, suspected 3D printed suppressor, and a red notebook. Multiple handwritten notes were also seized.\n\n\"The Altoona Police Department illegally seized a notebook which allegedly contained numerous personal writings covering a plethora of personal experiences of the Defendant,\" the filing notes. \"A member of the Altoona Police Department improperly, and without justification, labeled these writings and/or notebook as 'Manifesto'. The use of this characterization of the Defendants alleged personal experiences and writings is incorrect, improper, and without justification and has no probative value.\n\nThe document says Mangione believes \"that this characterization was done so solely for the purpose to prejudice the Defendant and put him in a negative light before the public; all in an effort to prejudice any potential jury pool.\"\n\nLater, at the police station, cops provided snacks to an unwitting Mangione.\n\n\"While illegally seized, arrested, and detained, the Defendant was provided food and soda while at the Altoona Police Department Station,\" the document states.\n\n\"The purposes for the same, was to obtain DNA from the Defendant for further investigative purposes.

He has pleaded not guilty to state charges but is yet to enter a plea to federal charges.\n\nNight Editor\n\nmatt.young@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "When 'Cops' Forced Ugly Copaganda Down America's Throat\n\nEntertainment Critic\n\nVice TV's Dark Side of the '90s is not what one might call hard-hitting investigative journalism; as its first season confirmed , it's a skin-deep look back at some of the most notable and controversial pop-culture stories and personalities of the decade. In its maiden 10 episodes, the series tackled the explosion of trashy talk shows (led by The Jerry Springer Show ), the untimely overdose death of River Phoenix at the then-Johnny Depp-owned L.A. hotspot The Viper Room, the emergence of Baywatch and the way in which Pamela Anderson and Tommy Lee's sex tape fueled its syndicated ascent, the East Coast-West Coast hip-hop feud that led to the murders of The Notorious B.I.G. and Tupac Shakur, and the rise of fanatical cults and the calamities that ensued. For those who lived through the '90s, it's a glossy rewind-the-clock venture that exploits nostalgia for the era's most titillating tales.\n\nSince there are plenty more of those sordid subjects, Dark Side of the '90s returns on June 14 for another round of time-machine examinations regarding the proliferation of tabloid endeavors such as A Current Affair and Hard Copy , Joey Buttafuoco's statutory rape of Amy Fisher, and the stratospheric success of The Arsenio Hall Show , which shook up late night by bringing an African-American sensibility-as well as a youthful energy, style, and attitude-to a genre and time slot historically dominated by Johnny Carson and The Tonight Show . MTV's The Real World and the origins of mixed martial arts and Ultimate Fighting Championship will also serve as grist for the series' mill, although perhaps none of its areas of concern are timelier than that of its early episode on the phenomenon that took television by storm: Cops .\n\nFew small-screen programs were more iconic throughout the '90s than Fox's seminal reality-TV hit. Airing on Saturday nights, it was instantly elevated by its theme song \"Bad Boys\" by reggae group Inner Circle, which remains one of the most recognizable tunes in television history, and will forever be associated with Cops -an ironic twist, as University of Texas at Austin media studies professor Adrien Sebro points out in Dark Side of the '90s , considering that reggae has traditionally been anti-establishment music and Cops was designed to prop up one of America's bedrock institutions. In half-hour episodes, producers John Langley and Malcolm Barbour's brainchild helped forever transform the entertainment landscape. Just as crucially, it did so while situating itself smack dab in the middle of a culture war that was escalating-and, in 1992, outright exploded with the LA riots .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nCops was, at the outset, the byproduct of fortuitous timing and circumstance. In 1983, Barbour and Langley had made a gritty documentary about the drug epidemic called Cocaine Blues: The Myth and Reality of Cocaine . They then attempted to bring that work's fly-on-the-wall approach to television with 1986's American Vice , a live two-hour special in which host Geraldo Rivera, in pre-taped segments, accompanied cops on drug raids. Rivera had to leave midway through production, compelling the crew to instead mic up the cops themselves, who narrated their activities directly to the camera. In an unexpected and impromptu instant, Cops was born.\n\nThe confluence of the 1988 writers' strike (which halted production on scripted sitcoms and dramas) and the launch of the edgy new Fox TV network provided Cops with a golden opportunity. Premiering on March 11, 1989, the show was an immediate sensation courtesy of its up-close-and-personal view of police work. According to retired Las Vegas Metropolitan PD field lieutenant Randy Sutton, Cops ' popularity was due to the fact that \"This is how it truly is,\" a sentiment seconded by Palm Beach County officer Keith Burns. Certainly, sound recordist Hank Barr and camera operator Mark Whaley contend that what was presented was legitimate, recalling instances in which they wound up in harm's way while documenting their action-highlighted by Whaley's anecdote about being accidentally shot with a shotgun by a careless officer in Chesapeake, Virginia.\n\nNarrated, as before, by Sugar Ray frontman Mark McGrath, Dark Side of the '90s features plenty of clips that reinforce Cops ' adrenalized nature. At the same time, however, it makes sure to note that, in exchange for police-department access and cooperation, Barbour and Langley granted authorities editorial control over the footage that was included in each episode's final cut. In effect, Cops was literal \"copaganda\": a compendium of carefully selected sequences designed to portray the boys in blue as superheroes defending communities from nefarious wrongdoers, who were almost always poor, and frequently Black. As Color of Change president Rashad Robinson states, it's no surprise that law enforcement agencies actively wanted to partner with Cops -it was an exciting series that doubled as a canny public-relations effort for police.\n\nDark Side of the '90s argues that Cops was therefore both realistic and deceptive, creating a gap between perception and reality that was epitomized by the 1991 caught-on-camcorder beating of Rodney King. That Cops ' ratings waned as smartphones became ubiquitous, leading to unvarnished views of unsavory police conduct, is undeniable. Vice TV's docuseries, though, only cursorily gets into the messy duality of the series (or its skewed-and some would say racist-depiction of people of color), whose cable-TV tenure ultimately ended in the wake of George Floyd's murder and the global protests that followed. Moreover, while contextualizing the show's legacy is important, the fact that Dark Side of the '90s installment on Cops spends substantial time in the 2000s and 2010s underscores its general thinness.\n\nThen again, that's emblematic of this undertaking as a whole. Unlike its wrestling-focused counterpart Dark Side of the Ring , Dark Side of the '90s relies on a cornucopia of archival material to bring back fond memories of its bygone age and avoids getting too wrapped up in serious socio-cultural criticism lest it spoil its own tawdry and titillating vibe. Still, even if it never gets beneath the surface, it does pinpoint Cops as the origin for today's modern \"Blue Lives Matter\" movement-a notion proven by the show's newfound (and continuing) run on the right-wing Fox Nation streaming service.\n\nEntertainment Critic\n\nNick.Schager@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

They were released minutes ago from the DC Jail. A HISTORIC DAY IN AMERICA! 🇺🇸 pic.twitter.com/7INfhxLqGr\n\nThey were part of a violent mob that stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, and tried to overthrow former President Joe Biden 's 2020 election victory, leaving a police officer and four rioters dead. Four other police officers died by suicide in the months that followed.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe boys are free from FCI Oakdale, La Ronald Mele Alan Hostetter Jason Farris Welcome home patriot HERO's ❤️🤍💙 pic.twitter.com/K7pQF21zVc\n\nThe pardons left officers who risked their lives defending the capital feeling \"betrayed,\" they said. At one point during the attack, Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone found himself lying stunned and injured on the ground of the U.S. Capitol building.\n\nHe'd been Tasered several times in the back of the neck, and as the mob stripped him of his ammunition, his police radio and his badge, someone tried to rip away his gun. That's when he heard someone say, \"Kill him with his own gun.\"\n\nOn Monday, Fanone, now 44, reacted to the news that one of Donald Trump's first presidential acts had been to pardon more than 1,500 rioters who stormed the Capitol and tried to overthrow former President Joe Biden 's 2020 election victory.\n\n\"I have been betrayed by my country, and I have been betrayed by those who supported Donald Trump,\" Fanone told CNN's Anderson Cooper . \"The only thing going through my mind is that this is what the American people voted for.\"\n\n\"I have been betrayed by my country\": Former DC police officer Michael Fanone talks to Anderson after President Trump pardons more than 1,000 convicted of committing crimes during the January 6 attack on the Capitol. pic.twitter.com/fhN3dhqbPz\n\nThroughout his presidential campaign, Trump had promised to pardon the violent criminals responsible for the Jan. 6 riots, which left a police officer and four rioters dead. Four other police officers died by suicide in the months that followed.\n\nThe would-be insurrectionists were arrested for pepper spraying and beating police officers with flagpoles, stomping on their heads, throwing a bomb into a tunnel full of police, hurling officers down a flight of stairs and plotting to kill FBI agents investigating the attacks. The judge in the case concluded the riot was an act of terrorism, and leaders of the Proud Boys militia received prison sentences of up to 22 years.\n\nInstead of condoning the violence, Trump-who also claimed to love police officers-called the rioters \"hostages\" and \"patriots,\" and even opened campaign rallies with a recording of a performance by the \"J6 Prison Choir.\"\n\n\"Whether you supported [Trump] because he promised these pardons or for some other reason, you knew that this was coming, and here we are,\" Fanone told Cooper.\n\nHe said he'd been receiving death threats ever since he testified before Congress in July 2021 about the horrors he'd experienced on Jan. 6. As members of the mob threatened to kill him, the 20-year law enforcement veteran went into \"survival mode\" and tried to appeal to their humanity by telling them about his kids. Apparently, it worked, and some of the rioters protected him until help arrived.\n\nHe was so badly injured, though, he could only return to limited duty in September 2021. A few months later, he retired completely.\n\n\"Right now, I think the Republican Party owns a monopoly on hypocrisy when it comes to their supposed support of law enforcement because tonight the leader of the Republican party pardoned hundreds of violent cop assaulters,\" he told Cooper.\n\nDaniel Hodges, another Capitol police officer who testified before Congress who still serves on the force, also responded to news of the pardons with disgust.\n\n\"Just worked about 14 hours making sure Trump's inauguration was secure and peaceful, got home, read this. Thanks America,\" he wrote on the social media platform X.\n\nJust worked about 14 hours making sure Trump's inauguration was secure and peaceful, got home, read this.  Thanks America. https://t.co/30RMeKzkIa\n\nVideo of Hodges being beaten and crushed in a door, his mouth full of blood while he cried out for help, went viral after the attacks.\n\n\"I don't think a day has gone by where I haven't thought about it,\" he told WUSA in the lead-up to Monday's inauguration.\n\nFour men who were convicted of assaulting him were presumably on Trump's list of pardons. But Hodges said he wasn't worried about his safety.\n\n\"I'm a cop in D.C. It's not the first time I've been threatened, it's not going to be the last. If they want to come after me, that's their choice. I'm ready,\" he said before the inauguration. \"I would encourage them to rethink their ways, particularly if people are pardoned.\"\n\nFalcone, however, said he's been concerned about his and his family's safety ever since he testified. In recent months his 76-year-old mother's house has been swatted, meaning someone made a fake emergency call to get police to swarm the premises.\n\n\"She's had human feces thrown on her while she was raking leaves in her front yard,\" he said. \"This is who we are as a nation. This is what we have become, and it has been further exacerbated by Donald Trump.\"\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Cops Demand the Right for Cops to Do Psychedelic Drugs\n\nSarko Gergerian, a Massachusetts police lieutenant, is not your average cop. He's also a trained MDMA -assisted therapist. His police chief even gave him permission to take a trip with the medicine, also known as ecstasy or molly, during a clinical trial. \"It opened my heart and mind,\" he told The Daily Beast.\n\nFor decades in the U.S., police officers have served as the frontline troops in a militarized war on drugs in which millions were jailed for non-violent offenses. But a small cadre of serving and former police officers, in the U.S. and across the world, are-like Gergerian- finding that when used responsibly and therapeutically, some of the drugs can ease distress and make them happier.\n\nOn the sidelines of the United Nations' annual Commission on Narcotic Drugs in Vienna on Wednesday , Gergerian sat beside three former senior policemen as part of a panel organized by Law Enforcement Action Partnership ( LEAP ) titled \"Why Police Need Access to Psychedelics Urgently\". They pressed authorities around the world to swiftly make MDMA -assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) available to their comrades both as a preventive medicine and treatment for PTSD , which is rampant and may affect as many as one-in-two officers. The scale of the mental health crisis in policing means that, in the U.S. and the U.K., officers are more likely to commit suicide than die on duty.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"MDMA can push treatment resistant PTSD into remission,\" says Gergerian, who had a postgraduate qualification in mental health counseling before joining the police in 2010 initially as a patrol officer and is speaking in a personal capacity. \"Why not create a wellness program for first responders with MDMA-AT built in so cops don't get to the point where they're blowing their own heads off with their guns.\"\n\nThe origin of Gergerian's training is a story for the ages. He attended a police chiefs' conference in Florida in 2018 where the psychedelic healing advocate Rick Doblin, the founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) presented clinical data on the effectiveness of the empathogenic stimulant. \"I was already a trained psychotherapist and I asked him, 'How can I help with this?'\" Gergerian recalls. \"He answered: 'Become a psychedelic-assisted therapist,' And gave me his card.\" Gergerian duly underwent MAPS' 100-hour training programme and made an appearance in the Netflix psychedelics series How to Change Your Mind .\n\nThe crew in front of the flags - Woods is the white guy in the middle, blue suit. Sarko second right, Bilheran far right.\n\nNow, Gergerian-the psychedelic healing lieutenant-is perhaps the most high profile advocate among serving police officers for psychedelic therapy. Already he has \"held space\" for veterans and retired police undergoing ketamine trips, and he stands ready to facilitate MDMA sessions for his fellow officers if the Food and Drugs Administration approves the therapy for the stress disorder in August, as expected. It seems far out-but with the U.S. Veterans Affairs department already funding a pilot scheme providing ketamine-assisted therapy to former soldiers, perhaps police officers will soon be able to access \"the love drug\" as part of their health insurance schemes.\n\nGergerian even thinks psychedelic therapy can help to heal the crisis in policing-where accusations of racial bias and fatal shootings have led to the \"defund the police\" movement. \"Psychedelic-assisted therapies are the antidote to highly contagious infections like hate,\" he says. \"They will help create space so we can carefully move towards one another, listen, accept, and extend a hand in service to each other for the sake of our entire planet.\"\n\nNeil Woods , board member of LEAP and a U.K. former undercover detective who co-wrote the best-seller Good Cop, Bad War , also thinks that it may be better to heal police officers, and society-at-large, than defund the police. \"The U.N. needs to start removing the barriers to psychedelic research and legalization,\" says Woods, who organized the panel. \"Nation states need to stand up and innovate for the sake of their cops too. The evidence is here: People are dying and we need to do something about it. We want psychedelic therapy ingrained to protect the mental health of police, as well as everyone else.\"\n\nWoods knows several police officers who have undergone psychedelic therapy. One was a detective sergeant at the time who drank ayahuasca, a visionary psychedelic brew from the Amazon, and rescued his mental health, and his marriage. He also became a better, kinder police officer, Woods says. Another is PC Paul Haylock, a serving officer of 22 years who recently told of how his experiences with ayahuasca in Peru. Psychedelics also turned his life around and helped him process trauma accrued from countless harrowing incidents and scant police aftercare. Serving officers in Canada have similar stories.\n\nIt's no wonder so many cops are seeking their own solutions. \"Police officers who were exposed to trauma in the war on drugs, now report that the effort did not limit access to drugs, but increased violence. Now they are fighting for psychedelics in the treatment of trauma and other psychological challenges,\" Arild Knutsen, the head of Norway's Association for Humane Drug Policies, who attended the panel, posted on X .\n\nLEAP's mental health in policing campaign comes as the severe lack of psychological and emotional support in forces around the world is driving an unprecedented exodus where record numbers across England and Wales and the U.S . are quitting. Others, like Fabien Bilheran, a retired French detective who spent eight years in the Paris \"narcotics brigade\" and was an ardent believer in the drug war when he began his policing career, have dawning realizations that they are part of the problem. He says this disillusionment, and the reaction to his attempts to raise awareness of the suffering resulting from the drug war, led him to attempt suicide in 2020.\n\n\"I was a fanatical enforcer of the drug war,\" he recalls. \"But when I realized that police violence made drug trafficking increase rather than go down, it was really bad for my mental health.\" He says he was about to shoot himself while sitting in an impounded car in the police station but just as he was about to pull the trigger, the car alarm went off. \"The car alarm saved my life,\" Bilheran, who also shared his story during the panel discussion, told The Daily Beast. \"It was like a wake up call.\"\n\nAfter that, he sought help outside of the police and received treatment for PTSD, but the sedating benzodiazepine drugs he was prescribed just made him slow and sleepy. He soon discovered that people were recommending other tools for fighting PTSD and he did therapeutic work with psychedelic mushrooms, LSD and 5-MeO-DMT. \"I felt that all the people around me were connected,\" re recalls. Bilheran says that his experiences with MDMA made it possible the co-writing a book , The Law of Silence, published in 2022, which highlights the issues he sees in the police force. \"It helps me speak freely more easily and put words to my suffering,\" he says.\n\nBilheran went to Mexico for some of his psychedelic experiences, but increasingly illegal psychedelic therapy is available under the radar and in some cases aboveboard in the U.S. and across Europe. Some underground psychedelic facilitators are ex-police officers and veterans. Luc Van Poelje-a former soldier who served in Iraq in 1991 and began facilitating mushroom truffle journeys in Holland after transformative 2013 ayahuasca and mushroom trips- has served psilocybin to around 30 serving police officers, from his own country, Germany, the U.K. and the U.S. \"Everyone is looking for healing, insights and inner peace,\" he says. \"It's about remembering you're part of a magical universe and you belong here, that you are loved. Police officers are often spat at, literally and figuratively, and that's a lot to deal with.\"\n\nSarko Gergerian with Rick Doblin\n\nBen Broughton, a cop for a decade in the U.K., was a proud of his work in the police. He rose to the rank of sergeant-arresting countless people for drug offenses-before going to work for the U.K.'s financial conduct authority. But he says a magic mushroom ceremony \"changed his life\" and transformed his perspective of himself, his work and his attitude towards drugs. So much so that he soon set about to train with a plant medicine shaman to become a medicine man himself. Fast forward five years and he's holding his own ceremonies.\n\nDoctors, lawyers and people from all sorts of professions attend, including two serving police officers. \"They are both trying to change the police force from within the system,\" says Broughton. \"They've decided to focus on their own personal issues in ceremony and become more conscious police officers. If we can have a more conscious police service, that could be one hell of a change.\" One of the officers is actively campaigning for drug law reform, too.\n\n\"We should have done things differently, but I wouldn't be the person I am today if I hadn't been through those experiences,\" says Broughton, alluding to the fact that he, like Bilheran and Woods, arrested countless people for drug crimes during his time in the force. \"That was me once upon a time,\" he adds, \"but I've changed, mostly due to the medicine, and this is who I am now.\"\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Trump Frees Thugs Who Beat Cops With Weapons on Jan. 6\n\nFreelance Reporter\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed an executive order pardoning about 1,500 people for convictions related to the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot on Monday night, one of his first acts as president.\n\nTrump only briefly addressed the order while signing a mountain of other executive orders on the Resolute Desk. An aide told the president that the order applied to \"approximately 1,500\" people at the riot. \"We have about six commutations in there, where we're doing further research,\" Trump added.\n\n\"We hope they come out tonight, frankly,\" the president said as he signed the order. \"They're expecting it.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOn the fourth anniversary of the attacks earlier this month, the Justice Department said that approximately 1,583 individuals were charged with crimes related to the riots that took place as Congress certified the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThat staggering figure included 608 charged with \"assaulting, resisting, or impeding law enforcement agents,\" as well as another 174 that were charged with using a deadly weapon to injure a police officer.\n\nThese include a 71-year-old man from Pennsylvania who was given 46 months in prison for beating a police officer with a metal flag pole, as well as Christopher Worrell, a member of the Proud Boys, who was handed a 10-year prison sentence after emptying an entire can of pepper spray onto police officers defending the building.\n\nShane Jenkins, a Capitol rioter from Texas, was sentenced to seven years in prison after trying to using a tomahawk to break through windows, then joining a \"concerted assault\" on police officers defending a tunnel entrance to the building, according to the Justice Department .\n\nAnother Texas man, Andrew Taake, pleaded guilty for attacking Metropolitan Police Department officers with a metal whip and bear spray after he was caught bragging about it on the dating app Bumble.\n\nOthers faced sentences for trespassing, obstruction, and entering the building-even if they did not clash with law enforcement. Alan Hostetter, a former California police chief-turned-yoga instructor, was sentenced to over 11 years in prison for entering the Capitol with a deadly weapon and obstructing an official proceeding.\n\nOther rioters were given smaller sentences for less violent crimes. Jay Johnston, a comedic actor known for his former role voicing a character on Bob's Burgers, pleaded guilty to charges of obstructing law enforcement officers and was sentenced to a year in prison .\n\nA statement later released by the White House clarified that the president's order commuted the sentences of 14 individuals-including Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers militia, who was sentenced to 18 years in prison on charges of seditious conspiracy.\n\nThe other individuals were granted a \"complete and unconditional pardon.\"\n\nThe list of pardons also includes the former leader of the Proud Boys, who was previously sentenced to 22 years in prison on charges of seditious conspiracy and obstruction of Congress for his role in planning the attack.\n\nEnrique Tarrio, the alt-right organization's former national chairman, is one of the thousands of people expected to be freed after Trump's sweeping order.\n\nAn attorney for Tarrio told NBC News he was being processed out of FCI Pollock in Louisiana, but exact details of what kind of clemency he was going to receive were unclear. Tarrio's representative did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Daily Beast.\n\nF ederal prosecutors said the Proud Boys played a \"central role in setting the January 6th attack on our Capitol into motion.\" Tarrio was eventually convicted alongside three other Proud Boys members on charges of seditious conspiracy.\n\nTarrio was sentenced to 22 years in prison , followed by 36 months of supervised release, in September 2023.\n\n\"He's very excited,\" his mother, Duarte Tarrio, previously told Local 10 News in Florida. \"It's surreal to him. He's ready to go.\"\n\nBut not everyone was ecstatic about Trump's broad pardons for some of his most loyal followers. Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA), who was overseeing the certification of former President Joe Biden's election in 2020, called the executive order an \"outrageous insult to our justice system and the heroes who suffered physical scars and emotional trauma as they protected the Capitol.\"\n\nFreelance Reporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Trump Pardons Cops Convicted in Deadly Chase and Cover-Up\n\nReporter\n\nPresident Trump has pardoned two police officers convicted in the death of Karon Hylton-Brown during a pursuit.\n\nHylton-Brown, a 20-year-old Black man, died in October 2020 as he was being chased by police officer Terence Sutton Jr. Hylton-Brown was riding a moped that was hit by a motorist uninvolved in the chase-but a jury found that Sutton caused his death \"by driving a police vehicle in conscious disregard for an extreme risk of death or serious bodily injury,\" according to a statement from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia.\n\nSutton was found guilty of second-degree murder, conspiracy to obstruct and obstruction of justice by a federal jury in September 2024, receiving a 66-month prison term.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHis supervisor, Andrew Zabavsky, was also sentenced to 48 months in prison by the same jury after he was found guilty of conspiracy to obstruct and obstruction of justice.\n\nThe court found that the pair conspired to hide the circumstances of the crash from officials. \"As Mr. Hylton-Brown lay unconscious in the street in a pool of his own blood, Sutton and Zabavsky agreed to cover up what Sutton had done to prevent any further investigation of the incident,\" according to prosecutors.\n\nThe incident-which happened amid mass protests over the killing of George Floyd five months earlier-led to civil unrest in Washington, D.C., beginning outside the 4th District police station where Sutton and Zabavsky worked.\n\nProtesters broke windows in the station and damaged police cars parked outside, and police fired pepper pellets and threw stun grenades. Four officers were were injured in the clashes, authorities said.\n\nTrump repeatedly made references to potential pardons for the officers following his inauguration this week. On Tuesday, he appeared to allude to the case when asked if his decision to grant clemency to those convicted of violent crimes in the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol signalled that it was acceptable to assault officers.\n\n\"No, the opposite. In fact, I'm going to be letting two officers from Washington police, D.C.-I believe they're from D.C.-but I just approved it,\" Trump said, without disclosing what had been approved. \"They were arrested, put in jail for five years, because they went after an illegal, and I guess something happened where something went wrong and they arrested the two officers and put them in jail for going after a criminal.

      "text": "'Reacher' Star Alan Ritchson Fires Back at Cops Who Trolled Him Online\n\nEntertainment Reporter\n\nAlan Ritchson, the titular star of Prime Video's Reacher series, has been known to share his political opinions despite how they may conflict with those of the show's conservative fan base. And even though some viewers have threatened to stop watching the popular streamer series in protest of Ritchson's \"woke\" comments, he's doubling down on his message of police accountability in a post to Instagram this week.\n\nThe digs aimed at Ritchson were related to an interview he did with The Hollywood Reporter this month, in which he addressed the online stir among Reacher fans after an old photo of him wearing an \"Arrest the cops who killed Breonna Taylor\" tee shirt resurfaced: \"Cops get away with murder all the time, and the fact that we can't really hold them accountable for their improprieties is disturbing to me,\" he said in the interview. \"We should completely reform the way that we do it. I mean, you shouldn't have to spend more time getting an education as a hairstylist than as a cop who's armed with a deadly weapon.\"\n\nThe National Fraternal Order of Police caught wind of Ritchson's comments and posted a photo of the actor to its Instagram page, calling him a \"useless Hollywood actor\" who is \"virtue signaling for attention at the expense of brave police officers.\" Ritchson responded to the post on Tuesday, calling it a \"concerning\" display of \"emotional immaturity\" in his lengthy reply.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nA post shared by Alan Ritchson (@alanritchson)\n\n\"This kind of emotionally immature response is the epitome of what concerns me about law enforcement today,\" he wrote in the post. \"If this is how leadership handles a peaceful disagreement, what does life look like for those unseen interactions in the street? How does this shape the character of those police officers looking to management?\"\n\n\"Do you really want individuals so easily angered and bully[sic] like school children to have a gun and the protection of an untouchable union?\" he also said.\n\nRitchson went on to say that he knows there are \"many good and brave cops\" but pretending that there aren't some bad apples indicates \"blind allegiance\" he called \"dangerous\" and \"fertile ground for fascism.\"\n\n\"There are rogue or ill-equipped officers who remind us that we need higher barriers to entry and stricter regulations so abuses are relegated to the past,\" he continued, \"To only seek praise and ignore this need is extremely unwise and endangers those at risk of being ostracized and marginalized.\"\n\nRitchson also took the opportunity to call out Florida Governor Ron DeSantis . \"To make matters worse, in Florida, voters perpetuate these issues by continuing to support people like Gov. Desantis who just passed a law making it illegal for anyone other than the police to police themselves,\" he wrote, referring to the governor's recent bill that limits police oversight panels in the state.\n\n\"This lack of transparency would be laughable if not so deadly,\" he added. \"Efforts like these take us further from the world I hope to leave for my children, which is one with extreme prudence when deciding who we arm and a glass house for public institutions. Especially ones with the ability to end lives.\"\n\nIn the same Hollywood Reporter interview, Ritchson opened up about his own Christian faith and expressed frustration over how conservatives have seemingly co-opted his religion. \"Trump is a rapist and a con man, and yet the entire Christian church seems to treat him like he's their poster child and it's unreal,\" he remarked. \"I don't understand it.\"\n\nEntertainment Reporter\n\neboni.boykin-patterson@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Secret Service in Crisis: Used Local Cops at Trump Rally\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\nIt's been the question on everyone's mind since Donald Trump narrowly escaped death in an assassination attempt Saturday night: How, exactly, was a 20-year-old rifleman able to perch himself on a rooftop just 150 yards away from the former president during a rally?\n\nIt turns out, the Secret Service's over reliance on Pennsylvania cops may be partially to blame, with a report from The Washington Post revealing Sunday the agency punted the responsibility of surveying and securing some nearby structures to local officers.\n\nAnthony Guglielmi, a spokesperson for the Secret Service, conceded that the agency relied on local law enforcement to fill in \"significant parts of its typical array of specialized protective units,\" the Post reported.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThomas Crooks was just 150 yards away from Donald Trump when he opened fire.\n\nGuglielmi said Trump's security detail called on at least six members of Butler County's tactical units for these jobs. That included the counter sniper teams that spotted and killed the shooter, Thomas Crooks, just moments after he fired a semiautomatic in Trump's direction.\n\nCiting sources, the Associated Press reported that it was also a local officer who spotted Crooks on the roof before he opened fire, but that cop was unable to engage him because he was clinging to a ledge and trying to pull himself up. The report said the officer couldn't draw his weapon and ultimately let go of the ledge after Crooks pointed his rifle at him.\n\nIt's not abnormal for the Secret Service to rely on local cops for additional security at events, but, with the agency now under a magnifying glass, many lawmakers-from both parties-are questioning whether the Secret Service should have had more of its own agents on the ground.\n\nSen. Rick Scott (R-FL) was among the lawmakers demanding answers from the Secret Service and calling for heads to roll inside the agency. The Secret Service was placed under official review on Sunday, and its director, Kimberly Cheatle, may soon find herself testifying on Capitol Hill to account for one of the worst disasters in her agency's 159-year history.\n\nTo put in perspective just how egregious it was that Crooks made it within 150 yards, or about 450 feet, from Trump-that's roughly the distance U.S. Army recruits must hit a human-sized silhouette from in order to qualify for the M16 assault rifle in basic training. That suggests that even the newest of U.S. infantrymen likely could have landed the shot-especially considering the rifle used by Crooks is a semiautomatic civilian version of the the military M16.\n\nSecret Service agents rushed to shield Donald Trump with their bodies and rush him off stage.\n\nKevin Rojek, the FBI Special Agent in Charge, said at the scene of the shooting that it was \"surprising\" the gunman was able to ever get a shot off at Trump-especially from so close.\n\nThe Secret Service has not said how many agents it had at the Trump rally, but its staffing struggles have been well documented in recent years.\n\nJason Chaffetz, who was chair of the House Oversight Committee in 2015 when it penned an investigative report on Secret Service security failures, has long called for the Secret Service to hire more agents. On Sunday, he said the Trump rally a \"catastrophic failure\" in security.\n\nHe told the Post that his 2015 report called for significant changes to the Secret Service-specifically, beefing up its personnel count-that were never implemented. That inaction may have nearly cost Trump his life.\n\n\"We did all these investigations and did an extensive report so this would never happen again,\" he told the Post . \"It's as if they paid no attention to the bipartisan recommendations.\"\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\nJosh.Fiallo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

In most of the arrests, the Post reported that victims were not related to or acquaintances of their abusers, with some children reportedly being assaulted by the very officers who were sent to help them after they fell victim to a separate sexual assault. The Post reported girls, aged 13 through 15, were the most likely to be assaulted by officers, who often came in contact with them \"through their jobs.\" The data used in the probe came largely from a database kept by Bowling Green University, in Ohio , which has a comprehensive database of crimes committed by law enforcement across the country. The Post added that other assaults were found by digging through thousands of court records and local news reports. \"In case after case, officers intentionally earned the trust of parents and guardians, created opportunities to get kids alone and threatened repercussions for broken silence,\" the Post wrote. \"Unlike teachers and priests, they did it all while wielding the power of their badges and guns.\"\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\nJosh.Fiallo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Cops: the violent legacy of a TV show that sculpted America's view of police\n\nThe cancellation of the long-running reality show puts an end to a problematic ratings hit that was seen by its many critics as unethical and dangerous\n\nI n 1989, a new show came on TV that felt like nothing that had come before it. For 30 minutes, viewers got to ride along with real police officers and watch - in verité style - as they broke up drunken fistfights, chased speeding motorcycles across highways, and went undercover for drug busts. It was thrilling. It was visceral. And it was a hit.\n\nCops, the brainchild of John Langley (and Malcolm Babour and Stephen Chao) was immediately met with critical and commercial success. It received four Emmy nominations between 1989 and 1994. During that first season, the New York Times proclaimed \"Cops Camera Shows the Real Thing\". The San Diego Union-Tribune said \"Cop Stories Don't Get More Real Than This.\" For decades, Cops was the predominant depiction of real police at work in America.\n\nThis week, after more than 1,000 episodes on air and just a day after its 33rd season was scheduled to premiere, Cops was cancelled by the Paramount network. It happened amid protests across the world responding to racist and violent policing in America, and reflects the work of many people, including concerted efforts by civil rights group Color of Change . While cancelling Cops is barely a starting point when it comes to creating a more fair and equitable criminal justice system, this small step is more meaningful than you might think.\n\nI know this because I spent 18 months investigating the show, as part of a six-part documentary podcast that came out last year called Running From Cops , hosted by Dan Taberski. We learned that Cops (and other reality policing shows like it) has a huge impact on how Americans view policing, and how police officers view themselves. Just ask any of the dozens of officers on the show who profess that watching Cops is what made them want to become a cop in the first place.\n\nWe watched and analyzed 846 episodes of the show, collecting over 68,000 data points. We catalogued the types of crimes (violent, narcotics, sex work, traffic stops, chases, etc); whether the segment ended in arrest; whether the suspect was on drugs or alcohol at the time; and the race and gender of all officers, suspects and victims. We then compared this data to data available from the FBI's Uniform Crime Report.\n\nWhat we discovered was that, contrary to early press reactions, the world portrayed on Cops is not like the real world. There are about four times more violent crimes in Cops than in reality. And three times more drug arrests. And about 10 times more arrests for sex work. The cops on the show are also, statistically speaking, extremely good at their jobs. Segments on the show end in arrest 84.4% of the time. (That number reflects a change over time, from 61% back in 1990 to 95% in the most recent season.) In Cops world, law enforcement officers are so effective, it's basically a given that a crime will end in an arrest.\n\nThe tactics the show's producers use to get this footage are also questionable at best, and disturbing at worst. We were told that they never air a segment without a signed consent form from the suspect in question. In the course of our reporting, we spoke to 11 suspects who had appeared on the show. All but one said that they had not given their consent, or they were too inebriated at the time to legally give consent. Others told us they were confused by the relationship between the show's producers and the law enforcement agents with whom they were working side-by-side. We even found a case in Gwinnett county, Georgia, where a young woman was denied a bail bond until she signed the form giving Cops permission to air her arrest for possession of cocaine. Subsequent testing showed that the substance was not cocaine at all, though this was never aired on the show. Instead, the producers aired her arrest, and continued to air it in reruns.\n\nPerhaps the most insidious takeaway we had from watching hundreds of hours of the show was not quantitative, but qualitative. Over and over, Cops shows officers acting in violent, abusive, racist and potentially unconstitutional ways. This can include anything from repeatedly tasing suspects who are in custody, to prying open a suspect's mouth with a flashlight in search of drugs. Rather than critiquing this sort of behavior, or even presenting it neutrally, Cops portrays it as good policing.\n\nThe police departments featured on the show have no problem with this portrayal. In fact, in exchange for access, the producers would give every department they work with \"final cut\" - the right to edit out any actions caught on camera that might portray them in a bad light. Those departments chose to leave all of those incidents in.\n\nUntil a few days ago, Cops was on TV almost constantly. In a single week, it could air as many as 69 times in syndication. It also led to Live PD, which we investigated for Running From Cops as well. In 2016, this new reality policing show arrived and became even more popular than the show that inspired it. It was the live version of Cops, cutting back and forth between active crime scenes being filmed across the country as they happen, while a team of law enforcement vets act as commentators in the show's New York studio. Picture the NFL's Red Zone, but with police. Unsurprisingly, it contained many of the same ethical problems as Cops, many of which were exacerbated by the fact that it was broadcast live. In our reporting, we heard from multiple people that police officers would show up to their homes at all hours of the day and night, production crew in tow, hoping to catch them doing something illegal and camera-worthy. LivePD, which aired on A&E, quickly became the most popular cable program in its time slot. It ran in long, multi-day marathon blocks, taking up a significant portion of the network's weekly schedule. There were six spinoffs.\n\nWhen Cops was cancelled this week, I could not imagine that A&E would follow suit. Cops was by this point a stale show with dwindling viewership but LivePD was a cash cow (it has just been renewed for 160 more episodes ). But I was wrong. Just a day after Cops was canned, A&E cancelled Live PD. The show's host, Dan Abrams wrote on Twitter that he was \"Shocked & beyond disappointed about this.\"\n\nDoes the violence we've seen committed by police officers over the last two weeks - and the protests in the face of that violence - have any connection to these show's long run? I can't say for sure. Or rather, I can't say how much. I can say that for 31 years Cops and more recently Live PD depicted a world full of violence and crime, in which the bad and often demonstrably illegal behavior of the cops on camera was held up as good policing. The shows helped to normalize injustice. And we know that in the real world, that type of injustice is disproportionately inflicted upon black people. We also know that dozens of officers who appear in the later seasons of the show profess that watching Cops was the reason they themselves became cops.\n\nThis show shaped them, and it has shaped the way millions of Americans, for more than three decades, perceived the supposed \"reality\" of policing.\n\nSo, what does it all mean - that this show went from near ubiquity to cancellation on the eve of its 33rd season? Is it a sign that something really is different? I can't claim to know. It is worth noting, though, that the first time there was a massive outcry in response to police brutality during Cops' run, following the 1992 beating of Rodney King by the LAPD, the show was nominated for Emmys for the following two years.\n\nIn 2013, after the murder of Trayvon Martin and in the early days of Black Lives Matter, a campaign by Color of Change convinced Fox to part ways with the show, although it was immediately picked up by another network. This time it's been taken off the air and it's unlikely to return.\n\nHenry Molofsky is the producer of Running From Cops"

      "text": "Cops is coming back and that's a depressing sign of the times\n\nCancelled during last summer's protests, the much-maligned reality series will return - a sadly predictable sign of a too-brief cultural reckoning\n\nL ast summer, amid a spate of protests against overzealous policing that erupted in more police violence, which only proved their necessity, the silver lining was supposed to be the promise of lasting change. Judging by the impassioned op-eds flying every which way, the demonstrations had triggered a hyperjump in mainstream awareness, with average Americans considering for the first time that there may be irreparable, institutional rot at the root of nationwide law enforcement. Statistics about disproportionate racial dynamics in arrests, harassment of mentally disabled individuals incapable of advocating for themselves, and other damning perspectives on the job came pouring out, fundamentally altering the perception of the cop in the public imagination. The image of trustworthy, competent heroes forming a thin blue line between society and anarchy began to fade, and the hope was that a more sober-minded critique would take its place.\n\nThere's no better bellwether for this presumed shift than Cops, the long-running TV series documenting on-duty encounters between the fuzz and real-life perps. Over 30 years, the show promoted the dedication and fearlessness of the officers on camera while minimizing the harm of their aggressive methods, sometimes even playing it off as humor. The footage courted scandal over the entirety of its run, but the objections that the show valorized the brutal protocols never held water until 2020. Its shortcomings and selective framings were recognized to an unprecedented degree, compelling Paramount to read the room and pull the 33rd season . Those inclined toward cultural analysis took it as a positive sign, a step on the path to enlightenment.\n\nBut there's a magical place where none of this progress stuck, a rightwing never-never-land that allows aggrieved conservatives to hear their opinions parroted back to them and affirmed as unassailably correct, in which the recent developments in social justice can look more like a passing fad than a step in political evolution. Cops has found a home in the bosom of Fox News Media , announced this week as the new host for fresh episodes of the series. (There are murmurs that A&E's like-minded reality program Live PD may also be coming back.) Despite this ideological faction's wariness of \"snowflakes\", the streaming platform Fox Nation will provide a safe space not just for the wayward TV property, but for the increasingly obsolete school of thought it represents.\n\nGoing to the online Fox hinterlands means that this latest iteration of Cops won't have to contend with the difficult question of what a humane, conscious version of the show might look like. If mounted on network TV for mass consumption, the segments would have to reflect the reality that we all know too well. It's hard to picture, say, the participating officers going out on a 5150 call (mentally distressed suspect) with a social worker or health professional and trying to defuse the situation rather than wrestle it into submission. The show can't function in a world where a traffic stop feels less like a spectator sport than the beginning of the realest horror in everyday life.\n\nThis quandary raises the question of what Cops is for, functionally speaking. It's not to faithfully portray the truth of police work, or else the rate of violent crimes, sex work and successful arrests wouldn't be nearly as high as they're represented onscreen. If it's to lionize the long arm of the law, that's a strange way of going about it, the police often behaving in a jumpy, hostile manner that doesn't cast the badge in such a flattering light. That leaves only the amusement factor, the notion that there's a viewership with a reliable desire to watch chases and tacklings, even (or perhaps especially) when they're at the expense of the unstable, the inebriated and the helpless. Anyone with the mistaken impression that Cops 2.0 would embrace critical reforms would do well to note that Fox Nation has already offered all active police and first responders a free year's subscription to the service.\n\nJust as giving the hook to Cops symbolized a turning of the tide in American culture, so too does the show's retreat into the welcoming refuge of the post-Trumpite media-sphere carry a weighty significance. The rift fracturing the polarized populace of the US continues to widen, accelerated by the availability of televised and online content to reinforce any stance you could choose. Fringe partisans can bunker themselves in their respective realities, separate and only getting farther apart. Like any of the pundits or celebrities decrying so-called cancel culture, the literally canceled Cops can find a refuge in the isolated yet expanding Fox News universe. There, time stands still. The decision to cling to that era of unchecked authority only tightens the unsettling bond between police departments all over the country and the far-right at the fore of the Republican party, done licking its wounds and back to consolidating influence."

      "text": "The revival of Live PD is a potentially dangerous reality TV backslide\n\nThe police-embedded reality series, arguably one of the most irresponsible on TV, will return two years after it was cancelled with a cloud of concern\n\nT here was a window in the summer of 2020 for once unthinkable, and unlikely, progress. This included the cancellation of Cops and Live PD, two reality shows embedded with law enforcement that sourced footage of real people in real arrests to valorize police and mock their targets. In the wake of the police killing of George Floyd and the nationwide Black Lives Matter protests, the shows' networks, Paramount and A&E, responded to pressure to reckon with television's role in producing so-called copaganda . It was a long overdue move given that Cops, the longest-running reality show in history which could air as many as 69 times a week in syndication, cemented the influential archetype of police as hard-charging, swash-buckling, ends-justify-the-means characters and left a trail of off-camera damage in its wake.\n\nIt would not last. Last September, Cops moved to Fox News Media's streaming platform, Fox Nation, which aired its 34th season the following month. And on Wednesday, cable channel Reelz announced it would revive Live PD, arguably the more unscrupulous, dishonest and dangerous version of its progenitor. The \"live\" version of Cops, Live PD premiered on A&E in 2016 and quickly became the most-watched show in its time slot with an average of 2.4m viewers . It was more popular than Cops, running in hour-long marathons, with six spinoffs by 2020. The return of Cops and Live PD is not surprising - there was too much money, too large a fandom , too wide a cultural divide and too little incentive for producers to not capitalize on it all to keep them off the air. But that does not lessen the disappointment, nor obviate restating what many unwilling participants already know: the revival of Live PD is a backslide, and people will pay for it.\n\nThe new Live PD has been rebranded as On Patrol: Live, but maintains the same production company, Big Fish Entertainment, as well as host Dan Abrams, who also serves as a chief legal analyst for ABC News. According to Abrams in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, On Patrol: Live is \"going to be a very similar type of show to the one that existed previously\". As in, a show that applies the buzz of a sports highlight roundup to seemingly live police footage, threaded with commentary by analysts at a New York studio. Think NFL Red Zone, but for arrests of people not given the chance to sign release forms because the show bills itself as live news. \"Live PD follows news gathering standards like any news organization - your local nightly news show or newspaper - would in covering a story,\" an A&E spokesperson told the New York Times in 2020.\n\nAbrams echoed this sentiment - that Live PD is an information-gathering tool - in the new series' announcement. \"I do think the environment has changed [since Live PD was canceled],\" he told the Hollywood Reporter. \"I think the more we talk about policing, the more we should want to watch police officers doing what they do. There was a conversation then about policing, there is a conversation now about policing, and as a result I think it is a good thing to have a lens on police departments.\"\n\nTo be clear: Live PD does not act like a news organization. It puts a \"lens on police departments\" insomuch as it films hundreds of hours of footage that is then edited for entertainment and, as multiple investigations have found, with police input to keep blatant misconduct off-air. (There is a 10- to 25-minute delay allowing for producers to make edits, and \"earlier footage\" segments could be filmed weeks in advance.) If the environment has \"changed,\" as Abrams claims, it's because public pressure has moved sufficiently elsewhere for Live PD to make a comeback; it's not that the show intends to contribute to a more nuanced, accurate, and critical view of policing in the US.\n\nLive PD is an even more deceptive ploy than Cops, as it over-emphasizes transparency by suggesting the minutes-long segments aired on TV are 1) live 2) accurate, despite being culled from hours of footage and 3) representative of real life and real police work. That is not the case, as Live PD is entertainment in a symbiotic relationship with law enforcement. A Marshall Project investigation found through records requests from 47 agencies working with Live PD that at least 13 departments asked the show not to broadcast certain unflattering encounters, which ultimately did not make it to air. This reportedly included footage of an officer in Rhode Island hitting a suspected shoplifter on a skateboard with his car door, video of officers grabbing a possible domestic violence victim and dragging her out of her home in Washington, and a Louisiana officer possibly calling a black man \"boy.\" (Live PD has said the footage was not aired for other reasons.)\n\nDistrict attorneys in Austin, Texas, fought to get deleted Live PD footage of the May 2019 arrest of Javier Ambler II, a 40-year-old black man, after a pursuit that began because he failed to dim his headlights; Ambler died after he was handcuffed, tased and forced to the ground. The case and the possible loss of evidence were not known publicly until the Austin American-Statesman and KVUE-TV reported it days before A&E canceled Live PD. It's unclear if Williamson county sheriffs viewed the Live PD footage before it was destroyed, though according to email records obtained by the Marshall Project, Live PD producers regularly sent footage to deputies for review in 2019. (In March 2021, Live PD sued the Austin police department and Williamson county sheriff's office for seizing their footage and wrongly blaming producers for \"stonewalling\" the investigation.)\n\nThe Ambler case is perhaps the most egregious example of the show's loyalties and incredibly murky ethics, but its mundane, bread-and-butter segments do their own harm. A 2020 Austin American-Statesman investigation found that uses of force by Williamson county sheriff deputies nearly doubled the year after Live PD partnered with the department, and that deputies used significantly more force during the weeks that Live PD camera crews filmed. Even if a case doesn't turn violent, there's the humiliation factor.\n\n\"They have no problem belittling you and humiliating you and degrading you ... some of them calling you names and such,\" a woman named Amy in Spokane, Washington, told Running from Cops , a six-part 2019 podcast investigating Cops and Live PD. Amy's Live PD arrest was filmed when she was blackout drunk, sobbing, not committing a crime, and unable to give consent (not that it would matter because, again, this is supposedly live news).\n\nHer friend, the podcast found, was sought out six times by police with the Live PD crew, hoping to catch her arrest for missing an appointment with a corrections officer on camera. Another man in Tulsa, Oklahoma, said he agreed to be on the show after several visits from police and camera crews and a $40 payment. \"They basically kept coming after my house and I finally realized that these people won't go away,\" he told producers. Live PD wouldn't confirm or deny the payment, but the man offered text messages with a show producer supporting his story.\n\nIt may return to television, but Live PD won't be welcome everywhere; in May last year, Texas governor Greg Abbott signed a law , named after Ambler, that would ban reality TV from partnering with state police. Spokane passed a measure in 2018 requiring Cops and Live PD to get consent from everyone on the show as well as proper insurance. Maybe the restrictions and fears of liability will lead to a Live PD with fewer glorified, graphic uses of force.\n\nMaybe the new departments and civilian ride-alongs will, as Abrams told the Hollywood Reporter, \"change the fabric of the show\". I doubt it. No change to a program fundamentally intended to translate policing into gotcha entertainment would be enough."

      "text": "Unmasking the spy cops: how women found the truth about men who tricked them into relationships\n\nCredit cards, passports and ingenuity led to the identities of undercover police who were loved under false pretences\n\nHelen Steel was in her 20s and deeply in love with a man who told her he would \"like to spend the rest of his life\" with her.\n\nShe and John Barker had just moved into a new flat and would share long walks in the countryside, where they hoped to one day buy a cottage using money he had inherited.\n\n\"I had never felt this intensity of love for someone before,\" she says. \"Although we'd had a few small arguments ... John and I had been blissfully happy\".\n\nOne day he surprised her by suggesting that he wanted children with her. \"I was a little startled and asked how many he had in mind,\" she says. \"Six,\" he replied.\n\nBut it was all a lie - even his name.\n\nIn reality he was an undercover police officer who had been sent to spy on her and her political allies.\n\nShe was a social justice and environmental campaigner, and would go on to be one of the defendants in the celebrated McLibel case.\n\nNow John Dines, who had used the fake name of Barker during his four-year undercover deployment, has said he never loved Steel. He has told the public inquiry into undercover policing that during their two-year relationship, he used Steel to bolster his fake identity and collect \"as much useful and valuable intelligence as possible\" about leftwing protesters.\n\n\"In other words, cold, calculating emotional and sexual exploitation,\" said David Barr, the inquiry's chief barrister. Dines has given the inquiry two statements but has refused to be questioned.\n\nOn Thursday, ITV is due to broadcast the first in a three-part series on the so-called spy cops scandal. The series, made in collaboration with the Guardian, tells the stories of a group of women, including Steel, who were devastated after they were deceived into long-term relationships by undercover officers.\n\nThe women used ingenious methods over many years to discover the true identities of the men who had abused them.\n\nIn a long-running covert operation that stretched from 1968 to at least 2010, about 139 undercover officers spied on more than 1,000 predominantly leftwing political groups . In deployments typically lasting four years, they adopted fake identities and pretended to be campaigners as they hoovered up information about the political activities of the groups.\n\nThe Guardian has calculated that at least 25 of the officers - nearly a fifth of the total number of spies - formed sexual relationships with members of the public, while concealing their real identities. In other words, it was frequent.\n\nFor six months, Dines pretended to Steel that he was having a mental breakdown. He tormented her by telling her that he loved her but could not continue their relationship as he needed space to sort himself out. He would disappear for periods and then reappear. It was \"erratic and alarming\", she says.\n\nIn 1992, he told her in a letter that he was going to South Africa as he felt hopeless. \"I was distraught, out of my mind worrying about him but unable to do anything about it. I fell apart and cried uncontrollably,\" Steel says.\n\nLike other undercover officers, Dines was feigning a breakdown to end his deployment. He returned to work at Scotland Yard.\n\nIt took 18 years, but Steel managed to expose him as a police spy. From the state archives of births and deaths certificates, she discovered that he had been using the identity of a dead child. \"John Barker - the man I'd loved, the man I'd planned to spend the rest of my life with - didn't exist. He never had,\" she says.\n\nDines had let slip clues about his real family when he had told her that he had grown up in New Zealand. She used public archives in New Zealand and London to establish that he had been married, and on his marriage certificate he had declared that he was a police officer.\n\nUnknown to Steel, another woman had been going through a similar ordeal. Alison, a leftwing campaigner, had lived with a man she knew as Mark Cassidy for five years.\n\nAlison describes them as living together \"as man and wife\". \"We'd soon settled down into a life of domesticity, and I hadn't felt this happy for years ... We enjoyed our evenings watching TV or hanging out with friends.\"\n\nHe met her relatives at family gatherings. But she never met his family. He told a sad tale of bereavement and family dysfunction: a drunken driver had killed his father when he was eight, he did not get on with his mother. She once went to meet his grandfather but he happened to be away on a church outing.\n\nIn 2000, he told her that he was going to Germany after months of depression. It was a familiar tactic of the undercover officers as they sought to extricate themselves from their covert work. He too used another tactic of the undercover spies: sending her letters or postcards postmarked from abroad that were designed to deter her from coming looking for him.\n\nBut she soon suspected that he was an agent of the state. She hired a private detective who established that he had used a fictional identity.\n\nCassidy had also made a crucial mistake while living with her: he had a credit card in the name of M Jenner which she had found. Back then, he claimed that he had stupidly bought it off a bloke in a pub. But she remembered it and was able to establish that was his real name.\n\nAnother activist, Lisa Jones, had a six-year relationship with Mark Kennedy, who infiltrated environmental campaigners. She loved him \"totally, completely, more than anyone\".\n\n\"The person who knew me better than anybody else. I thought I knew him better than anyone else knew him,\" she says.\n\nBut by 2010 she had begun to suspect that he was not who he said he was.\n\nShe had known him as Mark Stone. But on a holiday in Italy, she made a chance discovery: in the glove box of their van, she came across his passport but in the unfamiliar name of Kennedy.\n\n\"The thing that made my stomach come into my mouth was seeing that he had a child. The character of Mark Stone wasn't one that would have had a child.\"\n\nMore detective work led her to confront him, compelling him to admit that he was an undercover officer .\n\nThe exposure of Kennedy triggered the spy cops scandal in 2011, leading in turn to revelations about the scale of the covert operations over the decades and the misconduct of the spies."

Frank Bennett reflects on the impact of discovering that a police spy had stolen his dead brother's identity to infiltrate two leftwing organisations, and to deceive a woman into a sexual relationship\n\nThe Undercover Police Scandal: Love and Lies Exposed is available now on ITVX\n\nThis episode first aired on 9 December 2020.\n\nIn 2018, Frank Bennett 's sister Honor received a hand-delivered letter from a public inquiry about their 18-year-old brother Michael Hartley, who had been reported missing at sea, believed dead, 50 years before. For a moment, they thought Michael had been found, but in fact, the letter revealed that their dead brother's identity had been stolen by a police officer who had penetrated two leftwing organisations. Using this false identity, the police spy had deceived a woman into a sexual relationship and had been prosecuted during his deployment. Frank talks to Anushka Asthana about his childhood and the impact his brother's death had on him and his family. Knowing that, years on, his brother's name had been used by police has had a huge impact on his mental health, he says. Frank describes the police's behaviour as \"disgusting\".\n\nAnushka also talks to Guardian investigative editor Paul Lewis and Guardian investigative reporter Rob Evans about their decade-long investigation with activists to uncover the activities of the Special Demonstration Squad (SDS) . Over four decades, at least 139 police officers were given fake identities to closely monitor the inner workings of more than 1,000 political groups . Some of those identities had been stolen from dead children to lend credibility to their aliases - and some officers, in a macabre ritual , even visited the graves of the children whose identities they were using.\n\nThe work of activists and the Guardian has resulted in a judge-led public inquiry on a statutory level with other significant inquiries, such as Lord Saville's investigation into Bloody Sunday and the Chilcot examination of the Iraq invasion .\n\nIf you have been affected by this podcast, the Samaritans are available for counselling on 116 123.\n\nArchive: Channel 4 News; BBC; YouTube; Independent; ITN"

      "text": "The Undercover Police Scandal: Love and Lies Exposed review - what sort of country would let the police do this?\n\nThis powerful telling of the shocking 'spy cops' story does what only TV can: shows you the astonishing women at its heart. You'll be engrossed for three hours\n\nW hat function does a television series have when the disgrace it covers is already in the public domain? The \"spy cops\" scandal has been the subject of extensive reporting, spearheaded by the Guardian . There is no need to demand a public inquiry, either: one is under way .\n\nYet ITV's three-part The Undercover Police Scandal: Love and Lies Exposed - produced with the Guardian and featuring its journalists Rob Evans and Paul Lewis - more than earns its place. Aside from television simply hitting a wider audience, the way it unfolds narratives using personal testimony has a power a written summary may not achieve. And, as the series uses the tricks, and some of the cliches, of the true-crime documentary to keep viewers happily engrossed for three hours, it gives us the time we need to sit with the story and absorb its importance. Because this injustice asks huge questions about Britain.\n\nOver several decades, peaking in the 1990s and 2000s, undercover police officers infiltrated local campaign groups using false identities. You might argue this is an outrage in itself, but the scheme went much further. More than 60 women are now known to have had sexual liaisons, often developing into long-term relationships, with men they thought were political allies. Some even had children with the impostors.\n\nWomen who fell victim to these conmen - virtually all the undercover officers were male, targeting female activists - appear on camera to tell their stories, although most are disguised with wigs and makeup or their names are changed. Lisa spent five happy years with her boyfriend before a glimpse of his passport suggested he was not who he said he was. When the partner of \"Alison\" suddenly left her, she remembered finding a debit card with an unfamiliar surname. Helen - which is her real name, because she is the activist Helen Steel, of McLibel fame - was similarly abandoned by the love of her life and wondered if the gaps in his family history might offer an explanation.\n\nIt is a tale with all the twists, coincidences and courage that the intrigue-hungry viewer would want, told using tested true-crime tradecraft. Genre thrills kick in as the women remember apparently idyllic courtships, followed by creeping doubts, then their transformations into dogged amateur detectives. By the time one of them involves the Guardian and a snowball starts rolling, they have each independently busted the cover of a different professional spy. Then the scandal goes national.\n\nThe real value of this series, though, is in seeing the faces of the victims and hearing their anguish, which brings new clarity to the depth of the harm done. In photographs and home movies, and in memories of the times their partners accompanied them to siblings' weddings and parents' death beds, we are privy to those moments, all irreplaceable, all now tainted.\n\nIt's not just the cruelty and professional misogyny that linger. That the women's experiences were eerily alike underlines that this was an elaborate and expensive state-sanctioned operation. That raises the question of what would drive our government to such extremes. We learn part of the answer when we are told that \"Alison\" was in a community group that supported the families of Black people killed in contact with the police - and that, as the home secretary, Theresa May was forced to commission an inquiry in 2014 when it emerged that the Stephen Lawrence justice campaign had been infiltrated and undermined .\n\nMany of the women were engaged in nothing more subversive than small-scale anti-fascist or environmental campaigns, yet were seen as nuts to be cracked with a sledgehammer. One valid response to this level of official chicanery is hopeless, reclusive terror; another is to be encouraged by how paranoid the spy cops scandal shows those in power to have been. In her interview, Steel reminds us that every significant right and privilege citizens enjoy today was won through protests that began at grassroots level.\n\n\"Alison\", recalling the day she deduced that her boyfriend was a cop, says: \"I felt like I had uncovered something you weren't supposed to uncover.\" Shocking and disgusting as the facts of the case are, this documentary is part of a preciously rare moment when we can lift that lid a little higher.\n\nThe Undercover Police Scandal: Love and Lies Exposed airs on ITV1 and is available on ITVX"

      "text": "How does the reality TV show Cops stack up with real-life crime figures?\n\nCreators of podcast Running from Cops watched 846 episodes and compared the numbers they found with national crime figures\n\nReality TV can fail to live up to its name, conveying a version of the world that is a sidestep from the truth. And Cops was a show that was crucial to the genre - it's not only the longest-running reality show in history, it's also one of the first.\n\nA new podcast, Running from Cops , explores how the TV show helped to shape the same criminal justice system that it depicted. Dan Taberski tracks down some of the people whose crimes and arrests were broadcast for all to see and uncovers how the show was made.\n\nWhile they were making the six-episode podcast, Dan and his producers created an enormous dataset about the show. They watched 846 episodes across 30 seasons of Cops and compared the numbers they found with national crime figures.\n\nI created these illustrations using the Running from Cops dataset, as well as 2016 ACS PUMS 1-year estimates from the Census Bureau, 2017 Bureau of Justice Statistics and 2017 FBI Uniform Crime Reports.\n\nIt can be difficult to make some of these comparisons (US crime data on arrested suspects does not separate white and Hispanic) but some trends still appear. You're more likely to find white police officers and white victims on Cops than you are in real life, and you're less likely to see white suspects being arrested on the show than you are in real life.\n\nCops also spent a disproportionate time showing drugs and violent crimes.\n\nYou can catch up with the series and listen to future episodes here ."

      "text": "Not Just \"Cops\": It's Time to End the Entertainment Industry's Anti-Black, Pro-Police Programming\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe culture industry has consolidated the power of corrupt policing. We need a root-and-branch transformation of entertainment itself.\n\nStill from TV series, \"Cops,\" 1989.\n\n\"Cops,\" the longest-running reality TV show in U.S. history, was recently canceled after more than 30 years on air. You'd be hard-pressed to find a TV viewer who couldn't sing along to the show's signature tune, \"Bad boys, bad boys, whatcha gonna do?\" Having been nominated for an Emmy four times, \"Cops\" even spawned a trail of ubiquitous knockoffs, including \"LAPD: Life on the Beat,\" \"Police POV,\" and \"Live PD.\"\n\nThe Paramount Network announced its decision to pull the plug on the seminal reality show after protests over George Floyd's death and police brutality. The cancellation is barely a first step, however. The entertainment industry has an insidious though unmistakable influence over how the public thinks about policing. It is necessary for people to understand how long and how thoroughly \"Cops\" and shows like it have habituated tens of millions of people to the police abuse of black, brown, and poor communities. Increasingly comfy in this sewer of misrepresentation, legions of viewers were numbed to the need for overdue reform.\n\nTo enjoy \"Cops\" is to relish seeing black, Latinx, and poor men harangued, choked, slammed, shot at, and handcuffed by police officers, with no meaningful context or resolution to any given human being's situation, whether it be mental illness, substance addiction, or wrongful accusation. Weekly footage exhilarated viewers through jerky bodycams capturing men of color getting snared and engrossed them with narrative idolatry lavished on white cops. All of this reflected and abetted structural flaws in law enforcement, as well as racial and class bias in the criminal justice system.\n\nHere lies a kind of gross misdemeanor. Defund the Police and Campaign Zero - two progressive, nonpartisan efforts to overhaul policing - have no parallel in entertainment. But the culture industry should be held accountable for helping consolidate the power of corrupt policing.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe popularity of \"Cops\" soared after its 1989 debut, alongside the documented evidence of its racism. A 2004 academic study in the Internet Journal of Criminology, for example, analyzed 16 episodes of \"Cops,\" examining the race and gender of the protagonists and antagonists, as well as each show's depiction of crime. The study found that black men were largely shown as criminal perpetrators - usually of violent crimes - and that Latino men also were typically depicted as violent criminals. The police officers appearing were overwhelmingly white, and the disproportionately few white offenders portrayed were often shown committing nonviolent offenses. Subsequent studies showed that \"Cops\" leads white viewers to believe that crime is more prevalent than it actually is; that black people commit more crime than they actually do; that the public is more likely to be victimized than they actually are; and that police \"intuitions\" and biases are better at helping to catch perpetrators than they actually are. As one of the most iconic reality shows in television history, \"Cops\" served for three decades as a shadow advertising campaign for racist and brutal policing.\n\nThis demonstrates why entertainment activism is just as necessary and worthwhile as policy activism. The culture industry, hand in glove with the state, has for decades mobilized to surveil, assault, and cage black and brown people. The country gorged itself on brutal, racially charged reality TV as it turned its eyes from mounting evidence of police brutality in real life. Yet entertainment activism is demonstrably different than police reform, because policing is presumably a public service supposedly accountable to democracy, whereas Hollywood is a business accountable mostly to the bottom line. How do people of color confront a capitalist enterprise that, like physical white spaces, is seething with our presence?\n\nChallenging the entertainment industry means making its leaders and general audiences aware of dangerous portrayals of policing that come at the expense of people of color. An ecosystem of artists, activists, and allied industry insiders - especially producers, directors, actors, agents, and writers - needs to be enlisted to push back against industry leaders as they make development and production decisions. This activist network would collaborate with producers and writers to offer script consultations and to advocate for fair and accurate content.\n\nAlso, this country needs to establish a rapid-response group to monitor film, television, music, streaming, and other media for their portrayals of anti-black policing. Enhancing the media-advocacy tactics innovated by Jewish and LGBTQ communities, this group would advocate for inclusive and humane portrayals of people of color being policed. When content runs that is pro-police brutality, classist, or anti-black, this new body would denounce the content strategically and loudly to audiences and to the industry, outlining why these harmful messages have no value in entertainment and how those messages damage actual communities and lives.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage Protests for Black Lives\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nAs well, advertisers contributing to this abusive entertainment should be identified and targeted for boycott. Companies should be encouraged to withdraw their ad dollars from shows that feature this content, not unlike the companies withdrawing their marketing buys from Tucker Carlson's show on Fox News . It's important to hold accountable both the advertiser and the entertainment vehicle.\n\nIn addition to these important reactive strategies, we can also proactively work to transform the cultural landscape to deliver impressive entertainment experiences that can catalyze mass audiences for social change. An example of how much can be accomplished in this regard is the film adaptation of Angie Thomas's bestselling book, \"The Hate U Give.\" Both feature the adventures of Starr Carter, a black 16-year-old girl who responds to police violence \"by any means necessary.\" The critically acclaimed film grossed $35 million against its $23 million budget.\n\nMany white people, judging from their massive turnout at protests, seem to finally understand that racist policing portrayed in so-called entertainment, rarely named as such, has its parallel in actual events. So many white politicians had scratched their heads in confusion, wondering whether all that amateur video of the Alton Sterlings and the Philando Castiles and the Eric Garners was really a thing. Weren't those black people overreacting, griping, in fact, about being targeted and killed by police? Later, the length and the graphic clarity and the poignancy of George Floyd gasping for his life under the knee of police officer Derek Chauvin was the footage that somehow convinced the white masses that really it is a thing. Many white people have now come to accept this footage, perhaps the more telling form of reality programming. Put bluntly, are white people recognizing their decades-long complicity in aggressive policing by way of amateur footage that is more urgent and more convincing than \"Cops\"?\n\nJudging from recent news coverage, you'd think that the police are an extraterrestrial organization descending on our cities. Outfitted in their camouflage, semiautomatic rifles, grenade launchers, night-vision sniper scopes, and tactical armored vehicles, the police appear like a science-fictive force with paranormal capacity to parachute into civil disobedience and inflict damage, like in a war zone.\n\nIn fact, the police are no such thing. They are a mundane reflection of society - of the constituencies they protect.\n\nThough de jure segregation, as codified by law, no longer exists, de facto segregation remains. Police enforce segregation. Police guard private property. Police normalize racial and economic divisions. Police perform those roles so that white and upper-income and property-owning Americans don't have to. Police serve, in effect, as a kind of communal border patrol. Once the George Floyd protests erupted, and paramilitarized police struck back against protesters and journalists with brute force, much of the public expressed shock and indignation. The communities historically policed this way - black, brown, low-income - harbored no such surprise. That is because the police's reaction to the protests was an escalated, better-equipped iteration of traditional policing, especially as witnessed in our living rooms through entertainment vehicles like \"Cops.\"\n\nAll those public policy reforms being considered at the local and federal levels - enhancing training, diversifying forces, implementing \"community policing,\" requiring body cams, and instituting accountability measures - might do only so much. Consumers of mass entertainment need to be shown a forward-looking reality different from the unreality they previously devoured. What is needed, to augment policing and law enforcement reform, is a root-and-branch transformation of entertainment itself.\n\nThis article was supported by the journalism nonprofit the Economic Hardship Reporting Project .\n\nWAIT!

Investigators later found that Cosgrove was one of three officers who fired their guns. While the Louisville police department ultimately fired Cosgrove for violating use-of-force procedures and not using his body camera, he eluded criminal charges and remains employable as a cop.\n\nThat's because he kept his police certification.\n\nHe's not the only one. Out of 54 officers involved in 14 high-profile killings that spurred Black Lives Matter protests in the last nine years, only 10 had their certifications or licenses revoked as a matter of disciplinary action, according to The Intercept's analysis of certification documents obtained through public records requests. (Three officers' disciplinary cases remain pending.) The Intercept's review begins in 2014 and runs through January of this year. For the first several years of the analysis, none of the officers whose records The Intercept reviewed faced a disciplinary hearing in front of a regulatory board with the power to revoke their license - a bar on being rehired as a cop in most states. That changed after Derek Chauvin murdered George Floyd in 2020. He and three other Minneapolis officers were stripped of their licenses for their involvement in the killing - a turning point in public outrage over police violence, and, perhaps, in formal efforts at accountability.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWhile experts have described the revocation of police licenses as a \" viable remedy \" for misconduct, it can be difficult to attain. In many states, a conviction is a prerequisite for decertification, a major obstacle given how rarely even the most notorious cops are criminally prosecuted. And the process varies wildly from state to state. In most cases, local police departments must initiate the process, which is often handled by a state board that oversees police standards and training. The state boards are often stacked with law enforcement administrators, in addition to some civilian appointees. Not all states have a process for decertification, and there is no parallel process for federal law enforcement personnel.\n\nThat makes it impossible to conduct a comprehensive national analysis. While limited, The Intercept's review of licensing records across 11 states demonstrates how underutilized this accountability mechanism is, even though it could go a long way in keeping violent cops off the streets.\n\n\"Decertification has to be easier if it's to work as an independent way to get police reform,\" said Raff Donelson, an associate professor at the Chicago-Kent College of Law, drawing a contrast to criminal prosecutions as an accountability mechanism.\n\n\"We have one set of rules for figuring out whether to take away your freedom,\" he said, and \"a different set of rules about whether you should do a job.\"\n\nIn theory, it should be easier to revoke a cop's license than to convict a cop of using excessive force, since decertification is a civil process with lower evidentiary standards, Donelson said. In practice, however, decertification is often dependent on a criminal conviction.\n\nPolice departments' discretion over initiating decertification processes is another reason the numbers are low, said Tracie L. Keesee, a former Denver police captain and co-founder of the Center for Policing Equity. \"That goes to tell you about systems, right?\" she said. \"It's not just about systems by themselves, but it's about who's in the systems that are doing the investigations and that are making the determinations.\"\n\nThe idea of creating state boards with the power to decertify officers emerged in the wake of abusive police practices during the Black-led rebellions of 1967, with many states passing laws to create such entities by 2001. Today, some state boards have rules that require automatic decertification: for example, if an officer is convicted of a felony. But state regulatory agencies are not required to report when an officer's license is revoked, making it possible for decertified cops to find jobs elsewhere in the country - or even the same state.\n\nIn New York, for example, dozens of officers who were decertified by the state were later rehired by police departments or public safety agencies, according to a 2021 investigation by The Intercept and New York Focus.\n\nThe International Association of Directors of Law Enforcement Standards and Training maintains a decertification database that state boards can theoretically reference when deciding whether to issue a license. But because participation is completely voluntary, it has no teeth.\n\nAccording to IADLEST, some 209 officers are decertified in the United States each month. That figure represents a range of on- and off-duty misconduct and is a tiny fraction of the nation's over 900,000 law enforcement agents. Randy Shrewsberry, a former police officer who is the executive director of the Institute for Criminal Justice Training Reform, said that there should be more decertifications and that the disparate standards are a pressing issue.\n\n\"What is the criteria for decertification?\" Shrewsberry said. Even if every state doesn't have a decertification board, \"having some understanding of 'this is what we all agree should be the things for which would decertify an officer'\" is what is needed.\n\nIn Louisiana, where the laws on decertification are generally weak, automatic decertification is limited to convictions of malfeasance in office or if an officer is stripped of the right to bear arms; it does not apply to most felony or misdemeanor convictions. An investigative series published this past April by the Times-Picayune found that in the last decade, a majority of cops who were convicted of serious crimes like murder and sexual assault kept their certifications.\n\nLouisiana law requires local departments to report officer arrests and convictions based on on-duty incidents, but because there are no penalties for ignoring the mandate, only a slight majority of cases were reported, the investigation found.\n\nEven when a disciplinary case makes it to a licensing board, action is not guaranteed. Arizona's Peace Officer Standards and Training Board, which both issues and revokes police certifications, took no action in roughly 32 percent of misconduct allegations that could've resulted in decertification from 2000 to 2011.\n\nSome officers who lose their jobs due to misconduct are able to be rehired elsewhere. These so-called wandering officers are more likely to be fired at their next job or receive a \"moral character violation\" than rookies or veterans who have never been fired, according to an academic study published in the Yale Law Journal in 2020 looking at the records of 98,000 officers across almost 500 Florida police departments over 30 years.\n\nAnd then there's the fact that many officers facing misconduct allegations preemptively resign to evade a disciplinary record, noted Thor Morrison, who worked for 20 years as an administrator in various agencies related to Kentucky's police standards and training. It's \"much too easy based on the structure to let people leave than it is to do the right thing and follow through with preferring charges or going through a formal disciplinary process,\" he said.\n\nBrett Hankison, another one of the officers who raided Taylor's apartment, previously worked at the police department in Lexington, Kentucky. When he resigned from that job in 2002, a supervisor said he \"would not recommend him for reemployment at any time in the future\" due to habitually violating orders, shirking supervision, and having an overall bad attitude. But Hankison kept his license and simply moved on to another job in Louisville.\n\nJust over 17 years later, Hankison was fired for shooting 10 bullets through Taylor's apartment window and a sliding glass door, which were covered with blinds and a curtain. He was criminally charged but was acquitted in state court and had the charges expunged from his record. While state records show that his certification is currently inactive, there is no disciplinary bar on him seeking a job as a police officer in the future.\n\nFormer Louisville police officer Brett Hankison is cross-examined in Louisville, Ky., on March 2, 2022.\n\nIn addition to Taylor, The Intercept reviewed the records of officers involved in the deaths of Tyre Nichols in Memphis, Tennessee; Daunte Wright in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota; Floyd in Minneapolis; Stephon Clark in Sacramento, California; Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota; Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Jamar Clark in Minneapolis; Sandra Bland in Hempstead, Texas; Freddie Gray in Baltimore; Walter Scott in North Charleston, South Carolina; Tamir Rice in Cleveland; Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri; and Eric Garner in Staten Island, New York.\n\nOne of the officers who raided Taylor's home lost her license through a regulatory process, as did the four cops involved in Floyd's arrest and death, the officer who fatally shot Wright, and four of the officers who beat up Nichols, fatally injuring him. (One officer, the Texas state trooper who arrested Bland, lost his license not because of a regulatory process, but because he agreed to give it up as part of a perjury case.)\n\nTaken as a whole, the cases illustrate how often it is that officers who engage in excessive, deadly force remain employable in the profession. But the specifics of several of the cases also highlight the deadly consequences of regulatory agencies' failure to take definitive action against even the officers who are deemed by their own departments unfit to work.\n\nTake Darren Wilson, who killed Brown in August 2014. Three years earlier, Wilson lost his job as a cop in nearby Jennings, Missouri, after the city council disbanded the entire department due to corruption and complaints of racial discrimination by white officers policing the 89 percent Black populace. \"Wilson was let go of one police department, and he slithered his way into Ferguson,\" Brown's mother Lezley McSpadden-Head told The Intercept. (Wilson was never indicted for killing Brown, and his police license later expired, according to the Missouri Department of Public Safety.)\n\nTimothy Loehmann, the Cleveland police officer who shot 12-year-old Rice in November 2014, got a job last year in Tioga, Pennsylvania, a roughly 700-person township. Because Loehmann kept his license in Ohio, subject to the state's training requirements, he did not have to apply for a new license in Pennsylvania, which accepts police officer transfers from all states. Kelly May, a spokesperson for the Ohio attorney general's office, wrote in an email in March that Loehmann's license \"was not revoked as he was not convicted of anything that we were made aware of.\"\n\nSubodh Chandra, a lawyer who represents the Rice family, told The Intercept that either the decertification boards are not seeking information of excessive force cases or they are not interested in it when they receive it. \"And that is cause for concern,\" he said. \"What they are doing is leaving officers to commit excessive force in the wild, to inflict their danger upon the rest of us.\"\n\nMichael Slager, who stopped Scott for a broken brake light in 2015 and fatally shot him in the back as he ran away, was subsequently fired by his police department. In South Carolina, cops lose their certification when they leave a job at a police station, whether voluntarily or after being fired. After he was fired for an allegation of misconduct, the state board wrote to him to remind him of this fact - but left the door open for him to reactivate his license. In a cordially worded letter, obtained by The Intercept, the board wrote, \"[S]ince allegations of misconduct have been made against you, once you find employment with another law enforcement agency you must undergo a contested case hearing to determine if you can be reissued law enforcement certification.\"\n\nMore than two years after receiving that warning, Slager pleaded guilty to depriving Scott of his rights and was sentenced to 20 years in prison. Under South Carolina law, the conviction disqualifies him from working as a police officer.\n\nPeople gather to protest against the police assault of Tyre Nichols, in Times Square in New York City on Jan. 28, 2023.\n\nThe last few years have seen some progress on the use of decertification as an accountability mechanism.\n\nBack in 2016, over 25 percent of the nation's officers worked in six states that didn't have bodies with decertification powers, according to the late Saint Louis University law professor emeritus Roger L. Goldman. Prompted by the 2020 uprisings, three of those states - California, New Jersey, and Massachusetts - created processes for decertification in the last two and a half years.\n\nMeanwhile, in the cases reviewed by The Intercept, none of the 27 officers involved in 10 pre-2020 killings lost their licenses through a disciplinary process. Another 27 officers were involved in the four killings that took place since 2020. Ten of them were decertified, 10 retained their licenses, and no information was released about the final seven. The number of decertifications could increase, as disciplinary cases are still pending for three of the Memphis police officers involved in Nichols's death. (Of the 10 officers who were decertified, four are white, four are Black, and two are Asian.)\n\nSome experts like Donelson say that more can be done. \"One can imagine being really creative about how we create the enforcement mechanisms,\" Donelson said. One way could be to harness \"qui tam\" actions - a provision of anti-fraud law that allows private citizens to sue on behalf of the U.S. government to spur the government to take up a case - to initiate more license revocation processes.\n\nAnother idea, included in President Barack Obama's Task Force on 21 st Century Policing's final report in 2015, is for the Department of Justice to partner with IADLEST and expand its database of officers who've had their licenses revoked for misconduct with standardized reporting requirements so that those officers cannot easily be hired elsewhere.\n\nOthers, meanwhile, say the entire decertification process should be taken out of the hands of police.\n\n\"I would definitely like to see more accountability taken when it comes to these situations like my son's,\" said McSpadden-Head. That means electing ordinary people to positions with decertification powers rather than \"the police policing the police.\"\n\nThis story was supported by a 2023 Charles M.

      "text": "As Cops Scrambled at Trump Rally Shooting, Operators Assured 911 Callers Police Were in Control\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nButler County finally released 911 recordings of the chaotic aftermath of the Trump rally shooting after a lawsuit filed by The Intercept.\n\nOn Wednesday, more than three months after the apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, Pennsylvania county officials finally released 911 recordings from the July 13 rally. The Intercept filed a lawsuit in September for the recordings, which Butler County refused to provide without a court order.\n\nThe calls began flooding the Butler County emergency services one minute after shots rang out at the Butler Farm Show grounds, the recordings show. Callers expressed fear, terror, and confusion in the chaotic aftermath. Relatives of attendees called the emergency lines in alarm, afraid for their loved ones.\n\nDespite police and Secret Service agents having identified the shooter as a suspicious person at least 25 minutes prior to the shooting, 911 operators assured worried callers that law enforcement was aware of and handling the situation.\n\n\"Gunshot at the Trump rally,\" a woman told the Butler County 911 operator on one of 15 audio files of 911 calls released to The Intercept. The operator told the caller police were on their way. \"Better get here quick,\" they said. In another call, the operator told a different caller that the situation was being handled.\n\nButler County redacted callers' names and phone numbers from the recordings.\n\nPeople can be heard screaming in the background of several calls, adding to the sense of chaos that unfolded that day as attendees waited for police to respond to the shooting. \"We are at the Trump assembly and there's a guy shooting. He's been shooting up the place,\" one woman told the 911 operator on another call. The operator told her the police were aware of the shooting and were taking care of the situation. \"No one's injured, but I'm scared,\" she said.\n\nIn another call, a woman who said her husband was shot at the rally can be heard trying to figure out which hospital he was taken to for treatment. \"I called Butler hospital, he's not there. They told me to call 911,\" the woman said. The operator told her he could not get any information at that time but would call her back when they could.\n\nCorey Comperatore, a 50-year-old firefighter, was shot and killed at the rally. Two other people were injured : 57-year-old David Dutch and 74-year-old James Copenhaver.\n\nAnother woman called 911 asking about her mother, who was in attendance at the rally. The operator assured her police were handling the shooting. \"What am I supposed to do?\" she asked. The operator said police would start getting people out of the vicinity of the shooting.\n\n\"They just tried to kill President Trump,\" said a man who called for a paramedic to assist a woman who fainted after law enforcement started evacuating the grounds. \"You might want to make a note of that.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nSoon after the shooting, The Intercept submitted a request under Pennsylvania's Right-to-Know Law for copies of recorded 911 calls during the rally. Multiple outlets requested the same materials, including reporters from Scripps News and NBC News, who also filed lawsuits against the county alongside The Intercept.\n\nButler County denied all three outlets' requests on identical grounds, citing part of the public records statute that generally exempts 911 recordings from disclosure. The county argued that releasing the 911 calls might jeopardize law enforcement investigations, but it ignored another crucial provision that allows officials to release recordings if \"the public interest in disclosure outweighs the interest in nondisclosure.\"\n\nBy contrast, police from Butler Township released body camera footage showing their frantic real-time response to the shooter from multiple perspectives. Video footage showed police blaming the Secret Service for failing to secure the building on which the shooter was found. One sergeant is heard making calls to family members at the rally to make sure they got out safely.\n\nIn August, the state Office of Open Records found there was \"a compelling argument concerning the heightened public interest\" in the 911 tapes but deferred to Butler County's decision to withhold them.\n\nIn a consent order issued Wednesday, Judge Kelley T. D. Streib of the Butler County Court of Common Pleas wrote that the balancing test under Pennsylvania law favored releasing the recordings given \"the unique, historical circumstances.\"\n\n\"The release of public records should be a top priority of government, not a reluctant one that happens only after the threat of litigation,\" said David Bralow, The Intercept's general counsel. \"On a personal level, I am saddened when non-profit news organizations have to endure the delay and expense that arises from the government's reluctance to provide what is obviously public information.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "The Looming Fight to Make Local Cops Part of Trump's Deportation Machine\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nArizona voted to grant state and local police the authority to make immigration arrests, going against Supreme Court precedent.\n\nAs Donald Trump sweeps back into power with a promise to launch the \"largest deportation operation in American history,\" Arizona voted to expand the immigration enforcement machinery at his disposal. By a wide margin, voters approved a ballot measure to grant state and local police the authority to arrest undocumented immigrants for crossing the border.\n\nUnder current U.S. Supreme Court precedent, only federal agents can enforce immigration laws. But by adopting Proposition 314, Arizona joins Texas and other states in trying to challenge this constitutional limitation. So far, the Biden administration and immigration advocacy groups have blocked these laws in court, and one such challenge is currently awaiting a ruling from a federal appeals court.\n\n\"It would take a sea change in constitutional interpretation for the Supreme Court to permit this,\" said Lynn Marcus, director of the University of Arizona's immigration law clinic, of Prop 314 and similar laws. \"Because of the constitutional provisions it butts up against, I don't see foresee the law ever taking effect.\"\n\nBut Trump has repeatedly said he wants to deputize local police for his plans, and his Justice Department is unlikely to keep standing in the way of states that want their cops to pitch in.\n\nImmigration rights groups have vowed to fight Prop 314 and similar laws in court, even if the Trump DOJ changes course and urges judges to uphold them. It's shaping up to be one of the earliest legal battles around Trump's vow to deport millions of people , and possibly the first to reach the Supreme Court during his second administration.\n\nArizona still has not been called for the presidential race, although it seems Trump will likely take the state after narrowly losing there in 2020. But Prop 314 was quickly called, with more than 60 percent of voters favoring it so far.\n\n\"The passage of Prop. 314 will divide Arizona families, and it will pit Arizona neighbors against each other,\" said Reyna Montoya, founder of Aliento, a Phoenix-based group that serves undocumented and mixed-status families, in a statement on Wednesday.\n\nProp 314 reached Arizona voters after the Republican-controlled state legislature passed a similar bill earlier this year, which Gov. Katie Hobbs, a Democrat, vetoed . \"This bill presents significant constitutional concerns and would be certain to mire the State in costly and protracted litigation,\" Hobbs wrote in her veto letter in March.\n\nLegislators repackaged the bill as a ballot measure, which cannot be vetoed. On top of making unauthorized border crossings a state crime subject to arrest, Prop 314 also authorizes state judges to order deportations, requires agencies to verify immigration status for enrollment in public benefit programs, and makes it a felony to sell fentanyl that results in death.\n\n\"Proposition 314 will not fix the flaws in our immigration system, nor 'secure the border' in the way its proponents have represented,\" said Noah Schramm, border policy strategist for the ACLU of Arizona, in a statement on Thursday. \"What it will do - if the courts ever allow it to stand - is break families apart, exacerbate racial profiling, and increase criminalization of immigrants and communities of color.\"\n\nOpponents of Prop 314 critiqued the hodgepodge measure as a resurrection of the infamous Senate Bill 1070, Arizona's \" show me your papers \" law that was passed in 2010 and partially struck down by the Supreme Court in 2012.\n\nIn Arizona v. United States , the court ruled that federal immigration laws generally preempt states from further criminalizing undocumented status and unauthorized entry. The 5-3 decision struck down three parts of S.B. 1070, including the provision that authorized police to arrest people suspected of being in the country illegally. Two of the current right-wing justices, Samuel Alito and Clarence Thomas, dissented.\n\nBefore being struck down, Arizona's S.B. 1070 set off a wave of copycat laws in other states. This time, for Prop 314, Arizona Republicans borrowed from their colleagues in Texas, specifically from Texas's Senate Bill 4 , which was signed into law in December 2023. Other states have passed their own copycat versions of S.B. 4, including in Iowa and Oklahoma.\n\n\"These policies erode the trust built between law enforcement and local communities,\" said Victoria Francis, deputy director of state and local initiatives at the American Immigration Council. \"They create a climate of fear surrounding interactions with law enforcement, a concern voiced by law enforcement leaders themselves.\" Read Our Complete Coverage The War on Immigrants\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nSoon after S.B. 4 passed, the Biden Justice Department and immigrant rights organizations quickly challenged it in multiple lawsuits.\n\n\"Texas cannot disregard the United States Constitution and settled Supreme Court precedent,\" the Justice Department said in a statement in January. The DOJ has also filed lawsuits against the copycat laws in Oklahoma and Iowa, which are both currently blocked.\n\nArizona legislators included a trigger provision in Prop 314 that ties its fate to S.B. 4, which is the furthest along in legal challenges: Prop 314 will go into effect only after its Texan counterpart has been in effect for at least 60 days.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nS.B. 4 has already briefly reached the Supreme Court, which in March declined to block the law while lower courts consider its legality. The Texas law is currently on hold by order of the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard arguments in April and could issue a decision any day. After that, S.B. 4 will almost certainly make its way back up to the Supreme Court.\n\nThe Texas attorney general's office argues S.B. 4 was written to comply with Supreme Court precedent, while a coalition of Republican attorneys general proposed in an amicus brief that Arizona v. United States \"is ripe for overruling,\" pointing to Alito's and Thomas's dissents.\n\nGiven Trump's eagerness to rev up deportations, his Justice Department may simply bow out of the lawsuits in Texas, Iowa, and Oklahoma, leaving the fight to the immigrant advocacy groups. At the Supreme Court, the Trump administration itself might call for overruling precedent that blocks local cops from being deportation agents too.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Cops in Riot Gear Storm Penn Students' House in Month-Old Vandalism Case\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe students said police trained guns on them and refused to provide their names or badge numbers.\n\nLast Friday, 13 police officers gathered in the early morning hours outside an off-campus residential building in West Philadelphia. It was the home of several University of Pennsylvania students.\n\nDonning their full tactical gear, including riot helmets, and armed with assault rifles and handguns, the police threatened to break down the door with a battering ram and pointed a gun at a neighbor before storming the residence.\n\nThe sound of police coming up the stairs woke the students up. As they stepped out of their rooms, police trained guns on them, according to one student present during the raid who spoke to The Intercept on the condition of anonymity for fear of their personal safety.\n\nPolice identified themselves as 12 officers from the University of Pennsylvania Police Department and one from the Philadelphia Police Department, the student said, but refused to provide names, badge numbers, or a warrant. Police seized another student's personal device and took the student in for questioning. They were released later that morning with no charges or arrests made.\n\nIn the course of questioning, the student was provided with a copy of the warrant for suspicion of vandalism , according to the first student who spoke to The Intercept. The warrant related to an incident in September where red paint was thrown on the Benjamin Franklin statue on campus.\n\nAt the time, Penn's public safety department received a report of an incident and responded. Student activists posted on Instagram that \"an autonomous group\" was responsible.\n\n\"I'm pretty concerned that the university is using extreme tactics to try and suppress student movements. It's been pretty consistent this entire year,\" said state Rep. Rick Krajewski, a Democrat who represents West Philadelphia. \"A legal warrant is one thing, but the amount of force used for that warrant against young students is extremely alarming.\"\n\nHe said, \"At the end of the day 12 cops showed up with tactical gear and rifles against kids in a quiet neighborhood. It's hard for me to believe that was justified, legal or not.\"\n\n\"The raid on Friday was a clear act of institutional and state-sponsored terror,\" the student who was present for the raid told The Intercept. \"It comes a year after Penn disciplining students, suspending them, sending 300 riot cops to arrest and brutalize us multiple times over, throwing their own students and community members in jail. This is just another outrageous mark in their timeline of escalation.\"\n\nThe way police handled the raid was jarring, said Radhika Sainath, senior staff attorney at Palestine Legal. \"The disproportionate use of force over a suspected vandalism incident that occurred over a month ago quite honestly shocks the conscience.\"\n\nSince the surge of encampments protesting the war on Gaza across the country this spring, Penn has cracked down on Palestine solidarity activism with increasing force.\n\nThe Ivy League school was in the spotlight last winter after university president Liz Magill caved to pressure from pro-Israel donors and resigned after testifying before Congress. In the wake of the hearing, Penn Board of Trustees Chair Scott Bok also resigned, along with Harvard University President Claudine Gay.\n\nMonths later, in the spring, Penn called Philadelphia police in to clear the Gaza encampment in the spring.\n\nMiguel Torres, a spokesperson for the Philadelphia Police Department, directed questions to Penn and the Philadelphia district attorney. University spokesperson Ron Ozio did not respond to a request for comment. In a statement, Penn's Division of Public Safety confirmed the raid but said they do not comment on open criminal investigations. The statement said the warrant was revised by the DA's office, approved by a bail commissioner, and executed following proper policies and procedures.\n\nPhiladelphia district attorney spokesperson Dustin Slaughter confirmed that the DA approved the warrant for the search based on information provided by Penn police. Asked about student reports that the warrant cited suspicion of vandalism, Slaughter said he could not discuss specifics.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.

The raid on Friday was part of an increasing militarization of campus and city police that targets both activism for Palestine and the city's Black and brown residents.\n\n\"The Penn police and the PPD have long been a repressive force in West Philly,\" the student said. \"Police violence in Philly is far too present. You go through something like this and can't help but be reminded of the PPD bombing an entire block in 1985\" - referring to the police attack against the radicals of the MOVE commune in West Philadelphia.\n\nRead our complete coverage\n\nPenn has shown stark imbalances in how it's responded to activism for Palestine and activism for other causes, the student said. \"It's no surprise that Penn police are trained by the Israeli occupation forces, sponsoring trips to Israel for training and participating in counterterrorism seminars. It's also no surprise that Penn is funding this genocide and terrorizing their own students,\" they said.\n\nThe raid was unprecedented in Penn history, said Huda Fakhreddine, an associate professor of Arabic literature and member of Penn Faculty for Justice in Palestine who organized a Palestine literature festival at Penn that became the subject of attack from university donors last September.\n\n\"As some of us watch with horror the destruction of our homelands and the extermination and displacement of our families in Palestine and Lebanon, UPenn resorts to obscene intimidation tactics to silence anti-genocide speech, going as far as unleashing an armed police force on students in their residence,\" she said.\n\n\"Not only is the university obstructing students' and faculty's ability to teach, learn, and exchange ideas,\" she added, \"it is also criminalizing grief, shamefully clamping down on students, accusing them of trespassing in their own campus, and threatening them with arrest when they mourn the hundreds of thousands of lives destroyed by Israel's genocide in Palestine and now Lebanon.\"\n\nThe aim of the raid was to isolate students and chill further activism in support of Palestine, the student said.\n\n\"One of Penn's tactics is to isolate students,\" they said. \"I don't think they understand anything about how strong and how broad this movement is.\"\n\nRetaliation of this sort is a sign that powerbrokers are afraid of the growing international movement organizing against genocide.\n\n\"If you're shocked by this happening to students in the West, then think about the campaign of violence and terror that the West has been imposing on Palestine for decades,\" they said. \"They've only made all of this more visible.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Why Big Tech, Cops, and Spies Were Made for One Another\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe American surveillance state is a public-private partnership.\n\nCory Doctorow's latest book is \" The Internet Con: How to Seize the Means of Computation . \"\n\nThe techlash has finally reached the courts. Amazon's in court. Google's in court. Apple's under EU investigation. The French authorities just kicked down Nvidia's doors and went through their files looking for evidence of crimes against competition. People are pissed at tech: about moderation, about monopolization, about price gouging, about labor abuses, and - everywhere and always - about privacy.\n\nFrom experience, I can tell you that Silicon Valley techies are pretty sanguine about commercial surveillance: \"Why should I care if Google wants to show me better ads?\" But they are much less cool about government spying: \"The NSA? Those are the losers who weren't smart enough to get an interview at Google.\"\n\nAnd likewise from experience, I can tell you that government employees and contractors are pretty cool with state surveillance: \"Why would I worry about the NSA spying on me? I already gave the Office of Personnel Management a comprehensive dossier of all possible kompromat in my past when I got my security clearance.\" But they are far less cool with commercial surveillance: \"Google? Those creeps would sell their mothers for a nickel. To the Chinese .\"\n\nWhat are they both missing? That American surveillance is a public-private partnership: a symbiosis between a concentrated tech sector that has the means, motive, and opportunity to spy on every person in the world and a state that loves surveillance as much as it hates checks and balances.\n\nBig Tech, cops, and surveillance agencies were made for one another.\n\nAmerica has a privacy law deficit. While U.S. trading rivals like the EU and even China have enacted muscular privacy laws in response to digital commercial surveillance, the U.S. has slept through a quarter-century of increasing corporate spying without any federal legislative action.\n\nIt's really something. America has stronger laws protecting you from video store clerks who gossip about your porn rentals than we do protecting you from digital spies who nonconsensually follow you into an abortion clinic and then sell the data .\n\nIn place of democratically accountable privacy laws, we have the imperial fiat of giant tech companies. Apple unilaterally decided that in-app surveillance should be limited to instances in which users explicitly opted in. Unsurprisingly, more than 96 percent of iOS users did not opt into surveillance (presumably the remaining 4 percent were either confused, or Facebook employees, or both ).\n\nWhen Apple finally allowed its users to block Facebook surveillance, they cut off a torrent of valuable data that Facebook had nonconsensually acquired from Apple device owners, without those owners' permission. But - crucially - it was Apple that decided when consent was and wasn't needed to spy on it customers. After 96 percent of iOS device owners opted out of Facebook spying, Apple continued to spy on those users, in precisely the same way that Facebook had, without telling them, and when they were caught doing it, they lied about it .\n\nWhich raises a question: Why don't Apple customers simply block Apple's surveillance? Why don't they install software that prevents their devices from ratting them out to Apple? Because that would be illegal. Very, very illegal.\n\nOne in four web users has installed an ad blocker (which also blocks commercial surveillance). It's the \" biggest boycott in world history .\" The reason you can modify your browser to ignore demands from servers to fetch ads - and reveal facts about you in the process - is that the web is an \"open platform.\" All the major browsers have robust interfaces for aftermarket blockers to plug into, and they're also all open source, meaning that if a browser vendor restricts those interfaces to make it harder to block ads , other companies can \" fork the code \" to bypass those restrictions.\n\nBy contrast, apps are encrypted, which triggers a quarter-century-old law: the Digital Millennium Copyright Act of 1998, whose Section 1201 makes it a felony to provide someone with a tool to bypass an \"access control\" for a copyrighted work. By encrypting apps and locking the keys away from the device owner, Apple can make it a crime for you to reconfigure your own phone to protect your privacy, with penalties of a five-year prison sentence and a $500,000 fine - for a first offense.\n\nAn app is best understood as \"a webpage wrapped in just enough IP to make it a crime to install an ad blocker\" (or anything else the app's shareholders disapprove of).\n\nDMCA 1201 is only one of a slew of laws that restrict the ability of technology users to modify the tools they own and use to favor their interests over manufacturers': laws governing cybersecurity , trademarks , patents , contracts , and other legal constructs can be woven together to block the normal activities that the tech giants themselves once pursued .\n\nYes, there was a time when tech companies waged guerrilla warfare upon one another: reverse-engineering, scraping, and hacking each others' products so that disgruntled users could switch from one service to another without incurring steep switching costs. For example, Facebook offered departing MySpace users a \"bot\" that would impersonate them to MySpace, scrape their inboxes, and import the messages to Facebook so users could maintain contact with friends they'd left behind on the older platform.\n\nThat all changed as tech consolidated, shrinking the internet to what software developer Tom Eastman calls \" five giant websites, filled with screenshots of text from the other four .\" This consolidation was not unique to tech. The 40-year drawdown of antitrust has led to mass consolidation across nearly every sector of the global economy, from bottle caps to banking . Tech companies merged, gobbled up hundreds of small startups, and burned billions of investor dollars offering products and services below cost, making it impossible for anyone else to get a foothold.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nTech was the first industry born in the post-antitrust age. The Apple ][+ hit shelves the same year Ronald Reagan hit the campaign trail. When tech hit its first inter-industry squabble, jousting with the much more mature and concentrated entertainment industry during the Napster wars of the early 2000s, it was trounced, losing every court, regulatory, and legislative fight.\n\nBy all rights, tech should have won those fights. After all, the tech sector in the go-go early internet years was massive , an order of magnitude larger than the entertainment companies challenging them in the halls of power. But Big Content was well-established, having boiled itself down to seven or so companies (depending on how you count), while tech was still a rabble of hundreds of small and medium-sized companies that couldn't agree on its legislative priorities. Tech couldn't even agree on the catering for a meeting where these priorities might be debated. Concentrated sectors find it comparatively easy to come to agreements, including agreements about what to tell Congress and federal judges. And since those concentrated sectors also find it easy to agree on whose turf belongs to whom, they are able to avoid the \"wasteful competition\" that erodes their profit margins, leaving them with vast war chests with which to pursue their legislative agenda.\n\nAs tech consolidated, it began to feel its oats. Narrow interpretations of existing laws were broadened. New, absurd gambits were invented and then accepted by authorities with straight faces .\n\nJust as important as the new laws that tech got for itself were the laws they kept at bay. Labor laws were treated as nonexistent, provided that your boss was an app . Consumer protection laws were likewise jettisoned .\n\nAnd, of course, the U.S. never passed a federal privacy law, and the EU struggled to enforce its privacy law .\n\nSlide showing companies participating in the Prism program and the types of data they provide.\n\nConcentrated sectors of large, highly profitable firms inevitably seek to fuse their power with that of the state, securing from the government forbearance for their own actions and prohibitions on the activities they disfavor. When it comes to surveillance, the tech sector has powerful allies in government: cops and spies.\n\nIt goes without saying that cops and spies love commercial surveillance. The very first Snowden revelation concerned a public-private surveillance partnership called Prism , in which the NSA plundered large internet companies' data with their knowledge and cooperation. The subsequent revelation about the \"Upstream\" program revealed that the NSA was also plundering tech giants' data without their knowledge , and using Prism as a \"plausible deniability\" fig leaf so that the tech firms didn't get suspicious when the NSA acted on its stolen intelligence.\n\nNo government agency could ever hope to match the efficiency and scale of commercial surveillance. The NSA couldn't order us to carry pocket location beacons at all times - hell, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention couldn't even get us to run an exposure notification app in the early days of the Covid pandemic. No government agency could order us to put all our conversations in writing to be captured, stored, and mined. And not even the U.S. government could afford to run the data centers and software development to store and make sense of it all.\n\nMeanwhile, the private sector relies on cops and spies to go to bat for them, lobbying against new privacy laws and for lax enforcement of existing ones. Think of Amazon's Ring cameras, which have blanketed entire neighborhoods in CCTV surveillance, which Ring shares with law enforcement agencies, sometimes without the consent or knowledge of the cameras' owners . Ring marketing recruits cops as street teams, showering them with freebies to distribute to local homeowners.\n\nAnd when local activists and town councils ponder limitations on this kind of commercial surveillance , the cops go to bat for Ring, insisting that every citizen should have the inalienable right to contribute to an off-the-books video surveillance grid that the cops can access at will .\n\nGoogle, for its part, has managed to play both sides of the culture war with its location surveillance, thanks to the \"reverse warrants\" that cops have used to identify all the participants at both Black Lives Matter protests and the January 6 coup.\n\nDistinguishing between state and private surveillance is a fool's errand. Cops and spies need the surveillance industry, and the surveillance industry needs cops and spies. Since the days of the East India Company, monopolists have understood the importance of recruiting powerful state actors to go to bat for commercial interests.\n\nAT&T - the central node in the Snowden revelation s - has been playing this game for a century , foiling regulators attempts to break up its monopoly for 69 years before the Department of Justice finally eked out a win in 1982 (whereupon antitrust was promptly neutered, allowing the \"Baby Bells\" to merge into new monopolies like Verizon).\n\nIn the 1950s, AT&T came within a whisker of being broken up, but the Pentagon stepped up to defend Ma Bell, telling the Justice Department that America would lose the Korean War if they didn't have an intact AT&T to supply and operate their high-tech backend. America lost the Korean War, but AT&T won: It got a 30-year reprieve.\n\nStumping for his eponymous antitrust law in 1890, Sen. John Sherman thundered, \"If we will not endure a King as a political power we should not endure a King over the production, transportation, and sale of the necessaries of life. If we would not submit to an emperor we should not submit to an autocrat of trade .\"\n\nToday, as our snoopy tech firms hide in the skirts of our spies and law enforcement agencies, we have to get beyond the idea that this is surveillance capitalism . Truly, it's more akin to surveillance mercantilism : a fusion of state and commercial power.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "There Are So Many Armed Cops on Subways That Now They're Shooting Each Other\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA police shooting that injured three people and one officer is the result of New York Mayor Eric Adams's enforcement-first mentality.\n\nIn a Brooklyn subway station on Sunday afternoon, police shot and injured three people and a fellow New York Police Department officer over a $2.90 fare. This is what safety and security looks like in Mayor Eric Adams's New York, where problems of poverty and hardship are met with policing and state-sanctioned violence.\n\nAt around 3 p.m. Sunday, at the Sutter Avenue stop in Brownsville, Brooklyn, a 37-year-old man allegedly evaded paying the subway fare. According to reports, two police officers pursued this man up three flights of stairs and confronted him on the station platform. Police say the man pulled out a knife. Both officers opened fire on the man, piercing him with several bullets, while also striking two bystanders; one of the officers was hit with friendly fire. One of the bystanders, a 49-year-old man, is in critical condition in the hospital from a bullet wound to the head.\n\nThis is what happens when you flood a major transit system with a government-sanctioned, taxpayer-funded armed gang coated with official impunity and prone to violent escalation.\n\nSunday's police shooting should be a lesson in why the subway should not be teeming with cops, responding to \"crimes\" of poverty - like fare evasion and panhandling - with deadly force. Unsurprisingly, the Adams administration has framed the incident within its ongoing, mendacious narrative about rampant subway crime, for which more policing is the only answer .\n\n\"Earlier today, one of our officers was shot while protecting our subway system,\" Adams, a former cop surrounded by intensifying corruption scandals , wrote on X. \"I am relieved to report he is in good condition now, and we have arrested the suspect who put so many lives in danger. I cannot thank these officers enough for their bravery.\"\n\nA community note was added to the post by readers, noting, \"The officer in question was shot by a fellow NYPD officer. NYPD officers also shot 2 bystanders and the fare evasion suspect\" and linking to a New York Times report on the shooting.\n\nUnder the cop logic to which Adams adheres, however, there is no circumstance which could fail to affirm the necessity of excessive policing. Even an egregious display of violent escalation and incompetence is, for Adams, grounds to celebrate police \"bravery.\" The idea that it was the alleged fare evader who \"put so many so lives in danger\" would be laughable, were the consequences of such police-thinking not so grave.\n\nUnder Adams, the number of police stops and confrontations has surged. Despite the thorough debunking of so-called broken windows policing when it comes to improving public safety, the NYPD has recommitted to the work of harassing poor and unhoused New Yorkers, especially New Yorkers of color. The NYPD recorded more stops of New Yorkers in 2023 than it has in nearly a decade, and 89 percent of those who were stopped are Black and Latine.\n\n\"Adams has touted increased stop activity as a key ingredient to driving down crime, but that argument has been thoroughly disproven. As recorded stops fell 93 percent between 2011 and 2014, murders and shootings plummeted , and other serious crimes dropped significantly as well,\" wrote Simon McCormack and Melissa Avilez Lopez of the New York Civil Liberties Union earlier this year.\n\nThey noted that, while there's no positive correlation between public safety and increased police encounters, \"there is reason to believe that increased stop activity leads to more police misconduct. Complaints of NYPD officer abuse have skyrocketed under Adams as stops have spiked.\"\n\nA staggering 93 percent of riders arrested for subway fare evasion were Black or Latine. Police have arrested 1,700 people for fare evasion and ticketed another 28,000 people so far this year. The city's argument, of course, is that fare evasion deprives the New York City transit system of necessary funds. According to Metropolitan Transit Authority and City Council records , the total lost to fare evasion amounted to 14 percent of the MTA's potential pool of revenue and nearly 4 percent of its operating budget - an estimated $690 million in lost revenue. It's not an insignificant figure, but nothing about the budget problem requires hundreds of armed cops as a solution.\n\nOvertime pay for police in the subways skyrocketed from $4 million in 2022 to $155 million in 2023 - from an economic standpoint alone, this hardly seems a prudent use of resources. Meanwhile, NYPD misconduct settlements have cost the city more than $500 million over the past six years, including nearly $115 million in 2023.\n\nGreater desperation is met with more policing, producing greater desperation still.\n\nThirty percent of low-income New Yorkers reported that they often struggled to pay subway or bus fares, according to a Community Service Society study. The need to expand and make more accessible the already existing half-price Fair Fares program - which only a third of eligible New Yorkers currently use - should be a priority. Funneling more money into police coffers while cutting budgets for social services only serves to prove a circular logic, in which greater desperation is met with more policing, producing greater desperation still - and thus providing further grounds for right-wing calls for even more policing.\n\n\"The NYPD spent $150 Million *extra* last year to catch people who weren't able to afford to pay the subway fare. They owed just $104,000,\" wrote civil rights attorney Scott Hechinger on X, referring to the total of fares unpaid by fare evaders caught by police in 2023. \"$150 million could buy free fares (at going rate) for 95,000 poor New Yorkers per year.\"\n\nIt would be naive, however, to overlook the deeply entrenched political economy of carceral punishment in New York and throughout the country - treating poor people, particularly Black people, as accounts from which to extract fines or bodies to fill jails and prisons. It will take more than fiscal sense to upend the current bipartisan political consensus around \"law and order.\" But there can be no mistake: Incidents like the shooting on Sunday are an inevitable extension of the violence of quotidian city life, swarmed by police.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have?

      "text": "How to Build a Human\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA Forensics Company Tells Cops It Can Use DNA to Predict a Suspect's Face. Scientists Worry the Tool Will Deepen Racial Bias.\n\nAs a teenager , Dr. Susan Walsh loved the TV show \"The X-Files.\" She was particularly drawn to the character of Dana Scully, a hyper-rational doctor-cum-FBI agent who brought a scientist's skepticism to investigations of paranormal phenomena and deployed her medical training to determine cause of death for the show's victims.\n\nThe fact that Scully used science to solve problems and pursue justice intrigued Walsh. She wanted to explore a career in forensics but was on the fence about how to do it. Should she go into law enforcement? Become a scientist? The show helped her to decide. She loved the science. \"It did start with Scully, if I'm being honest,\" she said.\n\nWalsh studied biochemistry and, while working on her master's degree in DNA profiling, she happened onto a research paper that caught her attention. Australian scientists had found DNA markers corresponding to eye color, and Walsh began to wonder whether those techniques could be applied to criminal investigations. If crime-scene DNA could be analyzed for markers that relate to physical appearance, Walsh suspected that could help investigators identify suspects - and take crime fighting to a new level.\n\n\"Oh wow, that's so cool that we'll one day be able to predict what people look like,\" using DNA, she thought. \"In an application of a forensic setting, that's amazing.\"\n\nThat was 2005. Today, Walsh is at the top of her field. An assistant professor in the School of Science at Indiana University Indianapolis, she runs a lab researching what is now known as forensic DNA phenotyping, or FDP. Walsh has worked on locating genes related to eye, hair, and skin color and has built an open-source tool for people, including in law enforcement, who want to use DNA to predict those traits. She has also investigated connections between DNA markers and the appearance of various facial features, known as facial morphology.\n\nThrough her research, she came to learn that FDP works as she imagined it could: An unknown DNA sample can be parsed for genetic markers related to various traits, like hair or eye color, offering criminal investigators a glimpse into what the owner of the DNA might look like. That, in turn, could be useful information for prioritizing suspects to investigate. If the DNA says a person is likely to have red hair, for example, detectives could bump redheads to the top of their suspect list.\n\nStill, Walsh remains cautious about how she describes what DNA can and cannot tell us about what a person might look like. At present, the idea that DNA can be used to predict facial structure - for example, what a person's chin might look like - is more science fiction, like her beloved \"X-Files,\" and less science fact. The human face is a complicated structure defined by both nature (so, DNA) and nurture (like, if you've had your nose broken). Like others in her field, Walsh is unsure that research into morphology will ever bear reliable fruit. \"We can't even do a nose right now,\" she said.\n\nWalsh is adamant: It's scientifically premature to deploy these methods to predict a person's face, especially when their life and liberty is at stake. Not everyone in the field has been as chary.\n\nA private company based in Reston, Virginia, Parabon NanoLabs was founded in 2008 with the mission of creating \" breakthrough products \" using DNA, with an initial focus on developing cancer therapies. It has since evolved into a prominent purveyor of forensic products, including DNA phenotyping, to police agencies. Though it's well known among forensic scientists, it maintains a fairly low public profile and publishes few details about its operation online.\n\nAccording to Parabon, its Snapshot FDP System \"accurately\" predicts not only eye, hair, and skin color, but also face shape. For a fee, the company will provide law enforcement agencies with a rendering of its predictions in the form of a color composite sketch, along with a \"corresponding measure of confidence\" in the predicted traits. The company says it has worked with hundreds of police agencies in the nine years it's been doing this work.\n\nAs Parabon's foothold in the world of forensics deepened, so did the concern among scientists and legal experts, who warn that the company's sketches are, at best, misleading. Leading experts agree the science has not evolved enough to accurately and reliably provide the kind of singular image Parabon produces for police investigations. Even a scientist who helped develop the technology says it's not ready for real-world use.\n\nParabon's methodology for generating its phenotype predictions is a closely guarded secret; its system has not faced independent scientific verification and validation - the gold standard among scientists for vetting the efficacy of computer-based programs - nor has it been peer reviewed. Still, Parabon insists that its phenotyping work is based on good science. While it acknowledges that its program has not gone through traditional scientific review processes, it says the proof of Snapshot's ability and value is in the number of law enforcement agencies that use it and say it has helped them solve cases.\n\nSelling these singular images to police is \"detrimental to the field and something we need to stop.\"\n\nFor years, Walsh privately pressed the company to explain its work and grew frustrated by Parabon's refusal to engage with her questions. Her concerns were not just hypothetical: In a criminal legal system rife with wrongful convictions and racial bias, there are countless ways using an unproven tool to solve crimes can, and does, go wrong.\n\nThose frustrations came to a head during a March 2024 workshop at the National Academy of Sciences covering the good and bad of several next-generation forensic tools used by law enforcement, where Walsh and others sharply criticized Parabon. Selling these singular images to police is \"detrimental to the field and something we need to stop,\" Walsh said.\n\nPolice pay hundreds per case for appearance prediction, yet \"how these tools function remains shrouded in secrecy,\" noted Rebecca Brown, the former policy director for the Innocence Project and the founder of Maat Strategies, a criminal legal policy consulting firm. Speaking at the workshop, Brown cautioned against the use of FDP and other novel disciplines absent robust validation and regulation. There are \"too many examples of investigative tools that become runaway trains,\" she said.\n\nParabon's FDP service follows a predictable pattern in forensic science: Novel techniques are developed, often by private industry, and pressed into service for law enforcement purposes before their limitations have been fully assessed and addressed.\n\nAs with other forensic innovations, like forensic genetic genealogy or facial recognition , FDP is sold as an \"investigative tool\" - that is, a product not intended for use as evidence in a criminal proceeding, but as a behind-the-scenes aide to police searching for perpetrators. But selling a scientifically questionable product as a mere investigative tool can have real-world consequences.\n\nFor FDP in particular, experts warn that the composite images can reinforce racial stereotypes, encourage the over-surveillance of marginalized communities, and deny criminal defendants important information about how they became a target of an investigation, which raises serious implications for Fourth Amendment privacy rights. Composites like those Parabon sells could also inadvertently taint the memories of eyewitnesses to a crime, risking potentially valuable evidence.\n\nPaula Armentrout, Parabon's co-founder, provided written responses to questions from The Intercept about the company's Snapshot program. In part, the company said that The Intercept \"should not quote any of the presenters\" at the NAS workshop, who it claims \"made many false, uninformed, and misleading statements that were not based on evidence or facts, but on misinformation propagated by inaccurate media articles, hearsay, and their own personal and political agendas.\"\n\nWalsh insists her criticisms are motivated solely by her fidelity to the science and to ensuring the transparency and accuracy of forensic tools used in the criminal legal system. To that end, she was emphatic during the workshop: Law enforcement should not be allowed to purchase phenotyping composites. \"The science isn't there. We shouldn't be doing it,\" she said. At this juncture, she said, those sketches are about as scientific as \"my son drawing them.\"\n\nParabon's foray into forensics began in 2009, when the company secured the first of several contracts with the Pentagon's Defense Threat Reduction Agency, which was looking for a way to identify individuals in combat zones responsible for building improvised explosive devices. Parabon proposed extracting physical traits from DNA collected from the weapons to get the job done, and a subsequent 2012 contract led to the development of the Snapshot system. \"Traditional DNA analysis treats DNA like a fingerprint, useful for identification,\" Parabon co-founder and CEO Steven Armentrout told the military's Success Stories publication in 2022 . \"But Snapshot treats it like a blueprint for how to build a human.\"\n\nThe company began marketing the service to police agencies in 2015, an effort that has been \"extremely successful,\" Ellen McRae Greytak, the company's director of bioinformatics, said during a webinar for a military organization in 2020. In her presentation, Greytak briefly outlined Parabon's work to create Snapshot: how researchers collected existing DNA information for individuals across the world to home in not only on markers for hair, skin and eye color, but also for specific geographic ancestry information; how they used machine learning to create the algorithm that generates predictions; and how, at the time, the company was developing a phone app to help gather three-dimensional images of faces to aid its morphology work.\n\nOnce the software makes a phenotype prediction, a forensic artist steps in to shade the composite. Of course, the process has its limitations, Greytak acknowledged. It can't predict hairstyle, for example, or any other form of non-genetic modification - like scarring, tattoos, or dyed hair - and it can't discern a person's weight. Parabon's composites are developed for what a person would look like as \"a young adult at a normal body weight,\" she said, which the company defines as a body mass index of 22.\n\nParabon had already worked on \"hundreds of cases,\" Greytak said during the webinar, sharing a couple of alleged success stories. In 2016, Massachusetts police investigating the 24-year-old cold-case murder of Lisa Ziegert used crime-scene DNA to obtain a Parabon sketch of her possible murderer.\n\nDetectives used the composite information to narrow down the pool of \"thousands\" of people who, over the years, had been noted in the case file, Greytak said. There \"were maybe five guys who closely matched the predictions we made,\" she said, so the cops went knocking on their doors. Gary Schara wasn't home when the police arrived at his place, so they told Schara's roommate to pass on the message that \"we'd like to speak to him,\" Greytak explained. \"When Gary hears that, he flees.\" Police were eventually able to track Schara down and to match his DNA to the crime, she said, prompting him to confess. \"They were finally able to close this homicide case.\"\n\nAccording to news reports, Schara was more than just a note in the case file. In fact, he had long been a suspect : His wife gave him up to police in 1993, and he was subsequently interviewed multiple times by investigators, including from the FBI.\n\nAfter police received the Parabon phenotyping report and returned once again, talking to his roommate, Schara penned a confession and tried to kill himself. Police found him the next day in a Connecticut hospital. Schara ultimately pleaded guilty and was sentenced to life in prison.\n\nIt is unclear why detectives were unable to close the case years earlier. The Hampden district attorney's office did not respond to The Intercept's requests for comment, but in 2019, MassLive reported that District Attorney Anthony Gulluni said the \"embrace of new technology\" had helped to solve the case. Still, it appears the most Parabon can claim credit for is reminding cops of at least one of their top suspects.\n\nSusan Walsh had been working on FDP for nearly a decade when Parabon's service debuted for law enforcement agencies. Back then, Walsh was mostly curious. She started asking Parabon questions. \"I was saying, 'Oh, what [DNA] markers are you using? And where's your paper? Where can I read it? And what data set are you working with? And what's your algorithm?'\" she recalled. \"And I was just getting nothing back.\"\n\nShe approached company representatives at conferences and asked how the program worked. \"They just didn't answer my questions,\" she said. \"And then I was like, 'OK. Well, I don't think that you should be allowed in the field if you're not going to answer the questions a scientist asks you.'\" Scientists should be open to having their work scrutinized by peers, she said; they should be forthcoming about what parameters they're using, about what their tool does well - and where it fails. \"I was a bit curious at first and then kind of a little bit angry.\" It felt to her like snake oil, selling hope in the form of a tool that could provide answers in cases that had long gone cold.\n\nWalsh repeatedly tried to raise the alarm within the forensics community, but \"it still wasn't working.\" By the time the NAS workshop rolled around in March, she did not mince words. Parabon's sketches are \"detrimental,\" she said to the the scientists, legal scholars, academics, and advocates gathered at the National Academies' headquarters in Washington, D.C., for the two-day event. \"I was just sick of saying it all the time - that we need science,\" she later told The Intercept. \"We need publications. We need peer review.\"\n\nWalsh emphasized that she believes selling composite images is scientifically indefensible. Experts agree that the most accurate way to describe phenotypic predictions is individually - the likelihood of brown eyes or blonde hair, for example - which offers police solid and actionable intelligence without tipping into science fiction, she said. Currently, each of the three predictions available via Walsh's tool, which has been validated and peer reviewed, are reported to be approximately 80 percent accurate.\n\nAlthough Walsh's tool is available to law enforcement agencies free of charge, she said she doesn't get that many cases. She suspects that's because she won't offer the cops a composite. \"They go off and they pay because they want that singular image.\"\n\nFor that, they can turn to Parabon.\n\nFor Parabon, independent verification and peer review are superfluous pursuits. In response to a series of questions from The Intercept, the company said its program can't be externally vetted because the code is \"proprietary.\" As for peer review, while it is a \"valuable process for academic research because it allows researchers to contribute to the broader body of knowledge,\" the company said, Parabon instead focuses on \"delivering actionable results\" to law enforcement customers.\n\n\"Unlike academics, whose primary goal is to contribute to scientific literature and educate, our priority is to serve the immediate needs of our clients,\" the company wrote . Peer review can \"sometimes become bogged down in theoretical debates,\" it opined , noting that if Parabon had gone that route and hadn't started selling its system to police, the service \"would still not be available to them.\"\n\nThe proof that Parabon's system works is in the real-world validation the company has received from law enforcement agencies that have hired it to help solve cases. The 70 composites the company has posted online \"from actual cases where identifications were later made,\" it wrote, \"represent the most stringent and authentic performance evaluation possible.\" Many of those cases \"would not have been solved without Snapshot phenotyping,\" the company insists, \"a fact to which the involved agencies can attest.\"\n\nThe company sidestepped specific questions about how it is able to predict facial characteristics when other scientists say that isn't currently possible. Instead, the company said it approaches things differently than the \"academic literature,\" using what's known as principal component analysis - a statistical method that essentially sorts and makes sense of complex, noisy data - to fuel its predictions.\n\nThe company said its predictions are based on data collected from more than 1,000, mostly young-adult volunteers, 37 percent of whom \"self-identify as White.\" Although asked twice to do so, Parabon did not supply the total number of volunteers or a detailed breakdown of the population. Instead, it said the entire sample is \"diverse and balanced,\" including individuals from various ethnic backgrounds, \"such as African, Asian, European, Hispanic/Latino, and Middle Eastern,\" as well as individuals with mixed heritage. \"This diversity helps ensure the robustness and applicability of our predictions.\"\n\nParabon also provided two diagrams that purport to show how its Snapshot system sorts data to predict face shape, using DNA from Greytak and co-founder Paula Armentrout as an example. The first diagram features a star-like array of blank, gray faces, which Greytak said represent the five main face shapes deduced through principal component analysis. To the side is a heat map of those five faces, which supposedly shows which portions of each face is fueling the ultimate prediction. The second is a more sparse but similar diagram showing the two women's faces alongside the face shapes the program predicted.\n\nThe company declined to say which DNA markers it uses in this process, saying the specific genetic markers were \"chosen based on our proprietary analysis.\"\n\nMark Shriver, a geneticist and professor of anthropology at Penn State University who is a leading expert on phenotyping, reviewed the diagrams and relevant portions of the responses that Parabon provided to The Intercept. He said they are fundamentally flawed. \"If you want to study variation within a population, then you need a large sample from just that population,\" he said. \"If you want to distinguish the two white women like they were doing in their example figure ... then you need 1,000 white people.\"\n\nShriver knows better than most how Parabon's model works. More than a decade ago, Shriver collaborated with the company on its Pentagon contract. He and a colleague conducted the research that now underpins the Snapshot system, he said, including the information from the 1,000 or so volunteers. It was designed more as proof of concept, and in need of significantly more time, research, and work to transform into a truly predictive model. But Parabon was not interested in doing that work, Shriver said, which led him and his colleague to part ways with the company. \"It became clear they just wanted to take it to market immediately,\" he said.\n\nIn Parabon's telling, its relationship with Shriver \"ended without acrimony\" at the conclusion of his subcontract. His \"concerns ... were never communicated to us,\" Paula Armentrout wrote to The Intercept in an email.\n\nShriver told The Intercept that Parabon's data set is far too small to support the kind of individualizing predictions the company sells to police. \"And this was one of the points I made clear to them from the start,\" Shriver said.\n\n\"One of the phrases that goes way back in computer science is 'garbage in, garbage out,'\" he said. \"The input data is fundamental to any kind of analysis, any kind of conclusions, any kind of predictions you're going to be able to do from it.\" A thousand volunteers from one population could, \"perhaps, start to get you some information about what's going on within that population,\" he said. But the sample Parabon is working with was selected to cover a \"bunch of populations.\" Meaning, the system is primed for drawing general conclusions, but not for making detailed predictions about individuals.\n\nThe company pursued an approach that differs from the \"methods being explored in academia,\" Armentrout reiterated in response to questions about Shriver. \"Dr. Shriver was developing his own face prediction methods for casework, although we're not aware if they have ever been used in a forensic case.\"\n\nArmentrout is right that Shriver hasn't deployed his research forensically in the way Parabon has - with good reason. Though his research now includes data from tens of thousands of people - from both diverse populations and within closed groups, including families - he cautions that there is still more to be done to develop an effective, predictive tool. He won't put it to work until it has been tested, validated, and peer reviewed.\n\n\"It really isn't science until it's been looked at by somebody who could understand what you did wrong and what you did right,\" Shriver said. \"And not just one person, but the whole community has to be able to review what you've done if you want to call it science.\"\n\n\"Otherwise,\" he said, \"you're just playing games in the closet.\"\n\nInvestigators at the Edmonton Police Service in Alberta, Canada, were desperate to solve the violent rape of a young woman in March 2019. The man who attacked her was a stranger and had been bundled up against the cold, leaving her with few details about his appearance. There was no CCTV footage or other witnesses, save for DNA left behind.\n\nThree years later, the department turned to Parabon for help. The company used the DNA to generate a sketch of a nondescript Black man. According to Parabon, the suspect is of East African descent - as well as part South and West African - and likely has dark skin, dark hair, dark eyes, and no freckles. The police department posted the generic image online, including to its social media accounts.\n\nThe backlash was fierce. The image did little more than implicate nearly every Black man in Edmonton, critics noted, essentially encouraging racial profiling and the continued over-surveillance of minority and other marginalized communities. \"If they're generating an image of a face of a Black person, like what happened in Canada, and then releasing that image to the general public ... then you have a bunch of white people who are looking at Black people around them and thinking, 'Oh, well, that could be the guy,' and then they just report on that person,\" Jennifer Lynch, general counsel at the Electronic Frontier Foundation, told The Intercept.\n\n\"It obviously doesn't help the investigation in any sense,\" Lynch continued, \"because it's not a real image of a person, certainly not the real image of the perpetrator, and it can only harm both the investigation and communities of color, because it puts them at greater risk of arrest for things that they didn't do.\"\n\n\"It's not a real image of a person, certainly not the real image of the perpetrator, and it can only harm both the investigation and communities of color.\"\n\nTwo days after posting the image, the Edmonton police pulled it offline and issued a statement. \"The potential that a visual profile can provide far too broad a characterization from within a racialized community and in this case, Edmonton's Black community, was not something I adequately considered,\" Enyinnah Okere, the agency's chief operating officer said .\n\nDespite the police department's actions, Parabon kept the image on its website. The sketch merely reported \"what the signals in the DNA\" indicated about the perpetrator's \"traits and biogeographic ancestry,\" the company told The Intercept. It was \"unfortunate the community misunderstood the purpose of the composite and reacted the way it did.\" Besides, Parabon added, it had been told an arrest was made in the case and that \"our prediction was accurate.\"\n\nThat was news to the Edmonton police. In emails to The Intercept, spokesperson Sgt. Dan Tames said no suspect has been arrested in the case. He also said that after receiving The Intercept's inquiry, the agency asked Parabon to remove the image from its website. Nearly two years after it was posted, the image was finally removed. Parabon did not respond to an additional request for comment.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe case is a potent example of the way that FDP, and Parabon's composites in particular, can perpetuate other harmful practices within the criminal legal system. Faulty eyewitness identifications are a leading cause of wrongful convictions , and science has repeatedly demonstrated that people have a harder time correctly identifying people of a different race.\n\nResearch has also shown that introducing a composite image to a witness can reshape their memory, potentially corrupting their initial recollection. \"The presentation of a single photograph explicitly to ask about whether or not that person is maybe who the witness saw commit the crime has been found to be really suggestive,\" said Dr. Kara Moore, a professor of psychology at the University of Utah.\n\nAnd if police were to tell a witness that a composite is based on DNA phenotyping, that could be even more suggestive, Moore said. \"People find DNA evidence to be really persuasive. So this idea that this facial composite was based on DNA may have some implications for accuracy in the person's mind,\" she said. \"People might truly believe this is really what the person who committed the crime looks like.\"\n\n\"The accuracy of the composite is an interesting component too,\" she added. \"If it's wrong, you're negatively contaminating the eyewitness's memory and really harming your eyewitness. But even if it's right, you might be artificially inflating the person's memory and confidence for the face.\"\n\nFor Walsh, the potential conflating of ancestry with appearance is another cause for concern. While DNA can offer ancestral information, that intel cannot be cribbed into assumptions about what a person looks like, including about facial features and skin color. \"Some individuals can be biased by skin pigmentation to infer ancestry, or ancestry to infer pigmentation,\" she wrote in an email. \"Unless you actually test for the specific trait ... you cannot assume either.\" Cautioning that she doesn't know how Parabon's system works, she said she worries that using ancestral data to produce an image could cause police to \"focus on a particular population without foundation.\"\n\nIn a January 2024 story in Wired , Greytak seemed to suggest that Parabon's system does take ancestry into account when making some phenotypic predictions. \"What we are predicting is more like - given this person's sex and ancestry, will they have wider-set eyes than average,\" she said. But, she said, \"there's no way you can get individual identifications from that.\"\n\nParabon did not directly address The Intercept's question about Greytak's comments to Wired, but insisted that it does not use ancestry categories to inform its morphology predictions. \"Categorical divisions are artificial and not reflective of the continuous nature of human genetic variation across the globe,\" it said.\n\nEither way, critics say current science does not support Parabon's individualizing composites. As Rebecca Brown, the policy consultant at Maat Strategies, put it, the automated facial composites are \"putting a veneer of science on an already problematic identification procedure.\"\n\nParabon markets its Snapshot phenotyping service not as a tool for positive identification, but a tool to generate investigative leads. The company stressed this in its responses to The Intercept. \"It's crucial to understand that the DNA phenotyping information we provide to agencies is not used for definitive identification or conviction,\" it wrote. That is, the phenotyping is only intended for use in developing suspects; from there, law enforcement agencies would try to use traditional forensic DNA testing to see if the suspect can be linked to crime-scene evidence. \"Our work does not change this process in any way,\" the company insisted.\n\nBut using such a program merely to generate leads is itself questionable. Parabon told The Intercept that it does \"not have an exact count\" of all the law enforcement agencies that have purchased its phenotyping services but said that \"hundreds of agencies\" have used Snapshot for casework. Of those, the company only posts to its website images that its client police agencies have already made public.\n\nTo date, Parabon has published only 70 composites. That means there are potentially hundreds of cases where law enforcement has used a composite behind the scenes to inform an investigation - information that almost certainly has not, or will not, be made available to the defense in a criminal prosecution, even if it did help to narrow the cops' focus onto a particular individual.\n\nThat's because the tools police use to generate investigative leads are generally not considered evidence in criminal cases, meaning the state is not required to share information about those tools or the leads they generate with defense lawyers. So, for example, if police use a Snapshot composite to lead them to a suspect who they then charge with a crime, the defense will likely never know unless the police choose to publicize it.\n\nThe lack of transparency is alarming to defense attorneys and civil libertarians. \"I would say, if there's a single biggest issue here, it's that,\" said Clare Garvie, a lawyer with the Fourth Amendment Center at the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.\n\nGarvie is an expert on the use of face recognition , another tool whose outputs are often hidden from scrutiny during criminal prosecutions. \"The logic behind asserting that it's an investigative lead only, is, in theory, to protect people from having adverse action taken against them based on unreliable methods,\" she said. \"But what it has functionally meant is that - in the face recognition context, but very, very likely in other investigative contexts - the defense never finds out that these searches are run.\"\n\nBack in 2016, for example, Garvie discovered that police in Pinellas County, Florida, who had been using facial recognition technology since 2001, were using it, \"on average, 8,000 times a month.\" But at the same time, she noted, the public defender's office there \"had never had a single case in which it had been disclosed.\"\n\nWhere FDP is concerned, there is at least one current case where police use of Parabon's work to identify a suspect is being challenged in court. After the 2016 murder of Karina Vetrano, who was killed while jogging near her family home in Queens, the New York Police Department hired Parabon to do phenotyping. The results reportedly came back that the suspect was of African descent, which the NYPD apparently took to mean the person was Black, subsequently undertaking a vast DNA dragnet of hundreds of Black men in the area. Ultimately, the cops landed on a young, developmentally delayed man named Chanel Lewis, who could not be excluded as a source of a trace amount of DNA found at the crime scene.\n\nThe fact that the police had used Parabon's service at all contradicted their public stance about the case - the official line was that a policeman's hunch and shoe-leather investigation had cracked it - and the prosecution failed to tell Lewis's defense the whole story. Eventually the fact that the NYPD had employed Parabon was leaked to Lewis's trial attorneys by a department insider. After a hung jury during his first trial, Lewis was found guilty in 2019. He has appealed his conviction, which his lawyers argue was tainted by the state's failure to disclose its questionable use of phenotyping to target their client.\n\nAt specific issue is whether police violated Lewis's Fourth Amendment rights when they collected his DNA as part of the dragnet - a question that largely turns on what police had in mind when they approached Lewis. Did they have a reasonable and individualized suspicion that Lewis might be Vetrano's killer? And, importantly, what was it that made them suspicious of him? Was it solely the phenotyping prediction that the killer was a Black male?\n\n\"If you're getting a phenotyping conclusion that says, it was a Black man, and then you have an investigative strategy where you only take DNA samples from Black men,\" then you are using the phenotyping not just to eliminate people, but to target them, said Rhidaya Trivedi, one of Lewis's attorneys. \"Then the scientific integrity of phenotyping enters that Fourth Amendment inquiry: Was it reasonable that they thought [the suspect] was a Black man?\"\n\nNone of the questions about the scientific integrity of Parabon's phenotyping have been answered in court. \"It's a huge question, an unanswered question: Can police use phenotyping to affirmatively generate suspicion?\" Trivedi asks. \"And if so, under what circumstances? Because I doubt that Chanel's case is the only one where this happened.\"\n\nIn an expert affidavit filed with Lewis's appeal, Shriver, the Penn State geneticist, detailed at length the kinds of questions that law enforcement agencies and courts should be asking of any phenotyping service before it is deployed. That includes whether and how the program has been validated, how any results were explained to police, and whether a distinction between geographic ancestry and any facial trait predictions were \"communicated and understood.\"\n\nJeanna Matthews is something of an evangelist for verification and validation of computer programs used in the criminal legal system. A professor of computer science at Clarkson University, she is also the vice chair of the AI Policy Committee at the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, known as the IEEE, which has long promulgated standards for ensuring the scientific integrity of computer-based systems.\n\nFor Matthews, the issue is straightforward: Forensic tools like Parabon's phenotyping program need to be independently verified and validated against accepted scientific standards, like those developed by the IEEE , if they're going to be deployed in the criminal legal system. Put simply, the tools need to be fully reviewed from code to output to determine whether they are built and function as intended.\n\nThis kind of detailed, ground-up review is common in mission-critical fields - like with medical devices or air traffic control systems - but it has not been implemented in the criminal legal system. The verification and validation process, known as V&V, \"is pretty much ubiquitous when we all agree that it's important that the software be accurate,\" Matthews said. \"Why isn't it done for criminal justice software? We don't all seem to agree it's important enough to do it carefully.\"\n\n\"The idea that anyone is hiding behind trade secrets when life and liberty is at stake, we have to ask ourselves some serious questions.\"\n\nIn part, the problem is that many newer forensic tools are developed by private companies that, like Parabon, say their system is \"proprietary\" or make claims of trade secrets to keep outsiders from looking closely at the tools they're selling. And that, experts say, should be unacceptable for a system that routinely locks people up or kills them.\n\n\"The idea that anyone is hiding behind trade secrets when life and liberty is at stake, we have to ask ourselves some serious questions about what we're about,\" said Rebecca Wexler, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley School of Law, \"if we're sort of like, 'Nope, that profit motive must transcend this person's ability to prove their innocence.'\"\n\nParabon, it seems, is not only uninterested in having its phenotyping program externally vetted, but also is not too keen on hearing any criticisms of its work.\n\nIn addition to admonishing The Intercept not to quote from the NAS workshop in which its Snapshot system was discussed, Parabon said that it had approached the organization about the workshop and was \"pleased to report that after an internal review,\" the NAS had removed video recording of the event from its website.\n\nAn NAS spokesperson acknowledged that the videos were removed but did not respond to repeated questions about the specific reason. \"Concerns were raised about comments made at the workshop,\" the spokesperson said in a statement to The Intercept. \"Although any statements made at the workshop solely reflect the personal opinions of individual presenters and not the views of all workshop participants or the National Academies, we decided to remove the videos of the workshop from our website.\"\n\nThough it may no longer be accessible online, the workshop had a lasting impact on Walsh. She said it helped her to think about her work - and its implications - in new ways. In particular, she more seriously ponders how her work could be misused, and about how she can counteract that possibility. She wants to be sure her predictions are made based on robust population samples and that her tools are described openly, and accurately, so that anyone can understand what they can and cannot do.\n\n\"I think along the lines of, 'How can I protect people more?'\" she said. \"'How can I make sure that there is no way this can be used badly?'\"\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept. Who would hold party elites accountable to the values they proclaim to have? How many covert wars, miscarriages of justice, and dystopian technologies would remain hidden if our reporters weren't on the beat?\n\nThe kind of reporting we do is essential to democracy, but it is not easy, cheap, or profitable.

      "text": "What Killed Daniel Prude? The Cops and New York AG Said a Diagnosis That's Since Been Debunked.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA newly obtained document sheds light on how the disavowed \"excited delirium\" diagnosis infiltrated the Rochester Police Department before Prude's death.\n\nIn partnership with\n\nWhat killed Daniel Prude? The 41-year-old died in March 2020 after cops pinned him down during a drug-induced mental health crisis. For three minutes, Rochester, New York, police officers pressed Prude's head and torso into the street, continuing their hold for nearly a minute after he began vomiting. It was one of the highest-profile deaths in police custody in a year that saw a historic nationwide movement against police brutality.\n\nAccording to a state investigation, an autopsy, and the cops who held him to the ground, Prude was killed by something called \"excited delirium.\" The condition is said to turn people into erratic aggressors and can supposedly lead to cardiac arrest.\n\nAuthorities cited excited delirium in other notorious Black Lives Matter-era deaths in police custody, including those of George Floyd , Elijah McClain , and Angelo Quinto . The purported diagnosis had become so popular among first responders that, in Rochester, paramedics speculated even before they saw him that Prude was likely experiencing the condition, according to the state investigation.\n\nYet in the last four years, a vast swath of the U.S. medical establishment has rejected excited delirium as a diagnosis. Six leading national medical associations have fully disavowed it, while another two have distanced themselves from it. Floyd's home state of Minnesota, McClain's Colorado, and Quinto's California have barred public officials from citing the syndrome.\n\nMedical experts say excited delirium is a theory, not a recognized disease with a specific physiological cause. And they have argued it can obscure the actual causes of deaths, especially when police are involved.\n\nNow, a training document obtained through a public records request by New York Focus and The Intercept sheds new light on how the disavowed diagnosis infiltrated the Rochester Police Department before Prude's death.\n\nAdvocates and researchers blame the initial popularization of the excited delirium diagnosis on a corporate-backed campaign to absolve cops of responsibility for deaths in their custody. In Rochester, the training document, created in 2016 and last edited in late 2020, lifts directly from materials disseminated by an organization linked to Taser, producer of the eponymous stun gun. The document warns officers that the syndrome's sufferers experience a \"diminished sense of pain\" that could render police batons ineffective. And it claims that \"saying 'I can't breathe'\" is a sign of excited delirium.\n\n\"It displaces any sort of blame from the perpetrator of violence - in this case, the police - to the person who's on the receiving end, but under the guise of this diagnosis,\" said Altaf Saadi, a neurologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, of the training document. Saadi, who has done research on how excited delirium rose to prominence, reviewed the training materials for New York Focus and The Intercept.\n\nThe document comes to light as New York grapples with its role in promoting excited delirium as a cause of death. After Prude died, state Attorney General Letitia James encouraged first responders to embrace the disputed concept.\n\n\"Personnel must be trained to recognize the symptoms of excited delirium syndrome and to respond to it as a serious medical emergency,\" she recommended in a 2021 report.\n\nIt's unclear how many police departments in the state have trained officers on the theory - though the largest one has. Last year, New York Focus uncovered New York City Police Department training materials that provide guidance on excited delirium similar to what is in the Rochester document. (The NYPD did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nInternally, the attorney general's office has softened its stance.\n\nIn a statement, the office said, \"Causes of death are solely determined by medical examiners, not OSI\" - James's Office of Special Investigation - \"however we have not recognized 'excited delirium' or similar terms as a cause of death for several years because we are acutely aware of the scientific discourse and concerns regarding the term.\" Her office did not comment on her use of the term in the Prude investigation nor her guidance that officers should be trained on the theory.\n\nWith James avoiding a full-throated rejection of excited delirium, state lawmakers are taking up the fight. Citing New York Focus's report on the NYPD, Assemblymember Jessica González-Rojas introduced legislation in March to ban government agencies from referencing excited delirium.\n\n\"The term has been debunked by the major medical associations,\" said González-Rojas. \"It's something that has to be done.\"\n\nShe said, \"It's pseudoscience that all too often provides cover for fatal police tactics.\"\n\n\"Excited delirium syndrome\" was scientifically suspect from the start. In the 1980s , doctors studying cocaine use in Miami coined the term to describe how, in their observations, the drug could make men \"psychotic\" and potentially cause women to die during sex. The deceased women the doctors initially studied were later found to be victims of a serial killer . Other subjects had been restrained by police in positions that can obstruct breathing.\n\nStill, the notion gained traction, and in 2005, a forensic pathologist and psychiatric nurse published a book on the syndrome. In the opening pages, it reads, \"This book is dedicated to all law enforcement and medical personnel who have been wrongfully accused of misconduct in deaths due to excited delirium syndrome.\" The publication caught the eye of Taser.\n\nAmid increased scrutiny over its stun guns' role in deaths involving police, Taser became one of the excited delirium theory's biggest boosters. The company distributed the book and other literature on the syndrome. Taser-backed research made its way into first responder training materials , which recommended tactics to subdue excited delirium sufferers - including by using Taser stun guns.\n\nThe company hired experts who testified in police killing trials that the syndrome, and not stun guns or other uses of force, caused the victims' deaths. Some of the same experts inundated medical journals with studies making the same arguments. Taser, now known as Axon , did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTaser concentrated much of its advocacy on medical examiners, whose autopsies play a key role in legal proceedings for police killings. Between 2000 and 2017, medical examiners listed excited delirium as a factor in at least 276 deaths that followed Taser use, a Reuters investigation found. (Little to no public data exists on how many overall deaths are attributed to excited delirium.)\n\nJoye Carter Rush, a forensic pathologist and former longtime medical examiner, remembers receiving Taser materials on excited delirium, including the 2005 book. The dedication jumped out at her.\n\nTaser's medical examiner advocacy was peculiar, Carter Rush said, because there's no special way for medical examiners to diagnose the syndrome. Rather, as a \"syndrome,\" it's a list of simultaneous symptoms.\n\n\"There is no such medical disease as excited delirium,\" Carter Rush said.\n\nExcited delirium is sometimes linked with drug use, but the behaviors police have come to associate with it can result from a wide variety of underlying causes, medical experts said.\n\n\"Maybe they have dementia, maybe they have autism with behavioral issues,\" said Saadi, the neurologist. \"If they're having fever and muscle rigidity\" - among excited delirium's listed symptoms - \"it could be encephalitis. There's literally so many different diagnoses.\"\n\nThat murkiness is what prompted some of the top medical associations , including the American Medical Association and the American Psychiatric Association , to fully disavow the diagnosis.\n\nExcited delirium's reputation for endowing sufferers with super strength and imperviousness to pain can fuel more aggressive police responses, Saadi said.\n\n\"'Superhuman strength' and 'unlimited endurance' we know are racist tropes that have been typically used against Black men,\" said Saadi. \"It sends the message that it is okay to justify having this super aggressive escalation when that is often not the case.\"\n\nThe Rochester materials obtained by New York Focus and The Intercept highlight critics' concerns about excited delirium.\n\nLook out for subjects who look like they \"just snapped,\" the training warns. Excited delirium may render \"pain compliance techniques\" like batons ineffective.\n\nTo reinforce the unearthly qualities of people experiencing the syndrome, the training presentation includes melodramatic photos and illustrations: deranged people screaming; a naked, bloody zombie eating a corpse; the Incredible Hulk. In one image, two cops pin a naked, wide-eyed Black man to the ground.\n\nThe training file's metadata indicates that it was created in 2016 and last edited in late 2020, meaning it was likely offered to officers before Prude's death.\n\nThe metadata also shows that the file was created by the Monroe County Office of Mental Health's former chief of clinical and forensic services, Kimberly Butler, who also headed the county team that accompanies police on mental health crisis calls.\n\nButler, who did not respond to interview requests, resigned in 2020 after it was revealed that she sent privileged information about Prude's mental health care to Rochester police officials after his run-in with the cops. She was one of at least 16 public officials, including the Rochester police chief, to resign, retire, or get fired in connection with their handling of the Prude case.\n\nBoth the Rochester Police Department and the Monroe County Office of Mental Health said that they don't currently offer the excited delirium training. (The police department sent the file to New York Focus and The Intercept in response to a request for \"currently used\" training materials related to excited delirium.)\n\n\"It was co-sponsored by the county Office of Mental Health, and we do have officers who attend Office of Mental Health trainings, but I have no idea if they still use it or not,\" Greg Bello of the Rochester Police Department said.\n\nA spokesperson for the county Office of Mental Health said that the training document is from a prior administration - the current director took over in February 2021 - and the office can't be sure when the last time it was used. Neither the police nor the mental health office responded to follow-up questions about their stances on excited delirium.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.

The informational poster, written by Peters, touts that Taser's stun guns \"have been shown to be the most effective to quickly capturing\" excited delirium patients.\n\nIn an interview with New York Focus and The Intercept, Peters, a longtime police administrator, said he now agrees with many of the medical establishment's concerns about the diagnosis. The IPICD has recommended against using the term for nearly 15 years, he said. The organization now teaches officers to address what it calls \"agitated chaotic events,\" while leaving medical diagnoses to medical professionals.\n\nThe IPICD's website, however, still boosts the theory. An advertisement for a current institute police training course, for example, decries pushback against excited delirium as a result of \"post-George Floyd societal culture.\"\n\nThe IPICD also still publishes the informational poster that appears to have inspired the Rochester training presentation. The poster is nearly two decades old and cites the 1980s cocaine research. Peters said that he planned on replacing the poster after the IPICD's annual conference in November, but it remains on the group's website.\n\nTaser's connections to the Prude case extend beyond the IPICD-inspired Rochester police training.\n\nIn 2021, Gary Vilke, a San Diego-based emergency medicine doctor, became the New York attorney general's chief medical expert in the Prude case. As a frequent paid expert witness in police killing trials, including for Taser , Vilke has earned notoriety as one of the most influential members of a cadre of hired guns whose testimonies help absolve officers.\n\nIn a deposition last year, Vilke reportedly said he consults on more than a dozen cases a year and can earn as much as $50,000 per case. He said in a 2021 deposition that for nearly two decades he never blamed a cop for a death, according to the New York Times. (He told the Times that he did not recall the statement and disagreed with it.)\n\nHe was also one of excited delirium's most visible proponents, co-authoring a seminal white paper on the theory at an early IPICD conference.\n\nIn Prude's case, Vilke, who did not respond to a request for comment, was confident that police weren't at fault. He told the grand jury , convened to examine whether the cops should be charged with negligent homicide, that Prude died of excited delirium and not at the hands of the officers.\n\n\"I wouldn't do anything differently,\" he told a grand juror who asked if officers could have treated Prude better. The body voted 15-5 against charging the officers.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nThe office of James, the attorney general, retained Vilke to advise on its investigation into Prude's death, making him its sole cited outside medical expert.\n\nThe Monroe County medical examiner, who still works in that role and whose office declined to comment, ruled that Prude had died from \"complications\" from asphyxiation, excited delirium, and intoxication from PCP, the dissociative drug he was using. While a police practices expert hired by the attorney general said that pinning Prude on his stomach for three minutes was \"unreasonable\" and likely caused his death, Vilke steered investigators back toward excited delirium.\n\n\"Vilke noted that Mr. Prude displayed many symptoms consistent with Excited Delirium,\" the attorney general's office reported. The syndrome, brought on by his PCP use, \"caused Mr. Prude to suffer cardiac arrest.\"\n\nIn its final report , issued in February 2021, the attorney general's office dedicated nine pages to the topic of excited delirium. It acknowledged the controversy around the syndrome and its racial implications but declared that excited delirium is real and can cause sudden death.\n\nIt was in the report that James's office made its recommendation that first responders be trained in excited delirium. The report said the Rochester police academy barely taught the syndrome. It did not account for the police training materials produced by the Office of Mental Health.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "How Cops Can Secretly Track Your Phone\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nA guide to stingray surveillance technology, which may have been deployed at recent protests.\n\nSince May, as protesters around the country have marched against police brutality and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement, activists have spotted a recurring presence in the skies: mysterious planes and helicopters hovering overhead, apparently conducting surveillance on protesters. A press release from the Justice Department at the end of May revealed that the Drug Enforcement Agency and U.S. Marshals Service were asked by the Justice Department to provide unspecified support to law enforcement during protests. A few days later, a memo obtained by BuzzFeed News offered a little more insight on the matter; it revealed that shortly after protests began in various cities, the DEA had sought special authority from the Justice Department to covertly spy on Black Lives Matter protesters on behalf of law enforcement.\n\nAlthough the press release and memo didn't say what form the support and surveillance would take, it's likely that the two agencies were being asked to assist police for a particular reason. Both the DEA and the Marshals possess airplanes outfitted with so-called stingrays or dirtboxes: powerful technologies capable of tracking mobile phones or, depending on how they're configured, collecting data and communications from mobile phones in bulk.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage Protests for Black Lives\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nStingrays have been used on the ground and in the air by law enforcement for years but are highly controversial because they don't just collect data from targeted phones; they collect data from any phone in the vicinity of a device. That data can be used to identify people - protesters, for example - and track their movements during and after demonstrations, as well as to identify others who associate with them. They also can inject spying software onto specific phones or direct the browser of a phone to a website where malware can be loaded onto it, though it's not clear if any U.S. law enforcement agencies have used them for this purpose.\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

Stingrays are routinely used to target suspects in drug and other criminal investigations, but activists also believe the devices were used during protests against the Dakota Access pipeline , and against Black Lives Matter protesters over the last three months. The Justice Department requires federal agents to obtain a probable cause warrant to use the technology in criminal cases, but there is a carve-out for national security . Given that President Donald Trump has referred to protesters as \" terrorists ,\" and that paramilitary-style officers from the Department of Homeland Security have been deployed to the streets of Portland , Oregon , it's conceivable that surveillance conducted at recent demonstrations has been deemed a national security matter - raising the possibility that the government may have used stingray technology to collect data on protesters without warrants.\n\nTo better understand the kind of surveillance that may be directed at protesters, here's a breakdown of what we know and still don't know about stingrays, and why their use is so controversial.\n\nStingray is the generic name for an electronic surveillance tool that simulates a cell phone tower in order to force mobile phones and other devices to connect to it instead of to a legitimate cell tower. In doing so, the phone or other device reveals information about itself and its user to the operator of the stingray. Other common names for the tool are \"cell-site simulator\" and \"IMSI catcher.\"\n\nThe name stingray comes from the brand name of a specific commercial model of IMSI catcher made by the Florida-based Harris Corporation. That company's StingRay is a briefcase-sized device that can be operated from a vehicle while plugged into the cigarette lighter. Harris also makes products like the Harpoon, a signal booster that makes the StingRay more powerful, and the KingFish, a smaller hand-held device that operates like a stingray and can be used by a law enforcement agent while walking around outside a vehicle. About a dozen other companies make variants of the stingray with different capabilities. The surveillance equipment is pricey and often sold as a package. For example, in documents obtained by Motherboard in 2016, Harris offered a KingFish package that cost $157,300 and a StingRay package that cost $148,000, not including training and maintenance. Documents obtained this year by the American Civil Liberties Union indicate that Harris has upgraded the StingRay to a newer device it calls a Crossbow , though not a lot of information is known about how it works. Separately, a classified catalog of surveillance tools leaked to The Intercept in 2015 describes other similar devices.\n\nStingRay II, a cellular site simulator used for surveillance purposes manufactured by Harris Corporation, of Melbourne, Fla.\n\nPhones periodically and automatically broadcast their presence to the cell tower that is nearest to them, so that the phone carrier's network can provide them with service in that location. They do this even when the phone is not being used to make or receive a call. When a phone communicates with a cell tower, it reveals the unique ID or IMSI number (International Mobile Subscriber Identity) associated with the SIM card in the phone. The IMSI number identifies that phone and its owner as a paying customer of a cell carrier, and that number can be matched by the carrier to the owner's name, address, and phone number.\n\nA stingray masquerades as a cell tower in order to get phones to ping it instead of legitimate cell towers, and in doing so, reveal the phones' IMSI numbers. In the past, it did this by emitting a signal that was stronger than the signal generated by legitimate cell towers around it. The switch to 4G networks was supposed to address this in part by adding an authentication step so that mobile phones could tell if a cell tower is legitimate. But a security researcher named Roger Piqueras Jover found that the authentication on 4G doesn't occur until after the phone has already revealed its IMSI number, which means that stingrays can still grab this data before the phone determines it's not communicating with an authentic cell tower and switches to one that is authenticated. That vulnerability still exists in the 5G protocol , says Jover. Though the 5G protocol offers a feature that encrypts the IMSI when it's disclosed during pre-authentication communication, law enforcement would simply be able to ask phone carriers to decrypt it for them. And a group of researchers from Purdue University and the University of Iowa also found a way to guess an IMSI number without needing to get a carrier to decrypt it.\n\nBecause a stingray is not really a tower on the carrier's network, calls and messages to and from a phone can't go through while the phone is communicating with the stingray. So after the stingray captures the device's IMSI number and location, the stingray \"releases\" the phone so that it can connect to a real cell tower. It can do this by broadcasting a message to that phone that effectively tells the phone to find a different tower.\n\nLaw enforcement can use a stingray either to identify all of the phones in the vicinity of the stingray or a specific phone, even when the phones are not in use. Law enforcement can then, with a subpoena, ask a phone carrier to provide the customer name and address associated with that number or numbers. They can also obtain a historical log of all of the cell towers a phone has pinged in the recent past to track where it has been, or they can obtain the cell towers it's pinging in real time to identify the user's current location. By catching multiple IMSI numbers in the vicinity of a stingray, law enforcement can also potentially uncover associations between people by seeing which phones ping the same cell towers around the same time.\n\nIf law enforcement already knows the IMSI number of a specific phone and person they are trying to locate, they can program that IMSI number into the stingray and it will tell them if that phone is nearby. Law enforcement can also home in on the location of a specific phone and its user by moving the stingray around a geographical area and measuring the phone's signal strength as it connects to the stingray. The Harris StingRay can be operated from a patrol vehicle as it drives around a neighborhood to narrow a suspect's location to a specific cluster of homes or a building, at which point law enforcement can switch to the hand-held KingFish, which offers even more precision. For example, once law enforcement has narrowed the location of a phone and suspect to an office or apartment complex using the StingRay, they can walk through the complex and hallways using the KingFish to find the specific office or apartment where a mobile phone and its user are located.\n\nNo. In 2008, authorities used a StingRay and a KingFish to locate a suspect who was using an air card: an internet-connectivity device that plugs into a computer and allows the user to get online through a wireless cellular network. The suspect, Daniel Rigmaiden , was an identity thief who was operating from an apartment in San Jose, California. Rigmaiden had used a stolen credit card number and a fake name and address to register his internet account with Verizon. With Verizon's help, the FBI was able to identify him. They determined the general neighborhood in San Jose where Rigmaiden was using the air card so they could position their stingray in the area and move it around until they found the apartment building from which his signal was coming. They then walked around the apartment complex with a hand-held KingFish or similar device to pinpoint the precise apartment Rigmaiden was using.\n\nA dirtbox is the common name for specific models of an IMSI catcher that are made by a Boeing subsidiary, Maryland-based Digital Receiver Technology - hence the name \"DRT box.\" They are reportedly used by the DEA and Marshals Service from airplanes to intercept data from mobile phones. A 2014 Wall Street Journal article revealed that the Marshals Service began using dirtboxes in Cessna airplanes in 2007. An airborne dirtbox has the ability to collect data on many more phones than a ground-based stingray; it can also move more easily and quickly over wide areas. According to the 2006 catalog of surveillance technologies leaked in 2015, models of dirtboxes described in that document can be configured to track up to 10,000 targeted IMSI numbers or phones.\n\nStingrays and dirtboxes can be configured for use in either active or passive mode. In active mode, these technologies broadcast to devices and communicate with them. Passive mode involves grabbing whatever data and communication is occurring in real time across cellular networks without requiring the phone to communicate directly with the interception device. The data captured can include the IMSI number as well as text messages, email, and voice calls.\n\nIf that data or communication is encrypted, then it would be useless to anyone intercepting it if they don't also have a way to  decrypt it. Phones that are using 4G employ strong encryption. But stingrays can force phones to downgrade to 2G, a less secure protocol, and tell the phone to use either no encryption or use a weak encryption that can be cracked. They can do this because even though most people use 4G these days, there are some areas of the world where 2G networks are still common, and therefore all phones have to have the ability to communicate on those networks.\n\nThe versions of stingrays used by the military can intercept the contents of mobile communications - text messages, email, and voice calls - and decrypt some types of this mobile communication. The military also uses a jamming or denial-of-service feature that prevents adversaries from detonating bombs with a mobile phone.\n\nIn addition to collecting the IMSI number of a device and intercepting communications, military-grade IMSI catchers can also spoof text messages to a phone, according to David Burgess, a telecommunications engineer who used to work with U.S. defense contractors supporting overseas military operations. Burgess says that if the military knows the phone number and IMSI number of a target, it can use an IMSI catcher to send messages to other phones as if they are coming from the target's phone. They can also use the IMSI catcher for a so-called man in the middle attack so that calls from one target pass through the IMSI catcher to the target phone. In this way, they can record the call in real time and potentially listen to the conversation if it is unencrypted, or if they are able to decrypt it. The military systems can also send a silent SMS message to a phone to alter its settings so that the phone will send text messages through a server the military controls instead of the mobile carrier's server.\n\nVersions of the devices used by the military and intelligence agencies can potentially inject malware into targeted phones, depending on how secure the phone is. They can do this in two ways: They can either redirect the phone's browser to a malicious web site where malware can be downloaded to the phone if the browser has a software vulnerability the attackers can exploit; or they can inject malware from the stingray directly into the baseband of the phone if the baseband software has a vulnerability. Malware injected into the baseband of a phone is harder to detect. Such malware can be used to turn the phone into a listening device to spy on conversations. Recently, Amnesty International reported on the cases of two Moroccan activists whose phones may have been targeted through such network injection attacks to install spyware made by an Israeli company.\n\nU.S. law enforcement use of stingrays domestically is more curtailed, given that they, unlike the military, need to obtain warrants or court orders to use the devices in federal investigations. But there is little transparency or oversight around how the devices are used by federal agents and local police, so there is still a lot that is unknown: for example, whether they've ever been used to record the contents of mobile phone communications or to install malware on phones.\n\nNews stories suggest that some models of stingrays used by the Marshals Service can extract text messages, contacts, and photos from phones, though they don't say how the devices do this. Documents obtained by the ACLU in 2015 also indicate such devices do have the ability to record the numbers of incoming and outgoing calls and the date, time, and duration of the calls, as well as to intercept the content of voice and text communications. But the Justice Department has long asserted publicly that the stingrays it uses domestically do not intercept the content of communications . The Justice Department has stated that the devices \"may be capable of intercepting the contents of communications and, therefore, such devices must be configured to disable the interception function, unless interceptions have been authorized by a Title III [wiretapping] order.\"\n\nAs for jamming communications domestically, Dakota Access pipeline protesters at Standing Rock, North Dakota, in 2016 described planes and helicopters flying overhead that they believed were using technology to jam mobile phones. Protesters described having problems such as phones crashing, livestreams being interrupted, and issues uploading videos and other posts to social media.\n\nThe devices don't just pick up data about targeted phones. Law enforcement may be tracking a specific phone of a known suspect, but any phone in the vicinity of the stingray that is using the same cellular network as the targeted phone or device will connect to the stingray. Documents in a 2011 criminal case in Canada showed that devices used by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police had a range of a third of a mile, and in just three minutes of use, one device had intercepted 136 different phones .\n\nLaw enforcement can also use a stingray in a less targeted way to sweep up information about all nearby phones. During the time a phone is connecting to or communicating with a stingray, service is disrupted for those phones until the stingray releases them. The connection should last only as long as it takes for the phone to reveal its IMSI number to the stingray, but it's not clear what kind of testing and oversight the Justice Department has done to ensure that the devices release phones. Stingrays are supposed to allow 911 calls to pass through to a legitimate cell tower to avoid disrupting emergency services, but other emergency calls a user may try to make while their phone is connected to a stingray will not get through until the stingray releases their phone. It's also not clear how effective the devices are at letting 911 calls go through. The FBI and DHS have indicated that they haven't commissioned studies to measure this, but a study conducted by federal police in Canada found that the 911 bypass didn't always work.\n\nDepending on how many phones are in the vicinity of a stingray, hundreds could connect to the device and potentially have service disrupted.\n\nThe technology is believed to have originated in the military, though it's not clear when it was first used in combat zones or domestically in the U.S. The earliest public mention of a stingray-like device being used by U.S. law enforcement occurred in 1994, when the FBI used a crude, jury-rigged version of the tool to track former hacker Kevin Mitnick ; authorities referred to that device as a Triggerfish. In a case in Utah in 2009, an FBI agent revealed in a court document that cell-site simulators had been in use by law enforcement for more than a decade. He also said they weren't just used by the FBI but also by the Marshals Service, the Secret Service, and other agencies. Recent documents obtained by the ACLU also indicate that between 2017 and 2019, the Department of Homeland Security's Homeland Security Investigations unit has used stingrays at least 466 times in investigations. BuzzFeed News had previously obtained records showing that from 2013 to 2017, HSI had used the technology 1,885 times .\n\nThe other controversy with stingrays involves secrecy and lack of transparency around their use. Law enforcement agencies and the companies that make the devices have prevented the public from obtaining information about their capabilities and from learning how often the technology is deployed in investigations. Agencies sign nondisclosure agreements with the companies, which they use as a shield whenever journalists or others file public records requests to obtain information about the technology. Law enforcement agencies claim criminals could craft anti-surveillance methods to undermine the technology if they knew how it worked. The companies themselves cite trade secrets and proprietary information to prevent the public from obtaining sales literature and manuals about the technology.\n\nFor years, law enforcement used the devices without obtaining a court order or warrant. Even when they did seek approval from a court, they often described the technology in misleading terms to make it seem less invasive. They would often refer to stingrays in court documents as a \"pen register device,\" passive devices that sit on a network and record the numbers dialed from a certain phone number. They withheld the fact that the devices force phones to connect to them, that they force other phones that aren't the target device to connect to them, and that they can perform more functions than simply grabbing an IMSI number. Most significantly, they withheld the fact that the device emits signals that can track a user and their phone inside a private residence. After the FBI used a stingray to track Rigmaiden (the identity thief in San Jose) in his apartment, Rigmaiden's lawyers got the Justice Department to acknowledge it qualified as a Fourth Amendment search that would require a warrant.\n\nLaw enforcement agents have not only deceived judges, however; they've also misled defense attorneys seeking information about how agents tracked their clients. In some court documents, law enforcement officials have indicated that they obtained location information about the defendant from a \" confidential source ,\" when in truth they used a stingray to track them.\n\nTo address this deception, the Justice Department in 2015 implemented a new policy requiring all federal agents engaged in criminal investigations to obtain a probable cause search warrant before using a stingray. It also requires agents and prosecutors to tell judges when the warrant they are seeking is for a stingray; and it requires them to limit the use of the stingray's capabilities to tracking the location of a phone and logging the phone numbers for calls received and made by the phone. They cannot collect the contents of communication, such as text messages and emails. And agents are required to purge the data they collect from non-targeted phones within 24 hours or 30 days, depending on the circumstances.\n\nThe problem, however, is that Justice Department policy is not law. And although the policy includes state and local law enforcement agencies when they are working on a case with federal agents and want to use the devices, it does not cover those agencies when they are working on cases alone . To address this loophole, lawmakers would need to pass a federal law banning the use of stingrays without a warrant, but efforts to do so have so far been unsuccessful.\n\nOne bigger issue with the Justice Department policy is that, as noted above, it only applies to criminal investigations, not national security ones, and it also includes a carve-out for \"exigent circumstances\" that are not clearly defined. Federal agents are not required to seek a warrant to use the technology in cases involving such circumstances. Whether the government has used the technology against Black Lives Matter protesters without a warrant is likely something that will remain a secret for some time.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "It's Been Two Years Since Cops Killed Tyre Nichols. Here's What You Need to Know.\n\nRon Adar via Zuma Press\n\nJanuary 10, 2025, marks the second anniversary of the death of Tyre Nichols, a 29-year-old Black man who was restrained and fatally beaten by five now-former Memphis police officers during a traffic stop. After countless marches, talks with politicians, and pending court cases, his family are still fighting for justice for their loved one.\n\n\"This year has been unbearable,\" said his mother, RowVaughn Wells, at a vigil on Tuesday. \"I had to listen to a cop tell people that they just stopped my son for nothing, that he was not a threat. We had to hear all of this. But what made it so difficult is the fact that it finally sank in that I would never see my son again.\"\n\nReleased three weeks after his death, the video of Nichols' brutal beating shook the nation, with then-President Biden calling Wells to express his condolences. Attorney Anthony Romanucci described Nichols as \"a human piñata for those police officers.\"\n\nOne of the most high-profile cases of police brutality of 2023, the widespread coverage of his death helped shine a light on the long history of misconduct by the Memphis Police Deparment, and reignited the nation's long-held conversation about police brutality.\n\nAs we approach the two-year anniversary of Nichols' passing, here's what you need to know about the case.\n\nNichols was beaten by five members of Memphis PD's SCORPION Unit, a police task force that was hastily disbanded after footage of the attack was released to the public.\n\nIn January 0f 2023, Emmitt Martin, Desmond Mills Jr., Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, and Justin Smith were all arrested and hit with several state felony charges. A federal court indicted them eight months later.\n\nIn October 2024, a judge found Bean, Haley and Smith guilty on federal charges of witness tampering; however, they dodged the most serious charge levied against them: violating Nichols' civil rights, causing his death.\n\nAvoiding the trial, Martin and Mills both pleaded guilty and testified against their former colleagues. But these aren't the only charges they're facing.\n\nOn April 28, 2025, the ex-officers will go on trial for second-degree murder, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated assault, official misconduct, and official oppression.\n\nA public records request by The Commercial Appeal found that police department had either suspended or reprimanded four out of the five officers before they'd beaten Nichols. Records show that the officers were reprimanded for allegedly failing to report domestic violence, causing multiple car accidents with squad vehicles, and not documenting forceful arrests.\n\nThe Memphis Commercial Appeal reports that the men \"faced little-to-no consequences.\"\n\nSome of these same officers allegedly beat another man just three days before Nichols. Monterrious Harris, a 22-year-old, was grabbed, kicked and punched by four of the officers involved in the Tyre Nichols attack. And the accusations didn't stop there.\n\nAs my colleague Samantha Michaels wrote last year :\n\nAs prosecutors review cases, other victims continue to come forward. Darick Lane, 32, alleges that two of the officers who killed Nichols, Desmond Mills Jr. and Justin Smith, pulled him out of a car window in June and threatened to shoot him if he moved, according to the Washington Post . Another officer, Demetrius Haley, is meanwhile accused of beating Cordarlrius Sledge while Sledge was incarcerated in the Shelby County jail in 2015, according to another lawsuit that was dismissed on technical grounds. Sledge said he was trying to hide a cellphone when Haley and two other officers attacked him, slamming his head into a sink until he blacked out .\n\nThe beating was so brutal that a large group of prisoners on the cellblock wrote a letter to the corrections director to complain: \"We are truly asking that this matter gets looked into before someone gets hurt really bad or lose their life because of some unprofessional officers,\" they wrote.\n\nThe alleged wrongdoing was not limited to just the indicted officers. Nichols' death kickstarted a 17-month federal investigation into the Memphis Police Department. In December 2024, the Department of Justice released a jaw-dropping, 73-page report detailing the department's long pattern of misconduct, discrimination, and excessive force.\n\n\"Our investigation found that officers use force to punish and retaliate against people who do not immediately do as they say,\" the DOJ's Civil Rights Division Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke wrote in the report . Here's a quick run-down of some of the egregious actions the Memphis PD stands accused of:\n\nHigher-ups reportedly failed to hold their officers accountable and didn't conduct thorough investigations into many of these incidents. The report concludes with a serious call for reform, recommending 18 remedial measures.\n\n\"This process and these findings uncovered that our city has a lot of work to do,\" said Reagan Fondren, Acting US Attorney  for the Western District of Tennessee, in a statement . \"Memphians are rightly concerned with gun violence and violent crime. They are also rightly concerned about the collective approach that we must take to tackle these issues.\"\n\nIn response to the report, the city plans to hire former Judge Bernice Donald, Tennessee's first Black woman to hold a judgeship, to supervise the department. According to ABC 24 , Donald will lead nine-person task force to come up with a plan for reform.\n\nTyre Nichols' family is suing the city of Memphis, several current and former Memphis PD officials, and all the officers involved for $550 million. The complaint states that Memphis police lied to Nichols' mother about his arrest, claiming that he was driving under the influence.\n\nThe suit, like the Justice Department report, also claims that officials turned a \"blind eye\" to the SCORPION unit's violent policing.\n\n\"How does this horrific and unconstitutional treatment of Black men and women by law enforcement continue to happen?\" said attorney Ben Crump, who is representing Nichols' family, in a statement that likened the Memphis officers to the lynch mob that murdered Emmett Till. \"Tyre's lynch mob was dressed in department sweatshirts and vests,\" Crump wrote,\" sanctioned by the entities that supplied them.\"\n\nOn January 3, Judge Mark Norris pushed the trial to July 2026-the second such delay-citing several reasons, including that officials would prefer proceedings to start after the separate murder trial begins.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Meet the Company That Writes the Policies That Protect Cops\n\nRob Dobi\n\nMadison Pauly September/October 2020 Issue\n\nEarly one morning in June 2015, after Kris Jackson had been fighting loudly with his girlfriend, a police officer knocked on the door to their motel room a few blocks from California's Lake Tahoe. Jackson, a Black 22-year-old who was on probation for a drug offense, did not stick around to deal with the cops. Wearing only a pair of shorts, he hoisted himself partway out of the bathroom window into the cool, dark air of the motel's back alley. That's when another officer, Joshua Klinge, rounded the corner of the building, spotted Jackson hanging out the window, and shot him from several feet away. Klinge later claimed that Jackson looked \"aggressive\" and had a gun. No gun was found. Jackson died at the hospital a few hours later.\n\nAs in the majority of police killings, the local district attorney did not charge Klinge, who was placed on paid leave before being allowed to retire quietly. Jackson's parents filed a federal lawsuit against the officer, several police department staff, and the city of South Lake Tahoe, arguing that not only had Klinge used excessive force against their son, but that the police department had an illegal policy allowing him to do so. That policy , written by a company called Lexipol , stated that officers could use deadly force to protect themselves or others from any \"imminent\" threat of serious injury or death. An \"imminent\" threat, the policy explained, was broader than an \"immediate\" threat such as someone pointing a gun. It included any situation in which a \"reasonable officer\" would believe a suspect had a weapon and intended to use it.\n\nLexipol says it has provided policies, training, or services to 8,100 public safety agencies, offering customizable handbooks and instruction modules to police departments as well as fire, EMS, and corrections agencies. According to the company , its copyrighted policies, which cover everything from avoiding racial profiling to policing protests, are based on \"best practices\" as well as federal and state standards and recent laws and court rulings. Since Lexipol was founded nearly 20 years ago, its model has proved immensely popular with smaller police departments that may not have the resources to keep their own policy manuals updated. Yet its policies are also used by larger cities, including Oakland and Salt Lake City. As many as 95 percent of law enforcement agencies in California have purchased Lexipol policies or received them through their insurers.\n\nSome of the company's policies, including the use-of-force policy challenged by Jackson's family, depart in significant ways from recommendations by mainstream policing organizations. The National Consensus Policy on Use of Force , a collaboration between 11 major law enforcement groups, requires cops to try deescalation techniques before using force if possible. Lexipol discourages police departments from requiring them. Lexipol's policy allows officers to shoot at moving vehicles in some circumstances, a practice that the Police Executive Research Forum recommends against because it may injure or kill civilians and officers. The ACLU has contested Lexipol's rules for handling immigration violations, which in some states include a provision allowing cops to consider \"a lack of English proficiency\" when deciding whether someone may have entered the country illegally.\n\nDespite these challenges, the company has marketed its policies as a way to decrease cities' liability in police misconduct lawsuits. In its communications with potential clients, Lexipol has claimed that agencies that use its policies are sued less frequently and pay out smaller settlements, according to a Texas Law Review analysis of public records. The company's critics argue that it accomplishes this with vague or permissive rules that meet bare-minimum legal requirements rather than holding officers to a higher standard. \"They want to make it impossible, or nearly impossible, for anybody to point to the policy and say it was violated,\" says Carl Takei, an ACLU senior staff attorney specializing in police practices. \"Defining 'imminent' in a way that removes all of the immi­nence? That's a classic Lexipol policy.\" Samuel Sinyangwe, a racial justice activist and data analyst who has looked at hundreds of police departments' policies, concludes that Lexipol's use-of-force guidelines usually lack requirements that have been shown to reduce police violence. Lexipol did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLexipol was started in 2003; two of its three founders were former cops who became lawyers. One, Bruce Praet, spent a decade as an officer in Orange County, where he twice beat misconduct lawsuits, according to a 1992 Los Angeles Times profile . Inspired by his defense lawyer, Michael Stone-who later represented one of Rodney King's assailants-Praet went on to become a police union lawyer before starting a firm that specialized in defending cops in cases involving shootings, pursuits, and dog bites. In 1998, he co-wrote the precursor to Lexipol's first law enforcement manual. From the last three years alone, he has defended police in nearly three dozen federal lawsuits.\n\nPraet is explicit about his desire to give police officers as much discretion as possible. \"One of our secret sauces, so to speak, is rarely if ever will you see the use of the word 'shall' in our policies,\" he told officials during a webinar last year. \"Nothing in police work is black and white except the car you drive...so policies need to be flexible.\" Today, he serves on Lexipol's board while continuing to defend cops across California. \"Every single case, he argues that the officer just followed his policies and training,\" says Michael Haddad, an attorney who has faced off against Praet in several police misconduct lawsuits and is representing Kris Jackson's father. Praet did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nMultiple police departments that have been sued over Lexipol-authored policies have turned to Praet to defend them. \"It's sort of a form of double dipping,\" Takei, the ACLU attorney, says. \"The local government is paying for a Lexipol policy that's marketed on the premise that it would prevent lawsuits-and is paying again when officers kill people, and then their family sues the local government.\"\n\nIn the South Lake Tahoe case, a federal judge has spent more than a year considering Haddad's argument that Lexipol's expansive definition of an \"imminent\" threat violated the Fourth Amendment's protection from unreasonable searches or seizures. In the meantime, California's legislature passed the Act to Save Lives , which promised to hold officers to a higher standard by allowing them to shoot people only when \"necessary,\" not just when \"reasonable.\" The bill lost support from the Black Lives Matter Global Network and other activists after its backers made concessions to police groups, including removing the definition of \"necessary.\" After it passed, Lexipol updated its California use of force policy, including its definition of \"imminent,\" to match the bill's language. But the company maintains that little has really changed. In a webinar with police officials last year, Praet hinted that he had personally worked with legislators to water down the bill, which he said was \"near and dear\" to his heart. \"We-law enforcement-got 95 percent of what we needed out of [the bill],\" he assured them.\n\n\"They have one private company that has the power to rewrite the use-of-force standards for America's largest state, and that's just unacceptable,\" says Sinyangwe, who was involved in the fight over the bill. \"These are policies that are life and death. They are policies that ought to be shaped with input from community members, and instead they're being written by a private corporation that very clearly aligns with the police narrative that use of force is justified and acceptable, even in cases where it's unnecessary.\"\n\nAbout a year after her son, Kris, was killed, Angela Ainley drove to South Lake Tahoe to stay in the motel room where he was shot. She climbed into the small bathroom window and sat there, staring into the dark alley, trying to understand what her son had experienced. \"He was trying to get out the window because he was afraid,\" she says. She believes Klinge lied about seeing a gun, and that Praet is helping the police department cover for him. Patrick Jackson, Kris' father, says he hasn't smiled since his son was killed. \"I just want justice for my family,\" he says. He hopes their case could help end a system in which police get away with killing people simply because they perceive a threat. \"Until they really solve that problem, until they take away that ability to have that excuse,\" he says, \"I don't know what they're really changing.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "A Road Map for Getting Rid of Racist Cops\n\ntaka4332/iStock/Getty Images Plus\n\nIt's hard to forget the image: Thomas Robertson and Jacob Fracker, two off-duty Virginia police officers, pose for a selfie in the US Capitol, one of them raising his middle finger to the camera, as throngs of Trump supporters ransack the building to try to stop lawmakers from certifying the presidential election. The photo circulated widely on Facebook and other social media platforms in the days following the January 6 mob.\n\nAs a result, the two officers were fired this week from the Rocky Mount police department, and they're now facing federal charges . It's likely they weren't the only cops to join the insurrectionists: Police departments around the country are also investigating more than a dozen off-duty cops who allegedly participated in the violent mob, and examining allegations that other officers attended the rally in the hours beforehand.\n\nBut waiting until after an armed insurrection to investigate officers with extremist views seems like far too little, too late. In the wake of the Capitol attack, legal scholars and activists argue that police departments should do much more to rid their teams of racist officers, including by regularly screening their social media posts. \"They should be searching their emails and text messages for key words associated with far-right extremism and racial animus,\" says former DC public defender Vida Johnson , an associate law professor at Georgetown University who has studied white supremacist infiltration of police.\n\nIn recent years, the Plain View Project, a collaboration between a Philadelphia lawyer and journalists at the nonprofit Injustice Watch, has documented around 5,000 bigoted social media posts by accounts belonging to current and former law enforcement officials. These days, many more posts are coming to light: One of the Virginia officers who posed for the Capitol selfie gave clues on social media weeks before the mob, writing on Facebook in December that he was prepared to start an armed rebellion, according to an FBI investigation. The other Virginia officer sent social media messages to a friend afterward, bragging that he'd peed in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's toilet. \"[I]t was f***** amazing,\" he wrote. (Both officers now say they did not participate in any violence or property damage in the Capitol.)\n\nI spoke with Johnson about some simple solutions that police departments could adopt to crack down on bigots with badges after decades of allowing them to patrol the streets.\n\nWhat was your reaction to the news that off-duty police officers joined the mob that stormed the Capitol?\n\nObviously I was shocked by the scale of what happened, and more than a little bit scared. I definitely was not surprised.\n\nPolice departments around the country are now investigating some of their officers who were in DC that day. Do you have any thoughts about these investigations and the way discipline is being handled?\n\nIt's a great step that departments are actually taking a look at their officers who were involved. Unfortunately, we're not going to know much more than what they share with us. Because of collective bargaining agreements between municipalities and police departments, and also confidentiality statutes, we don't know an awful lot about police officers and the kind of discipline they're exposed to. The Capitol Police is one of the most opaque police departments, but there aren't a lot of police departments that are particular transparent. So we're not going to know a lot about what kind of investigations are done. I find that worrisome.\n\nWhat should police departments be doing to root out racist police?\n\nOne of the problems we saw on January 6 is that there's a disproportionate number of people on police departments who hold far-right views. Really, it's not a surprise. Ten percent of the [total US] population believes it's okay to hold neo-Nazi views. Twelve percent of the population, based on a Reuters poll, said they support the rioters. You have to assume an even bigger percentage of people currently in law enforcement hold those types of beliefs. Whether they act on them or not, it's going to color the way they see the world and the way they police communities.\n\nWe know that white people are overrepresented on police forces, and that needs to change. It's not to say Black officers are all good or white officers are all bad, but it's definitely something we need to look at. This is just anecdotal, but when you look at who was taking selfies with the crowd, they were the white officers. When you look at who acted heroically, and lots of officers acted heroically, but the person we think of is that Black officer who led the rioters away from Congresspeople who were only feet away. So we need to diversify police departments.\n\nWe also need better background checks of police officers-more personality testing of new hires. There's this horrible story of a Little Rock, Arkansas, officer who was completely honest during hiring when he said he attended a KKK rally when he was a teenager, and he was hired anyway, and he went on to shoot and kill an unarmed teen there. So we can't just do background checks; we have to not hire people who set off alarm bells.\n\nAnother thing that hasn't happened is that we need to check in on officers periodically during their tenure in the police department. I use this example: We don't give someone a driver's license when they're 16 and say, \"Go ahead. You can drive for the next 70 years.\" We check in on them to make sure their eyes still work, that they're thinking clearly, that they don't have dementia. Every year or two, police departments should be doing social media checks, having [officers] come in for new rounds of psychological testing. They should be searching their emails and text messages for key words associated with far-right extremism and racial animus. Police officers need to agree to a social media policy that makes it impossible for them to spew hate online, and they need to be fired when they violate it.\n\nIt is really difficult to fire police officers due to a lot of agreements that municipalities have made with police unions , and that needs to change. Because until it is easy to fire a police officer who crosses a line or violates the law, we are going to continue to have this problem. Good officers have no incentive to tell on officers [who commit misconduct], because at this point they have every reason to believe those officers will be on the force the next day or the next year.\n\nIn one of your papers , you argue that police departments have a legal obligation to regularly screen officers. Can you talk more about that?\n\nBoth police departments and prosecutors' offices have an obligation under something called the Brady doctrine. There's a case called Brady v. Maryland that was a Supreme Court case several decades ago, and it said the government-and the government means both prosecutors and police-has to turn over any information that's favorable to the defense for use by the defense at trial. For example, if a complaining witness in a case has a prior conviction for perjury, that's something they need to turn over to the defense so that the defense can cross-examine that witness with that information. Similarly, I argue that issues of police discipline and anything else you could cross-examine a police officer about should be turned over to the defense.\n\nMany prosecutors' offices already do this. The US Attorney's Office in DC and the San Francisco prosecutor's office turn over issues of police discipline to the defense for use at trial. But what they're not doing, and should do-all prosecutors' offices should-is some social media checks to see whether these officers hold any biases against the communities they police. So for example, in the OJ Simpson trial, basically the way the defense won that case was by showing that the main detective had used a racial epithet toward Black people in the past, and he lied about it on the stand, and then they cross-examined him with it. That shows how effective that kind of cross-examination can be. So that's something that police and prosecutors need to do more seriously.\n\nBut there's not a lot of incentive for prosecutors to do these kinds of in-depth looks at police officers because they don't want to ruffle police officers' feathers, because they rely on them so much. They don't want to step on police officers' toes. That's a problem.\n\nWe really need independent people looking into both prosecutors' decisions on whether to prosecute police officers and also the issue of officer discipline. A good police department would pay an outside group to do an internal review of the social media policies, searching for emails and text messages of police officers. Because you're more likely to root out the problem when you don't have people who may have been to an officer's daughter's birthday or wedding being the one looking into whether they should stay on the force.\n\nUnder the Brady doctrine, is the government required not only to hand over information to the defense that it's aware of, but to actively be searching for information about these officers?\n\nWith the proliferation of social media platforms as a way to communicate, and the fact that officers are texting with one another rather than using their recorded radio channels to communicate, I think we're at a point where to not look into these things is like putting your head in the sand. As long as other officers know this stuff, then the prosecutor is on notice to look into it. So I think yes, the law says they need to look into it. Not everyone would agree with me.\n\nAre there any outside groups already doing these social media checks, or any that would be well tasked to do this?\n\nNot that I'm aware of. We do it in other instances: We appoint special prosecutors-calls for this usually come in the wake of a police shooting, where a local prosecutor doesn't prosecute a police officer. But we really need to think about this more broadly. Otherwise this problem is going to continue. It was back in 2006 that the FBI warned of the infiltration of white supremacists in police departments, and almost nothing's been done to curb the problem. We've let it just grow for almost 15 years.\n\nEven if police departments had to do these social media investigations themselves, wouldn't they be pretty well equipped to do it? Since they already have teams of people who analyze social media posts of suspected gang members or people suspected of criminal activity.\n\nYeah, big police departments do. But it's so easy to scrutinize someone different than you. It's a different matter to dive deep into someone who you know well. The tendency is to give them the benefit of the doubt, cut them some slack. You try to read a different meaning into what their post says. So I think we don't want to leave it to other police officers who may have known the officer they are looking into since they were a cadet. Or they've been to the bar with them, they've been to each other's weddings. That's a recipe for more of the same.\n\nYou've heard the story of the officers in Wilmington, North Carolina, over the summer. One of them accidentally activated his body cam, and it caught this whole conversation between several officers who were dreaming of a race war and of wiping Black people off the map, and referring to a Black woman they'd arrested earlier that day as the n-word. There were multiple officers having this type of discussion. And the only way it was discovered was because someone happened to be independently reviewing body camera equipment to see if it worked. It wasn't that one of the officers who was more quiet was like, \"God, these guys are scary.\" No. Those guys just continued to work together every day.\n\nThere was another story of officers in San Jose over the summer. One of them posted , \"I say re-purpose the hijabs into nooses.\" This was on a Facebook group with other officers. Why would he feel comfortable posting that unless he knew his back was covered? The culture of policing is that you don't tell. There's this blue wall of silence. And until that is destroyed, you're going to continue to have this problem.\n\nI've seen the term \" ghost skins \" in some articles, referring to officers who are white supremacists but don't openly display their beliefs; they try to blend into society and further their agenda that way. How common is that?\n\nIt's so hard to know how common any of this is. But that's precisely what that 2006 FBI report warned about. Police officers have access to sensitive information. For example, they might know if they're looking into the Proud Boys or the Three Percenters or the Oath Keepers, so they can tip them off. That's one reason why careers in law enforcement are so appealing to people who hold far-right belief systems. They get this opportunity to not only police people of color, to control their goings and comings and how they live their lives, but also they get this inside information about whether [far-right groups] are in fact being investigated.\n\nThere's an argument that departments can't fire officers simply for having white supremacist beliefs-it has to be about behavior, which I think could include social media posts. Do you have any thoughts on that?\n\nWell, we can never know what's in someone's mind, but certainly we can fire them when they act on their white supremacist views, like publicly posting something or texting something to another officer, because that impacts the behavior of others. There are cases that say that an officer might have a First Amendment right to express some of his views, but his right to express those views don't outweigh the police department's interest in a good relationship with the public. Anything that undermines the integrity of the office is grounds for dismissal.\n\nYou previously worked in DC's public defender office. Did you encounter any cases there that involved racist police that got you wanting to study this more?\n\nIn my time as a public defender, I saw all sorts of instances of racial bias. Our clients were 95 percent Black in a city that's less than 50 percent African American. But in terms of explicit bias, it really wasn't until I had the time as an academic to sit back and think about this problem. I was at Georgetown-I teach a clinic there. Our students represent people in Superior Court. And there was a police officer who wore a T-shirt with a symbol on it that's connected to white supremacy. The middle of the shirt showed an angel of death, like a Grim Reaper, and in one hand he was holding a rifle, and in the other hand he was holding a Metropolitan Police Department badge. This officer wore the T-shirt to court; that's how it was discovered .\n\nAt the same time I heard about a scandal in another police department about some racist text messages-it might have been Miami. That's what connected all the dots for me. The thing about the T-shirt that really troubled me is that it showed that this white officer saw himself as not a public servant to this community that he was policing, but as an angel of death, as someone at war with them. Someone who's goal was to intimidate them. And then ultimately it was discovered that there wasn't just one of these T-shirts-the entire shift had these. And some of those officers were Black. So whether it's racism or not, there's a problem in police culture where they don't see themselves as servants of the community.\n\nThat reminds me of another case you mentioned in your paper, in Cincinnati, of the officer who had the-\n\n-the Confederate flag...\n\nYeah, he wore a Confederate flag T-shirt underneath his uniform, and the judge wouldn't allow that to be considered as evidence in the trial.\n\nEvidence of racial bias. Ah! The other thing that's really crazy about that T-shirt [in DC] is he wore it to court. Just think about how comfortable you are in your job that you think you can wear a T-shirt like that. One that shows you as an angel of death. It was the Seventh District, which is one of the Blackest precincts in DC. It was the 12 a.m. to 8 a.m. shift. Just imagine that you think you can wear that to court and that that's okay. You're not gonna get in any trouble. And indeed, nothing happened to any of these officers who had these T-shirts.\n\nThey're supposed to be protecting and serving us. But unfortunately it seems like a lot of departments see themselves at odds with or even at war with the rest of the community. That's a culture within policing that needs to change.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "What a World Without Cops Would Look Like\n\nMother Jones illustration; Julio Cortez/AP\n\nFollowing the killing of George Floyd in Minneapolis and an outbreak of police violence in response to nationwide protests, calls for change in America's police departments are coming from activists , public officials , and celebrities . But unlike past attempts to reform the police in the wake of high-profile killings of people of color, which often centered on increased oversight or training, this time the demands are far more radical: defund police departments or abolish them entirely .\n\nEfforts to cut off funding for police have already taken root in Minneapolis, where the police department's budget currently totals $193 million . (In 2017, the department received 36 percent of the city's general fund expenditures.) Two days after Floyd's killing, the president of the University of Minnesota declared that that the campus would no longer contract with the police department to provide security for large gatherings like football games. On Friday, a member of the Minneapolis Board of Education announced a resolution to end the school district's contract to station 14 cops in its schools . And community groups such as the Black Visions Collective and Reclaim the Block are petitioning the city council to cut the police department's budget by $45 million and reinvest the money in health and (non-police) safety programs.\n\nWith other campaigns to cut police budgets underway in cities like Los Angeles and New York and calls to defund the police gathering steam on social media, I spoke with Brooklyn College sociology professor Alex Vitale, the coordinator of the Policing & Social Justice Project and author of The End of Policing , to talk about the sweeping vision of police abolition and what it means in practice.\n\nMadison Pauly: Why defund the police, rather than reform them?\n\nAlex Vitale: Five years ago, in the wake of the murders of Mike Brown and Eric Garner and Tamir Rice , we were told, \"Don't worry, we're going to fix it. We're going to give the police implicit bias training . We're going to hold some community police encounter sessions. We're gonna buy some body cameras.\" A whole set of what we often refer to as \"procedural reforms\" designed to make the police more professional, less biased, more transparent-and that this is going to magically fix the problem. But things did not get better. People are still being killed, and more importantly, the problem of overpolicing remains.\n\nWhy didn't it work?\n\nProcedural justice folks, they want to restore the public's trust in the police so that the police can go back to policing. But this ignores the question of what they are policing, and whether they should be policing it. We have [millions of] low-level arrests in the United States every year and most of them are completely pointless. It is just a huge level of harassment meted out almost exclusively on the poorest and most marginal communities in our society. There is a deep resentment about policing in those places. And then, when there's a high-profile incident, it unleashes all this pent-up anger and rage.\n\nReducing policing goes hand in hand with widespread decriminalization, then-of things like having an open container in your front yard or selling untaxed cigarettes .\n\nAbsolutely. It goes hand in hand with decriminalizing sex work, drugs, homelessness, mental illness. We don't really need a vice unit, we need a system of legalized sex work that's regulated just like any other business. We don't need school police, we need counselors and restorative justice programs. We don't need police homeless outreach units, we need supportive housing, community based drop-in centers, social workers.\n\nHow do you mesh the idea of police abolition with the need to address serious public safety threats like murder or aggravated assault (when those crimes are committed by the general public)?\n\nThe criminal justice system says there's one strategy for everything-make arrests, put them in prison. What abolitionists say is, Well, let's figure out why they're doing this and try to develop concrete prevention strategies. Not all homicides are the same. Is it a domestic violence case? Is it a school shooting? Is it a drug deal gone bad? We know, for instance, that in almost all the school shooting cases, somebody had a pretty good idea that this might happen , but did not tell anyone-or told the police and the police had no tools to do anything about it. What if instead, we had a system in place where when a young person thinks their friend might do something awful, can go and talk to a responsible adult without worrying that the police will get involved, that they will have ratted on their friend to the police, or that their friend will get expelled from school because of some zero tolerance policy?\n\nIt's important to remember that there is no perfect world, there's no perfect solution. What we have now is far from perfect. People get killed all the time, even though our society is filled with police. Can we come up with a situation where there are fewer killings, and fewer collateral consequences?\n\nWhere did the movement to abolish the police come from?\n\nIt began to take a coherent shape in the late '60s, early '70s. Initially, the radical edge of this, from the Black Panthers and others, was the idea of community control of the police . But a group of activists and academics wrote a document called The Iron Fist and the Velvet Glove , in which they began to say, \"Wait a second-is there any policing that's actually a good idea?\" When we understand the fundamental nature of policing, even if the community has control over it, it's still a state institution that's predicated on the use of violence to fix problems. And historically, it has never operated in the interests of the poor and the nonwhite.\n\nAfter the '70s, this idea became very dormant. It was the rise of mass incarceration in the last 20 years that has brought this idea back into the fore. A little over 20 years ago, Critical Resistance was formed in California, which was mostly focused on prison abolition. This led to works by Angela Davis and Ruth Wilson Gilmore that were focused on prison abolition. But communities understood that to achieve prison abolition, we needed to do something about policing as well. So little campaigns began to pop up. In the Black Lives Matter era, there's been a deepening of analysis among the activists who initially just wanted to jail some killer cops, but then began to see that that would not really fix the problem.\n\nHave the campaigns had any victories?\n\nThere have been little victories that kind of presaged what we're trying to do, but not a lot. Sometimes, what we did is we prevented an increase in spending. People managed to kill a particular program, or funding for a new police academy.\n\nThe victories are not going to look like a police department getting shut down. A victory is going to look like, we got police out of the schools, or we created an alternative to using the police to deal with homelessness.\n\nWhat does this end up looking like on a practical level, say, if my car gets stolen?\n\nA friend of ours, they had their car stolen. The police actually recovered it and arrested the driver. So they were like, \"See? We need police.\" And I said, \"Well, let's dig a little deeper here. What do we know about the person who got arrested that stole your car?\" \"Uh, the police said that he'd been arrested a bunch of times and there was drug paraphernalia left in the car?\" And I'm like, Hmm. So we tried policing a bunch of times with this guy. Did it prevent your car from getting stolen? No. Is this person stealing cars because they have a drug problem? Probably. Is sending them to jail over and over again fixing their drug problem? No. Okay, if we want to reduce vehicle thefts, the first time that we come in contact with this person, we've got to start trying to address what's driving their problematic behavior.\n\nWithout police, or with drastically scaled back police forces, how does the picture change for people and communities who don't use the police or trust them?\n\nFor those folks, the picture changes because hopefully they won't have so many problematic things to deal with. The reality is a lot of people just don't call the police as it is because they feel like it's just going to make their lives worse. That is a deep truth. And so what we want to do is not just to leave them on their own, we want to try and start fixing their problems. Like domestic violence, which goes grossly underreported because huge numbers of survivors feel that getting the police involved is just going to make the situation worse. Police come, either do nothing, arrest both parties, or arrest the man whom the woman was financially dependent upon. He's pissed off when he gets out of jail, and he comes and beats her up again. Where's the community resource center? Where are the supports for families, so that maybe they can fix their problems? Where are the outlets for women so that they can live independently, to get away from an abuser?\n\nHow would things change for the white people who reflexively rely on and trust the police-the Amy Coopers of the world?\n\nThey won't have this resource that they can weaponize against people. They'll have to figure out other ways of resolving their problems.\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "\"No One Took Us Seriously\": Black Cops Warned About Racist Capitol Police Officers for Years\n\nPolice confront rioters at the US Capitol. Lev Radin/Pacific Press/Zuma\n\nThis story was published originally by ProPublica, a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for ProPublica's The Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox .\n\nWhen Kim Dine took over as the new chief of the US Capitol Police in 2012, he knew he had a serious problem.\n\nSince 2001, hundreds of Black officers had sued the department for racial discrimination. They alleged that white officers called Black colleagues slurs like the N-word and that one officer found a hangman's noose on his locker. White officers were called \"huk lovers\" or \"FOGs\"-short for \"friends of gangsters\"-if they were friendly with their Black colleagues. Black officers faced \"unprovoked traffic stops\" from fellow Capitol Police officers. One Black officer claimed he heard a colleague say, \"Obama monkey, go back to Africa.\"\n\nIn case after case, agency lawyers denied wrongdoing. But in an interview, Dine said it was clear he had to address the department's charged racial climate. He said he promoted a Black officer to assistant chief, a first for the agency, and tried to increase diversity by changing the force's hiring practices. He also said he hired a Black woman to lead a diversity office and created a new disciplinary body within the department, promoting a Black woman to lead it.\n\n\"There is a problem with racism in this country, in pretty much every establishment that exists,\" said Dine, who left the agency in 2016. \"You can always do more in retrospect.\"\n\nWhether the Capitol Police managed to root out racist officers will be one of many issues raised as Congress investigates the agency's failure to prevent a mob of Trump supporters from attacking the Capitol while lawmakers inside voted to formalize the electoral victory of President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nAlready, officials have suspended several police officers for possible complicity with insurrectionists, one of whom was pictured waving a Confederate battle flag as he occupied the building. One cop was captured on tape seeming to take selfies with protesters, while another allegedly wore a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat as he directed protesters around the Capitol building. While many officers were filmed fighting off rioters, at least 12 others are under investigation for possibly assisting them.\n\nTwo current Black Capitol Police officers told BuzzFeed New s that they were angered by leadership failures that they said put them at risk as racist members of the mob stormed the building. The Capitol Police force is only 29 percent Black in a city that's 46 percent Black. By contrast, as of 2018, 52 percent of Washington Metropolitan police officers were Black. The Capitol Police are comparable to the Metropolitan force in spending, employing more than 2,300 people and boasting an annual budget of about a half-billion dollars.\n\nThe Capitol Police did not immediately respond to questions for this story.\n\nSharon Blackmon-Malloy, a former Capitol Police officer who was the lead plaintiff in the 2001 discrimination lawsuit filed against the department, said she was not surprised that pro-Trump rioters burst into the Capitol last week.\n\nIn her 25 years with the Capitol Police, Blackmon-Malloy spent decades trying to raise the alarm about what she saw as endemic racism within the force, even organizing demonstrations where Black officers would return to the Capitol off-duty, protesting outside the building they usually protect.\n\nThe 2001 case, which started with more than 250 plaintiffs, remains pending. As recently as 2016, a Black female officer filed a racial discrimination complaint against the department.\n\n\"Nothing ever really was resolved. Congress turned a blind eye to racism on the Hill,\" Blackmon-Malloy, who retired as a lieutenant in 2007, told ProPublica . She is now vice president of the US Capitol Black Police Association, which held 16 demonstrations protesting alleged discrimination between 2013 and 2018. \"We got Jan. 6 because no one took us seriously.\"\n\nRetired Lt. Frank Adams sued the department in 2001 and again in 2012 for racial discrimination. A Black, 20-year veteran of the force, Adams supervised mostly white officers in the patrol division. He told ProPublica he endured or witnessed racism and sexism constantly. He said that before he joined the division, there was a policy he referred to as \"meet and greet,\" where officers were directed to stop any Black person on the Hill. He also said that in another unit, he once found a cartoon on his desk of a Black man ascending to heaven only to be greeted by a Ku Klux Klan wizard. When he complained to his superior officers, he said he was denied promotions and training opportunities, and suffered other forms of retaliation.\n\nIn an interview, he drew a direct line between racism in the Capitol Police and the events that unfolded last week. He blamed Congress for not listening to Black members of the force years ago.\n\n\"They only become involved in oversight when it's in the news cycle,\" said Adams, who retired in 2011. \"They ignored the racism happening in the department. They ignored the hate.\"\n\nThe department's record in other areas of policing have drawn criticism as well.\n\nIn 2015, a man landed a gyrocopter on the Capitol lawn-top officials didn't know the airborne activist was coming until minutes before he touched down. In 2013, when a lone gunman opened fire at the nearby Navy Yard, killing 12 people, the Capitol Police were criticized for standing on the sidelines. The force's leadership board later determined its actions were justified.\n\nLast month, days after a bloody clash on Dec. 12 between militant Trump supporters and counterprotesters, Melissa Byrne and Chibundu Nnake were entering the Capitol when they saw a strangely dressed man just outside the building, carrying a spear.\n\nHe was a figure they would come to recognize-Jacob Chansley, the QAnon follower in a Viking outfit who was photographed last week shouting from the dais of the Senate chamber.\n\nThey alerted the Capitol Police at the time, as the spear seemed to violate the complex's weapons ban, but officers dismissed their concern, they said.\n\nOne officer told them that Chansley had been stopped earlier in the day, but that police \"higher ups\" had decided not to do anything about him.\n\nWe don't \"perceive it as a weapon,\" Nnake recalled the officer saying of the spear.\n\nChansley told the Globe and Mail's Adrian Morrow that Capitol Police had allowed him in the building on Jan. 6, which would normally include passing through a metal detector, although he was later charged with entering a restricted building without lawful authority, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. As of Tuesday, he had not yet entered a plea .\n\nFor Byrne and Nnake, their interactions with the \"QAnon Shaman\" on December14 highlighted what they perceive as double standards in how the Capitol Police interact with the public.\n\nLike many people who regularly encounter the force, Nnake and Byrne said they were accustomed to Capitol officers enforcing rules aggressively-later that day, Nnake was told that he would be tackled if he tried to advance beyond a certain point. \"As a Black man, when I worked on the Hill, if I forgot a badge, I couldn't get access anywhere,\" he told ProPublica .\n\nCongress, which controls the agency and its budget, has a mixed record of oversight. For the most part, Congress has been deferential toward the force, paying attention to its workings only after serious security failures, and even then, failing to meaningfully hold its leaders accountable.\n\nRep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat from D.C. who is a nonvoting member of Congress, told ProPublica she believes a national commission should be formed to investigate what occurred at the Capitol on January 6, similar to what followed 9/11.\n\n\"Congress deserves some of the blame,\" she told ProPublica . \"We have complete control over the Capitol Police. ... Long-term concerns with security have been raised, and they've not been dealt with in the past.\"\n\nThe force has also suffered a spate of recent, internal scandals that may prove pertinent as Congress conducts its investigation.\n\nCapitol Police officers accidentally left several guns in bathrooms throughout the building in 2015 and 2019; in one instance, the loaded firearm was discovered by a small child.\n\nThe agency has been criticized for a lack of transparency for years. Capitol Police communications and documents are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act and, unlike many local law enforcement agencies, it has no external watchdog specifically assigned to investigate and respond to community complaints. The force has not formally addressed the public since the riot last week.\n\n\"All law enforcement is opaque,\" said Jonathan M. Smith, executive director of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. \"At least most local police departments are subject to some kind of civilian oversight, but federal police agencies are left to operate in the shadows.\"\n\nThe agency's past troubles have rarely resulted in reform, critics said.\n\nAfter the April 2015 gyrocopter incident, Congress held a hearing to examine how 61-year-old postal worker and activist Doug Hughes managed to land his aircraft after he livestreamed his flight. Dozens of reporters and news cameras assembled in front of the Capitol to watch the stunt, which was designed to draw attention to the influence of money in politics. Capitol Police did not learn of the incoming flight until a reporter reached out to them for comment, minutes before Hughes landed.\n\nDine defended the force's response to the incident, pointing out that Hughes was promptly arrested and no one was hurt.\n\nFormer Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, then the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, harshly criticized the department and other federal agencies for what he perceived as an intelligence failure.\n\n\"The Capitol Police is terrible and pathetic when it comes to threat assessment,\" Chaffetz told ProPublica in an interview. \"They have a couple people dedicated to it, but they're overwhelmed. Which drives me nuts. ... It's not been a priority for leadership, on both sides of the aisle.\" He said he is not aware of any serious changes to the force's intelligence gathering following the debacle.\n\nNorton, who also pressed Dine at the hearing, told ProPublica the intelligence lapses surrounding the gyrocopter landing should be considered a \"forerunner\" to last week's riot.\n\n\"For weeks, these people had been talking about coming to the Capitol to do as much harm as they can,\" Norton said. \"Everyone knew it. Except the Capitol Police.\" Reports show the force had no contingency plan to deal with an escalation of violence and mayhem at last week's rally, even though the FBI and the New York Police Department had warned them it could happen.\n\nLaw enforcement experts said that the agency is in a difficult position. While it has sole responsibility for protecting the Capitol, it must work with other nearby federal law enforcement agencies, Washington's Metropolitan Police and the National Guard in case of emergencies.\n\nIn an interview, Nick Zotos, a former D.C. National Guard commander who now works for the Department of Homeland Security, said that the roughly two dozen agencies responsible for public safety in Washington can cause territorial disputes, finger-pointing and poor communication.\n\n\"This is not a D.C. thing, necessarily, although it's probably the worst in D.C.,\" Zotos said. \"Police departments just don't play with each other nicely.\"\n\nBlackmon-Malloy told ProPublica that divisions within the Capitol Police could be just as dangerous, not only for Congress but for Black officers themselves. \"Now you got to go to work on the 20th,\" she told ProPublica , alluding to the inauguration. \"And stand next to someone who you don't even know if they have your back.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Few Cops We Found Using Force on George Floyd Protesters Are Known to Have Faced Discipline\n\nJason Redmond / AFP/Getty\n\nThis story was originally published by ProPublica , a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for the Big Story newsletter to receive stories like this one in your inbox .\n\nLast summer, ProPublica compiled 68 videos that appeared to show police officers using disproportionate force against protesters during the nationwide events following George Floyd's death in police custody.\n\nWe had culled the videos from hundreds circulating on social media in the wake of the protests and highlighted the cases that seemed to clearly show officers using disproportionate force. We then reached out to dozens of law enforcement agencies whose officers are in the videos and asked some straightforward questions: Have the officers' police departments investigated the incidents? And what consequences, if any, have the officers in the videos faced?\n\nAs time passed, we've been checking in with the departments to get their answers.\n\nAfter a year, we wanted to give a final update on what we know: Departments have disclosed discipline for 10 officers.\n\nA Seattle Police Department officer received a written reprimand for striking a protester with \"six to eight punches over six seconds.\" In Grand Rapids, Michigan, an officer shot a man in the shoulder at close range with a long-range tear gas round. He received two days without pay. In Salt Lake City, an officer received \" coaching and counseling \" for using a shield to push an elderly man.\n\nSix officers were initially fired, though two got their jobs back after a review. Criminal charges are also pending against 11 officers, including some who have already faced internal discipline.\n\nIn 17 cases that we followed, the departments have decided not to discipline the officers or could not identify them.\n\nInvestigations are still ongoing in 25 of the cases. This includes a high-profile case in Buffalo, New York, where two officers pushed a man backward , causing him to hit his head on the pavement. A grand jury dismissed felony assault charges against the officers, but a decision on departmental discipline is still pending.\n\nFinally, in 18 instances, ProPublica could not determine the disciplinary outcome - either because the department did not respond or the department said it could not share the information.\n\nThe weaving journey of accountability has played out starkly around one of the cases in Atlanta.\n\nIn May 2020, the mayor announced the firing of two officers just a day after they were involved in the violent arrest of two college students who were pulled from a car.\n\nBut the officers quickly sued to get their jobs back, citing a lack of due process. In February, Atlanta's Civil Service Board agreed. The two officers are once again employed by the department but remain on administrative leave. The incident remains under investigation. Criminal charges have also been filed against the officers , including assault, though the district attorney who brought them has since been voted out of office.\n\nOne reason departments have declined to comment on the status of cases is that the incidents have been subject to litigation. But the back and forth on such suits can be illuminating.\n\nResponding to a lawsuit by a protester who was hit by a Los Angeles Police Department vehicle, the city wrote that the \"force used against plaintiff, if any, was caused and necessitated by the actions of plaintiff, and was reasonable and necessary for self-defense.\"\n\nIn about half of the cases we reviewed, including one resulting in discipline, the officer or officers involved have not been publicly identified. Sometimes, it's not even clear which law enforcement agency they worked for.\n\nIn Minneapolis, where Floyd's death occurred, sparking outrage across the world, a video captured the moment in May when officers patrolling a neighborhood fired paint rounds at a woman's home while enforcing a curfew.\n\nA Minnesota National Guard spokesperson told ProPublica the agency was \"not involved\" in the incident. The Minneapolis Police Department said the incident was \"not our agency.\" The Minnesota State Patrol said that it reviewed the video of the incident, and that \"the officer who fired the marking round was not a State Patrol trooper.\" When asked which agency the officers who fired the paint round were from, the spokesperson said it was \"unclear.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Why Are Cops So Resistant to Getting Vaccinated?\n\nNew York Police Benevolent Association President Pat Lynch, who has threatened to sue the city if it imposes vaccine mandates on cops, campaigns for Donald Trump in 2020. John Marshall Mantel/ZUMA Wire\n\nIn city after city, the story appears to be the same: Police unions are firmly against rules requiring their members to be vaccinated against COVID-19. In Chicago, after Mayor Lori Lightfoot said a mandate would be in order for all public employees, Fraternal Order of Police President John Catanzara told the Chicago Sun-Times his response would be \" Hell no ,\" analogizing the directive to something out of the Holocaust:\n\n\"This ain't Nazi fucking Germany, [where they say], 'Step into the fucking showers. The pills won't hurt you.' What the fuck?\"\n\nIn New York City, the Police Benevolent Association promised to sue the city if, as seems likely, Mayor Bill de Blasio requires cops to get jabs. Though less belligerent than his peers, a union chief in Cincinnati warned city leaders that a strict mandate (without an option for officers to simply get tested frequently) \"would be a bad policy for a department that is struggling to retain and attract enough police officers.\" A San Jose union leader said a vaccine mandate-with testing as an option only for those with religious or medical exemptions-would \"decimate\" his department. Police in Tucson filed an unsuccessful lawsuit to block a vaccine mandate from going into effect among their ranks.\n\nThe mandates are no academic exercise; they've become a necessity in places like New York because police have lagged behind the rest of the population in getting vaccinated. And the excuses that might explain away, at least to some degree, lower vaccination rates in other quarters do not apply to police. Unlike some workers, they can take a day or two off to get a shot if they need to without being fired. They have ready access to health care professionals who can answer any sorts of questions they have. Because of their line of work, they have also experienced the horrors of successive coronavirus waves-the virus is the No. 1 cause of death for law enforcement in the United States this year. They are literally the government.\n\nIt doesn't really speak well of America's law-enforcement agencies that their ranks are filled with people who cannot determine, from the voluminous evidence and expert opinions, whether the COVID-19 vaccines are good or bad for them. It is not a good reflection of anything, really, that Chicago's police union leadership in particular cannot seem to distinguish between a life-saving vaccine and the gas chambers. And the vaccine is hardly the only area where police have become clearinghouses for disinformation. As my colleague, Ali Breland, reported last year, the QAnon conspiracy movement has attracted a real following among cops. America's municipal police forces were well represented at the Capitol on January 6th, motivated by false narrative of a stolen election.\n\nWhen public employees' Facebook-meme rabbit holes make them a danger to the general welfare, the solution is not to accommodate those unfounded fears, it is to remind those employees who they are supposed to be working for. The vaccine is the simplest of steps police can take to ensure that, whatever else they might do, their literal presence is not inflicting harm, so that fewer people-and fewer cops-get sick and die from a virus that should never have killed this many. This is the absolute most basic threshold of \"to serve and protect.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Breonna Taylor Is Dead Because Cops Lied. One Finally Pleaded Guilty.\n\nAn image of Breonna Taylor during an event in Louisville, Kentucky, one year after her death. DeeCee Carter/MediaPunch /IPX/AP\n\nMore than two years after police barged into Breonna Taylor's Kentucky home in the middle of the night and shot her dead, a former cop involved with the case has finally been convicted.\n\nKelly Goodlett, an ex-detective for the Louisville Metro Police Department, was not present during the March 2020 raid. But she admitted on Tuesday in federal court that she helped a colleague lie to convince a judge to sign off on the no-knock warrant that allowed officers to enter the home in search of drugs. To get the warrant, detectives allegedly claimed to have evidence that they did not have . Taylor, who had been in bed when officers entered, was a 26-year-old EMT. No drugs were found on the premises.\n\nThe conviction is the first in a case that spurred massive nationwide protests and inspired lawmakers in multiple states to ban or restrict no-knock raids. Federal prosecutors have also charged two other Louisville officers for their role in acquiring the search warrant, and a fourth officer for violating Taylor's civil rights and the civil rights of her neighbors by blindly firing 10 bullets through two apartments during the raid. The two cops who actually shot Taylor have not been charged. Federal prosecutors said those officers, Jonathan Mattingly and Myles Cosgrove, did not know their colleagues had lied to obtain the warrant. State prosecutors also previously declined to press charges against them.\n\nTaylor is not the first person to die after police misled judges to obtain search warrants. In fact, cops commonly lie to justify their raids, according to scholars who study the issue. The New York Times recently highlighted other cases in Houston, Baltimore, and Atlanta. \"The disturbing ease with which one can find examples of falsified warrant applications,\" Stephen Gard, a professor emeritus at the Cleveland-Marshall College of Law, wrote in a legal journal back in 2008, \"provides powerful evidence of the serious problem of police perjury in our society.\"\n\nAnd as cops use false information to obtain warrants, the number of raids they pursue has skyrocketed around the country. As I previously reported , officers in the United States conduct an estimated 60,000 no-knock and quick-knock raids each year, compared with around 3,000 back in 1981. Black and Latino people are disproportionately targeted. And no-knock raids like the one in Louisville are especially dangerous, because of the confusion they cause: When the cops barged into Taylor's home, her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, mistook them for intruders and fired a weapon toward them. The cops returned fire, striking Taylor multiple times.\n\nIn Taylor's case, federal prosecutors allege that the cops lied repeatedly to justify their raid. Goodlett, the ex-detective who was convicted this week, said she did not stop her colleague Joshua Jaynes when he falsely claimed on a warrant application to have proof from a postal inspector that a drug dealer was sending packages to Taylor's apartment. (Jaynes has pleaded not guilty.) According to prosecutors, the warrant application also stated that the drug dealer, Taylor's ex-boyfriend Jamarcus Glover, used her address as his own, even though the detectives knew he did not live there.\n\nThe lies continued after the raid. As public backlash grew over Taylor's death, according to prosecutors, Goodlett and Jaynes met in Jaynes' garage to scheme how they could cover up the false statements they had made. \"During the garage meeting,\" according to a Justice Department statement , \"the other detective told Goodlett that they needed to get on the same page because if he went down for the false warrant, she would go down too.\"\n\nGoodlett faces up to five years in prison and a $250,000 fine.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Problem With Cop Storylines in Children's Media\n\nMother Jones illustration; Nickelodeon; Getty\n\nThere's a party going on on Sesame Street . A diverse group of young children is dancing. One muppet is juggling bowling pins. Another announces that there is about to be some live music. Enter three police officers in uniform singing the lyrics, \"If you find yourself out in the cold and you don't have a hand to hold, well then you might be lost, it's true. But don't be scared, here's what to do: Don't you fret or fuss, look for one of us!\"\n\nThe scene, which aired in 1985, is a nice idea, but in reality, the relationship between kids and cops isn't always so sweet. There are more than 10,000 officers in schools, who are meant to protect kids, yet 20 percent of them say they don't have sufficient training to do that work. Every day, nearly 2,000 children are arrested. Between 2015 and 2021, law enforcement fatally shot 112 minors . Police violence is particularly real for children of color, who are nearly twice as likely to be arrested as white kids. In 2020, two-thirds of those in the juvenile justice system were children of color, and Black children were six times as likely to be killed by police than their white counterparts.\n\nYet you'd never think any of that is possible watching the episode of Sesame Street. It's a classic case of copaganda, a word that became part of our mainstream lexicon around the time that the killing of George Floyd sparked a national reckoning of policing in America. In the weeks after Floyd's death, showrunners and critics reflected on how the glorification of cops on television shows gives viewers incorrect ideas of the police's benevolence. As Carol Stabile, a dean at the University of Oregon, told me: \"The stories that get told about police are used to promote specific views of policing in this country.\"\n\nAnd some changes did happen. Warren Leight, then show runner for Law and Order: SVU , spoke on a podcast about how he wanted to do an episode portraying what happened to Floyd and said changes would start taking place on shows after what was hopefully an \"inflection point.\" Brooklyn Nine-Nine, a comedy, was also criticized, and in their final season, those involved with production made efforts to include storylines about how bad some police were and to hold main characters accountable for their actions.\n\nYet little attention has been paid to how law enforcement storylines show up in children's media, despite the fact that kids are especially impressionable. \"For many children, TV plays a large role in shaping their consciousness and relationship to the world around them,\" says Kelle Rozell, chief marketing and storytelling officer at Color Of Change. This makes it all the more crucial that the messages children receive during these formative developmental years combat copaganda and instead reflect important truths about the system.\"\n\nIn the most popular children's television shows, I struggled to find a depiction of policing that was anything less than flattering. The closest I came was SpongeBob Squarepants , but even that was basically benign. Though the police officers in the show at times present an obstacle to the titular character, ultimately, they are portrayed as trying to get their jobs done . On the other end of the spectrum is the show most people already associate with copaganda: Paw Patrol, a program about a young boy and a group of dogs that work to protect their community. One dog is a pilot, another is a firefighter. A third is a cop, who helps solve problems around town. It is such blatant copaganda, it's almost laughable.\n\nThere's also the popular Peppa Pig , a long-running show about Peppa, her pig brother George, and the other animal families in the town. In one episode, two officers visit the titular character's classroom. One kid shouts \"Hooray! The Police!\" as they arrive. In the rest of the scene, the officers teach the class of children how to ride their bikes. It's the kind of utopian policing that imagines cops as helpful adults in a community. In the cartoon world of Peppa Pig , police are your friends. Of course, that is far from the lesson many parents of color want to instill in their children. Many Black parents give their kids, particularly their sons, \"the talk,\" a warning about how they will be viewed by police and how to stay safe. Parents of Black and brown kids are teaching their kids that the police are not always safe, while the messaging on shows like Sesame Street works to teach the exact opposite, an unrealistic view that police are there to help you find your way.\n\n\"In children's shows, copaganda often shows up in the form of a teaching moment or lesson to encourage children to follow rules. Police are often there to impart a sense of accountability for, and even fear of, making bad choices,\" says Rozell. But kids take these inaccurate views about police being universally helpful and consistently good figures with them into the real world as they grow up and become adults.\n\nThe show that first got me interested in kid copaganda is Avatar the Last Airbender. It is an animated series about Avatar Aang and his friends attempting to take down the colonizing forces of the fire nation. In this show, the world is divided into four regions, which each correspond to their inhabitants' ability to control one of the elements: water, air, earth, and fire. Aang is a leader because he is the Avatar, the one person who can control all four elements and ostensibly bring peace to the conflict-ridden world. It's an incredibly unique children's television show, in that all the characters are people of color. And though there are local police officer-types, there isn't a police force at all akin to what we see in real life. At least that was true until the spinoff comic books and sequel series, the Legend of Korra , came out.\n\nIn the comics, which take place between the two series, Aang is traveling to rebuild the postwar world. During a meeting about a city that's being established, Aang says, \"What I think this city needs is a real police force. Something to serve its citizens and establish true law and order.\" It's the complete opposite of the tone of the original series.\n\nIn the original series, a young girl named Toph develops the ability to bend metal as part of her escape from her kidnappers. By the time the second series rolls around, metalbending is almost exclusively used by a police force that Toph founded as an adult. The leap in character development doesn't make sense. In the first series, the characters were constantly evading the military and figures of authority because they were being hunted by the fire nation and those loyal to it. Policing was contradictory to the mission of the main character, and there was even an extended plot line about the corruption of one of the law enforcement-type groups. By the second show, the main characters are part of the establishment. They have become law enforcement.\n\nI can vividly remember waiting for the series finale of Avatar the Last Airbender when I was ten. It's a show I've rewatched over and over, feeling that same excitement I did when I first watched Aang defeat his nemesis, the firelord. And little did I know, the show was impacting me. It helped teach me everything from how to be accepting of people different than me to huge concepts like colonization. By the time the Legend of Korra came out, I was a bit older and not as porous to what I was receiving on television. Even so, it took me until I was in my early 20s to realize that the message they were feeding viewers was yet another version of copaganda. As I watch clips of Peppa Pig , whose Instagram has close to half a million followers, praise the police officers she meets, I wonder what effect it will have on the kids watching it now. How long will it take, if ever, for them to realize that they're being fed a message that's not entirely accurate?\n\nI asked Rozell how to incorporate more nuanced portrayals of policing in media for kids. \"It is critical that [media] leaders focus on who is on screen and who is in charge of the story,\" writes Rozell. \"One way to do this is by inviting more people with expertise and real-life experience into the writers' room to advise on these critical issues, share stories and collaborate on storylines. This hard look at copaganda in children's shows is long overdue.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

The murder sparked the largest sustained civil rights protests since the 1960s. For a brief moment, white folks claimed to have had their eyes \"opened\" to the reality of police violence and brutality in this country. Corporations, media organizations, and universities committed to adopting more inclusive policies toward hiring and representation. Politicians promised real reforms to address the demands of protesters.\n\nI predicted, in June of that year, mere weeks after the murder, that all of the alleged \"solidarity\" from corporate or political \"allies\" was white bullshit. I explained that white folks understand (either consciously or not) that the police are there to protect them, their privilege, and their power. I said that white folks are fundamentally willing to sacrifice innocent Black people to the murderous clutches of the police if it ensures their continued supremacy. I wrote :\n\nThe system of white supremacy enforced and protected by the American police was not built in a day, and it will not be dismantled in a day. What will people be prepared to do two weeks from now to make the world safer for black people than it was two weeks ago? What will they be prepared to do in two months? In two years?... Already, the infrastructure is in place for this country to ignore police brutality the moment everybody stops shouting about it.\n\nIt was an easy prediction to make if you understand the way the white world works. The white public support for the protests dissipated before the summer was even over . The inclusion and diversity programs erected in response to the protests are being torn down with glee by the defenders of white supremacy. Meaningful police reform died in statehouses around the country, in Congress, and on Senator Joe Manchin's desk. And the news media and Hollywood resumed its regularly scheduled programing of copaganda.\n\nAnd so, three-and-a-half years after the summer of \"no justice, no peace,\" we are back to the quiet acceptance of systemic injustice. A new report from the nonprofit organization Mapping Police Violence shows that 2023 was the police's most homicidal year on record. The police killed at least 1,232 people last year, the most since the organization began tracking police murders in 2013. In 98 percent of those cases, the officers faced no charges.\n\nIt should come as little surprise that Black people faced the greatest danger from these murderous officers. Black people accounted for 26 percent of the deaths, despite the fact that we are only 14 percent of the population. Indeed, the statistics showed that Black people were 2.6 times more likely to be killed by the police than white people.\n\nBut, hey, former Harvard University president Claudine Gay improperly cited some of her sources, so really her appointment was the biggest racial injustice story of the year. Not Tyre Nichols , who was lynched by a group of Memphis cops. Not Niani Finlayson , who was fatally shot by a Los Angeles police officer mere seconds after he arrived on the scene to respond to a domestic violence call she made. Not Leonard Allan Cure , who spent 16 years in prison for a crime he didn't commit, was exonerated, and was shot to death by police during a traffic stop.\n\nOf course, Black people were not the only ones to bear a disproportionate burden from violent cops. The report shows that Native Americans are 2.2 times more likely to be killed by cops than white people. Latinos are 1.3 times more likely to be murdered than whites. Only Asian-Americans are less likely to be killed by cops than white folks.\n\nOne particularly disturbing trend the report highlights is that more killings were done by the police in rural areas (26 percent) than in urban areas (24 percent). There is even less oversight of county sheriff departments than of big city police. The chances of holding any of these small town cops accountable-when they kill people in the dark, in depopulated areas with no witnesses around, and when the only people who can prosecute them are their friends or cousins or brothers in the local district attorney's office-are almost nil.\n\nIt's worth noting that the cops unleashed their most deadly year on us when the murder rate by people who are not protected by a badge went down . Society as a whole was less homicidal, but the cops were more violent. That's on top of the cops asking for more money and more weapons to combat a \"crime wave\" that doesn't actually exist.\n\nAnother critical point: This report tracks only the number of deaths by the police; it doesn't track the attempted homicides. It doesn't track the beatings or sexual assaults. It doesn't track the racial harassment or false arrests. This report doesn't account for the people who miraculously survived their encounter with predatory police and escaped with only broken limbs, perforated lungs, or lifetime psychological scars.\n\nThis is the police force white America wants: violent and unaccountable. We cannot even muster enough sustained attention to the problem of police brutality, much less the sustained political pressure to try to fix it.\n\nWhatever else happens in 2024, one thing is certain: The police will kill more people, those people will be disproportionately Black, and nobody will stop them.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Activate your online access\n\nBy a 6-3 vote, the conservative justices decided that there is no need for the state to provide a preliminary hearing in civil forfeiture cases.\n\nA woman sits in her car, which police had seized for a crime she did not commit.\n\n\"Civil asset forfeiture\" is the legal euphemism for when the cops steal your stuff. In this country, if you are stopped or arrested, the police can take all the personal property you have on you and call it \"incident to the arrest.\" That property can include your phone or your legally purchased guns, and it almost always includes your car.\n\nWhen cops decide to help themselves to your property, they can do it without a warrant, without securing a conviction, without even charging you with a crime. Once they've taken it, the cops then force people to engage in a long legal fight to get their stuff back. Often, the value of the property stolen by the government is less than the cost of lawyers needed to fight the government. There's no right to public counsel when the cops steal from you, so most people can't afford to fight them, never get their stuff back, and the cops end up selling it for profit.\n\nCivil forfeiture is a booming business and has become a key source of income for some cities and entire states. According to \" Policing for Profit ,\" a report from the Institute for Justice, federal, state, and local governments made $68.8 billion from civil forfeiture between 2000 and 2019.\n\nMost people I know think that civil forfeiture should be unconstitutional as a point-and-click violation of the Due Process clause. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments both say that we should not be \"deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law.\" Civil forfeiture is literally depriving people of their property with no process at all.\n\nUnfortunately, most people I know are not on the Supreme Court. On Thursday, the six unelected Republicans who rule this country said that civil forfeiture can continue to happen so long as the government eventually provides a hearing, even if the hearing takes place long after the theft and most people can't afford to appeal.\n\nThe case is called Culley v. Marshall and deals with two straightforward civil forfeiture examples from Alabama. Halima Culley loaned her car to her son, who was stopped and arrested while driving with marijuana. Lena Sutton loaned her car to a friend who was subsequently busted while driving with methamphetamines. Alabama cops seized both vehicles, even though they didn't belong to the person driving them, and didn't return them to their real owners even after they learned of their mistake. Instead, the cops made a civil forfeiture claim and attempted to keep Culley's and Sutton's cars.\n\nA report from the Southern Poverty Law Center found that Alabama made $2.2 million in 2015 from stealing property through civil forfeiture, so the cops are fairly heavily incentivized to take property even when the owners are not guilty of anything. But according to alleged attempted rapist Brett Kavanaugh, Alabama's grand theft auto operation is just fine.\n\nWriting for a 6-3 majority (it was the usual split: all Republican justices in the majority, all Democratic justices in dissent), Kavanaugh reduced the issue to one of timing. The plaintiffs Culley and Sutton wanted the state to provide a \"preliminary\" hearing and force the police to justify stealing their cars. Kavanaugh said that the state already provides a \"timely\" hearing and said that all the plaintiffs wanted was to get their stuff back more quickly. He argued that the plaintiffs' arguments were just \"a backdoor argument for a more timely forfeiture hearing to allow a property owner with a good defense to recover her property quickly.\"\n\nAs he does so often, Kavanaugh willfully missed the point. The plaintiffs want to stop the government from taking their property, not argue after the fact that the government should give it back. Remember, we're talking about cars here. If the cops arrest somebody and take their car, then find out later that the car does not belong to the person they arrested, the normal (and constitutional, and basically decent) thing to do is return the car to its rightful owner. But instead of returning the cars to the people who own them, the police in these cases wanted to not only keep the cars but then force the owners to enter into litigation against the police to get the cars back. That's not a timing issue: That's a mugging issue.\n\nThink about it this way: If the cops arrest somebody and throw them in jail, the accused is entitled to a preliminary hearing where the government has to explain to a court why that person should be kept in jail and denied bail. That hearing is different from the trial to convict and sentence the person. As a threshold issue, cops have to explain why they locked somebody up. The same constitutional rule should apply to a person's property. If the police jack a car, they should be forced to explain to a court why they're keeping the car instead of releasing the car on its own recognizance (just pretend that the car is Lightning McQueen).\n\nIn dissent, Justice Sonia Sotomayor (joined by Justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson) made a critical distinction between criminal forfeiture and civil forfeiture. It's one thing if the property involved is the subject of crime. If the car itself is stolen, or if the car is a getaway vehicle that may contain blood or other evidence of criminal activity, one can understand why the cops might need to keep it. Criminal asset forfeiture can also be a form of punishment-for instance, in the unlikely event that a Wall Street type is ever forced to disgorge illegal or fraudulently obtained profits.\n\nCivil forfeiture, however, requires no crime. Sotomayor notes that 80 percent of civil forfeiture cases \"are not accompanied by any ultimate criminal conviction.\" She further argues that unchecked civil forfeiture can also lead to false pleas and settlements from property owners desperate to just get their stuff back. She writes:\n\nLoss of a car not only \"takes away one's ability to commute\" but also imposes a barrier to \"buy[ing] necessities, access[ing] healthcare, and visit[ing] family members, pharmacies, grocery stores, hospitals, and other essential services.\"... Given these burdens, low-income communities are also the most vulnerable to pressure from unchecked prosecutors, who can use coercive civil forfeiture processes to extract settlement money from innocent owners desperate to get their property back.\n\nKavanaugh was unmoved by these arguments, noting only that states are free to rein in civil forfeiture abuses through legislation but the Constitution does not require them too. It's worth noticing that the Republicans who claim to care so much about private property and protecting citizens from government \"theft\" when it comes to environmental regulations or tax laws have no problem allowing states to steal cars from innocent citizens who aren't even charged with crimes.\n\nFor what it's worth, while Kavanaugh is probably off at a Buffalo Wild Wings somewhere wondering if Alabama can use its forfeiture funds to hire better offensive coordinators for their football programs, Justice Neil Gorsuch seemed at least to struggle with his intellectual hypocrisy. Gorsuch wrote a concurring opinion (joined by Justice Clarence Thomas) where he declared both the majority and the dissent to be right.\n\nOh, he came down on the side of the Republican majority of course, because even if both sides are right, Gorsuch usually thinks the Republican position is more right. And, because this is Gorsuch we're talking about, he treated us in his opinion to an archaic, intellectually masturbatory discussion of the law of \" deodand \"-which (I've now been forced to learn) was the 11th-century English equivalent to civil forfeiture: Property that caused someone's death was forfeited \"to God\" or \"the Crown,\" but usually the local lord who needed some cash.\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nElie Mystal\n\nLuckily, Gorsuch didn't seem fond of this particular 11th-century law (probably because he couldn't figure out how to use it to hurt women or Black people), so the legal upshot of Gorsuch's concurrence was this musing:\n\nWhy does a Nation so jealous of its liberties tolerate expansive new civil forfeiture practices that have \"led to egregious and well-chronicled abuses\"?... In this Nation, the right to a jury trial before the government may take life, liberty, or property has always been the rule. Yes, some exceptions exist. But perhaps it is past time for this Court to examine more fully whether and to what degree contemporary civil forfeiture practices align with that rule and those exceptions.\n\nWhat I think Gorsuch is saying is that if some kind of carefully crafted lawsuit came before the court, Gorsuch (and Thomas) would declare at least some aspects of civil forfeiture unconstitutional. I don't know what that lawsuit would look like. In this case, Culley and Sutton were asking the court to impose a process, that of a \"preliminary\" hearing, on the states, but we already know that justices like Gorsuch and Thomas don't like for the courts to do anything to proactively stop the states from violating the Constitution or civil rights (unless the states are trying to keep guns out of the hands of mass shooters-then they think the Constitution gets violently angry). They were never going to go for this one, theft of private property be damned.\n\nBut perhaps a lawsuit challenging the asset seizure itself instead of the timeliness of the hearing would tickle Gorsuch's fancy. I'm sure he could find something from Beowulf about the proper procedure for stealing a golden cup.\n\nIn the meantime, the cops will continue to rake in billions of dollars from taking people's stuff. As usual, Republicans have rendered the Constitution impotent in the face of any two-bit criminal who happens to wear a badge instead of a ski mask.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Nichols was beaten to death by Black cops (five of whom have been charged with murder ); Tasered by a white cop who encouraged the beating (who has been suspended but still not charged ); and abandoned by people with a duty to render aid ( three Memphis first responders have been relieved of duty) as he slumped, dying of injuries, for 23 minutes until an ambulance showed up on the scene. A goddamn rainbow coalition of \"cops\" killed that man. Then, a police force made up of a diverse group of people whose forebears were enslavers, slaves, and slave catchers took to the streets in riot gear and armored personnel carriers to keep Memphis \"safe\" from people who wanted to protest the brutality of those cops. All of that should be obvious, but apparently there are people out here who can't understand how \"Black\" cops could commit this act born of \"white\" supremacy. All cops are employed to uphold a system, a system conceived of by white folks, for white folks, that operates to oppress and control Black people. It's not surprising if Black people do not even find it difficult to participate in the oppression of other Black people, especially when they align themselves with an institution (in this case, the police) instead of working to take down that system. To put it a different way: When a cop says they \"bleed blue,\" believe them. That isn't to say that the race of cops under their uniform doesn't matter. Other cops may well care about the race or ethnicity of their fellow officers. We see evidence for this in the tepid response of the police unions to the murder charges brought against the five Black officers. Normally, the police union's spokespeople run to any camera they can find to defend officers caught performing violence, but not this time. We can also clearly see that the justice system cares about the race or ethnicity of police officers: These five Black officers were fired and charged faster than any white police officer I can remember, including George Floyd's murderer, Derek Chauvin. But that just shows, yet again, that systemic racism in the justice system attaches to the race of the accused, not the race of the functionaries within the system. It doesn't matter if that functionary is white, Black, or brown. Systemic racism does not require an individual to harbor hatred for another race in their hearts; it simply requires individuals to participate in the corrupted system. You could drop a Martian in the middle of a local prosecutor's office and, unless they actively and consciously looked for ways to subvert and sabotage the system, they too would soon start charging Black suspects with stunning haste while using their discretion to aid and appease white wrongdoers. And if you dropped that same Martian into a patrol car, it wouldn't take long before they got out of that car and started cracking Black skulls. That's because the badge and uniform give cops legal authority to become one thing in our society: predators. It's that license to prey on their fellow humans, specifically the Black ones, that transcends race or ancestry, and transforms some cops from alleged protectors into vicious murderers.

They exist to arrest people. One might hope that they're arresting criminals or suspected criminals, but it's important to remember that the very institution of local policing can trace its roots directly back to the old slave patrols and slave catchers of the antebellum South. Studies show that even when a massive influx of cops into a city leads to a small reduction in major crimes like homicide, it comes with an explosion of arrests for petty, victimless crimes, and, of course, increased brutality against Black people. Current Issue View our current issue The police are institutionally designed to be predators: Capturing (and if need be, killing) their targets is the primary way they justify their continued existence. Police are judged everywhere based on their numbers of arrests, the number of people they catch . And like all predators, they tend to target the weakest among us. Black people are easy prey. We are, overall, less wealthy and less economically powerful. The media trashes us and our communities, making others more accepting of state-sponsored violence against us. Politicians, and the majority of white folks who put them in power, remain hysterically concerned about being the victim of crime and thus also support state violence against us, especially since the media tells them we're all criminals or soon-to-be criminals. Many in our own economically depressed communities, which are legitimately beset by crime, are willing to accept more oppressive policing than what happens in white communities in exchange for its false promises of enhanced safety. And nobody believes us. One basic rule of predation is that after you identify the prey, you have to separate it from the herd. The fact that our society doesn't often believe Black people when we are the victims of police brutality and violence, or thinks that we are ultimately at fault for the violence against us, has the effect of isolating us from that society and makes us targets of violent cops. It's the same reason serial killers usually start by preying on those who are homeless, who engage in sex work, who are addicted to drugs or are otherwise marginalized by society. Nobody takes our word against the uniform. Black people have complained about violent police since the invention of the police, but before camera phones and other surveillance technology became ubiquitous, nobody listened when we told them how the cops treated us. Even now, cops are charged only when the full measure of their violence is unmistakably captured on video. Even with clear and convincing video, cops are only convicted when their Black victim dies face down begging for their life. Any attempt to fight back, to live, results in acquittal for the cop. Tyre Nichols was beaten to death while calling out for his mother. I believe in that moment he knew that the only person who would believe what was happening to him was his mom. He was so close to her house. He was almost safe. He knew that she was the only person who would care about his life enough to save him from his attackers. That's why you'll never see cops, of any race, beat a white boy to death like that. Because the cops know that a white male in that situation can call out to anybody from \"CNN\" to \"lawyer,\" and somebody might materialize out of thin air to stop them. Another officer, a medic, a neighbor-there were any number of people who could have intervened to save Nichols's life. Nobody did. The cops who beat him knew nobody would be coming to help. They also assumed nobody would demand justice after the fact. Note that the most damning video of his murder does not come from the cops' body cameras (which, as usual in this situation, mysteriously did not capture the full encounter) but from a surveillance camera mounted on the light post that the cops probably didn't know was there. In fact, on the devices the cops knew were recording them, they can be heard making up the usual story that Nichols was trying to go for their guns. One cop even falsely claimed that Nichols \"almost had his hand\" on the gun. Pure lies. But would people have believed Nichols if he had lived and there were no camera footage? If Nichols had survived his injuries and there were no video evidence of this encounter, the officers would still be on the force and Nichols would be the one charged with a crime.

As long as we accept armed paramilitary forces roving the streets looking for people to catch, we accept the disproportionate murder of Black people at the behest of the state. I hope they don't get me. I hope they don't get my kids. But all I can do is hope, because too many people have decided that my death or my children's death is a price they're willing to pay for the fear the cops induce. In the meantime, asking me to differentiate between a white cop and a Black cop is like asking me whether a tiger is orange with black stripes, or black with orange stripes.

They exist to arrest people. One might hope that they're arresting criminals or suspected criminals, but it's important to remember that the very institution of local policing can trace its roots directly back to the old slave patrols and slave catchers of the antebellum South. Studies show that even when a massive influx of cops into a city leads to a small reduction in major crimes like homicide, it comes with an explosion of arrests for petty, victimless crimes, and, of course, increased brutality against Black people. Current Issue View our current issue The police are institutionally designed to be predators: Capturing (and if need be, killing) their targets is the primary way they justify their continued existence. Police are judged everywhere based on their numbers of arrests, the number of people they catch . And like all predators, they tend to target the weakest among us. Black people are easy prey. We are, overall, less wealthy and less economically powerful. The media trashes us and our communities, making others more accepting of state-sponsored violence against us. Politicians, and the majority of white folks who put them in power, remain hysterically concerned about being the victim of crime and thus also support state violence against us, especially since the media tells them we're all criminals or soon-to-be criminals. Many in our own economically depressed communities, which are legitimately beset by crime, are willing to accept more oppressive policing than what happens in white communities in exchange for its false promises of enhanced safety. And nobody believes us. One basic rule of predation is that after you identify the prey, you have to separate it from the herd. The fact that our society doesn't often believe Black people when we are the victims of police brutality and violence, or thinks that we are ultimately at fault for the violence against us, has the effect of isolating us from that society and makes us targets of violent cops. It's the same reason serial killers usually start by preying on those who are homeless, who engage in sex work, who are addicted to drugs or are otherwise marginalized by society. Nobody takes our word against the uniform. Black people have complained about violent police since the invention of the police, but before camera phones and other surveillance technology became ubiquitous, nobody listened when we told them how the cops treated us. Even now, cops are charged only when the full measure of their violence is unmistakably captured on video. Even with clear and convincing video, cops are only convicted when their Black victim dies face down begging for their life. Any attempt to fight back, to live, results in acquittal for the cop. Tyre Nichols was beaten to death while calling out for his mother. I believe in that moment he knew that the only person who would believe what was happening to him was his mom. He was so close to her house. He was almost safe. He knew that she was the only person who would care about his life enough to save him from his attackers. That's why you'll never see cops, of any race, beat a white boy to death like that. Because the cops know that a white male in that situation can call out to anybody from \"CNN\" to \"lawyer,\" and somebody might materialize out of thin air to stop them. Another officer, a medic, a neighbor-there were any number of people who could have intervened to save Nichols's life. Nobody did. The cops who beat him knew nobody would be coming to help. They also assumed nobody would demand justice after the fact. Note that the most damning video of his murder does not come from the cops' body cameras (which, as usual in this situation, mysteriously did not capture the full encounter) but from a surveillance camera mounted on the light post that the cops probably didn't know was there. In fact, on the devices the cops knew were recording them, they can be heard making up the usual story that Nichols was trying to go for their guns. One cop even falsely claimed that Nichols \"almost had his hand\" on the gun. Pure lies. But would people have believed Nichols if he had lived and there were no camera footage? If Nichols had survived his injuries and there were no video evidence of this encounter, the officers would still be on the force and Nichols would be the one charged with a crime.

As long as we accept armed paramilitary forces roving the streets looking for people to catch, we accept the disproportionate murder of Black people at the behest of the state. I hope they don't get me. I hope they don't get my kids. But all I can do is hope, because too many people have decided that my death or my children's death is a price they're willing to pay for the fear the cops induce. In the meantime, asking me to differentiate between a white cop and a Black cop is like asking me whether a tiger is orange with black stripes, or black with orange stripes.

It really doesn't matter.\n\nThat's why you'll never see cops, of any race, beat a white boy to death like that. Because the cops know that a white male in that situation can call out to anybody from \"CNN\" to \"lawyer,\" and somebody might materialize out of thin air to stop them. Another officer, a medic, a neighbor-there were any number of people who could have intervened to save Nichols's life. Nobody did. The cops who beat him knew nobody would be coming to help. They also assumed nobody would demand justice after the fact. Note that the most damning video of his murder does not come from the cops' body cameras (which, as usual in this situation, mysteriously did not capture the full encounter) but from a surveillance camera mounted on the light post that the cops probably didn't know was there.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

One in five students reported being verbally harassed or made fun of by police in school, and two of every five young people surveyed felt unsafe just seeing them. The findings were released in a report titled \" Arrested Learning: A Survey of Youth Experiences of Police and Security at School .\" The report details how students often feel targeted by police in schools, including through regular, negative interactions as well as sexual harassment. The students surveyed overwhelmingly favor receiving additional resources and support, like mental health treatment, more teachers, and dedicated youth programs, rather than greater funding for police and security. Because of over-policing, many students-often low-income and students of color-are funneled out of public schools and into the criminal justice system. The Center for Popular Democracy's Senior Policy and Campaign Strategist Kate Terenzi said the school-to-prison-and-deportation pipeline was one of the most \"egregious examples of systemic racism and state-sanctioned violence in the country.... Students deserve more than an education system that is hell-bent on criminalizing them instead of providing them with the resources they need to succeed.\" Many of these children have learning disabilities or histories of poverty, abuse, or neglect, and would benefit from additional educational and counseling services. Instead, when they act out in school, they are isolated, reprimanded, and sometimes criminally charged. As of 2013, 51 percent of high schools with majority Black and Latino enrollment had law enforcement officers on campus, compared to only 32 percent of majority white schools. Across the country, Black students are more than twice as likely as their white classmates to be referred to law enforcement or arrested at school. Studies have also shown that those involved with the criminal justice system as adolescents are more likely to go to prison as an adult. Roughly 40 percent of kids who go into juvenile detention end up in prison by the age of 25. Stationing police in schools is a relatively new practice. In the 1960s, members of the Johnson administration saw the rising crime and poverty rates as a lack of \" law and order .\" In response, LBJ implemented programs to promote equitable access to housing, employment, and schooling after declaring a \"War on Poverty\" in 1964. However, public officials at all levels of government simultaneously pursued their own programs of economic and social control. By the late 1960s, the federal government initiated \"youth crime prevention\" programs in many of the nation's largest cities. In Kansas City, Mo., a program allowed teachers and school administrators to label students as young as 9 as \"pre-delinquent,\" subjecting them to increased surveillance and more frequent interrogation by police. These classifications justified the expansion of police presence for the expressed purpose of preventing future crime, and the concept of delinquency became increasingly racialized.

A school resource officer is the official title for any police officer regularly working within a school, but the role of these officers can differ from state to state and from school to school. At the national level, the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, describes the job as a combination of law enforcement, counseling, teaching, and emergency management. However, the same office also tells school police to prioritize law enforcement above all else. If our schools need additional counselors and mentors, turning to police is far from the most suitable choice. Unlike a school psychologist or social worker, a police officer lacks specialized training. A school counselor's first responsibility is to the students they counsel, and they are bound by ethical standards to keep student information confidential, absent certain extenuating circumstances. Police officers do not have the same obligation. Instead, police may share information with other law enforcement agencies or use information gathered against a student or a students' family and friends. At best, their efforts are meant to foster positive views of police or teach children about crime, objectives which do not require regular assignment to schools. However, the effects of such efforts are not always benevolent. Current Issue View our current issue In 2016, Milwaukee Public Schools implemented a pilot program for fourth and fifth graders called Students Talking It Over with Police , or STOP, with the goal of increasing positive perceptions of police among youth. A review caused the school district to abruptly cancel the program. Concerns included \"a classroom skit in which an actual police officer pretends to pull out a gun and threatens to shoot if a student runs away, and then repeatedly yells: 'Bang, bang, bang,'\" along with a requirement to sign a pledge \"never to run from the police, fight with police, or argue with the police.\" According to a member of the review committee, the program \"teaches students the police are correct and that the problem is really the youth.\" This manifests itself in the frequent criminalization of adolescent behavior by police. When adolescent behaviors are criminalized, students of color find themselves at greater risk of involvement with the criminal justice system merely by virtue of attending school. These students are criminalized for behaviors that may annoy adults but are a typical part of adolescent development, with serious-sounding criminal laws often applied to not-so-serious behavior. For example, in South Carolina, the misdemeanor crime of \"disturbing schools\" is consistently among the leading charges made against young people, sending thousands of children into the criminal justice system for offenses as vague as acting \"obnoxiously.\" In 2015, this law was used to criminally charge a student who had taken out her phone in class, as well as her classmate Niya Kenny , who criticized the actions of a police officer when he violently ripped the young girl from her desk. Over the past decade, students have been criminally charged for spraying perfume, fake burping, refusing to change a T-shirt depicting a hunting rifle, and criticizing a police officer. Students have been charged with \" assault \" for throwing a baby carrot at a student and launching a paper airplane. A 5-year old student with ADHD was charged with \" battery on a police officer \" for having a tantrum. Students of color in urban areas are punished-and sometimes even incarcerated-for the same behaviors that white students in suburban schools exhibit all the time. According to a study conducted by Russell Skiba and Natasha Williams at the Equity Project in 2016, \"there is simply no good evidence that racial differences in discipline are due to differences in rates or types of misbehavior by students of different races.\" Following the extrajudicial murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, June 22, 2020, marked the beginning of a weeklong, nationwide call by student groups across the country to support young people and their allies in the fight for police-free schools. During this week, communities across the country, mostly led by youth of color, called on their school boards, mayors, and other elected officials to cut ties with local police departments and remove police from schools. Organizers and allies made similar demands in Minneapolis, Seattle, Denver, Milwaukee, Portland, and Rochester over the course of the two weeks prior. \"Black youth are organizing and demanding police-free schools because they know that the police killing Black people in the streets are the same police assaulting and arresting them in their schools,\" says Alliance for Educational Justice National Director Jonathan Stith. \"This is a national crisis. Until a few weeks ago, there wasn't a school in America that a Black child could attend where there wasn't the threat of police violence.\" All students deserve to feel safe and welcome whenever they attend school, and no one should be worried that firing a spitball will lead to a court sentence.

For example, in South Carolina, the misdemeanor crime of \"disturbing schools\" is consistently among the leading charges made against young people, sending thousands of children into the criminal justice system for offenses as vague as acting \"obnoxiously.\" In 2015, this law was used to criminally charge a student who had taken out her phone in class, as well as her classmate Niya Kenny , who criticized the actions of a police officer when he violently ripped the young girl from her desk. Over the past decade, students have been criminally charged for spraying perfume, fake burping, refusing to change a T-shirt depicting a hunting rifle, and criticizing a police officer. Students have been charged with \" assault \" for throwing a baby carrot at a student and launching a paper airplane. A 5-year old student with ADHD was charged with \" battery on a police officer \" for having a tantrum. Students of color in urban areas are punished-and sometimes even incarcerated-for the same behaviors that white students in suburban schools exhibit all the time. According to a study conducted by Russell Skiba and Natasha Williams at the Equity Project in 2016, \"there is simply no good evidence that racial differences in discipline are due to differences in rates or types of misbehavior by students of different races.\" Following the extrajudicial murders of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor, June 22, 2020, marked the beginning of a weeklong, nationwide call by student groups across the country to support young people and their allies in the fight for police-free schools. During this week, communities across the country, mostly led by youth of color, called on their school boards, mayors, and other elected officials to cut ties with local police departments and remove police from schools. Organizers and allies made similar demands in Minneapolis, Seattle, Denver, Milwaukee, Portland, and Rochester over the course of the two weeks prior. \"Black youth are organizing and demanding police-free schools because they know that the police killing Black people in the streets are the same police assaulting and arresting them in their schools,\" says Alliance for Educational Justice National Director Jonathan Stith. \"This is a national crisis. Until a few weeks ago, there wasn't a school in America that a Black child could attend where there wasn't the threat of police violence.\" All students deserve to feel safe and welcome whenever they attend school, and no one should be worried that firing a spitball will lead to a court sentence. Education can be \"the great equalizer,\" but not until we remove police from schools.\n\nBy the late 1960s, the federal government initiated \"youth crime prevention\" programs in many of the nation's largest cities. In Kansas City, Mo., a program allowed teachers and school administrators to label students as young as 9 as \"pre-delinquent,\" subjecting them to increased surveillance and more frequent interrogation by police. These classifications justified the expansion of police presence for the expressed purpose of preventing future crime, and the concept of delinquency became increasingly racialized.

By 2001, 90 percent of school systems had implemented some form of zero-tolerance or three-strikes discipline policy.

A school resource officer is the official title for any police officer regularly working within a school, but the role of these officers can differ from state to state and from school to school. At the national level, the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, or COPS, describes the job as a combination of law enforcement, counseling, teaching, and emergency management. However, the same office also tells school police to prioritize law enforcement above all else. If our schools need additional counselors and mentors, turning to police is far from the most suitable choice. Unlike a school psychologist or social worker, a police officer lacks specialized training. A school counselor's first responsibility is to the students they counsel, and they are bound by ethical standards to keep student information confidential, absent certain extenuating circumstances. Police officers do not have the same obligation. Instead, police may share information with other law enforcement agencies or use information gathered against a student or a students' family and friends. At best, their efforts are meant to foster positive views of police or teach children about crime, objectives which do not require regular assignment to schools. However, the effects of such efforts are not always benevolent. Current Issue View our current issue In 2016, Milwaukee Public Schools implemented a pilot program for fourth and fifth graders called Students Talking It Over with Police , or STOP, with the goal of increasing positive perceptions of police among youth. A review caused the school district to abruptly cancel the program. Concerns included \"a classroom skit in which an actual police officer pretends to pull out a gun and threatens to shoot if a student runs away, and then repeatedly yells: 'Bang, bang, bang,'\" along with a requirement to sign a pledge \"never to run from the police, fight with police, or argue with the police.\" According to a member of the review committee, the program \"teaches students the police are correct and that the problem is really the youth.\" This manifests itself in the frequent criminalization of adolescent behavior by police.

Until a few weeks ago, there wasn't a school in America that a Black child could attend where there wasn't the threat of police violence.\" All students deserve to feel safe and welcome whenever they attend school, and no one should be worried that firing a spitball will lead to a court sentence. Education can be \"the great equalizer,\" but not until we remove police from schools.\n\n\"Black youth are organizing and demanding police-free schools because they know that the police killing Black people in the streets are the same police assaulting and arresting them in their schools,\" says Alliance for Educational Justice National Director Jonathan Stith. \"This is a national crisis.

The trial has produced no made-for-television stunts or rhetorical flourishes. There's no bloody glove, no rhyming couplets. Chauvin's defense is so basic that an attorney straight out of law school could pull it off. His lawyers are simply arguing that cops have the right to kill people, if they think they need to. That strategy might seem foolish to the untrained eye. After all, there is incontrovertible video evidence that Chauvin did not \"need\" to kill George Floyd. The video shows that Floyd posed no threat to the police or anybody else: He was prone and handcuffed while Chauvin slowly choked the life out of him over the course of eight minutes and 46 seconds. Any reasonable human being can see that Chauvin should have taken his knee off of Floyd's neck. But the defense lawyers know that the law does not require Chauvin to behave like a human being; it only requires him to behave like a cop. It doesn't hold cops to an objective standard of behavior. Instead, the law allows an individual cop's own frailties-their fears, their racist misconceptions, and even their own hysteria-to define the scope of acceptable cop behavior. If Chauvin's lawyers were better showmen, they'd be telling the jury, \"If Chauvin could imagine being hit, you must acquit.\" As it is, Chauvin's attorneys have taken to citing the 1989 Supreme Court case Graham v. Connor -and doing it so frequently that you'd think a man named Graham V. Connor told Chauvin he could get away with murder. In a way, that's exactly what the case did. Graham v. Connor changed the use-of-force guidelines for police all across the country, allowing them to be more violent and homicidal. To understand how one case has authorized brutality, you have to appreciate that our only real constitutional protection from police violence is the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on \"unreasonable search and seizure.\" \"Unreasonable\" was, naturally, poorly defined by the collection of white men who wrote and ratified the Constitution and determined that things such as slavery and genocide were totally \"reasonable\" uses of state power. Still, for most of American history, the Fourth Amendment followed a \"reasonable [white] man\" standard: The actions of the government, or its agents, were judged through the lens of what an average person would find reasonable. In practice, this allowed for plenty of abuse. Victims of police brutality had to show that officers acted \"unreasonably\" and with malicious intent. As one can imagine, it was always hard for victims (or their surviving family members) to prove that a violently homicidal police officer intended to kill them. Before camera phones, it was nearly impossible to get white people to believe the cops acted like Black people have always said they do.

Connor took this loophole and made it so big that whole police forces could simply saunter right through it. Instead of limiting police use of force to what a reasonable person might expect, the Supreme Court said that force could only be judged against what a reasonable \"officer on the scene\" would do. In the actual Graham v. Connor case, that meant the court found that a \"reasonable officer\" could slam Dethorne Graham's head into his car and break his foot, because Graham was resisting arrest, never mind that he was a diabetic going into shock who was being detained on the suspicion that he stole some orange juice-which he did not. Current Issue View our current issue Graham v. Connor was authored by the conservative Justice William Rehnquist, but the decision was unanimous. The liberals on the court thought this new \"reasonable officer\" standard was an upgrade over trying to prove malicious intent. History has proven them woefully wrong. Graham v. Connor is the reason every officer accused of murder claims \"I feared for my life.\" It's the reason most officers are never charged in the first place and the reason a police officer's saying \"I thought he had a gun\" nullifies the objective truth that a suspect was unarmed. Since Graham v. Connor , it doesn't even matter if the police are malicious or not; they can be malicious so long as they can argue that a \"reasonable police officer\" would be just as malicious under the circumstances. The result is a self-fulfilling loop of violence: As additional officers respond violently to situations, it becomes easier for other officers to argue that violence is a reasonable police response in a similar situation in the future. And Graham v. Connor does all that before we get to the racism. Those who have watched the Chauvin trial have undoubtedly noticed the string of racist bread crumbs laid out by the defense about Floyd's apparent \"strength.\" There is a long and ugly history of white people ascribing super strength to Black people as a way to justify the use of deadly force against those Black people. There's even a controversial medical term, \" excited delirium ,\" that is often cited by the police to explain why they just had to kill an unarmed Black person. At trial, Chauvin's lawyers have argued that even after Chauvin choked Floyd unconscious, he needed to keep choking him, lest Floyd regain consciousness and access his hidden reservoir of big Black power. They've argued that the crowd, the group of bystanders who filmed the murder, might have encouraged Floyd to wake up and start beating Chauvin and the other police officers at the scene-all by himself. When the defense gets to call witnesses, I half expect them to put Bruce Banner on the stand to testify that it's not gamma radiation but colored melanin that makes him swole. All of this racism isn't being offered by the defense to confuse the issue. It's not a sideshow. It goes to the heart of their Graham v. Connor defense. If they can convince even a single juror that large Black people can beat up four cops while almost dead, then they can convince them that a \"reasonable cop\" would keep his knee on a man's neck for nearly 10 minutes. That's why, during cross-examination, the defense keeps asking the cops who are testifying as witnesses against Chauvin-cops who are being called specifically to rebut Chauvin's idea of a \"reasonable officer\"-questions prefaced with \"Is it possible...?\" and \"Have you ever heard of...?\" Is it \"possible\" that Floyd could have entered an excited delirium state and then posed a threat to the officers? Have you ever \"heard\" of a person waking up from being choked unconscious and then hurting somebody? The defense lawyers aren't asking about what actually happened. In reality, Floyd never posed a threat and never was allowed to wake up, because Chauvin killed him right there on the street. His lawyers are asking about a fantasy world of what might have happened if Floyd were the supernaturally dangerous man Chauvin wanted him to be, instead of the real world where Chauvin tortured and murdered a normal man in a cold-blooded way. This will all come together during closing arguments. Chauvin's lawyers will argue that if it's \"possible\" that Floyd could have called upon the strength of his ancestors and the spirit of the Black Panther to re-breathe and crush his enemies, if Chauvin could have \"reasonably feared\" that zombie-Floyd would reanimate himself and come for Chauvin's brains, then a \"reasonable police officer\" would continue suffocating him until there was no chance of revival. \"Because police officers have the right to go home.\" That's an entirely valid legal argument under our current laws. The legal debate about whether an officer's actions are justified now takes place within the hysterical headspace and fever dreams of a cop, instead of on the plane of objective reality. I don't know if the cop defense will work this time. First of all, Black people do not have superpowers, and it is unreasonable to think that they do. Secondly, I'm not the only one saying that: This time, t here are other cops testifying against Chauvin , arguing that what he did \"absolutely\" defied police training, policy, and procedure. I think it's pretty hard to argue that you are a reasonable cop when other cops testify against you. The Chauvin Trial The Blue Wall of Silence Is Crumbling Around Derek Chauvin Elie Mystal Arradondo Condemned Him, but All Cops Are Derek Chauvin Alyssa Oursler and Anna DalCortivo But the fact that this is even considered a valid defense strategy illustrates, once again, that our laws are objectively pro-police brutality. The Supreme Court has given cops license to kill people, and the only limit it has placed on that violence is what another cop would do in the same situation. It's like a chef telling sheep the wolf gets to set the menu. Congress could repudiate the court's holding in Graham v. Connor and set a new national use-of-force guideline tomorrow, if it wanted to. State governments could define \"reasonable\" force as something more robust than \"whatever the cops say,\" if they wanted to. Many Democratic presidential candidates, from Julián Castro to Cory Booker to Kamala Harris, supported new national use-of-force guidelines and restrictions that, if adopted by states, could render the Chauvin defense inoperable for future murderous cops. But the person who won, President Joe Biden, was not one of them. Biden favors community policing, accountability review boards, and bringing people together to \"figure it out,\" but he hasn't been out front on changing the actual legal standard cops use to get away with murder (or packing the Supreme Court with the kind of liberals who will do it on their own). Unless Biden and the Democrats use their moment of total control of government to change the Graham v. Connor standard, the next cop who shoots an unarmed Black person will claim he feared for his life. And the next one after that. And all the other next ones who will brutalize and kill in this country that refuses to address the state-sponsored terrorism directed against Black bodies. When you watch the Chauvin trial and listen to the defense put on their case, remember that all the victim blaming, fearmongering, and racism is not a fancy lawyer trick aimed at subverting justice. It's a policy choice, made by the Supreme Court.\n\nThat strategy might seem foolish to the untrained eye.

His lawyers are asking about a fantasy world of what might have happened if Floyd were the supernaturally dangerous man Chauvin wanted him to be, instead of the real world where Chauvin tortured and murdered a normal man in a cold-blooded way. This will all come together during closing arguments. Chauvin's lawyers will argue that if it's \"possible\" that Floyd could have called upon the strength of his ancestors and the spirit of the Black Panther to re-breathe and crush his enemies, if Chauvin could have \"reasonably feared\" that zombie-Floyd would reanimate himself and come for Chauvin's brains, then a \"reasonable police officer\" would continue suffocating him until there was no chance of revival. \"Because police officers have the right to go home.\" That's an entirely valid legal argument under our current laws. The legal debate about whether an officer's actions are justified now takes place within the hysterical headspace and fever dreams of a cop, instead of on the plane of objective reality. I don't know if the cop defense will work this time. First of all, Black people do not have superpowers, and it is unreasonable to think that they do. Secondly, I'm not the only one saying that: This time, t here are other cops testifying against Chauvin , arguing that what he did \"absolutely\" defied police training, policy, and procedure. I think it's pretty hard to argue that you are a reasonable cop when other cops testify against you. The Chauvin Trial The Blue Wall of Silence Is Crumbling Around Derek Chauvin Elie Mystal Arradondo Condemned Him, but All Cops Are Derek Chauvin Alyssa Oursler and Anna DalCortivo But the fact that this is even considered a valid defense strategy illustrates, once again, that our laws are objectively pro-police brutality. The Supreme Court has given cops license to kill people, and the only limit it has placed on that violence is what another cop would do in the same situation. It's like a chef telling sheep the wolf gets to set the menu. Congress could repudiate the court's holding in Graham v. Connor and set a new national use-of-force guideline tomorrow, if it wanted to. State governments could define \"reasonable\" force as something more robust than \"whatever the cops say,\" if they wanted to. Many Democratic presidential candidates, from Julián Castro to Cory Booker to Kamala Harris, supported new national use-of-force guidelines and restrictions that, if adopted by states, could render the Chauvin defense inoperable for future murderous cops. But the person who won, President Joe Biden, was not one of them. Biden favors community policing, accountability review boards, and bringing people together to \"figure it out,\" but he hasn't been out front on changing the actual legal standard cops use to get away with murder (or packing the Supreme Court with the kind of liberals who will do it on their own). Unless Biden and the Democrats use their moment of total control of government to change the Graham v. Connor standard, the next cop who shoots an unarmed Black person will claim he feared for his life. And the next one after that. And all the other next ones who will brutalize and kill in this country that refuses to address the state-sponsored terrorism directed against Black bodies. When you watch the Chauvin trial and listen to the defense put on their case, remember that all the victim blaming, fearmongering, and racism is not a fancy lawyer trick aimed at subverting justice. It's a policy choice, made by the Supreme Court.\n\nAs it is, Chauvin's attorneys have taken to citing the 1989 Supreme Court case Graham v. Connor -and doing it so frequently that you'd think a man named Graham V. Connor told Chauvin he could get away with murder. In a way, that's exactly what the case did. Graham v. Connor changed the use-of-force guidelines for police all across the country, allowing them to be more violent and homicidal. To understand how one case has authorized brutality, you have to appreciate that our only real constitutional protection from police violence is the Fourth Amendment's prohibition on \"unreasonable search and seizure.\" \"Unreasonable\" was, naturally, poorly defined by the collection of white men who wrote and ratified the Constitution and determined that things such as slavery and genocide were totally \"reasonable\" uses of state power. Still, for most of American history, the Fourth Amendment followed a \"reasonable [white] man\" standard: The actions of the government, or its agents, were judged through the lens of what an average person would find reasonable. In practice, this allowed for plenty of abuse. Victims of police brutality had to show that officers acted \"unreasonably\" and with malicious intent. As one can imagine, it was always hard for victims (or their surviving family members) to prove that a violently homicidal police officer intended to kill them. Before camera phones, it was nearly impossible to get white people to believe the cops acted like Black people have always said they do.

Connor took this loophole and made it so big that whole police forces could simply saunter right through it. Instead of limiting police use of force to what a reasonable person might expect, the Supreme Court said that force could only be judged against what a reasonable \"officer on the scene\" would do. In the actual Graham v. Connor case, that meant the court found that a \"reasonable officer\" could slam Dethorne Graham's head into his car and break his foot, because Graham was resisting arrest, never mind that he was a diabetic going into shock who was being detained on the suspicion that he stole some orange juice-which he did not. Current Issue View our current issue Graham v. Connor was authored by the conservative Justice William Rehnquist, but the decision was unanimous. The liberals on the court thought this new \"reasonable officer\" standard was an upgrade over trying to prove malicious intent. History has proven them woefully wrong. Graham v. Connor is the reason every officer accused of murder claims \"I feared for my life.\" It's the reason most officers are never charged in the first place and the reason a police officer's saying \"I thought he had a gun\" nullifies the objective truth that a suspect was unarmed. Since Graham v. Connor , it doesn't even matter if the police are malicious or not; they can be malicious so long as they can argue that a \"reasonable police officer\" would be just as malicious under the circumstances. The result is a self-fulfilling loop of violence: As additional officers respond violently to situations, it becomes easier for other officers to argue that violence is a reasonable police response in a similar situation in the future. And Graham v. Connor does all that before we get to the racism. Those who have watched the Chauvin trial have undoubtedly noticed the string of racist bread crumbs laid out by the defense about Floyd's apparent \"strength.\" There is a long and ugly history of white people ascribing super strength to Black people as a way to justify the use of deadly force against those Black people. There's even a controversial medical term, \" excited delirium ,\" that is often cited by the police to explain why they just had to kill an unarmed Black person. At trial, Chauvin's lawyers have argued that even after Chauvin choked Floyd unconscious, he needed to keep choking him, lest Floyd regain consciousness and access his hidden reservoir of big Black power. They've argued that the crowd, the group of bystanders who filmed the murder, might have encouraged Floyd to wake up and start beating Chauvin and the other police officers at the scene-all by himself. When the defense gets to call witnesses, I half expect them to put Bruce Banner on the stand to testify that it's not gamma radiation but colored melanin that makes him swole. All of this racism isn't being offered by the defense to confuse the issue. It's not a sideshow. It goes to the heart of their Graham v. Connor defense. If they can convince even a single juror that large Black people can beat up four cops while almost dead, then they can convince them that a \"reasonable cop\" would keep his knee on a man's neck for nearly 10 minutes. That's why, during cross-examination, the defense keeps asking the cops who are testifying as witnesses against Chauvin-cops who are being called specifically to rebut Chauvin's idea of a \"reasonable officer\"-questions prefaced with \"Is it possible...?\" and \"Have you ever heard of...?\" Is it \"possible\" that Floyd could have entered an excited delirium state and then posed a threat to the officers? Have you ever \"heard\" of a person waking up from being choked unconscious and then hurting somebody? The defense lawyers aren't asking about what actually happened.

I don't know if the cop defense will work this time. First of all, Black people do not have superpowers, and it is unreasonable to think that they do. Secondly, I'm not the only one saying that: This time, t here are other cops testifying against Chauvin , arguing that what he did \"absolutely\" defied police training, policy, and procedure. I think it's pretty hard to argue that you are a reasonable cop when other cops testify against you. The Chauvin Trial The Blue Wall of Silence Is Crumbling Around Derek Chauvin Elie Mystal Arradondo Condemned Him, but All Cops Are Derek Chauvin Alyssa Oursler and Anna DalCortivo But the fact that this is even considered a valid defense strategy illustrates, once again, that our laws are objectively pro-police brutality. The Supreme Court has given cops license to kill people, and the only limit it has placed on that violence is what another cop would do in the same situation. It's like a chef telling sheep the wolf gets to set the menu. Congress could repudiate the court's holding in Graham v. Connor and set a new national use-of-force guideline tomorrow, if it wanted to. State governments could define \"reasonable\" force as something more robust than \"whatever the cops say,\" if they wanted to. Many Democratic presidential candidates, from Julián Castro to Cory Booker to Kamala Harris, supported new national use-of-force guidelines and restrictions that, if adopted by states, could render the Chauvin defense inoperable for future murderous cops. But the person who won, President Joe Biden, was not one of them. Biden favors community policing, accountability review boards, and bringing people together to \"figure it out,\" but he hasn't been out front on changing the actual legal standard cops use to get away with murder (or packing the Supreme Court with the kind of liberals who will do it on their own). Unless Biden and the Democrats use their moment of total control of government to change the Graham v. Connor standard, the next cop who shoots an unarmed Black person will claim he feared for his life. And the next one after that. And all the other next ones who will brutalize and kill in this country that refuses to address the state-sponsored terrorism directed against Black bodies. When you watch the Chauvin trial and listen to the defense put on their case, remember that all the victim blaming, fearmongering, and racism is not a fancy lawyer trick aimed at subverting justice. It's a policy choice, made by the Supreme Court.\n\nGraham v. Connor was authored by the conservative Justice William Rehnquist, but the decision was unanimous. The liberals on the court thought this new \"reasonable officer\" standard was an upgrade over trying to prove malicious intent. History has proven them woefully wrong. Graham v. Connor is the reason every officer accused of murder claims \"I feared for my life.\" It's the reason most officers are never charged in the first place and the reason a police officer's saying \"I thought he had a gun\" nullifies the objective truth that a suspect was unarmed. Since Graham v. Connor , it doesn't even matter if the police are malicious or not; they can be malicious so long as they can argue that a \"reasonable police officer\" would be just as malicious under the circumstances. The result is a self-fulfilling loop of violence: As additional officers respond violently to situations, it becomes easier for other officers to argue that violence is a reasonable police response in a similar situation in the future. And Graham v. Connor does all that before we get to the racism. Those who have watched the Chauvin trial have undoubtedly noticed the string of racist bread crumbs laid out by the defense about Floyd's apparent \"strength.\" There is a long and ugly history of white people ascribing super strength to Black people as a way to justify the use of deadly force against those Black people. There's even a controversial medical term, \" excited delirium ,\" that is often cited by the police to explain why they just had to kill an unarmed Black person. At trial, Chauvin's lawyers have argued that even after Chauvin choked Floyd unconscious, he needed to keep choking him, lest Floyd regain consciousness and access his hidden reservoir of big Black power. They've argued that the crowd, the group of bystanders who filmed the murder, might have encouraged Floyd to wake up and start beating Chauvin and the other police officers at the scene-all by himself. When the defense gets to call witnesses, I half expect them to put Bruce Banner on the stand to testify that it's not gamma radiation but colored melanin that makes him swole. All of this racism isn't being offered by the defense to confuse the issue. It's not a sideshow. It goes to the heart of their Graham v. Connor defense. If they can convince even a single juror that large Black people can beat up four cops while almost dead, then they can convince them that a \"reasonable cop\" would keep his knee on a man's neck for nearly 10 minutes. That's why, during cross-examination, the defense keeps asking the cops who are testifying as witnesses against Chauvin-cops who are being called specifically to rebut Chauvin's idea of a \"reasonable officer\"-questions prefaced with \"Is it possible...?\" and \"Have you ever heard of...?\" Is it \"possible\" that Floyd could have entered an excited delirium state and then posed a threat to the officers? Have you ever \"heard\" of a person waking up from being choked unconscious and then hurting somebody? The defense lawyers aren't asking about what actually happened. In reality, Floyd never posed a threat and never was allowed to wake up, because Chauvin killed him right there on the street. His lawyers are asking about a fantasy world of what might have happened if Floyd were the supernaturally dangerous man Chauvin wanted him to be, instead of the real world where Chauvin tortured and murdered a normal man in a cold-blooded way. This will all come together during closing arguments. Chauvin's lawyers will argue that if it's \"possible\" that Floyd could have called upon the strength of his ancestors and the spirit of the Black Panther to re-breathe and crush his enemies, if Chauvin could have \"reasonably feared\" that zombie-Floyd would reanimate himself and come for Chauvin's brains, then a \"reasonable police officer\" would continue suffocating him until there was no chance of revival. \"Because police officers have the right to go home.\" That's an entirely valid legal argument under our current laws.

The Supreme Court has given cops license to kill people, and the only limit it has placed on that violence is what another cop would do in the same situation. It's like a chef telling sheep the wolf gets to set the menu. Congress could repudiate the court's holding in Graham v. Connor and set a new national use-of-force guideline tomorrow, if it wanted to. State governments could define \"reasonable\" force as something more robust than \"whatever the cops say,\" if they wanted to. Many Democratic presidential candidates, from Julián Castro to Cory Booker to Kamala Harris, supported new national use-of-force guidelines and restrictions that, if adopted by states, could render the Chauvin defense inoperable for future murderous cops. But the person who won, President Joe Biden, was not one of them. Biden favors community policing, accountability review boards, and bringing people together to \"figure it out,\" but he hasn't been out front on changing the actual legal standard cops use to get away with murder (or packing the Supreme Court with the kind of liberals who will do it on their own). Unless Biden and the Democrats use their moment of total control of government to change the Graham v. Connor standard, the next cop who shoots an unarmed Black person will claim he feared for his life. And the next one after that. And all the other next ones who will brutalize and kill in this country that refuses to address the state-sponsored terrorism directed against Black bodies. When you watch the Chauvin trial and listen to the defense put on their case, remember that all the victim blaming, fearmongering, and racism is not a fancy lawyer trick aimed at subverting justice. It's a policy choice, made by the Supreme Court.\n\nThat's an entirely valid legal argument under our current laws. The legal debate about whether an officer's actions are justified now takes place within the hysterical headspace and fever dreams of a cop, instead of on the plane of objective reality. I don't know if the cop defense will work this time. First of all, Black people do not have superpowers, and it is unreasonable to think that they do. Secondly, I'm not the only one saying that: This time, t here are other cops testifying against Chauvin , arguing that what he did \"absolutely\" defied police training, policy, and procedure.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Millions took to the streets around the world, and cops responded with the same violence that was being protested. As Brooks Laughlin watched from a prison cell in Washington state, he was sure he could help the protesters and the police understand each other. He thought he knew from experience exactly what was toxic with police culture and how it could be overcome. In December, I sat with him on the gymnasium floor of the Monroe Correctional Complex. He leaned back against a brick wall-his wide, muscular build a testament to his love of powerlifting. Laughlin always seems tough and collected, and seldom shows any emotion. In 2006, he graduated from Washington state's police academy with top honors, and then at 21, became the Bellingham Police Department's youngest hire in decades. For the next 13 years, he worked as a drug detective; a range master, charged with training and qualifying officers with guns; a member of the National Tactical Officers' Association; and an undercover operative in federal organized crime investigations. He literally wrote the test given to all new officers in his department. He planned and executed drug raids, was involved in shoot-outs, and trained SWAT teams. He was the type of cop about which movies are made. But all the while a secret haunted him that would eventually help land him in prison: \"Since I was young, I knew I had Bipolar Disorder Type I. My mum recognized a lot of it, because growing up her dad was bipolar, and he went to prison and mental institutions for robbing his bank.\" By the time Laughlin was 13, he said he also knew that he would grow up to become a cop. At 14, he joined the Police Explorers, where he got to do ride-alongs and participate in training simulations with the SWAT team. For him, he said, \"there was this picture of law enforcement that was a false picture of perfection.\" His assimilation into police culture started early. \"As an Explorer, I learned there are slangs for everything. Four-eighty-one was the clearing code for someone who was crazy. That was my first glimpse into the dehumanization,\" he told me. \"They didn't call it someone who is having a crisis. No, this is a four-eighty-one. I was like I can't be a four-eighty-one, so I didn't go get a diagnosis.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement Feature / Vincent Bevins The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement The Power and Symbolism of Brazil's Landless Workers' Movement Feature / Vincent Bevins The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women The UK's Anti-Trans Ruling Is a Defeat for All Women Sophie Lewis Current Issue View our current issue At the Academy, he was indoctrinated into an \"us versus the world\" mentality and learned just how deep such dehumanization ran. He said he learned the \"colloquial terms for people you encounter, such as 'doper,' 'skell' [short for skeleton], 'mope,' and 'thug.'\" He said he understands now how they carry \"clear racial undertones,\" but explained that \"it doesn't take long for a recruit to be totally enmeshed into their new cop identity.\" As a young officer, he embraced police culture, which he now describes as cult-like. He married a girl with whom he had been an Explorer and whose father was on the force. They bought a home in suburbia, and had their first child when he was 26. To onlookers, he was a poster child for the aforementioned picture of police perfection, but at work, very different images were being seared into his memory. \"I responded to dead bodies, ranging from suicides, drug overdoses, car accidents, to natural causes. I was in a shoot-out before my training was even over. Less than a month off, I was the first on the scene of a drug homicide, where I had to hold someone's brains in with a towel. He didn't make it. That was just the tip of the iceberg of the horrors I would see and experience over the next dozen years.\" He told me that witnessing the carnage and suffering-often the result of the War on Drugs-drove even the most callous of cops into self-imposed isolation: \"It becomes hard to relate to outsiders. The only people you can relate to are those in your tribe. Your identity becomes fused to that of a cop. This extreme tribalism is the root of toxic police culture. Those that don't face the isolation are ostracized and usually don't make probationary officer status.\" Related Article Incarcerated, Infected, and Ignored: Inside an Arkansas Prison Outbreak Molly Minta The hiring practices, he explained, also play a role. The typical recruit is a white male in his mid-20s with at least some college education. Combine this with a screening for mental illness and a criminal background, and you end up with officers without the experiences of hardship that can help them relate to those they meet in the field. Before long, the Laughlins brought another child into the world. During the birth, Brook Laughlin's mother was rushed to a hospital in Seattle for an emergency operation related to a softball-sized tumor in her brain. \"I couldn't be there because my daughter was being born. It triggered me being manic, because everything was about me or my mum. That's when I stopped giving a shit,\" he said. She survived the surgery and got to meet her second granddaughter, but missed the birth of her third by two weeks. In 2015, Laughlin received a call on his birthday from his father telling him he needed to go see his mum. In February, he lost the person who had kept him grounded since he was a child. Within months, Laughlin's marriage unraveled. He began drinking heavily and soon eloped with a woman from the force with whom he'd been having an affair. Fully immersed in a macho workplace, he ignored his declining mental health and normalized his own violent behavior. In 2018, Laughlin was arrested for second degree assault/domestic violence against his wife and sentenced to 96 months in prison. He told me, \"What I did to my ex-wife is inexcusable... The fact is I hurt the person, other than my kids, I loved the most.\" He said being in prison challenged everything he had been trained to believe about the criminal justice system. \"During my trial, they said I had attended something like 3,800 hours of training, not including the ones I spent teaching. The thing that struck me was that in all those hundreds of hours, none of it told me anything about what life in prison and convict culture is really like. I had no idea what psychosocial factors from prison led to behaviors on the streets.\" Laughlin said that it was the people he met in county jail and prison that led to his realization about the police: \"It was people that led me to see and understand that mass incarceration and aggressive policing is doing no good for this country. We are systemically setting up generations of disenfranchised people for state-sponsored slavery.\" In an era where the idea of police reform has become popular, Laughlin said he feels a responsibility to use his experience on both sides of the system to offer practical solutions: \"Our nation's drug strategies have done a lot to shape modern policing. Drug enforcement is mostly done where it's most visible: the urban street level in poor communities, primarily of color. Drug arrests are easy to self-initiate, which makes them very appealing for cops wishing to generate stats. I believe shifting the drug strategy away from a law enforcement issue to a public health one would improve police's relationships with the communities they serve. Mental health also needs to be handled differently. Not only does law enforcement need to change how they view mental health in the community, but also among their own ranks.\" Related Article The Devastating Emotional Toll of Suspending Prison Visits Karina Piser Laughlin is set for release in 2023, and he said he wants to use his expertise to fight for social justice. He spends his days in prison strumming an acoustic guitar and developing a consulting program that will work with police departments to hold meetings with the formerly incarcerated to further what he believes might be the most important conversation in the country. Recognizing the transformative power of getting to know the people he once viewed as enemies, he said he believes that it's crucial for officers to experience these encounters as well. \"I want to use my experience to help bridge gaps with police agencies and those they serve. I have a plan for classes for law enforcement, where I would bring in convicts to help facilitate learning. Not to lecture or share trade secrets by either side, but in collaborative groups, to work towards solutions.\" He also pointed out that police performance is typically measured in arrests, tickets, warrants, and other enforcement means. \"Reviews and statistics for arrests are used when officers try out for special units and promotions,\" he told me. \"There's no measure of 'What good did you do in people's lives?' Drug crimes, which are predominantly enforced in communities of color, are the easiest target for a stat-hungry officer. The way we allow agencies to use enforcement statistics as a metric of performance is, in itself a testament to systemic racism within the force, and needs to be eliminated.\" Lastly, he said his time as a convict has changed his views about outside oversight. The Department of Corrections, much like the police force, handles all complaints in-house. He said that this means they're likely handled by friends of those in power and thrown out, which provides police and prison guards with almost complete impunity. Laughlin knows the underlying system needs to be changed, but he urged individual officers to not lose themselves in the uniform, and wanted to make a plea to every cop reading this: \"Ignore the stigma our police culture has created about mental health. The most manly thing you can do is ask for help. If your anger is getting out of control, your work life is perfect, but marriage is a mess, or you think of harming yourself, deal with it now, so you don't end up as the next cop making headlines.\"\n\nGeorge Floyd uttered the phrase with the simple hope that the police officer kneeling on his neck would let him live, but the words resonated through communities that understood what it meant to be suffocated by those entrusted to protect them.

He said that this means they're likely handled by friends of those in power and thrown out, which provides police and prison guards with almost complete impunity. Laughlin knows the underlying system needs to be changed, but he urged individual officers to not lose themselves in the uniform, and wanted to make a plea to every cop reading this: \"Ignore the stigma our police culture has created about mental health. The most manly thing you can do is ask for help. If your anger is getting out of control, your work life is perfect, but marriage is a mess, or you think of harming yourself, deal with it now, so you don't end up as the next cop making headlines.\"\n\nIn December, I sat with him on the gymnasium floor of the Monroe Correctional Complex. He leaned back against a brick wall-his wide, muscular build a testament to his love of powerlifting. Laughlin always seems tough and collected, and seldom shows any emotion. In 2006, he graduated from Washington state's police academy with top honors, and then at 21, became the Bellingham Police Department's youngest hire in decades. For the next 13 years, he worked as a drug detective; a range master, charged with training and qualifying officers with guns; a member of the National Tactical Officers' Association; and an undercover operative in federal organized crime investigations. He literally wrote the test given to all new officers in his department. He planned and executed drug raids, was involved in shoot-outs, and trained SWAT teams. He was the type of cop about which movies are made. But all the while a secret haunted him that would eventually help land him in prison: \"Since I was young, I knew I had Bipolar Disorder Type I. My mum recognized a lot of it, because growing up her dad was bipolar, and he went to prison and mental institutions for robbing his bank.\" By the time Laughlin was 13, he said he also knew that he would grow up to become a cop. At 14, he joined the Police Explorers, where he got to do ride-alongs and participate in training simulations with the SWAT team. For him, he said, \"there was this picture of law enforcement that was a false picture of perfection.\" His assimilation into police culture started early. \"As an Explorer, I learned there are slangs for everything. Four-eighty-one was the clearing code for someone who was crazy. That was my first glimpse into the dehumanization,\" he told me. \"They didn't call it someone who is having a crisis.

Before long, the Laughlins brought another child into the world. During the birth, Brook Laughlin's mother was rushed to a hospital in Seattle for an emergency operation related to a softball-sized tumor in her brain. \"I couldn't be there because my daughter was being born. It triggered me being manic, because everything was about me or my mum. That's when I stopped giving a shit,\" he said. She survived the surgery and got to meet her second granddaughter, but missed the birth of her third by two weeks. In 2015, Laughlin received a call on his birthday from his father telling him he needed to go see his mum. In February, he lost the person who had kept him grounded since he was a child. Within months, Laughlin's marriage unraveled. He began drinking heavily and soon eloped with a woman from the force with whom he'd been having an affair. Fully immersed in a macho workplace, he ignored his declining mental health and normalized his own violent behavior. In 2018, Laughlin was arrested for second degree assault/domestic violence against his wife and sentenced to 96 months in prison. He told me, \"What I did to my ex-wife is inexcusable... The fact is I hurt the person, other than my kids, I loved the most.\" He said being in prison challenged everything he had been trained to believe about the criminal justice system. \"During my trial, they said I had attended something like 3,800 hours of training, not including the ones I spent teaching. The thing that struck me was that in all those hundreds of hours, none of it told me anything about what life in prison and convict culture is really like. I had no idea what psychosocial factors from prison led to behaviors on the streets.\" Laughlin said that it was the people he met in county jail and prison that led to his realization about the police: \"It was people that led me to see and understand that mass incarceration and aggressive policing is doing no good for this country. We are systemically setting up generations of disenfranchised people for state-sponsored slavery.\" In an era where the idea of police reform has become popular, Laughlin said he feels a responsibility to use his experience on both sides of the system to offer practical solutions: \"Our nation's drug strategies have done a lot to shape modern policing. Drug enforcement is mostly done where it's most visible: the urban street level in poor communities, primarily of color. Drug arrests are easy to self-initiate, which makes them very appealing for cops wishing to generate stats. I believe shifting the drug strategy away from a law enforcement issue to a public health one would improve police's relationships with the communities they serve.

The fact is I hurt the person, other than my kids, I loved the most.\" He said being in prison challenged everything he had been trained to believe about the criminal justice system. \"During my trial, they said I had attended something like 3,800 hours of training, not including the ones I spent teaching. The thing that struck me was that in all those hundreds of hours, none of it told me anything about what life in prison and convict culture is really like. I had no idea what psychosocial factors from prison led to behaviors on the streets.\" Laughlin said that it was the people he met in county jail and prison that led to his realization about the police: \"It was people that led me to see and understand that mass incarceration and aggressive policing is doing no good for this country. We are systemically setting up generations of disenfranchised people for state-sponsored slavery.\" In an era where the idea of police reform has become popular, Laughlin said he feels a responsibility to use his experience on both sides of the system to offer practical solutions: \"Our nation's drug strategies have done a lot to shape modern policing. Drug enforcement is mostly done where it's most visible: the urban street level in poor communities, primarily of color. Drug arrests are easy to self-initiate, which makes them very appealing for cops wishing to generate stats. I believe shifting the drug strategy away from a law enforcement issue to a public health one would improve police's relationships with the communities they serve. Mental health also needs to be handled differently. Not only does law enforcement need to change how they view mental health in the community, but also among their own ranks.\" Related Article The Devastating Emotional Toll of Suspending Prison Visits Karina Piser Laughlin is set for release in 2023, and he said he wants to use his expertise to fight for social justice. He spends his days in prison strumming an acoustic guitar and developing a consulting program that will work with police departments to hold meetings with the formerly incarcerated to further what he believes might be the most important conversation in the country. Recognizing the transformative power of getting to know the people he once viewed as enemies, he said he believes that it's crucial for officers to experience these encounters as well. \"I want to use my experience to help bridge gaps with police agencies and those they serve. I have a plan for classes for law enforcement, where I would bring in convicts to help facilitate learning. Not to lecture or share trade secrets by either side, but in collaborative groups, to work towards solutions.\" He also pointed out that police performance is typically measured in arrests, tickets, warrants, and other enforcement means. \"Reviews and statistics for arrests are used when officers try out for special units and promotions,\" he told me. \"There's no measure of 'What good did you do in people's lives?' Drug crimes, which are predominantly enforced in communities of color, are the easiest target for a stat-hungry officer. The way we allow agencies to use enforcement statistics as a metric of performance is, in itself a testament to systemic racism within the force, and needs to be eliminated.\" Lastly, he said his time as a convict has changed his views about outside oversight. The Department of Corrections, much like the police force, handles all complaints in-house. He said that this means they're likely handled by friends of those in power and thrown out, which provides police and prison guards with almost complete impunity. Laughlin knows the underlying system needs to be changed, but he urged individual officers to not lose themselves in the uniform, and wanted to make a plea to every cop reading this: \"Ignore the stigma our police culture has created about mental health. The most manly thing you can do is ask for help. If your anger is getting out of control, your work life is perfect, but marriage is a mess, or you think of harming yourself, deal with it now, so you don't end up as the next cop making headlines.\"\n\nHis assimilation into police culture started early. \"As an Explorer, I learned there are slangs for everything. Four-eighty-one was the clearing code for someone who was crazy. That was my first glimpse into the dehumanization,\" he told me. \"They didn't call it someone who is having a crisis. No, this is a four-eighty-one.

He said he learned the \"colloquial terms for people you encounter, such as 'doper,' 'skell' [short for skeleton], 'mope,' and 'thug.'\" He said he understands now how they carry \"clear racial undertones,\" but explained that \"it doesn't take long for a recruit to be totally enmeshed into their new cop identity.\" As a young officer, he embraced police culture, which he now describes as cult-like. He married a girl with whom he had been an Explorer and whose father was on the force. They bought a home in suburbia, and had their first child when he was 26. To onlookers, he was a poster child for the aforementioned picture of police perfection, but at work, very different images were being seared into his memory. \"I responded to dead bodies, ranging from suicides, drug overdoses, car accidents, to natural causes.

That was just the tip of the iceberg of the horrors I would see and experience over the next dozen years.\" He told me that witnessing the carnage and suffering-often the result of the War on Drugs-drove even the most callous of cops into self-imposed isolation: \"It becomes hard to relate to outsiders. The only people you can relate to are those in your tribe. Your identity becomes fused to that of a cop. This extreme tribalism is the root of toxic police culture.

Combine this with a screening for mental illness and a criminal background, and you end up with officers without the experiences of hardship that can help them relate to those they meet in the field. Before long, the Laughlins brought another child into the world. During the birth, Brook Laughlin's mother was rushed to a hospital in Seattle for an emergency operation related to a softball-sized tumor in her brain. \"I couldn't be there because my daughter was being born. It triggered me being manic, because everything was about me or my mum. That's when I stopped giving a shit,\" he said. She survived the surgery and got to meet her second granddaughter, but missed the birth of her third by two weeks. In 2015, Laughlin received a call on his birthday from his father telling him he needed to go see his mum. In February, he lost the person who had kept him grounded since he was a child. Within months, Laughlin's marriage unraveled. He began drinking heavily and soon eloped with a woman from the force with whom he'd been having an affair.

I believe shifting the drug strategy away from a law enforcement issue to a public health one would improve police's relationships with the communities they serve.

Not only does law enforcement need to change how they view mental health in the community, but also among their own ranks.\" Related Article The Devastating Emotional Toll of Suspending Prison Visits Karina Piser Laughlin is set for release in 2023, and he said he wants to use his expertise to fight for social justice. He spends his days in prison strumming an acoustic guitar and developing a consulting program that will work with police departments to hold meetings with the formerly incarcerated to further what he believes might be the most important conversation in the country. Recognizing the transformative power of getting to know the people he once viewed as enemies, he said he believes that it's crucial for officers to experience these encounters as well. \"I want to use my experience to help bridge gaps with police agencies and those they serve.

Drug crimes, which are predominantly enforced in communities of color, are the easiest target for a stat-hungry officer. The way we allow agencies to use enforcement statistics as a metric of performance is, in itself a testament to systemic racism within the force, and needs to be eliminated.\" Lastly, he said his time as a convict has changed his views about outside oversight. The Department of Corrections, much like the police force, handles all complaints in-house. He said that this means they're likely handled by friends of those in power and thrown out, which provides police and prison guards with almost complete impunity. Laughlin knows the underlying system needs to be changed, but he urged individual officers to not lose themselves in the uniform, and wanted to make a plea to every cop reading this: \"Ignore the stigma our police culture has created about mental health. The most manly thing you can do is ask for help. If your anger is getting out of control, your work life is perfect, but marriage is a mess, or you think of harming yourself, deal with it now, so you don't end up as the next cop making headlines.\"\n\nBefore long, the Laughlins brought another child into the world. During the birth, Brook Laughlin's mother was rushed to a hospital in Seattle for an emergency operation related to a softball-sized tumor in her brain. \"I couldn't be there because my daughter was being born. It triggered me being manic, because everything was about me or my mum. That's when I stopped giving a shit,\" he said. She survived the surgery and got to meet her second granddaughter, but missed the birth of her third by two weeks. In 2015, Laughlin received a call on his birthday from his father telling him he needed to go see his mum. In February, he lost the person who had kept him grounded since he was a child. Within months, Laughlin's marriage unraveled. He began drinking heavily and soon eloped with a woman from the force with whom he'd been having an affair. Fully immersed in a macho workplace, he ignored his declining mental health and normalized his own violent behavior. In 2018, Laughlin was arrested for second degree assault/domestic violence against his wife and sentenced to 96 months in prison. He told me, \"What I did to my ex-wife is inexcusable... The fact is I hurt the person, other than my kids, I loved the most.\" He said being in prison challenged everything he had been trained to believe about the criminal justice system. \"During my trial, they said I had attended something like 3,800 hours of training, not including the ones I spent teaching. The thing that struck me was that in all those hundreds of hours, none of it told me anything about what life in prison and convict culture is really like. I had no idea what psychosocial factors from prison led to behaviors on the streets.\" Laughlin said that it was the people he met in county jail and prison that led to his realization about the police: \"It was people that led me to see and understand that mass incarceration and aggressive policing is doing no good for this country. We are systemically setting up generations of disenfranchised people for state-sponsored slavery.\" In an era where the idea of police reform has become popular, Laughlin said he feels a responsibility to use his experience on both sides of the system to offer practical solutions: \"Our nation's drug strategies have done a lot to shape modern policing.

And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Now the city's notorious police forces are raiding its college campus.\n\nPolice officers detain a demonstrator during a pro-Palestinian protest against the war in Gaza at Emory University on April 25, 2024, in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nMaybe you've already seen the video of Dr. Noëlle McAfee, the chair of the Emory University Philosophy Department and the president-elect of the Emory Senate, being frog-marched out of a university building in handcuffs by an Atlanta Police officer wearing a balaclava. The student filming the video asks if they can do anything, and McAfee responds, calmly, \"Can you call the philosophy department and tell them I've been arrested?\" Her arrestable offense? Coming upon a police officer \" pummeling \" a student and refusing to walk away.\n\nThe morning of April 25 was cool and lovely in Atlanta. Spring is in full bloom, and the scent of honeysuckle often hangs in the morning air. A little after 7 am , a group of people-Emory students joined by community members and students from surrounding universities-bound together to join the nationwide movement of students and organizers erecting encampments with the purpose of demanding that their schools divest from financial relationships with Israel. In the case of Emory, a mid-sized, private university in Atlanta, people were also protesting against the construction of the police training facility known as Cop City-a demand from the greater-Atlanta community that has been consistent since plans to raze forest land to build the expensive, unpopular project were announced in 2021. \"Divest from Death,\" a banner hung on one of Emory's stone buildings read. \"No Genocide and No Cop City.\"\n\nFor an almost comically short period of time, the protesters and their encampments were alone on the quad. But Emory University President Greg Fenves, against the urging of some of his own faculty, called the cops fast. He knew exactly what he was doing: calling in state and city police forces that have, among other things, killed a 62-year-old deacon at a traffic stop, sexually harassed people during raids of Cop City opponents' homes, killed a forest defender sitting in a tent in the woods, tore two students out of their car, tased them, and smashed their windows for a \"curfew violation,\" is a direct threat. Arrested students would be sent to the Dekalb County Jail, or \" DeKalb County Hell ,\" one of the deadliest jails in the country.\n\nBy 8 am , the quad was swarming with officers from a trifecta of police agencies: Emory Campus Police, Atlanta Police, and Georgia State Patrol. Given Georgia's history, it's not at all surprising that an Atlanta-area university was, compared with other schools, the quickest to call the cops. Within minutes, police had wreaked havoc on the quad. They threw tear gas, fired pepper balls, and repeatedly tased a Black medic after he had already been handcuffed and thrown to the ground. Dr. Caroline Fohlin, a well-known economics professor who happens to be married to the dean of students, came over to a group of officers who had a student pinned to the ground. \"What are you doing?\" she asks incredulously. Almost immediately, police turn around and slam her down on the concrete. Her glasses are knocked askew; she cries out, almost in disbelief, \"I'm a professor!\" She was charged with battery. A professor of English, Dr. Emil' Keme, was tackled on camera as he was walking across the quad. \"I literally felt that I was in a war zone,\" he told Democracy Now! Multiple Black students and organizers are seen being carried off by police, screaming. This is exactly what Stop Cop City organizers feared when they warned the city about the risks of further militarizing already-violent police forces.\n\nThe connection between Cop City, Israel, and Atlanta-area universities are stronger than you might guess. \"The parallels,\" Atlanta organizers write , \"extend deeper into the mechanisms of oppression, where the tactics employed to suppress dissent in Atlanta echo those used globally, facilitated by significant international collaboration in policing and surveillance.\" First, there's the fact that Cop City is being built nearly in the mold of the Israeli Urban Warfare Training Center (UWTC) or \"Mini Gaza,\" as it is unaffectionately known. UWTC is, according to the IDF's website, a \"training facility to answer the IDF's needs for modern urban warfare training.\" It simulates an \"...authentic, modern desert city,\" complete with \"fully-populated complexes to shabby shacks, schools, city-stores, public buildings and market places.\" On the Atlanta Police Foundation's website, Cop City is described as a \"state-of-the-art facility, complete with \"a mock streetscape to simulate real-world crisis situations faced by law enforcement officers.\" One wonders whether a mock campus-quad will be added to Cop City blueprints.\n\nThen there's the Georgia International Law Enforcement Exchange. GILEE, which has been housed within Georgia State University for over 30 years, is basically just what it sounds like: a foreign exchange program for cops. While GILEE technically works in multiple countries now, the primary relationship is between Israel and various Georgia police agencies. The organization's website will tell you about \"enhancing homeland security efforts through international cooperation and training programs,\" but in less war-machine-PR-language, GILEE is all about Israeli and US police forces trading tips on how to manage and crack down on communities with a de facto racial underclass.\n\nOver the last three years, those opposed to Cop City have had all their arguments upheld and their worst fears confirmed. Organizers were worried about protesters' getting killed-then Georgia State Patrol officers murdered Tortuguita, a forest defender, while they were sitting in their tent on public land. There were fears about unnecessary arrests and trumped-up criminal charges, and since 2021, police have brutalized and arrested scores of people opposed to Cop City, including over 60 who have been ensnared in a bogus RICO prosecution . Environmentalists warned of the catastrophic impacts the building of Cop City would engender. The roads surrounding the construction site have already been rendered impassable due to flooding multiple times over the past few months. A lawsuit was filed over the pollution of the South River as a result of current construction.\n\nRepression of anti-war or anti-police movements on college campuses (and beyond) is obviously not a new phenomenon. There has, rightfully, been lots of talk about the student protests of the 1960s and '70s. But there is a key difference between then and now : The police forces responding to campus protests today are not the same as those who showed up to Columbia in 1968, and they're not the same as those who showed up to post 9/11 anti-war demonstrations. Even small-town police forces today more closely resemble the armed-to-the-teeth National Guard who showed up to kill kids at Kent State in 1970. On campuses across the country , but particularly in the South, we are seeing the kind of violence that no training at Cop City would mitigate.\n\nSuppressing dissent or rebellion has always been foundational to policing, but militarization really started in earnest in the 1970s, and that timing is not coincidental. The first SWAT (Special Weapons and Tactics) teams emerged in the 1960s. Cops would like you to think, in part, that this was to keep students safe on campuses: Police lore cites Charles Whitman's killing spree from the University of Texas watchtower as seminal to the creation of more militarized police forces. There were other reasons, too: uprisings and protest movements throughout the '60s, particularly LA's Watts Rebellion. Amid those uprisings, the chief of the LAPD compared anti-war/anti-imperialism protesters to the Viet Cong: Not so far off from the politicians, police officials, and talking heads endlessly accusing today's anti-genocide protesters of \" pro-Hamas propaganda .\"\n\nWhat transpired at Emory last week is exactly why Atlantans don't want Cop City. It's what we have been protesting for three years. When untold sums of public money and state propaganda have been invested in militarized policing, militarized police become the answer to everything. The SWAT vehicles, tasers, pepper balls, bulletproof vests, guns, and tear gas and the cops' time were paid for with funds that should have gone toward things like healthcare, bridge repairs, universal pre-K, and access to healthy food.\n\nAt a Cop City action last fall, protesters showed up with large puppetry and gardening tools to plant sapling trees, and the cops showed up with, among other things, SWAT vehicles, sound cannons, tear gas, and a dog in tactical goggles . It's just as ridiculous a response as sending in scores of adults in tactical gear with weapons of war to disperse a group of young people, tired of reading about children being obliterated by the thousands, sitting on a lawn. When all you have is a hammer, all you see are nails.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Students have to deal with both municipal and campus cops, and so do the people who live around university grounds. And campus have only become more professionalized and militarized in the paste decade. They are frequently armed, equally as violent as regular cops, and-especially at private universities- not burdened with the same expectation of transparency. These are complaints shared by students across the country. To this end, we asked students at universities that have led the way in campus police abolition movements to tell us about what they've been doing to hold their universities' police departments accountable. 2 W hile many colleges and universities have only recently started to contend with policing on college campuses in the wake of this summer's Black Lives Matter protests, the University of Chicago's reckoning with its private police force began in early 2018. Following the shooting of a university undergraduate by an officer of the University of Chicago Police Department (UCPD), students were galvanized to create a #CareNotCops (CNC) chapter on campus and demand reform. 3 The UCPD has a history of policing Black and brown people on campus, questioning their purpose in buildings, once even forcefully arresting a Black student in the library for making too much noise. Their presence is even more pervasive for the South Side residents within the force's three-mile jurisdiction, which extends roughly 14 blocks north past the campus. As such, reform efforts have brought together various student groups and faculty members with local residents seeking greater transparency of budget and practice, disarmament, and a defunding that redistributes resources to the surrounding neighborhood, which is largely Black and historically underserved. 4 This story was produced for Student Nation, a section devoted to highlighting campus activism and student movements from students in their own words.

At the end of the academic year, the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor lit new fire under these existing demands, spurring protests around Hyde Park and the deployment of more radical tactics by student organizers, which has led to a number of contentious confrontations between the university administration and activists in the past year. At the beginning of the summer, student organizers from a number of campus activist groups staged a sit-in at UCPD headquarters that included, at points, over 100 participants and lasted through the night. In September, the week before the start of the new school year, CNC staged a controversial, week-long occupation in front of Provost Ka Yee Lee's, calling for her to agree to a recorded public meeting and address their demands.

Instead of an armed force, the Maroon advocated for an unarmed emergency response force trained in seeking to \"better trained and equipped to handle particular, commonly occurring University-related situations.\" In the editorial, we point particularly to not just the past horrifying actions of the UCPD, but how policing is not an adequate response for students going through a mental health crisis. Student organizing is crucial-the surrounding community can and will be safer without a private militarized force. 6 Current Issue View our current issue The editorial was published following the 19-hour occupation of UCPD headquarters, where student organizers demanded that the university hold a public town hall that fielded comments from students and community members. The university has refused to meet this demand, nor has it offered to consider the broader, abolitionist demands of student organizers. We wrote our editorial with the firm belief that, given the university's past actions and its claimed interests in serving both its students and the greater community needs, a Hyde Park free of the UCPD will help keep students and the community safer. The student organizing group UChicago United, which is affiliated with #CareNotCops, has been facilitating mutual aid in Hyde Park and now tables weekly by Jewel-Osco, a grocery store near campus. 7 Amid the gentrification taking place in Hyde Park, student organizing has helped increase students engagement with and support of mutual aid projects. Defunding UCPD as a step toward its abolition would be a direct means of putting resources into the hands of community members and directing funds toward those who need them the most. Abolition is not just a process about taking down systems that may be inequitable; abolition is about creating new possibilities and new ways of helping us all live more fulfilling lives. 8 - K ate M abus and N oah T esfaye , University of Chicago 9 I n the midst of last summer's nationwide uprising for Black lives, Phoenix students escalated their #CopsOuttaCampus protests, demanding the removal of School Resource Officers (SROs) from Phoenix schools. The students were from Puente , a human rights group organizing to improve the lives of Arizona's most marginalized communities. After three months of intensive lobbying and action, they won a resounding victory: the district superintendent announced the dissolution of its police contract and the removal of SROs. 10 Phoenix followed a number of other cities-most prominently Minneapolis , where George Floyd was murdered, as well as Portland and Denver . For years, youth and community organizations across the country had raised the alarm on SROs. According to the Dignity in Schools Campaign , Black students are nearly three and a half times more likely to be taken into police custody than white students; Latinx students are one and a half times more likely. 11 Phoenix in particular has a long history of targeting and discriminating against students of color. In the early 1900s, African American students were segregated in a basement known as the \"Department for Colored Students,\" where all of their classes were held. In 1969, a group of students formed Chicanos Por La Causa in response to racial inequities. At first, they lobbied the district; after the district refused to listen, they organized a month of walkouts. 12 Puente's campaign launched in 2017. Students had already been organizing in response to then-President Trump's new immigration policies as well as SB 1070 , Arizona's landmark \"show me your papers\" law. In 2019, an SRO pepper-sprayed a group of middle school students at Isaac School District, ramping up the urgency. Then, last summer, with growing school shootings and Black Lives Matter protests alike, the campaign took off. \"There were so many stories of undocumented people coming out,\" said Michelle Ruiz, a Puente youth organizer. \"Our community was already being targeted, and so we felt like our schools were going to be the next target.\" 13 From the start, the campaign employed a range of tactics-using social media to educate peers, attending board meetings, and holding protests outside district headquarters. In early 2018, following the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, students marched downtown demanding that SROs leave their campuses. \"We wanted to remove SROs from schools to make a point of safety and security,\" said Puente's development and financial director Isis Gil. \"But there's always an ask for other resources for our youth, such as more counselors, more nurses, and social services to improve their lives.\" 14 In June 2020, Abia Khan, a North High senior who was part of Puente Youth and is now a Harvard freshman, started a petition to reignite the call for SRO removal. Phoenix PD had become one of the deadliest police forces in America, and Khan felt that there was no reason for a force like that to be present on school campuses. The petition went on to amass 4,000 signatures, putting pressure on the district while helping to build Puente's base. 15 \"The Black Lives Matter protests were the first time I had heard the phrase, 'defund the police,'\" Khan said. \"If I'm being completely honest, it caught me a little off guard because I couldn't understand the demand. After doing more research, I realized the merits of the demand.\" 16 One of the board members, Stephanie Parra, felt the urgency. \"I appreciate when students use their voice,\" she said. \"What they did last summer wasn't just personal. They were demanding more from an institution that has a long history of oppression and racism.\" 17 The board's initial vote was split: three in support of termination, three against, and one abstention. Those who were against it had security concerns for the students. The final decision was announced on July 7, following internal dissension. 18 Now, students are working to hold PUHSD accountable for the $1.2 million that the district recouped from the terminated contract. In September, the district launched a participatory budgeting process, recruiting student, parent, and staff input. Puente Youth members are trying to figure out the best way to reinvest the funds. They're also expanding the campaign to other schools in Arizona, starting with Glendale and Mesa, where they plan to launch student programs, like in Phoenix, anchored by training on leadership and grassroots organizing. 19 \"I hope that other people that I know or people who see me on social media will see the work I am doing,\" Ruiz reflected. \"I hope they will want to go out there and do it themselves, so they are part of a huge community and a larger project.\" 20 - A nna D eogratias , Arizona State University class of 2020 21 I n the 2021 Maryland state legislative session, SB0276 was introduced to repeal the ability of Johns Hopkins University to form a private police force. After nearly four years of fighting, student organizers and community members in Baltimore had finally brought opposition to the private police to the state Senate floor. 22 Our organizing began in 2018, when the university wrote and lobbied for a bill that would authorize the creation of a private police force to patrol not just campus but the surrounding communities. The bill, called the \"Community Safety and Strengthening Act,\" was introduced to the Senate in 2019; the General Assembly passed the bill, despite significant opposition from Hopkins affiliates and community members who reside in the areas surrounding Hopkins campuses. 23 That April, student and community activists staged a 35-day sit-in at Garland Hall, the administrative building. At least seven protesters, both students and local residents, were dragged from the building and arrested. Rather than address the concerns being raised by these activists, university President Ron Daniels called the Baltimore Police Department. 24 The Coalition Against Policing by Hopkins formed during the 2020 nationwide protests. The university also acted in the wake of a global reckoning with police brutality: it announced a \"two-year pause\" on the creation of their police force to \"reevaluate\" the role of policing in public safety. The \"pause\" included disbanding the student advisory board, the police accountability board, and the school has stopped holding meetings with community members. 25 Then, despite the two-year pause, earlier this year Hopkins sent administrators to testify at the SB0276 bill hearings. They spoke against the bill, saying that a police force is necessary for the safety of Hopkins affiliates. Organizers here noted that this position flagrantly contradicted their previous claim that during the so-called pause, the university would \"reevaluate\" the role of policing. Every person who testified spoke about the police force as an entity that will absolutely exist after their \"pause.\" 26 While the university disbanded its advisory boards, we with the Coalition Against Policing by Hopkins-made up of student organizers and Baltimore community activists from over a dozen groups like the Baltimore Redevelopment Action Coalition for Empowerment, Greater Baltimore Democratic Socialists of America, Teachers and Researchers United, and the Hopkins graduate student union-escalated the opposition to the Hopkins private police force. 27 CAPH and concerned faculty circulated a petition calling for the full abandonment of the JHUPD that received over 6,000 individual signatures from Hopkins affiliates, alumni, and Baltimore community members, which we delivered to university president Ron Daniels's house at the end of a protest march across campus. 28 Though our pressure led to significant movement of this bill, it failed to pass committee. Now, CAPH is organizing communities to make clear its opposition both on the campus and among the surrounding residents who would be directly impacted by their neighborhoods being patrolled by Hopkins police officers. 29 Immediately after the failure of SB0276 to pass from committee, Hopkins announced that it is renewing the search for a vice president of security and public safety, thus solidifying plans to create JHPD. 30 This work is far from over. CAPH is ready to continue this fight as long as Hopkins plans to force police on Baltimore City. We've slowed them down by four years-and we're not going anywhere. 31 - A ndrew E neim , Johns Hopkins University 32 A mid a global pandemic and calls for defunding the police around the country, the University of California system maintained and even increased the UC Police Department (UCPD) budget. The UCLA police budget, for example, was projected to increase from $21,663,372 to $22,182,739 in the next year-a 2.4-percent increase. 33 This money goes toward initiatives like predictive policing technologies, surveillance softwares, and community policing partnerships. These harmful carceral alliances not only inflict violence; they also extract money from the students and communities without keeping them safe. 34 It is clear that the UC system has prioritized its allegiances to policing, upholding policing logics and colonial structures of violence. 35 The exorbitant amount of money spent at UCPD is only one example of the university's inability to prioritize community over state violence. This is coupled with several inevitably failed attempts to \"hold police accountable\" for instances of state violence, including the harm to student protesters. 36 Cops Off Campus is a coalition of graduate students, undergraduate students, faculty, staff, and community members who have come together to organize around the abolition of police at UCLA and beyond. 37 We are demanding the removal of the physical manifestations of the police, as well as a disbanding and refusal of all police partnerships and technologies within academic spaces and other university supported spaces. These spaces include student housing and community hospitals owned or managed by the university. 38 We acknowledge that UCLA, and academia more generally, is a space of complicity. Our school has been the site of extensive state violence and has created various forms of policing technologies, producing research that inflicts harm on campus and within communities. 39 We are not calling for attempts to reform the police or attempting to hold them accountable. 40 Over the last year we have organized protests, held reflection spaces, and launched a map of carceral violence on our campus . Throughout May, we are joining a national alliance of faculty, staff, and students to call for the complete removal of cops from all academic spaces and to educate and activate members to collectively imagine a community without police through the creation of spaces for protest, reflection, healing and mutual aid. But it's not just that. We are also demanding a cost-of-living adjustment for equitable pay for all workers at the university. We are demanding a reinvestment to community healing, mental health, and student support. We are demanding land back. We are demanding an end to all forms of policing violence and harm through the university and beyond. 41 - V ictoria C opeland and D ominique M ikell , University of California, Los Angeles Cops Off Campus 42\n\nStudents have been making these demands for years now, and not just for local police.

Then, last summer, with growing school shootings and Black Lives Matter protests alike, the campaign took off. \"There were so many stories of undocumented people coming out,\" said Michelle Ruiz, a Puente youth organizer. \"Our community was already being targeted, and so we felt like our schools were going to be the next target.\" 13 From the start, the campaign employed a range of tactics-using social media to educate peers, attending board meetings, and holding protests outside district headquarters. In early 2018, following the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, students marched downtown demanding that SROs leave their campuses. \"We wanted to remove SROs from schools to make a point of safety and security,\" said Puente's development and financial director Isis Gil. \"But there's always an ask for other resources for our youth, such as more counselors, more nurses, and social services to improve their lives.\" 14 In June 2020, Abia Khan, a North High senior who was part of Puente Youth and is now a Harvard freshman, started a petition to reignite the call for SRO removal. Phoenix PD had become one of the deadliest police forces in America, and Khan felt that there was no reason for a force like that to be present on school campuses. The petition went on to amass 4,000 signatures, putting pressure on the district while helping to build Puente's base. 15 \"The Black Lives Matter protests were the first time I had heard the phrase, 'defund the police,'\" Khan said. \"If I'm being completely honest, it caught me a little off guard because I couldn't understand the demand. After doing more research, I realized the merits of the demand.\" 16 One of the board members, Stephanie Parra, felt the urgency. \"I appreciate when students use their voice,\" she said. \"What they did last summer wasn't just personal. They were demanding more from an institution that has a long history of oppression and racism.\" 17 The board's initial vote was split: three in support of termination, three against, and one abstention. Those who were against it had security concerns for the students. The final decision was announced on July 7, following internal dissension. 18 Now, students are working to hold PUHSD accountable for the $1.2 million that the district recouped from the terminated contract. In September, the district launched a participatory budgeting process, recruiting student, parent, and staff input. Puente Youth members are trying to figure out the best way to reinvest the funds. They're also expanding the campaign to other schools in Arizona, starting with Glendale and Mesa, where they plan to launch student programs, like in Phoenix, anchored by training on leadership and grassroots organizing. 19 \"I hope that other people that I know or people who see me on social media will see the work I am doing,\" Ruiz reflected. \"I hope they will want to go out there and do it themselves, so they are part of a huge community and a larger project.\" 20 - A nna D eogratias , Arizona State University class of 2020 21 I n the 2021 Maryland state legislative session, SB0276 was introduced to repeal the ability of Johns Hopkins University to form a private police force. After nearly four years of fighting, student organizers and community members in Baltimore had finally brought opposition to the private police to the state Senate floor. 22 Our organizing began in 2018, when the university wrote and lobbied for a bill that would authorize the creation of a private police force to patrol not just campus but the surrounding communities. The bill, called the \"Community Safety and Strengthening Act,\" was introduced to the Senate in 2019; the General Assembly passed the bill, despite significant opposition from Hopkins affiliates and community members who reside in the areas surrounding Hopkins campuses. 23 That April, student and community activists staged a 35-day sit-in at Garland Hall, the administrative building. At least seven protesters, both students and local residents, were dragged from the building and arrested. Rather than address the concerns being raised by these activists, university President Ron Daniels called the Baltimore Police Department. 24 The Coalition Against Policing by Hopkins formed during the 2020 nationwide protests. The university also acted in the wake of a global reckoning with police brutality: it announced a \"two-year pause\" on the creation of their police force to \"reevaluate\" the role of policing in public safety. The \"pause\" included disbanding the student advisory board, the police accountability board, and the school has stopped holding meetings with community members. 25 Then, despite the two-year pause, earlier this year Hopkins sent administrators to testify at the SB0276 bill hearings. They spoke against the bill, saying that a police force is necessary for the safety of Hopkins affiliates. Organizers here noted that this position flagrantly contradicted their previous claim that during the so-called pause, the university would \"reevaluate\" the role of policing. Every person who testified spoke about the police force as an entity that will absolutely exist after their \"pause.\" 26 While the university disbanded its advisory boards, we with the Coalition Against Policing by Hopkins-made up of student organizers and Baltimore community activists from over a dozen groups like the Baltimore Redevelopment Action Coalition for Empowerment, Greater Baltimore Democratic Socialists of America, Teachers and Researchers United, and the Hopkins graduate student union-escalated the opposition to the Hopkins private police force. 27 CAPH and concerned faculty circulated a petition calling for the full abandonment of the JHUPD that received over 6,000 individual signatures from Hopkins affiliates, alumni, and Baltimore community members, which we delivered to university president Ron Daniels's house at the end of a protest march across campus. 28 Though our pressure led to significant movement of this bill, it failed to pass committee. Now, CAPH is organizing communities to make clear its opposition both on the campus and among the surrounding residents who would be directly impacted by their neighborhoods being patrolled by Hopkins police officers. 29 Immediately after the failure of SB0276 to pass from committee, Hopkins announced that it is renewing the search for a vice president of security and public safety, thus solidifying plans to create JHPD. 30 This work is far from over. CAPH is ready to continue this fight as long as Hopkins plans to force police on Baltimore City. We've slowed them down by four years-and we're not going anywhere. 31 - A ndrew E neim , Johns Hopkins University 32 A mid a global pandemic and calls for defunding the police around the country, the University of California system maintained and even increased the UC Police Department (UCPD) budget. The UCLA police budget, for example, was projected to increase from $21,663,372 to $22,182,739 in the next year-a 2.4-percent increase. 33 This money goes toward initiatives like predictive policing technologies, surveillance softwares, and community policing partnerships. These harmful carceral alliances not only inflict violence; they also extract money from the students and communities without keeping them safe. 34 It is clear that the UC system has prioritized its allegiances to policing, upholding policing logics and colonial structures of violence. 35 The exorbitant amount of money spent at UCPD is only one example of the university's inability to prioritize community over state violence. This is coupled with several inevitably failed attempts to \"hold police accountable\" for instances of state violence, including the harm to student protesters. 36 Cops Off Campus is a coalition of graduate students, undergraduate students, faculty, staff, and community members who have come together to organize around the abolition of police at UCLA and beyond. 37 We are demanding the removal of the physical manifestations of the police, as well as a disbanding and refusal of all police partnerships and technologies within academic spaces and other university supported spaces. These spaces include student housing and community hospitals owned or managed by the university. 38 We acknowledge that UCLA, and academia more generally, is a space of complicity. Our school has been the site of extensive state violence and has created various forms of policing technologies, producing research that inflicts harm on campus and within communities. 39 We are not calling for attempts to reform the police or attempting to hold them accountable. 40 Over the last year we have organized protests, held reflection spaces, and launched a map of carceral violence on our campus . Throughout May, we are joining a national alliance of faculty, staff, and students to call for the complete removal of cops from all academic spaces and to educate and activate members to collectively imagine a community without police through the creation of spaces for protest, reflection, healing and mutual aid. But it's not just that. We are also demanding a cost-of-living adjustment for equitable pay for all workers at the university. We are demanding a reinvestment to community healing, mental health, and student support. We are demanding land back. We are demanding an end to all forms of policing violence and harm through the university and beyond. 41 - V ictoria C opeland and D ominique M ikell , University of California, Los Angeles Cops Off Campus 42\n\nW hile many colleges and universities have only recently started to contend with policing on college campuses in the wake of this summer's Black Lives Matter protests, the University of Chicago's reckoning with its private police force began in early 2018. Following the shooting of a university undergraduate by an officer of the University of Chicago Police Department (UCPD), students were galvanized to create a #CareNotCops (CNC) chapter on campus and demand reform. 3 The UCPD has a history of policing Black and brown people on campus, questioning their purpose in buildings, once even forcefully arresting a Black student in the library for making too much noise. Their presence is even more pervasive for the South Side residents within the force's three-mile jurisdiction, which extends roughly 14 blocks north past the campus. As such, reform efforts have brought together various student groups and faculty members with local residents seeking greater transparency of budget and practice, disarmament, and a defunding that redistributes resources to the surrounding neighborhood, which is largely Black and historically underserved. 4 This story was produced for Student Nation, a section devoted to highlighting campus activism and student movements from students in their own words.

The Student Nation program is made possible through generous funding from The Puffin Foundation . At the end of the academic year, the killings of George Floyd and Breonna Taylor lit new fire under these existing demands, spurring protests around Hyde Park and the deployment of more radical tactics by student organizers, which has led to a number of contentious confrontations between the university administration and activists in the past year. At the beginning of the summer, student organizers from a number of campus activist groups staged a sit-in at UCPD headquarters that included, at points, over 100 participants and lasted through the night. In September, the week before the start of the new school year, CNC staged a controversial, week-long occupation in front of Provost Ka Yee Lee's, calling for her to agree to a recorded public meeting and address their demands. This October, CNC collaborated with the youth activist group Good Kids Mad City to organize a Halloween-night demonstration advocating for the defunding of the UCPD and reduced Chicago Police Department (CPD) presence on the South Side. 5 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer In June of 2020, the Chicago Maroon published an editorial endorsing the organizing efforts of students and community members to disband and abolish the UCPD. Instead of an armed force, the Maroon advocated for an unarmed emergency response force trained in seeking to \"better trained and equipped to handle particular, commonly occurring University-related situations.\" In the editorial, we point particularly to not just the past horrifying actions of the UCPD, but how policing is not an adequate response for students going through a mental health crisis. Student organizing is crucial-the surrounding community can and will be safer without a private militarized force. 6 Current Issue View our current issue The editorial was published following the 19-hour occupation of UCPD headquarters, where student organizers demanded that the university hold a public town hall that fielded comments from students and community members. The university has refused to meet this demand, nor has it offered to consider the broader, abolitionist demands of student organizers. We wrote our editorial with the firm belief that, given the university's past actions and its claimed interests in serving both its students and the greater community needs, a Hyde Park free of the UCPD will help keep students and the community safer. The student organizing group UChicago United, which is affiliated with #CareNotCops, has been facilitating mutual aid in Hyde Park and now tables weekly by Jewel-Osco, a grocery store near campus. 7 Amid the gentrification taking place in Hyde Park, student organizing has helped increase students engagement with and support of mutual aid projects. Defunding UCPD as a step toward its abolition would be a direct means of putting resources into the hands of community members and directing funds toward those who need them the most. Abolition is not just a process about taking down systems that may be inequitable; abolition is about creating new possibilities and new ways of helping us all live more fulfilling lives. 8 - K ate M abus and N oah T esfaye , University of Chicago 9 I n the midst of last summer's nationwide uprising for Black lives, Phoenix students escalated their #CopsOuttaCampus protests, demanding the removal of School Resource Officers (SROs) from Phoenix schools. The students were from Puente , a human rights group organizing to improve the lives of Arizona's most marginalized communities. After three months of intensive lobbying and action, they won a resounding victory: the district superintendent announced the dissolution of its police contract and the removal of SROs. 10 Phoenix followed a number of other cities-most prominently Minneapolis , where George Floyd was murdered, as well as Portland and Denver . For years, youth and community organizations across the country had raised the alarm on SROs. According to the Dignity in Schools Campaign , Black students are nearly three and a half times more likely to be taken into police custody than white students; Latinx students are one and a half times more likely. 11 Phoenix in particular has a long history of targeting and discriminating against students of color. In the early 1900s, African American students were segregated in a basement known as the \"Department for Colored Students,\" where all of their classes were held. In 1969, a group of students formed Chicanos Por La Causa in response to racial inequities. At first, they lobbied the district; after the district refused to listen, they organized a month of walkouts. 12 Puente's campaign launched in 2017.

The \"pause\" included disbanding the student advisory board, the police accountability board, and the school has stopped holding meetings with community members. 25 Then, despite the two-year pause, earlier this year Hopkins sent administrators to testify at the SB0276 bill hearings. They spoke against the bill, saying that a police force is necessary for the safety of Hopkins affiliates. Organizers here noted that this position flagrantly contradicted their previous claim that during the so-called pause, the university would \"reevaluate\" the role of policing. Every person who testified spoke about the police force as an entity that will absolutely exist after their \"pause.\" 26 While the university disbanded its advisory boards, we with the Coalition Against Policing by Hopkins-made up of student organizers and Baltimore community activists from over a dozen groups like the Baltimore Redevelopment Action Coalition for Empowerment, Greater Baltimore Democratic Socialists of America, Teachers and Researchers United, and the Hopkins graduate student union-escalated the opposition to the Hopkins private police force. 27 CAPH and concerned faculty circulated a petition calling for the full abandonment of the JHUPD that received over 6,000 individual signatures from Hopkins affiliates, alumni, and Baltimore community members, which we delivered to university president Ron Daniels's house at the end of a protest march across campus. 28 Though our pressure led to significant movement of this bill, it failed to pass committee. Now, CAPH is organizing communities to make clear its opposition both on the campus and among the surrounding residents who would be directly impacted by their neighborhoods being patrolled by Hopkins police officers. 29 Immediately after the failure of SB0276 to pass from committee, Hopkins announced that it is renewing the search for a vice president of security and public safety, thus solidifying plans to create JHPD. 30 This work is far from over. CAPH is ready to continue this fight as long as Hopkins plans to force police on Baltimore City. We've slowed them down by four years-and we're not going anywhere. 31 - A ndrew E neim , Johns Hopkins University 32 A mid a global pandemic and calls for defunding the police around the country, the University of California system maintained and even increased the UC Police Department (UCPD) budget. The UCLA police budget, for example, was projected to increase from $21,663,372 to $22,182,739 in the next year-a 2.4-percent increase. 33 This money goes toward initiatives like predictive policing technologies, surveillance softwares, and community policing partnerships. These harmful carceral alliances not only inflict violence; they also extract money from the students and communities without keeping them safe. 34 It is clear that the UC system has prioritized its allegiances to policing, upholding policing logics and colonial structures of violence. 35 The exorbitant amount of money spent at UCPD is only one example of the university's inability to prioritize community over state violence. This is coupled with several inevitably failed attempts to \"hold police accountable\" for instances of state violence, including the harm to student protesters. 36 Cops Off Campus is a coalition of graduate students, undergraduate students, faculty, staff, and community members who have come together to organize around the abolition of police at UCLA and beyond. 37 We are demanding the removal of the physical manifestations of the police, as well as a disbanding and refusal of all police partnerships and technologies within academic spaces and other university supported spaces. These spaces include student housing and community hospitals owned or managed by the university. 38 We acknowledge that UCLA, and academia more generally, is a space of complicity. Our school has been the site of extensive state violence and has created various forms of policing technologies, producing research that inflicts harm on campus and within communities. 39 We are not calling for attempts to reform the police or attempting to hold them accountable. 40 Over the last year we have organized protests, held reflection spaces, and launched a map of carceral violence on our campus . Throughout May, we are joining a national alliance of faculty, staff, and students to call for the complete removal of cops from all academic spaces and to educate and activate members to collectively imagine a community without police through the creation of spaces for protest, reflection, healing and mutual aid. But it's not just that. We are also demanding a cost-of-living adjustment for equitable pay for all workers at the university. We are demanding a reinvestment to community healing, mental health, and student support. We are demanding land back. We are demanding an end to all forms of policing violence and harm through the university and beyond. 41 - V ictoria C opeland and D ominique M ikell , University of California, Los Angeles Cops Off Campus 42\n\nThis story was produced for Student Nation, a section devoted to highlighting campus activism and student movements from students in their own words.

At the beginning of the summer, student organizers from a number of campus activist groups staged a sit-in at UCPD headquarters that included, at points, over 100 participants and lasted through the night. In September, the week before the start of the new school year, CNC staged a controversial, week-long occupation in front of Provost Ka Yee Lee's, calling for her to agree to a recorded public meeting and address their demands. This October, CNC collaborated with the youth activist group Good Kids Mad City to organize a Halloween-night demonstration advocating for the defunding of the UCPD and reduced Chicago Police Department (CPD) presence on the South Side. 5 Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" The FBI Arrests a Milwaukee Judge in \"a Whole New Descent Into Government Chaos\" John Nichols A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer In June of 2020, the Chicago Maroon published an editorial endorsing the organizing efforts of students and community members to disband and abolish the UCPD. Instead of an armed force, the Maroon advocated for an unarmed emergency response force trained in seeking to \"better trained and equipped to handle particular, commonly occurring University-related situations.\" In the editorial, we point particularly to not just the past horrifying actions of the UCPD, but how policing is not an adequate response for students going through a mental health crisis. Student organizing is crucial-the surrounding community can and will be safer without a private militarized force. 6 Current Issue View our current issue The editorial was published following the 19-hour occupation of UCPD headquarters, where student organizers demanded that the university hold a public town hall that fielded comments from students and community members. The university has refused to meet this demand, nor has it offered to consider the broader, abolitionist demands of student organizers. We wrote our editorial with the firm belief that, given the university's past actions and its claimed interests in serving both its students and the greater community needs, a Hyde Park free of the UCPD will help keep students and the community safer. The student organizing group UChicago United, which is affiliated with #CareNotCops, has been facilitating mutual aid in Hyde Park and now tables weekly by Jewel-Osco, a grocery store near campus. 7 Amid the gentrification taking place in Hyde Park, student organizing has helped increase students engagement with and support of mutual aid projects. Defunding UCPD as a step toward its abolition would be a direct means of putting resources into the hands of community members and directing funds toward those who need them the most. Abolition is not just a process about taking down systems that may be inequitable; abolition is about creating new possibilities and new ways of helping us all live more fulfilling lives. 8 - K ate M abus and N oah T esfaye , University of Chicago 9 I n the midst of last summer's nationwide uprising for Black lives, Phoenix students escalated their #CopsOuttaCampus protests, demanding the removal of School Resource Officers (SROs) from Phoenix schools. The students were from Puente , a human rights group organizing to improve the lives of Arizona's most marginalized communities. After three months of intensive lobbying and action, they won a resounding victory: the district superintendent announced the dissolution of its police contract and the removal of SROs. 10 Phoenix followed a number of other cities-most prominently Minneapolis , where George Floyd was murdered, as well as Portland and Denver . For years, youth and community organizations across the country had raised the alarm on SROs. According to the Dignity in Schools Campaign , Black students are nearly three and a half times more likely to be taken into police custody than white students; Latinx students are one and a half times more likely. 11 Phoenix in particular has a long history of targeting and discriminating against students of color. In the early 1900s, African American students were segregated in a basement known as the \"Department for Colored Students,\" where all of their classes were held. In 1969, a group of students formed Chicanos Por La Causa in response to racial inequities. At first, they lobbied the district; after the district refused to listen, they organized a month of walkouts. 12 Puente's campaign launched in 2017. Students had already been organizing in response to then-President Trump's new immigration policies as well as SB 1070 , Arizona's landmark \"show me your papers\" law. In 2019, an SRO pepper-sprayed a group of middle school students at Isaac School District, ramping up the urgency. Then, last summer, with growing school shootings and Black Lives Matter protests alike, the campaign took off. \"There were so many stories of undocumented people coming out,\" said Michelle Ruiz, a Puente youth organizer. \"Our community was already being targeted, and so we felt like our schools were going to be the next target.\" 13 From the start, the campaign employed a range of tactics-using social media to educate peers, attending board meetings, and holding protests outside district headquarters. In early 2018, following the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, students marched downtown demanding that SROs leave their campuses. \"We wanted to remove SROs from schools to make a point of safety and security,\" said Puente's development and financial director Isis Gil. \"But there's always an ask for other resources for our youth, such as more counselors, more nurses, and social services to improve their lives.\" 14 In June 2020, Abia Khan, a North High senior who was part of Puente Youth and is now a Harvard freshman, started a petition to reignite the call for SRO removal. Phoenix PD had become one of the deadliest police forces in America, and Khan felt that there was no reason for a force like that to be present on school campuses. The petition went on to amass 4,000 signatures, putting pressure on the district while helping to build Puente's base. 15 \"The Black Lives Matter protests were the first time I had heard the phrase, 'defund the police,'\" Khan said. \"If I'm being completely honest, it caught me a little off guard because I couldn't understand the demand. After doing more research, I realized the merits of the demand.\" 16 One of the board members, Stephanie Parra, felt the urgency. \"I appreciate when students use their voice,\" she said. \"What they did last summer wasn't just personal. They were demanding more from an institution that has a long history of oppression and racism.\" 17 The board's initial vote was split: three in support of termination, three against, and one abstention. Those who were against it had security concerns for the students. The final decision was announced on July 7, following internal dissension. 18 Now, students are working to hold PUHSD accountable for the $1.2 million that the district recouped from the terminated contract. In September, the district launched a participatory budgeting process, recruiting student, parent, and staff input. Puente Youth members are trying to figure out the best way to reinvest the funds. They're also expanding the campaign to other schools in Arizona, starting with Glendale and Mesa, where they plan to launch student programs, like in Phoenix, anchored by training on leadership and grassroots organizing. 19 \"I hope that other people that I know or people who see me on social media will see the work I am doing,\" Ruiz reflected. \"I hope they will want to go out there and do it themselves, so they are part of a huge community and a larger project.\" 20 - A nna D eogratias , Arizona State University class of 2020 21 I n the 2021 Maryland state legislative session, SB0276 was introduced to repeal the ability of Johns Hopkins University to form a private police force. After nearly four years of fighting, student organizers and community members in Baltimore had finally brought opposition to the private police to the state Senate floor. 22 Our organizing began in 2018, when the university wrote and lobbied for a bill that would authorize the creation of a private police force to patrol not just campus but the surrounding communities. The bill, called the \"Community Safety and Strengthening Act,\" was introduced to the Senate in 2019; the General Assembly passed the bill, despite significant opposition from Hopkins affiliates and community members who reside in the areas surrounding Hopkins campuses. 23 That April, student and community activists staged a 35-day sit-in at Garland Hall, the administrative building. At least seven protesters, both students and local residents, were dragged from the building and arrested. Rather than address the concerns being raised by these activists, university President Ron Daniels called the Baltimore Police Department. 24 The Coalition Against Policing by Hopkins formed during the 2020 nationwide protests.

In early 2018, following the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, students marched downtown demanding that SROs leave their campuses. \"We wanted to remove SROs from schools to make a point of safety and security,\" said Puente's development and financial director Isis Gil. \"But there's always an ask for other resources for our youth, such as more counselors, more nurses, and social services to improve their lives.\" 14 In June 2020, Abia Khan, a North High senior who was part of Puente Youth and is now a Harvard freshman, started a petition to reignite the call for SRO removal. Phoenix PD had become one of the deadliest police forces in America, and Khan felt that there was no reason for a force like that to be present on school campuses. The petition went on to amass 4,000 signatures, putting pressure on the district while helping to build Puente's base. 15 \"The Black Lives Matter protests were the first time I had heard the phrase, 'defund the police,'\" Khan said. \"If I'm being completely honest, it caught me a little off guard because I couldn't understand the demand. After doing more research, I realized the merits of the demand.\" 16 One of the board members, Stephanie Parra, felt the urgency. \"I appreciate when students use their voice,\" she said. \"What they did last summer wasn't just personal. They were demanding more from an institution that has a long history of oppression and racism.\" 17 The board's initial vote was split: three in support of termination, three against, and one abstention. Those who were against it had security concerns for the students. The final decision was announced on July 7, following internal dissension. 18 Now, students are working to hold PUHSD accountable for the $1.2 million that the district recouped from the terminated contract. In September, the district launched a participatory budgeting process, recruiting student, parent, and staff input. Puente Youth members are trying to figure out the best way to reinvest the funds. They're also expanding the campaign to other schools in Arizona, starting with Glendale and Mesa, where they plan to launch student programs, like in Phoenix, anchored by training on leadership and grassroots organizing. 19 \"I hope that other people that I know or people who see me on social media will see the work I am doing,\" Ruiz reflected. \"I hope they will want to go out there and do it themselves, so they are part of a huge community and a larger project.\" 20 - A nna D eogratias , Arizona State University class of 2020 21 I n the 2021 Maryland state legislative session, SB0276 was introduced to repeal the ability of Johns Hopkins University to form a private police force. After nearly four years of fighting, student organizers and community members in Baltimore had finally brought opposition to the private police to the state Senate floor. 22 Our organizing began in 2018, when the university wrote and lobbied for a bill that would authorize the creation of a private police force to patrol not just campus but the surrounding communities. The bill, called the \"Community Safety and Strengthening Act,\" was introduced to the Senate in 2019; the General Assembly passed the bill, despite significant opposition from Hopkins affiliates and community members who reside in the areas surrounding Hopkins campuses. 23 That April, student and community activists staged a 35-day sit-in at Garland Hall, the administrative building. At least seven protesters, both students and local residents, were dragged from the building and arrested. Rather than address the concerns being raised by these activists, university President Ron Daniels called the Baltimore Police Department. 24 The Coalition Against Policing by Hopkins formed during the 2020 nationwide protests. The university also acted in the wake of a global reckoning with police brutality: it announced a \"two-year pause\" on the creation of their police force to \"reevaluate\" the role of policing in public safety. The \"pause\" included disbanding the student advisory board, the police accountability board, and the school has stopped holding meetings with community members. 25 Then, despite the two-year pause, earlier this year Hopkins sent administrators to testify at the SB0276 bill hearings. They spoke against the bill, saying that a police force is necessary for the safety of Hopkins affiliates. Organizers here noted that this position flagrantly contradicted their previous claim that during the so-called pause, the university would \"reevaluate\" the role of policing. Every person who testified spoke about the police force as an entity that will absolutely exist after their \"pause.\" 26 While the university disbanded its advisory boards, we with the Coalition Against Policing by Hopkins-made up of student organizers and Baltimore community activists from over a dozen groups like the Baltimore Redevelopment Action Coalition for Empowerment, Greater Baltimore Democratic Socialists of America, Teachers and Researchers United, and the Hopkins graduate student union-escalated the opposition to the Hopkins private police force. 27 CAPH and concerned faculty circulated a petition calling for the full abandonment of the JHUPD that received over 6,000 individual signatures from Hopkins affiliates, alumni, and Baltimore community members, which we delivered to university president Ron Daniels's house at the end of a protest march across campus. 28 Though our pressure led to significant movement of this bill, it failed to pass committee. Now, CAPH is organizing communities to make clear its opposition both on the campus and among the surrounding residents who would be directly impacted by their neighborhoods being patrolled by Hopkins police officers. 29 Immediately after the failure of SB0276 to pass from committee, Hopkins announced that it is renewing the search for a vice president of security and public safety, thus solidifying plans to create JHPD. 30 This work is far from over. CAPH is ready to continue this fight as long as Hopkins plans to force police on Baltimore City. We've slowed them down by four years-and we're not going anywhere. 31 - A ndrew E neim , Johns Hopkins University 32 A mid a global pandemic and calls for defunding the police around the country, the University of California system maintained and even increased the UC Police Department (UCPD) budget. The UCLA police budget, for example, was projected to increase from $21,663,372 to $22,182,739 in the next year-a 2.4-percent increase. 33 This money goes toward initiatives like predictive policing technologies, surveillance softwares, and community policing partnerships. These harmful carceral alliances not only inflict violence; they also extract money from the students and communities without keeping them safe. 34 It is clear that the UC system has prioritized its allegiances to policing, upholding policing logics and colonial structures of violence. 35 The exorbitant amount of money spent at UCPD is only one example of the university's inability to prioritize community over state violence. This is coupled with several inevitably failed attempts to \"hold police accountable\" for instances of state violence, including the harm to student protesters. 36 Cops Off Campus is a coalition of graduate students, undergraduate students, faculty, staff, and community members who have come together to organize around the abolition of police at UCLA and beyond. 37 We are demanding the removal of the physical manifestations of the police, as well as a disbanding and refusal of all police partnerships and technologies within academic spaces and other university supported spaces. These spaces include student housing and community hospitals owned or managed by the university. 38 We acknowledge that UCLA, and academia more generally, is a space of complicity. Our school has been the site of extensive state violence and has created various forms of policing technologies, producing research that inflicts harm on campus and within communities. 39 We are not calling for attempts to reform the police or attempting to hold them accountable. 40 Over the last year we have organized protests, held reflection spaces, and launched a map of carceral violence on our campus . Throughout May, we are joining a national alliance of faculty, staff, and students to call for the complete removal of cops from all academic spaces and to educate and activate members to collectively imagine a community without police through the creation of spaces for protest, reflection, healing and mutual aid. But it's not just that. We are also demanding a cost-of-living adjustment for equitable pay for all workers at the university. We are demanding a reinvestment to community healing, mental health, and student support. We are demanding land back. We are demanding an end to all forms of policing violence and harm through the university and beyond. 41 - V ictoria C opeland and D ominique M ikell , University of California, Los Angeles Cops Off Campus 42\n\nAmid the gentrification taking place in Hyde Park, student organizing has helped increase students engagement with and support of mutual aid projects. Defunding UCPD as a step toward its abolition would be a direct means of putting resources into the hands of community members and directing funds toward those who need them the most. Abolition is not just a process about taking down systems that may be inequitable; abolition is about creating new possibilities and new ways of helping us all live more fulfilling lives. 8 - K ate M abus and N oah T esfaye , University of Chicago 9 I n the midst of last summer's nationwide uprising for Black lives, Phoenix students escalated their #CopsOuttaCampus protests, demanding the removal of School Resource Officers (SROs) from Phoenix schools. The students were from Puente , a human rights group organizing to improve the lives of Arizona's most marginalized communities. After three months of intensive lobbying and action, they won a resounding victory: the district superintendent announced the dissolution of its police contract and the removal of SROs. 10 Phoenix followed a number of other cities-most prominently Minneapolis , where George Floyd was murdered, as well as Portland and Denver . For years, youth and community organizations across the country had raised the alarm on SROs. According to the Dignity in Schools Campaign , Black students are nearly three and a half times more likely to be taken into police custody than white students; Latinx students are one and a half times more likely. 11 Phoenix in particular has a long history of targeting and discriminating against students of color. In the early 1900s, African American students were segregated in a basement known as the \"Department for Colored Students,\" where all of their classes were held. In 1969, a group of students formed Chicanos Por La Causa in response to racial inequities. At first, they lobbied the district; after the district refused to listen, they organized a month of walkouts. 12 Puente's campaign launched in 2017. Students had already been organizing in response to then-President Trump's new immigration policies as well as SB 1070 , Arizona's landmark \"show me your papers\" law.

After nearly four years of fighting, student organizers and community members in Baltimore had finally brought opposition to the private police to the state Senate floor. 22 Our organizing began in 2018, when the university wrote and lobbied for a bill that would authorize the creation of a private police force to patrol not just campus but the surrounding communities. The bill, called the \"Community Safety and Strengthening Act,\" was introduced to the Senate in 2019; the General Assembly passed the bill, despite significant opposition from Hopkins affiliates and community members who reside in the areas surrounding Hopkins campuses. 23 That April, student and community activists staged a 35-day sit-in at Garland Hall, the administrative building. At least seven protesters, both students and local residents, were dragged from the building and arrested. Rather than address the concerns being raised by these activists, university President Ron Daniels called the Baltimore Police Department. 24 The Coalition Against Policing by Hopkins formed during the 2020 nationwide protests. The university also acted in the wake of a global reckoning with police brutality: it announced a \"two-year pause\" on the creation of their police force to \"reevaluate\" the role of policing in public safety. The \"pause\" included disbanding the student advisory board, the police accountability board, and the school has stopped holding meetings with community members. 25 Then, despite the two-year pause, earlier this year Hopkins sent administrators to testify at the SB0276 bill hearings. They spoke against the bill, saying that a police force is necessary for the safety of Hopkins affiliates. Organizers here noted that this position flagrantly contradicted their previous claim that during the so-called pause, the university would \"reevaluate\" the role of policing. Every person who testified spoke about the police force as an entity that will absolutely exist after their \"pause.\" 26 While the university disbanded its advisory boards, we with the Coalition Against Policing by Hopkins-made up of student organizers and Baltimore community activists from over a dozen groups like the Baltimore Redevelopment Action Coalition for Empowerment, Greater Baltimore Democratic Socialists of America, Teachers and Researchers United, and the Hopkins graduate student union-escalated the opposition to the Hopkins private police force. 27 CAPH and concerned faculty circulated a petition calling for the full abandonment of the JHUPD that received over 6,000 individual signatures from Hopkins affiliates, alumni, and Baltimore community members, which we delivered to university president Ron Daniels's house at the end of a protest march across campus. 28 Though our pressure led to significant movement of this bill, it failed to pass committee. Now, CAPH is organizing communities to make clear its opposition both on the campus and among the surrounding residents who would be directly impacted by their neighborhoods being patrolled by Hopkins police officers. 29 Immediately after the failure of SB0276 to pass from committee, Hopkins announced that it is renewing the search for a vice president of security and public safety, thus solidifying plans to create JHPD. 30 This work is far from over. CAPH is ready to continue this fight as long as Hopkins plans to force police on Baltimore City. We've slowed them down by four years-and we're not going anywhere. 31 - A ndrew E neim , Johns Hopkins University 32 A mid a global pandemic and calls for defunding the police around the country, the University of California system maintained and even increased the UC Police Department (UCPD) budget. The UCLA police budget, for example, was projected to increase from $21,663,372 to $22,182,739 in the next year-a 2.4-percent increase. 33 This money goes toward initiatives like predictive policing technologies, surveillance softwares, and community policing partnerships. These harmful carceral alliances not only inflict violence; they also extract money from the students and communities without keeping them safe. 34 It is clear that the UC system has prioritized its allegiances to policing, upholding policing logics and colonial structures of violence. 35 The exorbitant amount of money spent at UCPD is only one example of the university's inability to prioritize community over state violence. This is coupled with several inevitably failed attempts to \"hold police accountable\" for instances of state violence, including the harm to student protesters. 36 Cops Off Campus is a coalition of graduate students, undergraduate students, faculty, staff, and community members who have come together to organize around the abolition of police at UCLA and beyond. 37 We are demanding the removal of the physical manifestations of the police, as well as a disbanding and refusal of all police partnerships and technologies within academic spaces and other university supported spaces. These spaces include student housing and community hospitals owned or managed by the university. 38 We acknowledge that UCLA, and academia more generally, is a space of complicity. Our school has been the site of extensive state violence and has created various forms of policing technologies, producing research that inflicts harm on campus and within communities. 39 We are not calling for attempts to reform the police or attempting to hold them accountable. 40 Over the last year we have organized protests, held reflection spaces, and launched a map of carceral violence on our campus . Throughout May, we are joining a national alliance of faculty, staff, and students to call for the complete removal of cops from all academic spaces and to educate and activate members to collectively imagine a community without police through the creation of spaces for protest, reflection, healing and mutual aid. But it's not just that. We are also demanding a cost-of-living adjustment for equitable pay for all workers at the university. We are demanding a reinvestment to community healing, mental health, and student support. We are demanding land back. We are demanding an end to all forms of policing violence and harm through the university and beyond. 41 - V ictoria C opeland and D ominique M ikell , University of California, Los Angeles Cops Off Campus 42\n\nPhoenix followed a number of other cities-most prominently Minneapolis , where George Floyd was murdered, as well as Portland and Denver . For years, youth and community organizations across the country had raised the alarm on SROs. According to the Dignity in Schools Campaign , Black students are nearly three and a half times more likely to be taken into police custody than white students; Latinx students are one and a half times more likely. 11 Phoenix in particular has a long history of targeting and discriminating against students of color. In the early 1900s, African American students were segregated in a basement known as the \"Department for Colored Students,\" where all of their classes were held. In 1969, a group of students formed Chicanos Por La Causa in response to racial inequities. At first, they lobbied the district; after the district refused to listen, they organized a month of walkouts. 12 Puente's campaign launched in 2017. Students had already been organizing in response to then-President Trump's new immigration policies as well as SB 1070 , Arizona's landmark \"show me your papers\" law. In 2019, an SRO pepper-sprayed a group of middle school students at Isaac School District, ramping up the urgency. Then, last summer, with growing school shootings and Black Lives Matter protests alike, the campaign took off. \"There were so many stories of undocumented people coming out,\" said Michelle Ruiz, a Puente youth organizer. \"Our community was already being targeted, and so we felt like our schools were going to be the next target.\" 13 From the start, the campaign employed a range of tactics-using social media to educate peers, attending board meetings, and holding protests outside district headquarters. In early 2018, following the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, students marched downtown demanding that SROs leave their campuses. \"We wanted to remove SROs from schools to make a point of safety and security,\" said Puente's development and financial director Isis Gil. \"But there's always an ask for other resources for our youth, such as more counselors, more nurses, and social services to improve their lives.\" 14 In June 2020, Abia Khan, a North High senior who was part of Puente Youth and is now a Harvard freshman, started a petition to reignite the call for SRO removal. Phoenix PD had become one of the deadliest police forces in America, and Khan felt that there was no reason for a force like that to be present on school campuses. The petition went on to amass 4,000 signatures, putting pressure on the district while helping to build Puente's base. 15 \"The Black Lives Matter protests were the first time I had heard the phrase, 'defund the police,'\" Khan said. \"If I'm being completely honest, it caught me a little off guard because I couldn't understand the demand. After doing more research, I realized the merits of the demand.\" 16 One of the board members, Stephanie Parra, felt the urgency. \"I appreciate when students use their voice,\" she said. \"What they did last summer wasn't just personal. They were demanding more from an institution that has a long history of oppression and racism.\" 17 The board's initial vote was split: three in support of termination, three against, and one abstention. Those who were against it had security concerns for the students. The final decision was announced on July 7, following internal dissension. 18 Now, students are working to hold PUHSD accountable for the $1.2 million that the district recouped from the terminated contract. In September, the district launched a participatory budgeting process, recruiting student, parent, and staff input. Puente Youth members are trying to figure out the best way to reinvest the funds.

In early 2018, following the Parkland, Fla., school shooting, students marched downtown demanding that SROs leave their campuses. \"We wanted to remove SROs from schools to make a point of safety and security,\" said Puente's development and financial director Isis Gil. \"But there's always an ask for other resources for our youth, such as more counselors, more nurses, and social services to improve their lives.\" 14 In June 2020, Abia Khan, a North High senior who was part of Puente Youth and is now a Harvard freshman, started a petition to reignite the call for SRO removal. Phoenix PD had become one of the deadliest police forces in America, and Khan felt that there was no reason for a force like that to be present on school campuses. The petition went on to amass 4,000 signatures, putting pressure on the district while helping to build Puente's base. 15 \"The Black Lives Matter protests were the first time I had heard the phrase, 'defund the police,'\" Khan said. \"If I'm being completely honest, it caught me a little off guard because I couldn't understand the demand. After doing more research, I realized the merits of the demand.\" 16 One of the board members, Stephanie Parra, felt the urgency. \"I appreciate when students use their voice,\" she said. \"What they did last summer wasn't just personal. They were demanding more from an institution that has a long history of oppression and racism.\" 17 The board's initial vote was split: three in support of termination, three against, and one abstention. Those who were against it had security concerns for the students. The final decision was announced on July 7, following internal dissension. 18 Now, students are working to hold PUHSD accountable for the $1.2 million that the district recouped from the terminated contract. In September, the district launched a participatory budgeting process, recruiting student, parent, and staff input. Puente Youth members are trying to figure out the best way to reinvest the funds. They're also expanding the campaign to other schools in Arizona, starting with Glendale and Mesa, where they plan to launch student programs, like in Phoenix, anchored by training on leadership and grassroots organizing. 19 \"I hope that other people that I know or people who see me on social media will see the work I am doing,\" Ruiz reflected. \"I hope they will want to go out there and do it themselves, so they are part of a huge community and a larger project.\" 20 - A nna D eogratias , Arizona State University class of 2020 21 I n the 2021 Maryland state legislative session, SB0276 was introduced to repeal the ability of Johns Hopkins University to form a private police force. After nearly four years of fighting, student organizers and community members in Baltimore had finally brought opposition to the private police to the state Senate floor. 22 Our organizing began in 2018, when the university wrote and lobbied for a bill that would authorize the creation of a private police force to patrol not just campus but the surrounding communities. The bill, called the \"Community Safety and Strengthening Act,\" was introduced to the Senate in 2019; the General Assembly passed the bill, despite significant opposition from Hopkins affiliates and community members who reside in the areas surrounding Hopkins campuses. 23 That April, student and community activists staged a 35-day sit-in at Garland Hall, the administrative building. At least seven protesters, both students and local residents, were dragged from the building and arrested. Rather than address the concerns being raised by these activists, university President Ron Daniels called the Baltimore Police Department. 24 The Coalition Against Policing by Hopkins formed during the 2020 nationwide protests. The university also acted in the wake of a global reckoning with police brutality: it announced a \"two-year pause\" on the creation of their police force to \"reevaluate\" the role of policing in public safety. The \"pause\" included disbanding the student advisory board, the police accountability board, and the school has stopped holding meetings with community members. 25 Then, despite the two-year pause, earlier this year Hopkins sent administrators to testify at the SB0276 bill hearings. They spoke against the bill, saying that a police force is necessary for the safety of Hopkins affiliates. Organizers here noted that this position flagrantly contradicted their previous claim that during the so-called pause, the university would \"reevaluate\" the role of policing. Every person who testified spoke about the police force as an entity that will absolutely exist after their \"pause.\" 26 While the university disbanded its advisory boards, we with the Coalition Against Policing by Hopkins-made up of student organizers and Baltimore community activists from over a dozen groups like the Baltimore Redevelopment Action Coalition for Empowerment, Greater Baltimore Democratic Socialists of America, Teachers and Researchers United, and the Hopkins graduate student union-escalated the opposition to the Hopkins private police force. 27 CAPH and concerned faculty circulated a petition calling for the full abandonment of the JHUPD that received over 6,000 individual signatures from Hopkins affiliates, alumni, and Baltimore community members, which we delivered to university president Ron Daniels's house at the end of a protest march across campus. 28 Though our pressure led to significant movement of this bill, it failed to pass committee. Now, CAPH is organizing communities to make clear its opposition both on the campus and among the surrounding residents who would be directly impacted by their neighborhoods being patrolled by Hopkins police officers. 29 Immediately after the failure of SB0276 to pass from committee, Hopkins announced that it is renewing the search for a vice president of security and public safety, thus solidifying plans to create JHPD. 30 This work is far from over. CAPH is ready to continue this fight as long as Hopkins plans to force police on Baltimore City. We've slowed them down by four years-and we're not going anywhere. 31 - A ndrew E neim , Johns Hopkins University 32 A mid a global pandemic and calls for defunding the police around the country, the University of California system maintained and even increased the UC Police Department (UCPD) budget. The UCLA police budget, for example, was projected to increase from $21,663,372 to $22,182,739 in the next year-a 2.4-percent increase. 33 This money goes toward initiatives like predictive policing technologies, surveillance softwares, and community policing partnerships. These harmful carceral alliances not only inflict violence; they also extract money from the students and communities without keeping them safe. 34 It is clear that the UC system has prioritized its allegiances to policing, upholding policing logics and colonial structures of violence. 35 The exorbitant amount of money spent at UCPD is only one example of the university's inability to prioritize community over state violence. This is coupled with several inevitably failed attempts to \"hold police accountable\" for instances of state violence, including the harm to student protesters. 36 Cops Off Campus is a coalition of graduate students, undergraduate students, faculty, staff, and community members who have come together to organize around the abolition of police at UCLA and beyond. 37 We are demanding the removal of the physical manifestations of the police, as well as a disbanding and refusal of all police partnerships and technologies within academic spaces and other university supported spaces. These spaces include student housing and community hospitals owned or managed by the university. 38 We acknowledge that UCLA, and academia more generally, is a space of complicity. Our school has been the site of extensive state violence and has created various forms of policing technologies, producing research that inflicts harm on campus and within communities. 39 We are not calling for attempts to reform the police or attempting to hold them accountable. 40 Over the last year we have organized protests, held reflection spaces, and launched a map of carceral violence on our campus . Throughout May, we are joining a national alliance of faculty, staff, and students to call for the complete removal of cops from all academic spaces and to educate and activate members to collectively imagine a community without police through the creation of spaces for protest, reflection, healing and mutual aid. But it's not just that. We are also demanding a cost-of-living adjustment for equitable pay for all workers at the university.

The UCLA police budget, for example, was projected to increase from $21,663,372 to $22,182,739 in the next year-a 2.4-percent increase. 33 This money goes toward initiatives like predictive policing technologies, surveillance softwares, and community policing partnerships. These harmful carceral alliances not only inflict violence; they also extract money from the students and communities without keeping them safe. 34 It is clear that the UC system has prioritized its allegiances to policing, upholding policing logics and colonial structures of violence. 35 The exorbitant amount of money spent at UCPD is only one example of the university's inability to prioritize community over state violence. This is coupled with several inevitably failed attempts to \"hold police accountable\" for instances of state violence, including the harm to student protesters. 36 Cops Off Campus is a coalition of graduate students, undergraduate students, faculty, staff, and community members who have come together to organize around the abolition of police at UCLA and beyond. 37 We are demanding the removal of the physical manifestations of the police, as well as a disbanding and refusal of all police partnerships and technologies within academic spaces and other university supported spaces. These spaces include student housing and community hospitals owned or managed by the university. 38 We acknowledge that UCLA, and academia more generally, is a space of complicity. Our school has been the site of extensive state violence and has created various forms of policing technologies, producing research that inflicts harm on campus and within communities. 39 We are not calling for attempts to reform the police or attempting to hold them accountable. 40 Over the last year we have organized protests, held reflection spaces, and launched a map of carceral violence on our campus . Throughout May, we are joining a national alliance of faculty, staff, and students to call for the complete removal of cops from all academic spaces and to educate and activate members to collectively imagine a community without police through the creation of spaces for protest, reflection, healing and mutual aid. But it's not just that. We are also demanding a cost-of-living adjustment for equitable pay for all workers at the university. We are demanding a reinvestment to community healing, mental health, and student support. We are demanding land back.

In September, the district launched a participatory budgeting process, recruiting student, parent, and staff input. Puente Youth members are trying to figure out the best way to reinvest the funds. They're also expanding the campaign to other schools in Arizona, starting with Glendale and Mesa, where they plan to launch student programs, like in Phoenix, anchored by training on leadership and grassroots organizing. 19 \"I hope that other people that I know or people who see me on social media will see the work I am doing,\" Ruiz reflected. \"I hope they will want to go out there and do it themselves, so they are part of a huge community and a larger project.\" 20 - A nna D eogratias , Arizona State University class of 2020 21 I n the 2021 Maryland state legislative session, SB0276 was introduced to repeal the ability of Johns Hopkins University to form a private police force. After nearly four years of fighting, student organizers and community members in Baltimore had finally brought opposition to the private police to the state Senate floor. 22 Our organizing began in 2018, when the university wrote and lobbied for a bill that would authorize the creation of a private police force to patrol not just campus but the surrounding communities. The bill, called the \"Community Safety and Strengthening Act,\" was introduced to the Senate in 2019; the General Assembly passed the bill, despite significant opposition from Hopkins affiliates and community members who reside in the areas surrounding Hopkins campuses. 23 That April, student and community activists staged a 35-day sit-in at Garland Hall, the administrative building. At least seven protesters, both students and local residents, were dragged from the building and arrested. Rather than address the concerns being raised by these activists, university President Ron Daniels called the Baltimore Police Department. 24 The Coalition Against Policing by Hopkins formed during the 2020 nationwide protests. The university also acted in the wake of a global reckoning with police brutality: it announced a \"two-year pause\" on the creation of their police force to \"reevaluate\" the role of policing in public safety. The \"pause\" included disbanding the student advisory board, the police accountability board, and the school has stopped holding meetings with community members. 25 Then, despite the two-year pause, earlier this year Hopkins sent administrators to testify at the SB0276 bill hearings. They spoke against the bill, saying that a police force is necessary for the safety of Hopkins affiliates. Organizers here noted that this position flagrantly contradicted their previous claim that during the so-called pause, the university would \"reevaluate\" the role of policing.

The university also acted in the wake of a global reckoning with police brutality: it announced a \"two-year pause\" on the creation of their police force to \"reevaluate\" the role of policing in public safety. The \"pause\" included disbanding the student advisory board, the police accountability board, and the school has stopped holding meetings with community members. 25 Then, despite the two-year pause, earlier this year Hopkins sent administrators to testify at the SB0276 bill hearings. They spoke against the bill, saying that a police force is necessary for the safety of Hopkins affiliates.

      "text": "How Violent Cops Stay in Law Enforcement\n\nIn September, 2009, a card dealer named Evie Oquendo arrived at her apartment, on the far east side of Las Vegas, with groceries for her fifteen-year-old son, Tanner Chamberlain. Tanner, who struggled with bipolar disorder, had stayed home from school that day, and Oquendo wanted to make beef stew, one of his favorite meals. But, before she could start cooking, Tanner became extremely agitated. Not long afterward, she discovered that he had swallowed a handful of her anti-anxiety pills. She wanted to take him to the hospital, but first she called her sister, a former New York City police officer. Her sister told her to call 911. \"I said, 'I'm not calling the police, because I'm afraid they're gonna shoot him,' \" Oquendo recalled. \"She told me, 'Evie, don't be ridiculous. They'll know how to handle it.' \"\n\nTanner calmed down enough to suggest going to a nearby 7-Eleven for an iced tea, and Oquendo decided against calling the police. But her sister had already asked a family friend in Nevada to call 911, and soon officers from the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department pulled up to Oquendo's apartment building, a stucco complex with a pool and a playground. Among the group was a twenty-eight-year-old officer named Derek Colling, who had been with the department for four years. When Colling and the others approached, Tanner stood behind Oquendo, grasping his mother and holding a folding knife in one hand. Officers instructed him to drop the knife and release his mother, but he did not comply. One of the officers on the scene, who was trained in de-escalating crisis situations involving people with mental illnesses, tried to speak to Tanner. Colling trained his gun on Tanner. \"Don't shoot him!\" Oquendo pleaded. Colling shot him in the head.\n\nThis was Colling's second fatal shooting in three years: in 2006, he had been one of five officers to shoot and kill a man who pulled a gun at a gas station. In both cases, a coroner's inquest declared the killings justified. \"I did what had to be done,\" Colling said, during the second inquiry. One of Colling's childhood friends, Jedadiah Schultz, recalled meeting up with Colling shortly after Tanner's death, at a baseball game, and asking him about the incident. \"The way in which he was telling the story was like his heroic journey,\" Schultz said. \"I was deeply unsettled.\" (Colling did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nIn 2011, after Colling beat a videographer who was filming police activity in a suburban neighborhood, the footage went viral, and the department launched an investigation. In December, just weeks after the Las Vegas Review-Journal began publishing a series of articles on the use of lethal force by police, Colling was fired for policy violations. The city's police department, which had a long-standing reputation as one of the most violent in the country, announced that it would be undertaking extensive reforms, in conjunction with the Department of Justice, to improve transparency and accountability.\n\nNo criminal charges were brought against Colling, and the internal investigation that led to the department's decision was not made public. Still, Oquendo felt some sense of vindication: Colling wasn't going to jail, but at least he'd lost his badge and his gun. She decided to pursue a civil case against Colling and the department, including a wrongful-death claim, and, in 2013, two years after she'd filed it, a federal district-court judge allowed the case to go forward.\n\nBut, in 2015, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals dismissed the suit, citing qualified immunity, a legal doctrine that protects law-enforcement officers from civil lawsuits. Shortly afterward, while Oquendo was searching for news stories about Colling on the Internet, she got a hit from a paper in Laramie, Wyoming. Colling hadn't left law enforcement-he'd just moved home. He was working as a patrol deputy for the Albany County sheriff's office, which covers a forty-three-hundred-square-mile region of southeastern Wyoming, including Laramie, Colling's home town. Oquendo was distraught. She started calling journalists and community leaders in Laramie. \"I didn't want him to kill again,\" she said.\n\nEventually, she reached Debra Hinkel. An athletic woman with white-blond hair and a direct manner, Hinkel had lived in Laramie most of her life. She ran a few businesses in town, including the Ranger, a motel, bar, and liquor store, which her parents had owned. She was well-connected, and she had contacts at all three of the law-enforcement agencies with jurisdiction in Laramie-the police department, the sheriff's office, and the University of Wyoming's police department. Her middle child, Robbie Ramirez, had been diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder in his early twenties, and, in the years since, Hinkel had come to dedicate much of her time to mental-health advocacy. Oquendo had found Hinkel's phone number through the Laramie chapter of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, where Hinkel served as president. After explaining her story, Oquendo urged Hinkel to use her standing in the community to agitate for Colling's dismissal. \"She was trying to get ahold of anybody she could,\" Hinkel said. \"She told me, 'The guy's dangerous.' \"\n\nHinkel knew Derek Colling. His father was a highway patrolman, and his mother worked at a local school. Laramie is a college town of about thirty thousand that feels smaller. As boys, Colling and Robbie had played on the same baseball team, the Vigilantes. They had attended high school together; as members of the school choir, they travelled to Carnegie Hall. After graduating, Colling attended college in South Dakota, then explored a career in law enforcement. He got the job in Las Vegas in 2005. Robbie, meanwhile, had never left Wyoming.\n\nHinkel and Robbie lived a few blocks apart-she in a ranch house, he in a log-walled apartment owned by two of Hinkel's brothers. They had a close-knit family, with relatives spread throughout the region. Robbie's siblings, Randy and Robyn, lived about an hour away; their father, Jimmy Ramirez, lived in a small town across the Snowy Range mountains. Some months, Hinkel saw Robbie regularly. When he felt good, he coached hockey, made ceramic art, and worked at the Ranger. At other times, when he was feeling anxious or depressed, he kept to himself. A fun-loving skater in his younger days, Robbie had become exceedingly careful over the years, and police especially concerned him. After his diagnosis, he had been arrested a few times, and he wanted to avoid any similar encounters. He kept a detailed budget, and family members remember him painstakingly tracking his medications and meal plan. He spent hours tinkering with his Ford Ranger, but he was a tentative driver who rarely left Laramie. He said he needed to stay near home, where he was safe.\n\nHinkel decided not to tell her son about Colling, but he found out anyway. Not long after Oquendo's call, Robbie walked into the Ranger and found his mother standing by the pool table. The Boomerang , Laramie's daily, had just published an article about Oquendo's civil case. Robbie sounded matter-of-fact, Hinkel recalled later, when he told her that he'd read about Colling. \"He'll probably shoot me someday,\" Robbie said.\n\nThe sheriff of Albany County, David O'Malley, hired Colling in 2012, ten months after he was fired from his job in Las Vegas. Colling had applied to work for the town's police department, too, but his history disqualified him. \"We didn't even finish his background,\" Dale Stalder, the chief of the Laramie Police Department, said. A Laramie law-enforcement veteran told me that, when he heard that Colling was working for O'Malley, he was unsurprised. \"The sheriff's office is kind of a second-chance oasis for cops,\" he said.\n\nO'Malley is widely known for his role investigating the murder of Matthew Shepard , a gay student at the University of Wyoming who was beaten and left to die on the outskirts of Laramie, in 1998. O'Malley, who was then the head of investigations at the Laramie Police Department, worked with a detective from the sheriff's department to build the case that convicted two men of Shepard's murder. The story garnered international attention, helped to catalyze a reckoning with anti-gay violence, and inspired a play, \"The Laramie Project,\" that was produced as a touring show. O'Malley became an outspoken public figure, advocating for national hate-crime legislation and speaking openly about his former anti-gay bigotry. He marched at Pride events, attended drag-queen bingo, and spoke out against a book that cast aspersions on Shepard. He left the police department in 2004 and, in 2010, ran for sheriff as a Democrat, winning by nearly twenty points.\n\nThe American sheriff-especially the Western sheriff-has always occupied a role that is both functional and performative, and O'Malley seemed intuitively aware of the outward-facing aspects of the job. He wore a bushy mustache and snap shirts, and he projected warmth, relying on folksy lingo. He was widely liked, and he easily won reëlection twice. But among law enforcement his department's reputation was mixed, marred by a handful of cases of alleged misconduct. Stalder, Laramie's police chief, told me that the expertise of sheriff's departments varies widely. \"There's a huge disparity,\" he said. \"Some are very professional. Some are much less professional.\" When I asked where O'Malley's department fit within that spectrum, he said, \"I think I'll leave that one alone.\"\n\nStill, O'Malley's popularity seemed undimmed, and he appeared confident deflecting scrutiny. A few years after Colling was hired, when local journalists found out about Colling's history in Las Vegas, O'Malley defended him staunchly. In an interview with a local radio station and news site, he said, \"The fact that he was terminated didn't give me any real pause, because they didn't move to decertify him as a law enforcement officer.\" He added, \"If you don't believe that a person has any business in law enforcement, then you move for decertification. If they had done that, I couldn't have considered Derek.\"\n\nLike the disbarring of an attorney, or the revocation of a doctor's license, the decertification of a law-enforcement officer, which is handled by individual states, is meant to prevent bad actors from returning to the profession. (Wyoming, along with a few other states, recognizes decertification elsewhere as immediately disqualifying.) But standards for decertification vary widely. In a handful of states, like California, there is no process at all for removing an officer's certification; in others, like Nevada, decertification is rare. Even though Colling had been fired following allegations of police brutality, his dismissal did not meet the state threshold for decertification. Kelly McMahill, a deputy chief at the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police, who oversaw the internal investigation that led to his firing, told me that, had the state initiated an inquiry, \"It wouldn't even have come close to pulling his certification.\"\n\nIn recent years, the very idea of problem officers has become a flashpoint in the public discourse on police violence: when politicians and police chiefs blame the failures of policing on a handful of officers, they seem to be ignoring the systemic issues that plague American law enforcement. But it is widely accepted in the field of decertification studies that a small number of officers account for a large number of civilian complaints; if implemented fairly and consistently, decertification can serve as a vital mechanism for removing the worst actors. \"Most professions have a way of getting rid of bad professionals,\" Roger Goldman, an emeritus professor at the Saint Louis University School of Law, who is an expert on decertification, told me. \"So why not police?\"\n\nIn 2014, after a Cleveland police officer named Timothy Loehmann shot and killed Tamir Rice , a twelve-year-old Black child who was holding a toy gun, an investigation revealed that Loehmann had previously been deemed unfit for duty at another Ohio police department. Ohio decertifies law-enforcement officers in the event of felony convictions, but a grand jury declined to indict Loehmann for Rice's killing. Although he was eventually fired from the Cleveland Police Department, on the grounds that he had falsified his employment history, he remained eligible to work in law enforcement.\n\nLast year, the legal scholars Ben Grunwald and John Rappaport published a report, \"The Wandering Officer,\" that provided the first wide-scale analysis of officers, like Loehmann and Colling, who have lost employment at one law-enforcement agency  and then found a new job at  another. Analyzing data from nearly five hundred Florida police agencies over a thirty-year period, they found that such officers were more likely than their peers \"to be fired from their next job or to receive a complaint for a 'moral character violation.' \"\n\nOfficers who have previously worked at large metropolitan agencies typically have extensive training, which can make them appealing as prospective hires for smaller departments with less funding, or rural departments with fewer applicants. When Colling attended Wyoming's law-enforcement academy for basic training-a requirement for most new detention officers-he graduated at the top of his class and was recognized for exemplary physical fitness and marksmanship. The Albany County Sheriff's Office is well funded-last year, it had $1.8 million in expenditures-but O'Malley said that he had struggled to recruit officers. \"In the seventies and early eighties, you had people knocking down the door,\" he told me. The last time he posted a job, he said, there were twenty applicants, but only eight showed up for the physical and psychological tests. Of those eight, he said, \"We had one that our panel said they would recommend to hire.\" Matthew Hickman, a professor of criminal justice at Seattle University, said, \"Police departments in rural jurisdictions are just desperate for officers. And that's where some of these guys end up.\"\n\nStill, O'Malley maintained that his agency had strict hiring procedures. He told me that Colling had been interviewed by a panel, which included representatives from the sheriff's office, the police department, and the University of Wyoming Police Department. (He declined to share the interviewers' names, citing the confidentiality of personnel records.) O'Malley also said that Colling had passed a background check: \"I had a list of probably sixty people that were supervisory and peers.\" He could not tell me exactly how many were interviewed, but he stood by comments he had made in the Boomerang , in 2014, in which he called Colling \"the best man for the job.\"\n\nMcMahill, a deputy chief in Las Vegas, was alarmed by the circumstances of Colling's hiring in Wyoming. \"I am shocked he got a job with another police agency,\" she said. She said that the details from the investigation into Colling that she led, in 2011, were confidential. But she did tell me that Colling was one of a handful of officers who were involved in incidents that prompted the agency to change the way it monitored and supported personnel following use-of-force incidents. \"What we realized is that so many of these officers, they're going to relive their officer-involved shootings time and time and time again,\" she told me. McMahill now sits on Nevada's Peace Officers Standards and Training ( POST ) commission, which certifies and decertifies officers. She told me that she hoped for reforms to the state's decertification statute, and for more consistency across the country. \"I think the answer to that is really, every state-state to state-is going to have to be much more lenient on what it takes to decertify someone.\" She added, \"We don't want people like Derek Colling to remain with his POST certificate.\"\n\nDebra Hinkel, like many Laramie residents, was unaware of Colling's presence on the force until well after he had been hired, when the press got the story and Oquendo made calls around town. But she was inclined to trust O'Malley. Her kids had gone to school with his kids. She had once switched parties to vote for him, and they sat together on a mental-health board. She had also seen Robbie's relationship with local law enforcement improve since he was first diagnosed. In the early years, Robbie and the rest of the family struggled to manage his condition. In 2004, Robbie punched an uncle at a family cabin, and was escorted to the hospital by sheriff's deputies, who later tackled him to the ground so that a nurse could inject him with an antipsychotic. Robbie resisted, injuring two officers. After the incident, Hinkel became interested in crisis-intervention-team (C.I.T.) programs, which encourage the development of mental-health infrastructure and teach de-escalation techniques to law-enforcement officers. After attending a C.I.T. panel in San Diego, she met with a commander at the Laramie Police Department and representatives from the local hospital. Laramie's C.I.T. program became among the first in the state.\n\nRobbie's final arrest for violent behavior was in 2010, when he punched a man outside of the Ranger. After that, he abided strictly by his court-ordered probation. He picked up skateboarding again, and, after buying a classical guitar while on vacation with his father, in Mazatlán, he started playing music with a local group. In 2016, the Wyoming legislature slashed funding for Medicaid, and Robbie became convinced that he needed to keep his income as low as possible in order to prevent his benefits from changing. He eventually stopped working, and his mental health declined. When Hinkel sold the Ranger, in 2018, he lost another anchor. But he tried to stay active, regularly visiting the Laramie skate park.\n\nAt this point, local law enforcement knew how to handle Robbie when he was in an anxious spell. Stalder, the police chief, told me that, during calls to Robbie's apartment, officers stood outside the door and talked in a gentle voice until he calmed down. The department had a be-on-the-lookout alert set up for Robbie's vehicles, so officers would know to respond with calm in the event of a traffic stop. \"Because of the officers' abilities to create that space and that time, things worked out,\" Stalder said.\n\nIn November, 2018, Robbie drove his Ranger west on Grand Avenue, a commercial area near the university. He was travelling significantly under the speed limit, and soon a patrol vehicle from the sheriff's office pulled in behind him. Robbie moved into the left lane, then turned across traffic, flipping on his signal a few seconds late. The patrol car followed. Robbie turned again, this time without a signal. The patrol car flashed its lights, and they both pulled over. Robbie was about a hundred yards from home.\n\nDerek Colling is trim and muscular, with a blond crew cut that was, that day, covered by a dark beanie. He strode toward Robbie's car. In college, Colling had been a two-hundred-and-fifteen-pound football player, and he still maintained an athletic build, training regularly in a form of martial arts called Krav Maga, developed for the Israeli military. When he reached the passenger's side of the car, he told Robbie to roll down the window. Robbie refused, and pointed to his apartment building, which was visible across the street. Colling demanded again, and Robbie's responses turned agitated. Then he started the car, and pulled away. (For someone fleeing the police, he drove slowly; before turning into his apartment's parking lot, he used his turn signal.) Colling ran to his cruiser and followed in pursuit, calling for backup. Robbie parked next to his apartment, at the end of the parking lot, and got out. Officers trained in responding to calls involving people experiencing mental-health crises are taught how to speak in a calm voice and maintain distance. Colling pulled up quickly, pinning in Robbie's truck and leaving him effectively cornered.\n\nColling pulled out his Taser and pistol and yelled, \"Get your hands up now!\" He approached, weapons drawn, closing the space between them. \"Get your hands up now,\" he repeated. He then deployed the Taser: its barbs stuck in Robbie's shirt but didn't appear to take effect. \"Don't shoot at me,\" Robbie said. Colling tried again. Robbie covered his head, cursed, and charged. As the men grappled, Colling fired his pistol, and Robbie fell. Colling called for medical assistance, and held Robbie's body to the ground. (He would later say that he still considered Robbie a potential threat.) With the assistance of a responding officer, he handcuffed Robbie, who lay bleeding. Another officer arrived and administered CPR. Colling had shot Robbie three times, including in the back. An ambulance transported him to a hospital. Hinkel arrived shortly afterward. In the lobby, she was informed that her son was dead.\n\nSix days later, a vigil for Robbie was held at the Laramie skate park. More than a hundred people came to light candles. Later, at the memorial service, a friend of Robbie's from the skate park delivered a eulogy, and Hinkel gave a short speech. She thought that more of Robbie's friends might speak. But, she said, \"They just couldn't. They were just so angry.\"\n\nHinkel walks quickly, and often wears a grin that conveys preparedness rather than joy. Following Robbie's death, his older brother, Randy, tried to avoid returning to Laramie. Hinkel left frequently, to escape, but always returned home. \"I don't know how my mom does it,\" Randy said. \"She can't go to the grocery store without someone wanting to talk about it.\"\n\nA deeply spiritual person, Hinkel felt that her son's death had happened for a reason, and that some change should come of it. But she also tended to be trusting of local authorities. In the press, she praised O'Malley and Peggy Trent, the county attorney, with whom she was friendly. She told the Boomerang that her son's death was the fault of \"one police officer and not the whole force.\" When the state announced that its Department of Criminal Investigations (D.C.I.) would conduct an inquiry into the shooting,  she trusted that the system would deliver justice.\n\nBut others had started to organize around the shooting. After hearing about Robbie's death, a graduate student named Karlee Provenza decided to start an advocacy group, which came to be called Albany County for Proper Policing ( ACoPP ). Twenty-four people showed up to the first meeting, which Provenza held at her house, a one-story home on Laramie's west side, with a porch decorated by deer skulls. She served deer chili. One of Robbie's uncles attended; Hinkel did not.\n\nThe week after Robbie's vigil, Trent arranged a private viewing of Colling's dash-camera and body-camera footage for Robbie's family, including Hinkel, Ramirez, and their children Randy and Robyn. O'Malley was there, too. He cried as the tape rolled. \"I felt bad for the family,\" he told me later. Robyn hugged him and told him that she did not blame him for Robbie's death. Randy felt different. \"You did this,\" he said to O'Malley. Hinkel left the room.\n\nTrent eventually decided to gather a grand jury to determine whether Colling should be charged with a felony. Grand juries almost always convene in the absence of a judge or defense counsel, giving the prosecutor great influence. According to Kate Levine, a law professor at the Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law, prosecutors often present exculpatory information during cases involving law-enforcement officers. \"This is part of that careful, balanced presentation that is absolutely just never done for anyone but police officers,\" Levine told me. Prosecutors have an incentive to maintain a good relationship with the police department, since they depend on the coöperation of law enforcement to build other cases, and jurors tend to trust and sympathize with law enforcement. Courts grant officers significant leeway in use-of-force cases: if officers who claim self-defense can demonstrate that they feared for their life or someone else's, they can almost always avoid conviction. Rachel Harmon, a law professor at the University of Virginia, said that the legal standards \"are mostly vague. And so they give a lot of room for officers who perceive a threat to use force.\"\n\nShortly before the grand jury convened, Hinkel attended a community forum, where she finally met Provenza. They discussed the upcoming grand jury, which would convene under seal, concealing the proceedings from public scrutiny. Provenza was concerned that, if the grand jury declined to indict, it might create the impression that Robbie's killing had been justified. \"Debbie kind of brushed it aside,\" Provenza told me. \"Then, I think, she watched it happen.\"\n\nThe grand jury, which met in January, 2019, was tasked with determining whether to indict Colling on a charge of involuntary manslaughter. Trent presented jurors with evidence that had been gathered by the D.C.I. Prepared by multiple investigators, including Tina Trimble, who was also the president of the Wyoming Fraternal Order of Police, the D.C.I. report provided a menacing portrayal of Robbie, noting that his apartment was extremely dirty and suggesting that he had not been taking his medication. (The report wasn't released publicly until months later, under pressure from news outlets including the Boomerang and WyoFile, a nonprofit that has covered Robbie's case extensively. Through a supervisor, Trimble declined an interview request.) The report briefly covered Colling's two previous shootings, but it failed to mention his firing from the Las Vegas police department.\n\nIn an interview with Colling, which investigators waited to conduct until four days after the shooting, he claimed that he had not recognized Robbie during the encounter. But he also suggested that he had heard enough stories about Robbie's past to consider him dangerous, providing secondhand accounts of encounters between Robbie and law enforcement that took place years before he joined the sheriff's office. Only after Colling viewed body-camera footage did he come to the conclusion that Robbie might have been holding a key during their scuffle. \"Colling remarked that he never saw the keys,\" Trimble wrote, \"but that he felt like it was an 'edged weapon' after viewing the video.\"\n\nThe jurors listened to Colling's interview, and to testimony from Trimble and from a use-of-force expert who has defended police officers in misconduct cases. One of the members of the grand jury told me that the group was instructed not to consider Colling's history. (Later, in a press conference, Trent said that presenting the facts of Colling's prior shootings would have taken away \"the relevancy of the facts of the case.\") Much of the testimony, the juror said, \"was framed in a way to say that law-enforcement officers had this different standard applied to them because of the parameters of their occupation.\" The juror added that, for a charge to stick, \"I feel like they have to scream out, 'I'm going to kill you on purpose and I don't care.' And it has to be on camera.\" (Trent said that she could not discuss the details of the grand jury, beyond her public comments.)\n\nAfter three days of proceedings, the grand jury declined to indict Colling. O'Malley later moved Colling to an investigative role. Hinkel felt betrayed. \"The whole good-ol'-boy aspect of protecting somebody who's done something like that is totally confusing to me,\" she said.  She reconnected with Provenza, who was trying to get the county commissioners to establish a community oversight board for the sheriff's office. Hinkel was impressed by Provenza's persistence in a state where aggressive reform efforts are not the political norm. (In February, a former Albany County attorney wrote to Provenza, in an e-mail, \"You should exercise caution in your efforts. The people you are challenging have the power of the entire state government to bring against you.\") Hinkel and Provenza discussed policing issues and decided to start working together on advocacy. In May, Hinkel wrote an op-ed that criticized O'Malley and the law-enforcement system: \"Perhaps we need to look at de-certification of these officers so they do not continue to have opportunities to injure or kill citizens.\" Provenza soon started gathering signatures on a petition that called for Colling's decertification.\n\nIn Wyoming, as in many other states, decertification decisions are handled by the state's POST commission. (Most POST agencies were established following the civil unrest of the nineteen-sixties, when authorities in cities across the U.S. responded to civil-rights protesters with military tactics.) In January, 2020, Hinkel and Provenza drove seventy-five icy miles north to a diner in Wheatland, where they met Chris Walsh, the director of the state's POST commission. Provenza presented Walsh with a petition for Colling's decertification, which had nearly thirteen hundred signatures.\n\nTypically, decertification cases are brought by police chiefs or sheriffs themselves. \"The very people deciding whether to hire wandering officers are the people who need to decide whether to discipline them,\" Ben Grunwald, the legal scholar, told me. But in Wyoming, citizens can file a grievance directly to the POST commission. At the end of the meeting with Walsh, Hinkel filed a written complaint. Walsh began an investigation.\n\nIn April, Provenza announced that she was running as a Democrat for a seat in the legislature. Hinkel helped with the campaign, writing postcards to voters. A few weeks later, George Floyd was killed by Derek Chauvin, a white officer with eighteen prior complaints on his record. Protests erupted across the country, including in Laramie, where they attracted a diverse and durable crowd. Provenza attended, collecting more signatures for the decertification petition. Hinkel struggled to watch the video of Floyd's death, and the similarity of the officers' names-Derek Colling, Derek Chauvin-disturbed her. \"Too many synchronicities,\" she told me.\n\nShe left town to go rafting in Oregon. When she arrived home, in June, hundreds of people were marching in the streets, many of them chanting her son's name. The marches continued daily. (Laramie police officers later arrested protesters for disorderly conduct and, in one case, \"amplified noise,\" even as counter-protesters in trucks with modified exhaust systems blasted them with diesel smoke.)\n\nOne law-enforcement veteran in Laramie told me that the events of the summer had shaken his foundational beliefs about his profession. He had started to reëxamine the assumptions that he had been trained to believe. When he had first seen the footage of Robbie's death, he had thought Colling acted properly. \"Now, looking at it through the way society is changing,\" he told me, \"it makes me question if it was a valid shoot.\" For a long time, he had thought that the criminal-justice system was flawed but generally fair. \"Having to now look at everything,\" he said, \"I'm starting to realize that-no, it is not fair. It is very skewed.\" Another Laramie law-enforcement officer told me that Robbie's death had deeply saddened and demoralized many of his colleagues. \"With Robbie, it's deeply personal,\" he said. \"Because Robbie was us.\" He thought about Colling, and said, \"Why was he hired?\"\n\nWalsh declined to comment on the specifics of the case, but he outlined a scenario that could hypothetically support decertification: \"If a person were hired illegally, against Wyoming state statute, because, let's say, information from another state is pertinent to their employment here, and through an investigation I found out that something had been overlooked\"-that, he said, would be relevant. His investigation is ongoing. A hearing for Colling has not yet been scheduled.\n\nIn August, I met Sheriff O'Malley at the Albany County Courthouse, an impressive stone building on Grand Avenue. Inside, the receptionist greeted me from behind a gleaming one-way mirror. O'Malley came out and offered me a friendly handshake. He walked with his back slightly stooped. As he turned into his office, I could see Colling in a room across the way. O'Malley closed the door.\n\nHinkel had recently filed a twenty-million-dollar lawsuit on charges of wrongful death, listing the county, Colling, and O'Malley as defendants. O'Malley declined to discuss Hinkel's suit directly, but his comments suggested that the public had developed an unfair impression of his office. He offered a quotation from Mark Twain (apocryphal, as it turns out): \"No amount of evidence will ever convince an idiot.\" He was concerned that the protests in Laramie and around the country were damaging the reputation of law enforcement. \"The career, the profession, being associated with racism and excessive force and everything, that's just-it's not the case,\" he said. \"That happens, and there's people in this profession that need to be out of it.\" But Colling, he said, was not one of them. He stood by his decision to hire him. He said he planned to retire soon and move to Florida. \"I can fish twelve months a year without cutting a hole in the ice,\" he said, chuckling. He added, \"I don't know that I'll ever come back.\" He announced his resignation later that month.\n\nO'Malley's successor, Aaron Appelhans, was the first Black sheriff in Wyoming's history. Appelhans said that he was focussed on improving services for the mentally ill and recruiting from underserved communities. \"I'm not really sure law enforcement has put in enough work to really see the change,\" he told me. Colling was reassigned to a job at the county detention center. O'Malley moved away; Trent took a job in Kansas. In November, on the anniversary of Robbie's death, Karlee Provenza won her election by a hundred and sixty votes. Hinkel cried when she heard the news. \"It's not all about justice,\" she said. \"It's about a need for a change.\"\n\nStill, Hinkel found herself spending more and more time away from home. She went to Colorado, Santa Fe, Elko. \"There's a heaviness in my heart every time I drive into Laramie,\" she said. \"I still have to leave periodically to just regroup.\" One of her trips took her to Las Vegas, where she looked up Evie Oquendo. When they met, at a restaurant in a video poker lounge, they laughed at their similar statures-both women stand about five feet tall. Since losing the appeal for her case, Oquendo had been unable to work. At her apartment, she kept Tanner's room as it had been, with his clothes still in the closet. She struggled to sleep, and her dreams were bad. Still, she said, she saw in Hinkel's lawsuit a glimmer of hope. Maybe, she thought, it would yield a different result from her own.\n\nOquendo rarely left Las Vegas, and she was impressed by Hinkel's adventurous nature. They talked about taking a trip one day. \"Kind of a heck of a way to become kindred spirits,\" Hinkel said. They finished lunch, and Hinkel started the long drive through Utah and Colorado  and into the vast plains of Wyoming. After she arrived, her phone rang. It was Oquendo, calling to make sure she had got home safely.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Colin Barrett on Cops as Outsiders\n\nThis week's story, \" A Shooting in Rathreedane ,\" is about a firearm incident in rural Ireland and the officer in Ireland's police force, the Garda, who responds to the call. Was Sergeant Noonan part of the story from the outset?\n\nThe story always started with the character of Noonan, a provincial police officer sitting at her desk absorbed in her paperwork. She was an atypical character for me to write. A middle-aged, mid-career professional, pragmatic and essentially content in her job and her life. Which all gets blown up a little over the course of the story.\n\nI did like that she was a cop. As literary devices, cops are fairly useful. Their profession gives them inherent agency. Something bad happens and they go toward it, no further reason necessary other than that they are cops. Another thing that makes them literarily useful is that, like a criminal, a cop is at heart an outsider. No matter how embedded they are within a community, no matter how acutely they understand the customs and mores and psychological temperament of that community, indeed, even if they originally come from that community, as Noonan does, their cophood renders them ultimately apart. Suspect, even. They are like criminals in that regard. And it cuts both ways, I think. People can't completely trust cops, and cops can't completely trust people. So I wanted to try and catch something of that dynamic, that irrevocable third-rail animosity at the heart of the relationship between even the most ostensibly conscientious cop and the community she is deputed to manage.\n\nDo you think of this as a police procedural at all? Did you have to do much research into the Garda-or the guards, as they're commonly known-to write the story?\n\nI was on a weekend stag-a multiday bachelor party-several years ago, and one of the people there was a guard, a little bit notorious in his family for, allegedly, summarily euthanizing a sick family pet without the parents' say-so, though they'd all forgiven him by this stage. A few pints in, he got to talking a bit about the job. Like everything else at that time in the country, even the cops were being subjected to austerity logic. There were regular shutdowns of rural stations and cutbacks in resources, ostensibly in the name of institutional efficiency. And what really vexed the lad was how increasingly large a rural area he and his colleagues were now left to cover. Fewer personnel responsible for more square mileage of territory, which meant it could take them forever to get to certain locations, bad news if people needed help quickly. Something of that notion stuck with me-of how staggered and eerily piecemeal an emergency might play out in the remoteness of the countryside, as opposed to a large city.\n\nAnyway, that chat on the stag with the lad who allegedly shot the family dog was the extent of my research into what the police do, I'm afraid.\n\nThe Garda is a largely unarmed force. Noonan could call in a Special Response Unit, but she thinks she can handle this. Would this have been a different story if you'd decided to send the armed unit in first?\n\nI was interested in exploring the aftermath of the violence, not in its protraction. And I thought it said something about Noonan, her confidence in herself and in how well she thinks she knows her world, that she could make that call. Though she doesn't know the perpetrator of the shooting, Bertie Creedon, she wagers she knows his type-and can handle him.\n\nThe shooting victim is a young man Noonan recognizes, Dylan Judge, who's been in trouble before. She does her best to keep him conscious and talking, but his chances of survival are slim. He's not a talented criminal-as seen in his attempt to siphon gas out of an almost empty tank. Is this comic or tragic?\n\nI suppose I wanted the tones the story goes through, whatever the reader may judge those tones to be, to follow the trajectory of emotions that the unfolding fate of Judge elicits, almost moment by moment, in Noonan.\n\nSo far as Noonan is concerned, Judge is a small-time criminal and basically a waster, and so there's no getting around that she sees his potential fate as a self-inflicted joke, at least at the outset. Out of what she's willing to write off, almost metaphysically, as the lad's purblind criminality, he's made himself his own punch line. Which doesn't mean his fate won't, eventually, get to her.\n\nThe story closes with Noonan starting to write her report. Is this an act of storytelling, in effect? Does she have to assess who she thinks is telling the truth, or take down what happened and leave that judgment to someone else? Why did you want to finish on those abbreviated notes that she scribbled down in the first phone call?\n\nAn early reader of the story mentioned that they were a little wrong-footed by the way I ended up depicting the scene toward the end of the story where Noonan and Swift go to meet Judge's girlfriend, Mullally, to tell her what has happened. That reader had anticipated a more dramatic, climactic scene than the brief, somewhat flat, impersonally voiced summary you get instead.\n\nAgain, I suppose all I was trying to capture in these final phases of the story was where Noonan is by this stage of the day-drained, tired, a little traumatized, ready to lash out at anyone who looks at her sideways, as the random teen-age kid who crosses the road in front of her car does. There's been, by the standards of the community, a rare and uncharacteristically violent near-tragedy, one bound to become at least temporarily notorious, but she still has the paperwork to do.\n\n\"A Shooting in Rathreedane\" will appear in your second collection of stories, \" Homesickness ,\" which comes out next year. Many of the stories in your first collection, \" Young Skins ,\" and in \"Homesickness\" are, like \"A Shooting,\" set in County Mayo. You've spent the past few years in Toronto. Do you see Mayo in the same way from the other side of the Atlantic? Has Toronto challenged it as a setting?\n\nI think I was always going to be writing about Mayo, regardless. Though I will say that my relatively recent move to Toronto has its own weird valence in that I happened to be born in Canada, though out in Alberta, and then we spent a few years living in Toronto before we moved back to Ireland. So a great many of my very earliest childhood memories are of Toronto, mixed in with all the Mayo memories. The high-rise we rented an apartment in over here, it's not so far from where I live now. I can get to it on the subway, though I still haven't gone back to see the area. But one of these days.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "When Cops Choose Empathy\n\nAbout four years ago, in a city park in western Washington State, Joe Winters encountered a woman in the throes of a psychotic episode. As he sat down next to her, she told him that she had purchased the bench that they now shared and that it was her home. \"I didn't buy the hallucinations, but I tried to validate the feelings underneath them,\" Winters told me. His strategy resembled Rogerian psychotherapy-unconditionally accepting a patient's experience, even when it is untethered from reality. But Winters is not a roving psychologist; he is a deputy in the King County Sheriff's Office. He had been called to the scene in response to the woman's behavior, which nearby residents deemed disruptive. After talking with Winters for several minutes, the woman left of her own volition, without Winters having to arrest her or resort to physical force.\n\nPolicing can seem like barren ground for empathy, the experience of understanding, sharing in, and caring about another's emotions. According to the Web site Fatal Encounters , cops were involved in the deaths of twelve hundred and sixty-one people in the United States last year, an average of about three and a half each day. A recent string of brutal arrests by officers in Missouri, New York, Texas, South Carolina, Ohio, and elsewhere has helped to drive the public's faith in law enforcement to a twenty-two-year low . National confidence in police officers' racial impartiality has also fallen. But, for communities of color, incidents like these are nothing new; they often confirm a longstanding perception of police as antagonists.\n\nMany theories, both old and new, hold that empathy is inevitable and automatic. When you witness someone suffer a severe bone fracture, it doesn't take mental gymnastics to figure out how you feel; a wave of discomfort might wash over you, the emotional equivalent of a knee-jerk reflex. In fact, though, empathy is a fragile reaction, one that often fails when it is most needed. Conflicts between groups (racial, social, or competitive) can reduce its potency. So can stress, which limits the psychological space that people have for others, and power, which can numb those who possess it to the plight of those who don't.\n\nEach of these factors is common in policing. From their earliest days of training, many recruits are steeped in a so-called warrior mentality , in which routine patrols resemble combat and citizens pose a potentially mortal threat. Last year, the Santa Fe New Mexican obtained a draft of instructional materials from the state law-enforcement academy that offer a striking example of this philosophy. According to the proposed curriculum, cadets would be taught that, during traffic stops, they should \"assume that ... all the occupants in the vehicle are armed.\" Expectations like these encourage a volatile mindset, and they play directly into the tendency to see weapons where there are none , especially in the hands of black men. The warrior mentality also instills chronic anxiety. Seth Stoughton, an assistant professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law and a former police officer, told me that such fear colors the way that cops treat civilians. \"If I'm worried about never making it home again, I don't really give a damn if I offend someone,\" he said. \"Whatever emotional toll my actions take on them, it will feel less important than my survival.\"\n\nIf you wanted to decrease recruits' empathy, you could scarcely do better than to enshrine a warrior mentality. Recently, however, recruits in several cities-among them Cincinnati, Las Vegas, and Memphis-have begun to learn a different approach: command less, listen more. A strong example of such a program comes from Sue Rahr, the executive director of the Washington State Criminal Justice Training Commission. Rahr's curriculum, which has produced about seven hundred and fifty graduates in the past two years, is designed to do away with the warrior mentality and encourage recruits to view themselves not as combatants within a community but as guardians of it. (President Obama's Task Force on Twenty-First-Century Policing, whose final report Rahr helped shape, aims to do the same.)\n\nOne strategy that flows from Rahr's philosophy is known as LEED , \"listening and explaining with equity and dignity.\" LEED teaches officers to insure that citizens feel heard and that they understand the reasons behind police behavior. This approach draws heavily from the psychology of procedural justice, which views fairness of treatment as being equally important as fairness of outcome; Rahr calls it \"a Happy Meal version of a research smorgasbord.\" It also looks a lot like the method that Joe Winters, one of Rahr's trainers, used in his park-bench encounter. Rahr sees empathy as more than window dressing. \"It's a safety strategy that gives officers a tactical advantage,\" she told me. \"When you know why someone is acting a certain way, you also know how to best react.\"\n\nRahr's program supplements coursework with exercises that test recruits' ability to communicate effectively. In one exercise, trainees arrive at a mock crime scene in which two men have assaulted a third. The victim asks for his hat, which is out of reach to him. Only if the recruit honors this request does the victim reveal that the assault is part of a gang initiation. In another exercise, recruits encounter a knife-wielding actor. If they flood the room and fixate on the weapon, the scenario escalates. If they focus on building rapport, it falls under control. The lesson: good policing requires slowing things down, listening, and meeting people where they are.\n\nBecause Rahr's program is relatively new, its over-all effect on policing culture isn't yet clear. She harbors no illusions, and emphasizes that she and her colleagues don't expect to undo \"two hundred years of history\" overnight. Even if the program does change recruits' hearts and minds, the changes might not last. As Rahr told me, some recruits leave the program, move to their new departments, and meet field-training officers who offer to help them \"get past that touchy-feely bullshit and do real policing.\"\n\nThen there's the scale of the problem. In Rahr's ideal world, she said, \"everyone who sees a police officer would have the initial reaction that 'I'm safer.' \" That world feels very distant from our own. Police violence does not reflect the failure of empathy alone, and empathy cannot overwrite racial bias and structural inequality. (The woman whom Joe Winters encountered in the park was white; if she had been black and another officer had taken the call, how might the interaction have gone?) In some cases, empathy may even make things worse. According to Steve Silverman, the founder of Flex Your Rights , an organization that helps people assert themselves during police encounters, \"Officer Friendly tactics are good at getting citizens to voluntarily waive their Fourth Amendment rights.\" He maintains that empathy training \"must go hand in hand with respecting basic constitutional protections.\"\n\nIs it possible for an officer who starts out unempathetic to grow more caring? The knee-jerk theory suggests not. If people are helpless to stop themselves from feeling empathy, they might likewise be unable to stoke it. But the recruits in Rahr's program provide a counterpoint; they build their empathic ability even in difficult circumstances. This jibes with the findings of a new movement in the scientific community. Some psychologists, myself included , argue that empathy is less a fixed trait, like height, than a learnable skill, like Scrabble. In one recent study , my colleagues and I found that people who believe this to be true put more work into identifying with members of other races, a tendency that would serve police officers well.\n\nAnother way to bolster caring is to emphasize empathy-positive norms, as the British psychologist Mark Tarrant found in a study in 2009 . Tarrant and his colleagues told a group of college students about another student whose parents had died in a car accident. Participants felt more empathy when they believed that this victim attended their own university, as opposed to another school. Tarrant then ran his study again, but first told half the group that their own university was an unusually empathic place, high in \"compassion, tenderness, and sympathy.\" This simple prompt erased the empathy gap; students now expressed equal empathy for victims from their own and other schools. In the world of law enforcement, the city police department in Decatur, Georgia, seems to have adopted a similar empathic norm, as can be seen in the first seconds of its recruitment video -a stark contrast with more warrior-oriented messages offered elsewhere .\n\nIt is frustratingly difficult to draw a line between empathy-focussed police training, on the one hand, and concrete outcomes such as use of force, on the other. This is largely because police departments offer poorly structured or incomplete data about their behavior. Rahr and others are now engaged in long-term research to make up that disparity in knowledge. Still, even at this time of frayed relations between cops and communities, programs like Rahr's offer the potential for both optimism and psychological insight, by furthering the idea that officers can learn to choose empathy more often.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Improv for Cops\n\nLike a lot of New Yorkers, Terry Greiss watched the video of Eric Garner being choked to death by police officers on Staten Island, in 2014, and felt a call to action. But, instead of marching on Union Square, Greiss, the executive director of the Irondale Ensemble Project, a Brooklyn-based theatre company, wrote a letter to Police Commissioner William Bratton. \"I said, in a hubristic overstatement, 'You need what we do. As actors, we train ourselves to really look, to really listen,' \" he recalled recently. \"Within the week, I got a call from 1 Police Plaza, saying, 'When can you come in and talk about a pilot project?' I was bowled over.\"\n\nGreiss, who has a rumpled white beard and resembles George Carlin, was sitting in the balcony of Irondale's space, at a church in Fort Greene. The program he developed with the N.Y.P.D., \"To Protect, Serve, and Understand,\" pairs seven officers and seven civilians for improvisational theatre games. The goal, he said, is to \"develop empathy\" between the two groups. (It's unrelated, except in good will, to an initiative to sharpen cops' visual perception by taking them to art museums.) A few months ago, Greiss put up flyers around the neighborhood and received some thirty applicants, though some of the cops didn't quite know what they were getting into. \"One of our sergeants said that she needed volunteers-I thought it was training,\" Jaime Ramirez, an officer in the 73rd precinct, said. He turned to Guy Randel, his partner on the force since 2007. \"I was, like, 'Yo, Guy! Go talk to Sergeant So-and-So and get yourself signed up for training!' \"\n\nAfter a communal dinner of mulligatawny soup, the participants stood in a circle onstage. It was their second-to-last workshop before a free public performance; the cops were considered on duty during rehearsals. The civilians ranged in age and attitude, from a twenty-something Black Lives Matter protester to a retired corrections officer. They all warmed up by singing a medieval madrigal in the round, then by collectively keeping a volleyball up in the air as long as possible.\n\nGreiss stood beside a row of assorted hats and announced the evening's first exercise, called \"The Hat Game.\" Two players at a time would choose hats and improvise a scene, while trying to snatch the other person's hat. \"Make sure you're really saying 'yes' to every offer,\" Greiss reminded them, invoking the cardinal rule of improv, known as \"yes, and.\" \"Someone calls you José, now you're José.\" He added, \"Improv is aggressive, O.K.? When you go for something, you're going with your whole body, your whole mind.\"\n\nRandel put on a police hat and played a scene with Annika Sten Pärson, a Swedish-born strategic consultant living in Chelsea, who wore a backward baseball cap. They played the scene as a cop and a vagrant on the street. \"Hey, you! Kid!\" Randel said. \"What you doing over there? Shouldn't you be in school right now?\" As he grabbed her arm, she made for his hat and accidentally slapped him on the forehead.\n\n\"That's assault!\" Stephen Barnes (84th Precinct) hollered from the audience, laughing.\n\nSome of the cops were looser onstage than others (Barnes actually minored in theatre before joining the force), and, when there was mumbling, Greiss would yell out, \"Share your voice!\" The group moved on to a game called \"Unrelated Conversation,\" in which five players expound on disparate topics of their choice, interrupting one another whenever the urge strikes them. The idea is to concentrate on one thing and not respond directly. Earlene Cowie, an officer in the 79th Precinct, began, \"You would think being a police officer I would be paid top dollar. Suffolk County, Nassau County, they all get paid a hundred-something thousand. My paycheck sucks!\"\n\nEdward Kelly, a robotics teacher from Sunset Park, cut in, \"It's an interesting career choice, given that I never taught before I worked on computers, and now here I am teaching kids how to build a robot-\"\n\nHelen Tazes (88th Precinct) interjected, \" 'Don't shoot me! Don't kill me!' That's what I hear from this freaking lunatic! I arrested you because you beat the crap out of someone and it's on camera, not because you're black. Not because you're from a low-income area. I don't give a shit! I'd rather not arrest you and have to pat you down in your crevices in the July heat!\"\n\nJacqueline Wladis, who works at a fashion startup, jumped in, \"You know what sucks? Girls who work in fashion suck .\"\n\nMore games followed. In \"Rants,\" six players stood in a semicircle as an organizer called out subjects for them to sound off on, from lint (\"Those tape things, they don't work!\") to Black Lives Matter (\"Why does it always have to be involving the police?\") At one point, the instructor called out, \"Why are you here?\" One by one, the civilians and cops leaped out center stage, interrupting each other:\n\n\"I'm here because I'm sick and tired of everyone grouping police officers in one category, like we're all racists, we're all here just to lock people up-\"\n\n\"When I first heard about this, I thought, Oh, man, I get to, like, perform in something? But then I finally heard-\"\n\n\"I'm here because I want people to know that I see two sides on the story. I'm a cop and also-\"\n\n\"I'm here because I wanted to make a change in my community. I mean, I'm-\"\n\n\"Who would pass up this opportunity? Nobody would ever call me to a theatre! But now I have-\"\n\n\"There are all these stories that need to be told. I think that's so important. That's why I'm here, I wanted to-\"\n\n\"We're people, too. We have families. We have loved ones. We live in the city we want to be safe-\"\n\n\"People don't even respect me! I was respected before. I was referred to as 'Miss,' 'Ma'am.' Now I'm 'pig.' Now I'm 'racist.' I am a slew of adverbs, adjectives, nastiness.\"\n\nNear the end of the evening, Greiss asked the seven officers to stand onstage holding their police hats. \"I want you to look at it, and endow it with what you feel about the job,\" he told them. \"When you're ready, put the hat on and let your body respond to the hat.\" Postures stiffened; hands rested on hips.\n\nThen Greiss asked the officers to hand their police hats to the civilians. \"What does the hat bring up for you?\" Greiss asked them. \"What does it feel like? How much does it weigh? What does it represent?\" The civilians donned the hats. Some looked uneasy, others authoritative. \"Officers, watch,\" Greiss instructed. \"Are they wearing the hat, or is the hat wearing them?\"\n\nRichard Gadson, who has been a patrol cop in Bed-Stuy for fifteen years, said, from the first row, \"They're wearing the hat.\"\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "\"Incident\" Shows How Officers React When a Police Killing Is Caught on Tape\n\nWatch \"Incident.\"\n\nThe opening of Bill Morrison's short film \"Incident\" is silent. Security footage shows a section of a Chicago street on what looks to be an ordinary summer afternoon. A few people walk down the sidewalk, a seagull flies past the camera, a police cruiser idles on the corner. Suddenly the view changes and the sound comes on. The effect is jarring, and the new scene is one that has become all too familiar: police officers have shot and killed a Black civilian.\n\nHarith (Snoop) Augustus had left work at the barbershop down the street when he was shot by a Chicago police officer. Morrison's documentary captures the final moments of his life, and the actions and reactions of the police and neighbors who were there when it happened. Using police body-cam footage to create a multifaceted record of the shooting, along with simple onscreen text to place the shooting in its local political context, the film is a powerful record of one man's death and of the ongoing crisis of police violence.\n\nView the latest or submit your own film.\n\nThe shooting in \"Incident\" is closely tied to an earlier, more famous police shooting in Chicago. In 2014, Officer Jason Van Dyke killed seventeen-year-old Laquan McDonald. A journalist sued to get access to body-cam footage, which unravelled Van Dyke's claim that he had acted in self-defense. A striking, troubling element of \"Incident\" comes when we see the police officers immediately begin to describe the shooting to one another-in an account that contradicts what we see on tape. For Bill Morrison, this is at the crux of the film: \"With the public's access to this footage established, a shift in police behavior happens. The cops are all performing now. They know that they're on camera and that it's going to be reviewed, and they are creating a narrative to vindicate their actions.\"\n\nAfter the film was completed, in December, 2023, the City of Chicago reached a new collective-bargaining agreement with the Fraternal Order of Police. A provision of the contract, ratified by the Chicago City Council, allows officers to turn off body cameras during conversations that follow an incident, and to delete post-incident conversations that are recorded.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Word on the Street\n\nThe New Yorker , August 10, 1998 P. 36\n\nCOP DIARY about police jargon. The pseudonymous author, a New York Police Department patrolman, translates police codes such as \"K,\" meaning a radio transmission is over; \"two under,\" meaning two arrests; and \"Charlie Ida,\" for \"confidential informant.\" Cop talk comes from the shotgun marriage of street slang and legalese: \"The alleged perpetrator called him a 'bitch-ass punk' and mooshed him, causing annoyance and alarm.\" Sometimes, especially in the drug trade, the criminal words for things are the only words there are, like \"deck,\" a glassine envelope of a white powdery substance. When an informant the author was working with strolled into the precinct, another cop called out to him, \"Hey, your girlfriend's here.\" She said, \"He don't want this twisted ass.\" And so the successful warrant they executed for a drug dealer was dubbed Operation Twisted Ass. What you say and how you say it come into play far more than anything you do with your stick or your gun, and can even prevent the need for them. Cops have talked would-be suicides down from rooftops and convinced raving gunmen to release child hostages. The author tried to get information from a hard-core heroin junkie and dealer by pitching appeals to her freedom, but she was close-mouthed. When he asked if she had kids, she nodded and began explaining how she got her supplies. An adage favored by cops is: \"Believe half of what you see, and none of what you hear.\" When a robbery victim told him that three white men in white suits broke into her apartment and made off with her cigarettes, he asked if she was taking any medicine. She nodded, and said, \"For the voices.\" When P.O. Tony tells his partner, P.O. Mike, \"Hey, Pete, this guy's O.K.,\" he's really telling Mike that he isn't-that he has a weapon. The word \"buff\"-a green idealist-can convey several shades of insult. The opposite of \"buff\" is \"hairbag,\" a bitter and burned-out complainer. A possible inference is that faith and doubt can be equally blind. A handful of statements remain unambiguous, like the radio code \"10-13\"-for \"Officer needs assistance.\" The code may come from chapter ten, verse thirteen of the Epistle of Paul to the Romans: \"For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.\" The thought of old commissioners slyly encrypting police codes with heavenly messages is hard to resist. But it's like most everything cops say and hear: You believe it if you like, ignore it at your risk, but listen, always, if you hope to understand.\n\nView Article\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

Why?\n\nby Mac Schneider\n\nWhen it premiered in 1989, Cops presented itself as a raw, unscripted look at policing in the US. Down to its iconic theme song, Cops has remained more or less the same since: an unfussy purveyor of \"Bad Boys\" on American TV screens since the first Bush presidency. The show has been on longer than The Simpsons , and as it begins its 31st season this year, it holds the title as the longest-running primetime show in the US.\n\nThe show has no actors, no narration, no music, and it's filmed entirely with handheld cameras trained on police units throughout the country. Despite its stripped-down production value, the show has always managed to draw an audience - primarily by packing the episodes full of police chases, drug busts, and other criminal antics. Driving that success are numerous law enforcement officers who are not only willing but eager to go on the show. Why?\n\nThe show is run by producers who profit from filming situations that can be humiliating, violent or intense in other ways. And given this unscripted - and potentially image-damaging - format, it might seem odd that police would choose to participate. That is, until you realize how this show gets made.\n\nFor more than a year, the team behind the podcast Running From Cops has been researching the show. In this video, Vox worked with them to examine the reasons police choose to participate in Cops .

See our ethics statement.\n\nby German Lopez\n\nIf you buy something from a Vox link, Vox Media may earn a commission. See our ethics statement.\n\nDerek Chauvin, the former Minneapolis police officer accused of killing George Floyd, is on trial right now. But Chauvin is a major outlier in a system that very rarely imposes serious criminal charges against cops for an on-duty shooting or killing.\n\nTake shootings, for which Chauvin is not accused of, but for which we have the best data: Since 2005, 139 police officers have been arrested for murder or manslaughter due to an on-duty shooting, according to data from Philip Matthew Stinson, a criminal justice expert at Bowling Green State University who has been tracking the data for years. That amounts to fewer than nine prosecutions a year.\n\nAbout 1,000 fatal police shootings are reported each year in the US - so the arrest rate is around 1 percent, never higher than 2 percent. Some, perhaps most, shootings are justified. But the number of police officers prosecuted \"seems extremely low to me,\" Stinson told me. \"In my opinion, it's got to be that more of the fatal shootings are unjustified.\"\n\nOf those 139 officers, just 44 were convicted (with 42 cases still pending). Many of those convictions came on lesser charges: Just seven officers have been convicted of murder in police shootings since 2005, with their prison sentences ranging from 81 months to life. The remaining 37 were convicted on charges ranging from manslaughter to official misconduct, in some cases serving no prison time.\n\nVox's German Lopez is here to guide you through the Biden administration's burst of policymaking. Sign up to receive our newsletter each Friday .\n\nAfter the police shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, in August 2014, as the Black Lives Matter movement grew more prominent, there was an uptick in prosecutions: From 2005 to 2014, about five police officers were prosecuted a year. Starting with 2015, the average is up to roughly 13 a year - meaning cops are now prosecuted in less than 2 percent of fatal shootings, up from less than 1 percent. But convictions haven't increased much yet.\n\nStill, even the cases that result in charges are a tiny fraction of fatal police shootings. \"It's very low,\" Stinson said. As for the increase in prosecution numbers: \"I don't see systemic change.\"\n\nMany social and legal factors contribute to the low rates of charges and convictions. Cops, under cultural pressure , actively protect each other, making it more difficult at virtually every step to investigate a fatal police shooting as an illegal act. Prosecutors face conflicts of interest, as they risk aggravating police departments they work closely with by pursuing charges. The public is skeptical of second-guessing police in tense situations. And the law gives police wide latitude to use force.\n\nThere's a standard process for what happens after a murder. Police gather evidence of a crime, collecting physical materials as well as rounding up and talking to witnesses. Then prosecutors use that evidence to put together a case for court. A suspect can at that point make a deal and plead guilty, or take the case to trial.\n\nFor a police shooting, things work differently. That's in part because many police shootings are justified, dealing with a suspect who was a serious threat. But there's also a confluence of social and legal forces that protect cops at every step, from investigation to prosecution to trial, even if they actually were in the wrong.\n\n\"Everything is done different\" than in a standard murder, Stinson said. \"It makes it difficult for prosecutors to figure it out and to make a rational decision, an informed decision, in terms of charging.\"\n\nFor one, cops might resist treating a police killing as a crime and refuse to gather evidence. They could follow what's known as the \"blue wall of silence,\" essentially a code between officers that they won't snitch on each other or otherwise try to get each other in trouble. The most obvious effect of this is that cops, who are often the closest witnesses to a fatal shooting, won't give a full, truthful account if it puts their colleagues in danger. Right away, that eliminates the most likely witnesses - fellow officers - to treating a police killing as a potential crime.\n\nMeanwhile, prosecutors have incentives not to push too hard. They work very closely with police departments on a day-to-day basis - it's, again, how they get a lot of evidence for charges, trials, and convictions. If prosecutors go after the police, they risk damaging that relationship and, subsequently, making their day-to-day work a lot harder.\n\nThis isn't theoretical; prosecutors have repeatedly complained about this. Following the 2017 Minneapolis police killing of Justine Damond , Hennepin County prosecutor Mike Freeman brought murder charges against the shooting officer, Mohamed Noor. Though Noor was ultimately convicted and sentenced to prison , it wasn't easy.\n\n\"A number of the officers, for reasons we do not understand ... refused to come answer questions,\" Freeman said in 2018 . \"I've been privileged to have this job nearly 18 years, I've never had police officers who weren't suspects refuse to do their duty and come forward to talk to us.\"\n\nThat's an example of a prosecutor who actually tried pursuing the case. In many cases, prosecutors will use their discretion to not bring any charges at all. That may be because they genuinely find a police killing to be justified, or it may be because they find the case too challenging or politically risky. (In much of the US, prosecutors are elected into their positions .)\n\nIf a case does make it to trial, a major challenge is persuading judges and juries, made up of members of the public, that a cop should be convicted. Based on Stinson's data for officers charged with murder or manslaughter due to an on-duty shooting, just 46 percent of police with completed cases have been convicted since 2005.\n\n\"There is a tendency to believe an officer over a civilian, in terms of credibility,\" David Rudovsky , a civil rights lawyer who co-wrote Prosecuting Misconduct: Law and Litigation , previously told Vox . \"And when an officer is on trial, reasonable doubt has a lot of bite. A prosecutor needs a very strong case before a jury will say that somebody we generally trust to protect us has so seriously crossed the line as to be subject to a conviction.\"\n\nStinson put it another way: People are \"very reluctant to second-guess the split-second, life-or-death decisions of a police officer in a potentially violent street encounter. They just won't do it.\"\n\nThen there's the actual law, which gives police wide latitude to use force. Under the legal standards set by the Supreme Court , police officers can be legally justified in using force if they merely perceive a threat, even if a threat isn't there. State laws can vary, but in general the legal question comes down to whether the officer acted reasonably - in a way other officers would in similar situations, without the benefit of hindsight - which can easily be interpreted by prosecutors, judges, or juries to allow cops to use force in situations in which they didn't really need to.\n\nThis is part of the problem that the state's attorney for Baltimore, Marilyn Mosby, ran into when she prosecuted the police officers involved in the 2015 killing of Freddie Gray . The question in trial often came down to whether the officers were acting unreasonably, which was simply too hard for Mosby to prove. Coupled with all the other problems above, Mosby found it impossible to land a conviction. As she put it , after she decided to drop the cases in 2016:\n\nAfter much thought and prayer, it has become clear that without being able to work with an independent investigatory agency from the very start, without having a say in the election of whether cases proceed in front of a judge or jury, without communal oversight of police in this community, without substantive reforms to the current criminal justice system, we could try this case 100 times just like it and we would still end up with the same result.\n\nThat was true even for officers in a police department that the US Department of Justice found to be broken at practically every level - concluding in a damning report , \"Racially disparate impact is present at every stage of BPD's enforcement actions, from the initial decision to stop individuals on Baltimore streets to searches, arrests, and uses of force.\" And it's likely even more true for police departments that aren't as systemically broken.\n\nThe result: Police officers today get away without even an arrest for murder or manslaughter in more than 98 percent of fatal shootings.\n\nFixing police accountability will require more than changing policies.\n\nAccountability for officers needs to better ingrained within police departments and prosecutors' offices. If there's no culture of accountability in these places, it's going to be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for the legal system to do more to hold cops accountable. No one has a great answer for how, exactly, to make this happen. Some of that work has started with the recent push to elect more progressive prosecutors , but so far that hasn't led to big changes across America, and it's too early to say if it will.\n\nFrom a broader cultural perspective, the public needs to be more willing to question cops' side of the story - a shift that would ultimately not just trickle down to juries but perhaps spark more systemic changes in how police departments and prosecutors' offices function and the kinds of policies lawmakers back to hold police accountable. Again, some of that work already appears to be underway, with support for Black Lives Matter up compared to recent years , but it's too early to say if that's enough so far.\n\nPolicy changes could help, too.\n\nOne potential step is repealing \"qualified immunity,\" which shields individual officers from lawsuits. But Stinson said it has to go further: \"It would be an inconvenience for officers if they had [civil] judgments against them, but it's not a deterrent. What would deter them is seeing many other officers go to prison. That's what it takes.\"\n\nOne common idea is to put independent prosecutors in charge of investigations of police use of force. This could help mitigate any conflict of interest between prosecutors and the police departments they work closely with on a daily basis. Some cities, counties, and states already do this, but it's far from nationwide.\n\nAnother is to change the laws and rules surrounding shootings and use of force. Police departments could change their own policies, establishing clearer standards for what's reasonable or not.\n\nLocal, state, and federal lawmakers get a say here, too. Last year, for example, California lawmakers required that deadly force not be just \"objectively reasonable\" but \"necessary.\" While there are major questions about what \"necessary\" really means, experts are watching the impact of the changes over time as the new law is tested by prosecutors in court, to see if there's a real shift in police accountability.\n\nSome experts also still pin some hope on the spread of cameras. While the research on whether police-worn cameras have an impact on use of force and accountability overall is very disappointing , it's hard to shake the sense that video of police shootings has at least moved the needle on how the public perceives the police. After all, it's video of the arrest of George Floyd in Minneapolis this year that led to thousands of Black Lives Matter protests, and greater support for those protests, this summer.\n\nBut as Stinson said: \"Even when you got good video, you don't necessarily get a conviction out of it,\" such as in the Minnesota police killing of Philando Castile .\n\nBeyond police accountability, there are broader changes that could be made to otherwise reduce the number of police shootings. Better police training and policies could encourage officers to get into fewer situations in which use of force might be necessary - essentially, remove the need for a split-second decision. More could be done to rebuild trust and police-community relations , which could allow police to not be as guarded, and potentially aggressive, in day-to-day scenarios. America could tighten restrictions on guns, given that research suggests that more guns lead to more police shootings as well, perhaps because police are more likely to use lethal force in situations in which they expect a gun to be present.\n\nAs all of these problems and solutions indicate, this won't be an easy issue to solve. It requires a truly systemic shift, from America's culture around policing to how the criminal justice system functions at every level. If the US wants fewer cases that result in no justice, all of that work and effort will be necessary.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nAn exhausting - if not exhaustive - timeline of J.K.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nHow the number of police officers in schools skyrocketed in recent decades - and made for a harrowing education for Black and brown youth.\n\nby Kristin Henning\n\nPart of The Schools Issue of The Highlight , our home for ambitious stories that explain our world.\n\nWhen I was in high school, my school looked like a school. Teachers were in the classrooms. Our principal was in the front office. We had a guidance counselor who helped us think about where to go to college or how to get a job. We had a gym, a basketball court, and a football field.\n\nToday, when I meet my clients at school, I can barely distinguish a school visit from a legal visit to the local youth detention center. At the front door, I am greeted by a phalanx of uniformed police officers, some of whom have guns at their side. In schools, these officers are called school resource officers, or SROs. They are sworn police officers who patrol schools all over the country. In DC, the officers tell me to take everything out of my pockets, put my items in a plastic bin, and run them through a metal detector. I am then instructed to walk through a full-body scanner, and if I wear big jewelry or have metal in my shoes, the officer will \"wand\" me again with a handheld detector on the other side.\n\nI watch as students all around me are treated the same. There is a lot of banter between the students and the officers - some of it playful, some of it hostile. At one school, an officer tells a child, \"You know you're not supposed to have a cellphone in school. You need to sign that into the front office.\" The student lets out a loud sigh and drops the f-word. Another student yells out, \"Man, I'm going to be late to class, let me go through.\" At least one student is asked to remove his shoes. As I look up, I can see security cameras in the lobby. And when I head to a classroom on the third floor, I am escorted to the elevator by an officer who wants to make sure I am okay. To put it mildly, the schools my clients attend look like prisons at the front door.\n\nI have now been representing children in DC for 25 years, mostly as the director of the Juvenile Justice Clinic at Georgetown Law, where I supervise law students and new attorneys defending children charged with crimes in the city. I also spend a good deal of time traveling, training, and strategizing with juvenile defenders across the country in partnership with the National Juvenile Defender Center.\n\nFrom the East Coast to the West, from the Deep South to the North, Black children appear in juvenile and criminal courts across the country in numbers that far exceed their presence in the population. Black children are accosted all over the nation for the most ordinary adolescent activities - shopping for prom clothes, playing in the park, listening to music, buying juice from a convenience store, wearing the latest fashion trend, and protesting for their social and political rights.\n\nIn DC, our elected attorney general is more attentive now to the harms and disparities impacting people of color, but even with these changes, I have still spent much of the last two decades fighting for Black children who have been arrested and prosecuted for \"horseplay\" on the Metro, breaking a school window, stealing a pass to a school football game, throwing snowballs (a.k.a. \"missiles\") at a passing police car, hurling pebbles across the street at another kid, playing \"toss\" with a teacher's hat, and snatching a cellphone from a boyfriend. I have seen Black children handcuffed at ages 9 and 10; 12- and 13-year-old Black boys stopped for riding their bicycles; and industrious 16-and 17-year-old Black youth detained for selling water on the National Mall. The list goes on.\n\nWe live in a society that is uniquely afraid of Black children. Americans become anxious - if not outright terrified - at the sight of a Black child ringing the doorbell, riding in a car with white women, or walking too close in a convenience store. Americans think of Black children as predatory, sexually deviant, and immoral. For many, that fear is subconscious, arising out of the historical and contemporary narratives that have been manufactured by politicians, business leaders, and others who have a stake in maintaining the social, economic, and political status quo.\n\nThere is something particularly efficient about treating Black children like criminals in adolescence. Black youth are dehumanized, exploited, and even killed to establish the boundaries of whiteness before they reach adulthood and assert their rights and independence. It is no coincidence that Emmett Till was 14 when he was lynched, Trayvon Martin was 17 when he was shot by a volunteer neighborhood watchman, Tamir Rice was 12 when he was shot by the police at a park, Dajerria Becton was 15 when she was slammed to the ground by police at a pool party, and four Black and Latina girls were 12 when they were strip-searched for being \"hyper and giddy\" in the hallway of their New York middle school.\n\nSchool resource officers appear in all 50 states. They are visible in both urban meccas and small towns. In 1975, only 1 percent of US schools reported having police stationed on campus. By the 2017-18 school year, 36 percent of elementary schools, 67.6 percent of middle schools, and 72 percent of high schools reported having sworn officers on campus routinely carrying a firearm. In raw numbers, there were 9,400 school resource officers in 1997. By 2016, there were at least 27,000.\n\nBecause police operate under many different titles in schools, these numbers are surely low. Tallies often miss private security guards and neighborhood officers assigned by the local police department to patrol several schools without any formal agreement with the school district.\n\nAccording to a survey of school resource officers in 2018, more than half worked for local police or sheriff's departments. Twenty percent worked for school police departments, and the remaining worked for some \"other\" category including the school district, an individual school, school security employers, private companies, and fire departments. Some school systems, like those in Baltimore, Indianapolis, Los Angeles, Miami, Oakland, and Philadelphia, have their own independent police departments. The Los Angeles School Police Department has more than 350 sworn police officers and 125 non-sworn school safety officers.\n\nSchool resource officers often patrol with guns, batons, Tasers, body cameras, pepper spray, handcuffs, K-9 units, and handheld and full-body metal detectors like those found at an airport. Some are even equipped with military-grade weapons such as tanks, grenade launchers, and M16s.\n\nSo what happened to cause such a shift in school culture since I was in high school 35 years ago? For far too long I accepted the simple and often repeated explanation that parents were terrified to send their children to school after the deadly mass shooting at Columbine High School in 1999. Although Columbine certainly played a role in the rapid expansion of school resource officers in the early 21st century, the National Association of School Resource Officers had already formed in 1991, eight years before the tragedy in Colorado. Our nation's obsession with policing in public schools began long before Columbine. That story began in the mid-20th century, with the fight for - and against - racial desegregation.\n\nResearchers believe the first law enforcement officers appeared in public schools as early as 1939, when the Indianapolis Public Schools hired a \"special investigator\" to serve the school district from 1939 to 1952.\n\nIn 1952, that investigator began to supervise a loosely organized group of police officers who patrolled school property, performed traffic duties, and conducted security checks after hours. The group was reorganized in 1970 to form the Indianapolis School Police. It is significant that the Ku Klux Klan controlled both the state legislature and the Indianapolis Board of School Commissioners from the 1920s through the formation of the early school police force. The Klan had segregated Indianapolis schools by 1927 and kept them that way until the federal government intervened in the 1960s.\n\nOur nation's obsession with policing in public schools began long before Columbine. That story began in the mid-20th century, with the fight for - and against - racial desegregation.\n\nOther school districts began hiring police in the mid-20th century - more explicitly in response to the evolving racial dynamics in the country. American cities had become more diverse after World War II as Blacks left the Jim Crow South in search of opportunities in industrial centers such as Los Angeles and Flint, Michigan. Whites who were uncomfortable with the exploding populations and shifting demographics blamed the new migrants for emerging social problems such as poverty, racial and ethnic tension, and crime.\n\nTeachers in Flint planted the seed - maybe inadvertently - for a law enforcement presence in schools during a 1953 workshop, when they expressed concerns about growing student enrollments and the potentially negative impacts of overcrowding, including delinquency. Seeking to address these concerns, Flint educators, police, and civic leaders collaborated in 1958 to implement the nation's first Police-School Liaison Program and ultimately developed the framework for school resource officers as we know them today.\n\nSchools across the country followed Flint's lead. Programs sprang up in cities including Anchorage, Atlanta, Baton Rouge, Boise, Chicago, Cincinnati, Los Angeles, Miami, Minneapolis, New York City, Oakland, Seattle, and Tucson, on the heels of the US Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education to end legal segregation in public schools.\n\nState and local governments sent police into schools under the pretense of protecting Black youth. The real motives, however, likely had more to do with white fear, privilege, and resentment. Municipal leaders in the North and South claimed that Black children lacked discipline and feared they would bring disorder to their schools. In 1957, representatives from the New York City Police Department described Black and Latinx students in low-income neighborhoods as \"dangerous delinquents\" and \"undesirables\" capable of \"corroding school morale.\" Policing in schools also gave school administrators a mechanism for preserving resources for white middle-class students and keeping Black youth in their place.\n\nTensions escalated the following decade as Black students balked at whites' opposition to racial equality and schools' bold refusals to integrate. In cities like Greensboro, North Carolina, and Oklahoma City, students organized protests, walkouts, and marches to demand equal resources and opportunity. Students also insisted on culturally relevant curricula and basic dignity in the classroom.\n\nWhite, middle-class Americans equated civil rights action with crime and delinquency, inflaming - and sometimes manufacturing - fears of a growing youth crime problem. In this turbulent climate, cities implemented school-police partnerships to combat a \"problem\" that police and educators explicitly and implicitly blamed on Black and other marginalized youth.\n\nPolicing in the schoolhouse grew in lockstep with civil rights protests and gradually became a permanent fixture in integrated schools.\n\nWhile most school-police partnerships started as local initiatives like the one in Flint, these programs began to draw federal support in 1965 when President Lyndon B. Johnson established the Commission on Law Enforcement and Administration of Justice to \"inquire into the causes of crime and delinquency\" and provide recommendations for prevention. In its 1967 report, the commission predicted that youth would be the greatest threat to public safety in the years to come.\n\nThe report drew a tight connection between race, crime, and poverty and frequently reminded readers that \"Negroes, who live in disproportionate numbers in slum neighborhoods, account for a disproportionate number of arrests.\" The commission referred to young people in racially charged language like \"slum children\" and \"slum youth\" from \"slum families\" and noted that many Americans had already become suspicious of \"Negroes\" and adolescents they believed to be responsible for crime. The commission's analysis aligned with television and newspaper reports that stoked fears by depicting civil rights protests as criminal acts instead of political demonstrations against oppression.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, local and state law enforcement agencies applied for federal grants through the Department of Justice's newly created Office of Law Enforcement Assistance to fund new crime prevention plans like school-police partnerships.\n\nConcerns about discrimination in school-based policing surfaced almost immediately, including in Flint, the birthplace of the school-police partnership. Notwithstanding initial concerns about delinquency in school, Black teachers and parents began to complain that Flint's Police-School Liaison Program targeted students of color. As reported in a 1971 review of the initiative, some teachers said the program was \"aimed specifically at the black community\" and was \"anathema to black people\" because it enforced \"middle class white ethics and mores.\"\n\nThe race-baiting and fearmongering that motivated the first school-police partnerships during the civil rights era were followed by the mythic lies of the \"superpredator\" craze in the 1990s. With crime on the rise and the crack epidemic at full throttle by the end of the 1980s, white fears reached epic proportions. State and federal politicians accepted Princeton professor John J. DiIulio Jr.'s highly publicized yet unscientific 1995 predictions of a coming band of Black teenage \"superpredators\" with reckless abandon, and passed legislation to increase police presence in every aspect of Black adolescent life. Schools were a natural focus.\n\nCongress also passed both the Gun-Free Schools Act and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act in 1994. The Gun-Free Schools Act was passed to keep drugs, guns, and other weapons out of schools. The Violent Crime Control Act created the Office of Community Oriented Policing Services, radically increased federal funding for policing in communities, and laid the foundation for a new wave of federal funding for police in schools.\n\nAnd then there was Columbine. On April 20, 1999, the nation was rocked by a mass shooting at Columbine High School in Littleton, Colorado. Two 12th-graders, Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, murdered 12 students and one teacher. Twenty-one additional people were injured by gunshots. Another three were injured trying to escape the school. At the time, it was the deadliest school shooting in US history.\n\nColumbine was the 12th in a spate of school shootings committed by students between 1996 and 1999. These deadly tragedies terrified parents and teachers and prompted increased funding for school safety everywhere. In October 1998, just months before the shooting at Columbine, Congress had already voted to allocate funding for the COPS in Schools grants program.\n\nDays after the shooting, in April 1999, President Bill Clinton promised that the COPS office would release $70 million to fund an additional 600 police officers in schools in 336 communities across the country. In 1998 and 1999, COPS awarded 275 jurisdictions more than $30 million for law enforcement to partner with school systems to address crime and disorder in and around schools. Between 1999 and 2005, COPS in Schools awarded more than $750 million in grants to more than 3,000 law enforcement agencies to hire SROs.\n\nAlthough these shootings do explain the immediate increase in funding for police in schools, the shootings do not explain the disproportionate surge of police in schools serving mostly Black and Latinx students. Although the vast majority of the school-based shootings in the 1990s - and again in 2012 - occurred in primarily white suburban schools, school resource officers are more likely to be assigned to schools serving mostly students of color.\n\nNational data from the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights reveals that youth of color are more likely than white youth to attend schools that employ school police officers. In the 2015-16 school year, 54.1 percent of middle and high schools serving a student body that was at least 75 percent Black had at least one school-based law enforcement or security officer on campus. By contrast, only 32.5 percent of schools serving a student body that was 75 percent or more white had such personnel in place.\n\nThe 1990s brought a rapid increase in both school suspensions and school-based arrests as police officers remained confused about their roles on campus and new laws were passed to criminalize normal adolescent behavior. Administrators in the first school-police partnerships viewed school resource officers as part teacher, part counselor, and part law enforcement officer only when necessary.\n\nThe partners in Flint hoped to foster a positive relationship between youth and police, prevent youth crime, and provide counseling services for students believed to be at risk of delinquency. As police became more entrenched in schools, students, parents, and civil rights advocates complained that police officers weren't trained to be counselors and worried about the potential for conflicts of interest when police tried to serve multiple functions. Civil rights groups worried that police were violating students' rights through unsupervised interrogations, harassment, and surveillance.\n\nThirty years later, police still haven't figured out what schools want them to do, and schools haven't figured out what they want police to do. Only 15 states require schools and law enforcement agencies to develop memoranda of understanding (MOUs) to specify the scope and limits of the officers' authority on campus. When school districts do have an MOU, they usually focus on the cost-sharing aspects of the agreement and offer few details about when, where, and how police can intervene with students.\n\nThirty years later, police still haven't figured out what schools want them to do, and schools haven't figured out what they want police to do\n\nEven when school resource officers are expressly hired to respond to emergencies and protect students from guns and serious threats of violence, they are quickly drawn into the more routine activities of law enforcement on campus. Forty-one percent of school resource officers surveyed in 2018 reported that \"enforcing laws\" was their primary role on campus. Police often arrive with little or no training on how their traditional law enforcement roles should differ within the school context and even less training on developmental psychology and adolescent brain development.\n\nA 2013 study found that police academies nationwide spend less than 1 percent of total training hours on juvenile justice topics. In the 2018 survey, roughly 25 percent of school police surveyed indicated that they had no experience with youth before working in schools. Sixty-three percent reported they had never been trained on the teen brain; 61 percent had never been trained on child trauma; and 46 percent had never been trained to work with special education students. Without better training and guidance, police in schools do what they always do. They detain, investigate, interrogate, and arrest. They also intervene with force - sometimes violent and deadly force.\n\nUltimately, more police in schools means more arrests - three and a half times more arrests than in schools without police. And it means more arrests for minor infractions that teachers and principals used to handle on their own.\n\nWhen I was in high school in the mid-1980s, we were sent to the principal's office when we acted out. Sometimes we had to stay after school for detention. I even got suspended once for \"play fighting\" with one of my classmates, but I was never arrested. Today, children get arrested regularly at school, and mostly for things kids do all the time: fighting or threatening a classmate, breaking a window in anger, vandalism and graffiti, having weed, taking something from someone on a dare, arguing in the hallway when they are supposed to be in class.\n\nData from across the country mirrors what I see in DC. Although only 7 percent of officers surveyed in 2018 described their duties as \"enforcing school discipline,\" evidence shows that educators routinely depend on police to handle minor misbehaviors such as disobedience, disrespectful attitudes, disrupting the classroom, and other adolescent behaviors that have little or no impact on school safety. State lawmakers have even passed laws making it a crime to disturb or disrupt the school. As of 2016, at least 22 states and dozens of cities and towns outlaw school disturbances in one way or another.\n\nThe Maryland state legislature adopted its \"disturbing schools\" law back in 1967, shortly after the Baltimore City School District created its school security division. During the 2017-18 school year, 3,167 students were arrested in Maryland's public schools. About 14 percent of those arrests were for \"disruption.\" Until May 2018, students in South Carolina could be arrested for disturbing the school if they \"loitered about,\" \"acted in an obnoxious manner,\" or \"interfered with or disturbed\" any student or teacher at school. The penalty was a $1,000 fine and a possible 90-day sentence in jail.\n\nIn the 2015-16 academic year, 1,324 students were arrested or cited in the state for disturbing schools, making it the second most common delinquency offense referred to the family court. Black students were almost four times more likely than white youth to be deemed criminally responsible for disturbing schools. South Carolina lawmakers finally eliminated the crime in 2018.\n\nPolice in schools are symbolic. They provide an easy answer to fears about violence, guns, and mass shootings. They allow policymakers to demonstrate their commitment to school safety. And for a time, they make teachers and parents \"feel\" safe. But those who have studied school policing tell us this is a false sense of security.\n\nSchools with school resource officers are not necessarily any safer. An audit from North Carolina, for example, found that middle schools that used state grants to hire and train SROs did not report reductions in serious incidents like assaults, homicides, bomb threats, possession and use of alcohol and drugs, or the possession of weapons.\n\nMore from the Schools Issue\n\nAnd many advocates for police in schools forget that school resource officers were widely criticized for their failures to intervene in the shootings at both Columbine and Parkland. The officer in Columbine followed local protocol at the time and did not pursue the shooters into the building. Many speculated that if he had, there was a good chance the gunmen would not have reached the library, where so many students were targeted. Instead of immediately confronting the threat, school police secured the scene and waited for SWAT teams to arrive.\n\nThe sheriff's deputy who was assigned to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, also never went in the building, despite an active-shooter policy that instructed deputies to interrupt the shooting and search for victims after a ceasefire. Students later complained that they saw the armed deputy standing outside in a bulletproof vest while school security guards and coaches were running in to shield the students.\n\nPolice don't make students feel safer - at least not Black students in heavily policed communities. To the contrary, police in schools increase psychological trauma, create a hostile learning environment, and expose Black students to physical violence. For students who have already been exposed to police outside school, negative encounters with police in school confirm what their parents and neighbors have told them.\n\nBlack students enter their schools to be accosted by the same officers who stop, harass, and even physically assault their family and friends on the street. In much the same way they resent aggressive and racially targeted policing in their communities, students resent inconsistent and unfair school discipline. Black students don't feel welcome or trusted at school and are less likely than white students to report that school police and security officers have treated them with respect.\n\nFor many students, schools have become a literal and figurative extension of the criminal legal system. As schools increasingly rely on police officers to monitor the hallways and control classroom behavior, students feel anxious and alienated by the constant surveillance and fear of police brutality. Over time, students transfer their distrust, resentment, and hostility toward the police to school authorities. Teachers become interchangeable with the police, principals become wardens, and students no longer see school staff as educators, advocates, and protectors.\n\nBlack students who feel devalued by unfair disciplinary practices are more likely to withdraw and become delinquent. Policing in schools creates a vicious vortex. Students in heavily policed environments are less likely to be engaged and more likely to drop out. Youth who drop out are more likely to be arrested.\n\nNot only do students feel less safe in school, but they are less safe.\n\nOrganizations like the Alliance for Educational Justice have been tracking police assaults in schools across the country for many years. Since 2009, the organization has recorded numerous stories from students of color, as young as 12, who have been hit on the head, choked, punched repeatedly, slammed to the ground, kneed in the back, dragged down the hall, pepper-sprayed while handcuffed, shocked with a stun gun, tased, struck by a metal nightstick, beaten with a baton, and even killed by police at school.\n\nMost recently, in January 2021, 16-year-old Taylor Bracey was knocked unconscious and suffered from headaches, blurry vision, and depression after being body-slammed onto a concrete floor by a school resource officer in Kissimmee, Florida.\n\nMost often, police violence is inflicted in response to nonviolent student behaviors. Students have been physically assaulted for wearing a hat indoors, not tucking in their shirts as required by the dress code, being late to class, going to the bathroom without permission, participating in school demonstrations, fighting in school, having marijuana, being emotionally distraught, cursing at school officials, refusing to give up a cellphone when asked, arguing with a parent on campus, and throwing an orange at the wall.\n\nAfter Michael Brown was killed in Ferguson, Missouri, investigators from the Department of Justice found that officers in the local school district often used force against students of color for minor disciplinary violations like \"peace disturbance\" and \"failure to comply with instructions.\" In one instance, a 15-year-old girl was slammed against a locker and arrested for not following an officer's orders to go to the principal's office.\n\nStudents of color have characterized policing in schools as a coordinated and intentional effort to control and exclude them. Ironically, proponents of the federally funded COPS in Schools grant program hoped that sending police to schools would improve the image of police generally and increase the level of respect that young people have for the law and the role of law enforcement.\n\nEven Flint's first school-police partnership was framed as an attempt to \"improve community relations between the city's youth and the local police department.\" To date, these efforts have failed. Police in schools remain deeply entrenched in their traditional law enforcement roles and have been unable to dislodge youth's negative opinions and attitudes about them. The more recent and highly visible incidents of discrimination and brutality against students of color only reinforce historical images of the police as a tool of racial oppression.\n\nNow, 65 years after the Supreme Court ruled that racial segregation in public schools is illegal, Black youth are still systematically denied free, safe, and appropriate education. School segregation is achieved and maintained through school-based arrests and exclusions that deny Black youth access to a high school diploma and all of the opportunities that diploma can provide. In modern America, where formal education is the primary gateway to college, employment, and financial independence, policing in school puts Black youth at a severe disadvantage.\n\nGiven how little school-based arrests achieve, current policing strategies can no longer be justified as necessary for school safety. The unnecessary and extreme discipline of Black youth has little to do with the school-based massacres of the 1990s. Columbine can't explain police involvement in routine school discipline, discriminatory enforcement of school rules, or massive spending on the police infrastructure in American schools. And it certainly can't explain the violent force that is used to control children of color. It is about time we admit that our infatuation with policing Black children in schools was never about Columbine.\n\nExcerpted from The Rage of Innocence: How America Criminalizes Black Youth by Kristin Henning (Pantheon Books, September 28, 2021).\n\nKristin Henning is a nationally recognized trainer and consultant on the intersection of race, adolescence, and policing.

      "text": "The case for hiring more police officers\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA crime-fighting idea that actually works, and new exclusive polling shows it's popular across all racial groups.\n\nby Matthew Yglesias\n\nDemocrats seeking the 2020 presidential nomination find themselves in the odd situation of trying to prove they aren't tough on crime.\n\nJoe Biden hasn't officially declared, but to keep his options open he's already apologized for his role in criminal justice policy in the 1980s and 1990s . \"Kamala is a cop\" has been deployed as an insult , though Sen. Kamala Harris (D-CA) assures voters that she is \"taking full responsibility\" for excesses as a prosecutor in California. Sen. Cory Booker (D-NJ), meanwhile, has earned plaudits from Vox for being the rare politician to express openness to shorter prison sentences, even for violent offenders.\n\nThe swing toward greater attention to racial disparities in the criminal justice system and desire to find more humane methods of crime control is long overdue. But there's a very real risk that in the wake of the leftward swing in the Black Lives Matter era, Democrats are leaving behind genuinely effective and politically appealing approaches to criminal justice that the party has championed in the recent past.\n\nSolid data suggests that even if you take a realistic view of the police, spending money to hire more police officers - an idea espoused by both Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama - is a sound approach to the multifaceted problem of criminal justice. More police officers, in particular, doesn't need to mean more arrests and more incarceration. More beat cops walking the streets seems to deter crime and reduce the need to arrest anyone. And some of the best-validated approaches to reducing excessive use of force by police officers require departments to adopt more manpower-intensive practices.\n\nIn terms of the intersection of criminal justice policy and racial politics, new polling provided exclusively to Vox from the leading Democratic data firm Civis Analytics shows that black voters - just like white ones - support the idea of hiring more police officers. Black voters are likely aware that they are disproportionately likely to be victims of crime and disproportionately likely to benefit from extra police staffing in high-crime areas. Indeed, as Jenée Desmond-Harris wrote for Vox in 2015, one primary grievance African Americans have with the criminal justice systems is that black neighborhoods are paradoxically underpoliced .\n\nEspecially with America's police departments facing staffing challenges as they're squeezed between tight budgets and a recovering labor market, the political and policy case for more federal help hiring cops is impeccable.\n\nIn a 2005 paper, Jonathan Glick and Alex Tabarrok found a clever instrument to measure the effects of officer increases through the terrorism \"alert levels\" that were a feature of the early to mid-aughts. During high-alert periods, the Washington, DC, police force would mobilize extra officers, especially in and around the capital's core, centered on the National Mall. Using daily crime data, they found that the level of crime decreased significantly on high-alert days, and the decrease was especially concentrated on the National Mall.\n\nCritically, the finding was not that adding police officers leads to more arrests and then locking up crooks leads to lower crime in the long run. It's simply that with more officers around, fewer people commit crimes in the first place. That seems to be the criminal justice ideal, in which fewer people are getting locked up because fewer people are being victimized by criminals.\n\nThis sounds a little paradoxical, but the reality is the size of the prison population is driven largely by the harshness of the sentencing, not the number of police stops. The criminologist Lawrence Sherman has observed that the United States is very unusual in spending much more money on the prison system than on our police departments . This suggests the possibility of switching to a formula Tabarrok has summarized as \"more police, fewer prisons, less crime\" : uniformed officers patrolling the streets stopping crime before it starts rather than working in prisons surveilling convicts.\n\nAbout a year ago, Stephen Mello of Princeton University assessed the Obama-era increase in federal police funding . Thanks to the stimulus bill, funding for Clinton's Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) hiring grant program surged from about $20 million a year in the late-Bush era to $1 billion in 2009. The program design allowed Mello to assess some quasi-random variation in which cities got grants. The data shows that compared to cities that missed out, those that made the cut ended up with police staffing levels that were 3.2 percent higher and crime levels that were 3.5 percent lower.\n\nThis is an important finding because not only does it show that more police officers leads to less crime, but that actual American cities are not currently policed at a level where there are diminishing returns. Instead, reductions in crime seem to be about proportional to increases in the size of police forces.\n\nA larger historical survey by Aaron Chalfin and Justin McCrary looked at a large set of police and crime data for midsize to large cities from 1960 to 2010 and concluded that every $1 spent on extra policing generates about $1.63 in social benefits, primarily through fewer murders.\n\nOf course, much of the progressive turn against law enforcement has been driven not by skepticism about police officers' ability to deter crime but by concern about overly aggressive policing. It's important in that context to note a recent study by John MacDonald, Jeffrey Fagan, and Amanda Geller that looked at localized policing surges in New York City (dubbed \"Operation Impact\" by the NYPD) over a period of years.\n\nThey found that surges led to both less crime and more \"stop and frisk\"-type incidents where officers stopped citizens (typically young black or Latino men) without probable cause. That suggests a sharp trade-off between crime reduction and civil rights. But the same study, by looking at the covariance of \"stop and frisks\" and crime reduction, found that the additional stops were doing nothing to reduce crime. All of the anti-crime impact, in other words, came from putting more cops on the beat rather than from the use of aggressive tactics. New York City, not coincidentally, has continued to enjoy low and falling crime rates since stop and frisk tactics were curtailed. What's helpful is more officers, not more harassment.\n\nAnd there is at least some evidence that increased staffing levels would reduce the number of excessive force incidents. At a minimum, a big new federal police funding stream could also be tied to various reforms.\n\nThe key mechanism here is fatigue - which while obviously not a substitute for curing systemic racism, is a lot easier to fix with concrete short-term steps. Tired officers, across a variety of studies, generate more complaints from the civilians they interact with.\n\nObviously, police departments could (and probably should) reform their practices around shift assignment and overtime. But it would be much easier for police departments to maintain adequate police presence on the street without overscheduling officers if they had more officers around. Indeed, linking extra money for hiring officers to reforms of scheduling practices could be an element of a greatly expanded COPS hiring grant program.\n\nOther proven strategies could, likewise, be bundled into a funding package. UCLA psychologist Philip Goff, for example, worked with the Las Vegas Police Department to change their approach to on-foot chase situations after discovering that arrests following chases were unusually likely to lead to excessive force situations.\n\nThey adopted a new policy stipulating that the chasing officer - who is usually tired and angry, for understandable reasons, by the time the suspect gives up - would not be the one to touch the suspect, leaving the job to backup officers who'd be less emotional. The results were striking, including a 23 percent drop in the use of force and an 11 percent fall in officer injuries, along with a reduction in racial disparities.\n\n\"Safer for the officer, safer for the suspects,\" Goff told Vox's German Lopez when describing the research a few years ago. \"I didn't have to talk about race to reduce a disparity that has racial components to it. I had to change the fundamental situation where police are chronically engaging with suspects.\"\n\nThe sort of reforms Goff is talking about are things that departments can and should make without an infusion of new funds. But money for more officers would make it easier to implement while also giving cities whose political leaders may not be super woke an incentive to do the right thing.\n\nIdeally, of course, we'd like to know specifically if these measures would reduce police shootings - and especially deadly ones. Shootings are rare enough that they're difficult to study statistically in this context, beyond the hypothesis that a significant reduction in violence and complaints should lead to fewer shootings.\n\nMeanwhile, the political reality is that hiring more police officers is popular - including with the communities that are most concerned about the problem of police misconduct.\n\nWhen Obama pumped a billion dollars into local police hiring there was no significant controversy on the left, even though it was no secret in 2009 that officers sometimes use excessive force and that the law enforcement system features systemic biases against blacks and Latinos. The killing of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and the subsequent protests there, followed by high-profile controversies over the deaths of Tamir Rice , Philando Castile , and others transformed the political dynamic on the left.\n\nBy the 2016 cycle, it was de rigueur for Democratic Party politicians to say \"black lives matter\" and for the Mothers of the Movement to appear at the 2016 convention . Now, Harris is under accusations of having been too tough on crime as a California prosecutor . Shaun King, in a July 2018 article hailing Sen. Bernie Sanders's (I-VT) embrace of criminal justice reform, nevertheless criticized him for taking time in a speech on the subject to tell the crowd \"how hard the jobs of cops are, and how essential their role is in keeping communities safe.\"\n\nObviously, the reality is that different communities will and do feel differently about the police. But to rely on data rather than anecdotes, Civis Analytics ran a mid-January poll on a range of policing subjects and shared the results with Vox - finding that extra policing is broadly popular across racial groups and that most African Americans and Latinos express favorable views of their local police.\n\nThe firm framed the issue this way: \"Some members of your state legislature are proposing increasing the budget for the police force and hiring more police officers in high crime areas. If you have to choose, do you support or oppose increasing the number of police officers?\"\n\nThe results were unequivocally favorable to the proposal, with 60 percent of African Americans, 65 percent of Latinos, and 74 percent of whites saying they support it.\n\nThat's not to say that the conventional wisdom about race, public opinion, and policing is completely wrong. African Americans were, in the same survey, about 20 points less likely than whites to express a favorable view of their local police department. But that still leaves local police with a 58 percent favorable rating (27 percent say they take an unfavorable view), which is pretty strong.\n\nConversely, potential reforms are generally more popular with black voters than white ones. But many ideas are popular across racial lines, including guaranteed independent investigations of police shootings (backed by 62 percent of likely voters) and mandatory body cameras (backed by 74 percent of likely voters). A generous federal grant program could be a perfect lever to induce police departments to implement changes without incurring the wrath of police officers. And extra police hiring is extremely popular with the kind of voters Democrats most need to win over.\n\nAs broadly popular as the idea of additional police hiring is, it's especially popular with a critical bloc of voters: those who backed Obama in 2012 and flipped to Trump in 2016.\n\nIn the Civis poll, 75 percent of Obama-Trump switchers say they like the idea of hiring more cops - a topic that directly indicates the kind of economically progressive, culturally conservative voters who were pulled to the GOP side by the racialized themes of the 2016 campaign.\n\nNo one issue is going to be decisive in a presidential campaign, and certainly not something as small-bore as federal police funding. But the fact that this idea was embraced by the past two victorious Democratic presidential candidates, is broadly popular, is especially popular with key swing voters, and is also well-grounded in policy amounts to a powerful case that it deserves to make a comeback.\n\nThat's especially true precisely because it's a slightly odd thematic fit for a Black Lives Matter-conscious Democratic Party. It's both politically and substantively important for a political movement that wants to advance reforms of the criminal justice system to emphasize that reform does not mean indifference to crime.\n\nProviding money to put more cops on the beat is a proven and cost-effective means of bringing crime down that offers a humane alternative to harsh prison sentences as a deterrent and at least offers some prospect of cutting down on disproportionate use of force as well. The total amount of money involved is, moreover, pretty small. Even at the peak of Obama's local police funding program, he allocated \"only\" $1 billion. But the symbolism is large, a clear statement that Democrats take the problem of crime seriously and see the value of police officers' work.\n\nThe sums are also usefully comparable to the kind of money Trump wants to spend on his endless border security drives and offer a useful counterpoint to the fanciful \"build the wall and crime will fall\" slogan he has Republicans pushing. Adding $5.7 billion worth of steel slats to lightly populated regions of the US-Mexico border will have a minimal impact on America's high-crime communities, but putting that kind of money into extra police hiring could be transformative.\n\nIt's one idea from the \"tough on crime\" 1990s that actually worked out well and deserves to make a comeback in 2020.\n\nWould you like to know more?

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nEarly Hollywood treated the cops as incompetent fools. Then everything changed.\n\nby Constance Grady\n\nIn 2019, polls found that the police were one of the most trusted public institutions in America , more trustworthy than Congress or journalists or religious leaders.\n\nBut in 2020, after George Floyd died at the hands of police and wave of protests against police brutality spread across the US, police drove their vans into crowds of protesters , shot paint canisters at people standing on their own porches, fired rubber bullets at reporters and arrested other reporters live on television , and pulled down protesters' masks to pepper spray them in the face in the midst of a respiratory pandemic.\n\nThere is a gap between the ways in which the police behave and the ways in which the public perceives them. And for a long time, police have behaved as though they think pop culture is responsible for that gap.\n\nIn 1910, the International Association of Chiefs of Police was moved to adopt a resolution condemning the movie business for the way it depicted police officers . The movies, the IACP complained, made crime look fun and glamorous. Meanwhile, the police were \"sometimes made to appear ridiculous.\"\n\nIt was true: The movies did tend to make the police look ridiculous in the 1910s. From 1912 to 1917, the incompetent Keystone Cops bumbled their way across the silent screen. From 1914 to 1918, animated Police Dog shorts showed a police force unable to prevent adorable Officer Piffles (a good dog) from getting his owner into one scrape after another. And in 1917's Easy Street , Charlie Chaplin's tramp-turned-police-officer was only able to save his girl from a mob of criminals after accidentally sitting on a drug addict's needle and picking up superpowers from the force of the inadvertent injection.\n\nPolice in popular culture of the 1910s were inept buffoons to be mocked and, well, ridiculed. And the real-life police reacted with outrage. How could the police do their jobs if people thought of them as losers who could be foiled by a cartoon dog?\n\nToday, the police of popular culture have no such problem. Our screens are filled with depictions of heroic cop after heroic cop. We've got reactionary heroic cops and liberal heroic cops ; white heroic cops and Black heroic cops ; heroic cops who will work outside the system when the situation calls for it and never face a problem because they are always right, and heroic cops who never have to work against the system because the system itself is always right.\n\nWe live in a world in which police frequently respond to peaceful protesters with tear gas and rubber bullets. We also live in a world in which the heroic police officer is one of our culture's default protagonists . And the police are our protagonists because they put in the work to become so.\n\nThe ridiculous police of 1910s pop culture didn't come out of nowhere. The police of the late 19th and early 20th centuries were widely understood to be a corrupt gang, and not without reason. The infamous Lexow Commission of the 1890s, which ran more than 10,000 pages long, found that the police extorted $10 million from the public each year in New York State alone, and that they regularly harassed the citizenry rather than trying to protect them. That report drove 30 years of police reform efforts and gave a young Theodore Roosevelt the chance to build his reputation on cleaning up the New York City Police Department - but for much of the public, the police's reputation as a pack of hired goons at worst and incompetent bumblers at best had already been set.\n\nDecades of reform helped change the public's perception of the police. But it also helped that the movie industry, eager to escape police censorship, began to police itself. Studios needed police cooperation to cover up their stars' misdeeds. They also needed to get shooting permits. They had plenty of motivation to play nicely with the police. So the policeman as incompetent bumbler began to fade away from the movies.\n\nBut what cemented the idea of the hero cop in the American imagination was the modern cop show, starting with 1951's Dragnet . And as many critics have already shown - including, notably, Alyssa Rosenberg in her in-depth study at the Washington Post - the modern cop show was the result of a close relationship between Hollywood and the police.\n\nThe premise of Dragnet was that it was revealing to the world the authentic truth of what it is like to be a police officer, fighting crime. \"Ladies and gentlemen, the story you are about to see is true,\" showrunner, star, and narrator Jack Webb promised at the beginning of every episode. And as Webb's character, the stalwart LAPD detective Joe Friday, went about his work, he was surrounded by real cop cars and real cops acting as extras in the background of his scenes. Famously, the LAPD checked Webb's scripts for authenticity.\n\nBut as Rosenberg laid out , the LAPD's help came at a cost. Webb submitted every script to the LAPD's Public Information Division for approval before shooting, and any element they disliked, he would scrap.\n\nThe politics of Webb's Dragnet were not neutral. \"What Dragnet offered the American public,\" as the pop culture scholar Roger Sabin writes in his book Cop Shows , \"was a vision of the police force as a 'stabilizer' in society, made up of honest men (mostly men) dedicated both to keeping the bad guys in their place, and to the more abstract values of law and order.\" Dragnet presented the police to the public the way the police wanted to be seen: as aspirational heroes.\n\nIn 1951, the same year that Dragnet premiered, multiple members of the LAPD assaulted seven civilians , leaving five Latino men and two white men hospitalized with broken bones and ruptured organs. Racially motivated violence against civilians was and still is part of the reality of the police force. But Webb and his collaborators at the LAPD deliberately elided that reality, giving us the fantasy of the hero cop instead.\n\nAfter the success of Dragnet , law enforcement departments across the country began setting up eager collaborations with Hollywood, ready to shape the narrative of the police officer in the public's eyes. Highway Patrol followed quickly in its footsteps, and then F.B.I. , Columbo , Hawaii Five-0 , Hill Street Blues , and the mothership: Law & Order and all the series it would spawn. Today, it's de rigueur for cop shows to have cop experts on consult, ready to apply a patina of authenticity to the stories Hollywood tells us about police.\n\nIt is also de rigueur for some of the 21st century's cop shows to argue that there are serious problems in contemporary police forces. Not all cop shows choose to critique their systems: Law & Order and its various spinoffs tend to place their unfailing trust in the system. CBS's Blue Bloods aired an episode in 2014 in which a Black suspect throws himself out of a third-floor window to frame a blameless white officer for police brutality, the implication being that criticisms of the existing system do nothing but make life easier for criminals and harder for our heroic boys in blue.\n\nBut the 21st-century police shows that tend to be highly critically acclaimed and beloved by liberal audiences, like Brooklyn Nine-Nine and The Wire , do try to use their police expertise to critique the institutions in which they take place. The Wire features sympathetic individual cops, but it also depicts police brutality against sympathetic and well-developed civilians, and it argues that police departments are structured to encourage that brutality. And Brooklyn Nine-Nine develops much of its conflict by pitting its well-meaning progressive protagonist cops against the more conservative members of the NYPD.\n\nNot coincidentally, The Wire was considered wildly ahead of its time when it debuted in 2002, especially compared to the traditional police procedurals populating network television both then and now. And by the time Brooklyn Nine-Nine premiered in 2013, gentle criticism of the police as an institution felt like more or less what a respectable liberal viewer could expect from a respectable liberal TV show. The idea that a police show was inherently incapable of being politically progressive barely registered in mainstream criticism. When the journalist and academic Steven Thrasher suggested as much in 2018 , calling Brooklyn Nine-Nine \"some GOOD propaganda,\" he faced widespread backlash.\n\nBut regardless of whether a police show codes itself as conservative or progressive, the police officer is always the protagonist. He might be troubled, she might be working within a corrupt system and trying to change it from within, but it is always through their eyes that we see the world. And that's because the police built the genre that we use to talk about them. So today, even shows that are trying to self-reflexively critique the inherent flaws of the cop show find themselves doing so using the framework that the police built.\n\nIt's for that reason that some actors who have played police officers, including Brooklyn Nine-Nine 's Stephanie Beatriz , began publicly donating to bail relief funds for protesters as calls to defund the police came to dominate headlines in 2020. The donations were an act of restitution for making their living by glamorizing cops.\n\n(Notably, at least one figure associated with a less-progressive police show had the opposite reaction. A writer from S.W.A.T. and Chicago P.D. was fired from then-forthcoming Law & Order spinoff Law & Order: Organized Crime for making social media posts that jokingly threatened protesters.)\n\nPart of the central joke of Brooklyn Nine-Nine is that Andy Samberg's character Jake is obsessed with '70s detective procedurals and that he became a detective because he wanted to be the star of his own TV show. But Jake isn't any different from the rest of white America in the way he sees the world. We all grew up on cop shows. And we all reflexively know that when we are presented with a cop story, the cop is the hero.\n\nPushing back against such a deeply ingrained cultural understanding is difficult. Samberg himself acknowledged as much when he told People in July 2020 that he and the cast and creative team of Brooklyn Nine-Nine were \"all in touch and kind of discussing how you make a comedy show about police right now, and if we can find a way of doing that that we all feel morally okay about.\" Samberg's co-star Terry Crews had previously said that four unproduced episodes of Brooklyn Nine-Nine had been scrapped and would be rewritten . At the time, the show was between seasons; in February 2021, not long before it went back into production, news broke that its upcoming eighth season will be its last .\n\nIn the months since the George Floyd protests, different police procedurals have taken different paths in wrestling with this new narrative of the cop show as copaganda. Law & Order: SVU featured an episode where Olivia Benson has to face the question of whether or not she unconsciously racially profiled a suspect. Cops was outright canceled (it went back into production last fall to fulfill overseas obligations). CBS has brought in criminal justice reform advocates to work as consultants on its many police procedurals, in the same way that cop shows have traditionally used police officers as consultants.\n\nAnd police officers have reacted to this development in much the same way they did to the Keystone Cops a century ago: with outrage. The new CBS shows \"will be stories engineered to further diminish public opinion of police officers,\" Patrick Lynch, the president of the Police Benevolent Association of the City of New York, told the Washington Post last fall .\n\nBut if working with new consultants appreciably changes the cop show, it will only be the latest change in a long and fraught evolution.\n\nCop shows are where America thinks about how we see the police and how we would like to see them. These shows are shaped by our beliefs about the police, and they shape our beliefs in turn. A summer of watching police respond violently to protests against police brutality necessarily changed the way thousands of Americans think about the police - and that, in turn, means the cop shows will have to change, too.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\nA star-studded film explains the hope and hype behind regenerative agriculture.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

      "text": "Why the policing problem isn't about \"a few bad apples\"\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\n\"The system was designed this way\": A former prosecutor on the fundamental problem with law enforcement.\n\nby Sean Illing\n\nEvery time a cop is caught brutalizing a black or brown person, I hear the same argument: \"It's just a few bad apples.\"\n\nI'm hearing this again in the wake of George Floyd's murder . On Sunday, to take one example, National Security Adviser Robert C. O'Brien said, \"We have got great law enforcement officers, not - not the few bad apples, like the officer [Derek Chauvin] that killed George Floyd. But we got a few bad apples that have given - given law enforcement a bad name.\"\n\nWhen asked by CNN's Jake Tapper if he thought systemic racism was a problem for law enforcement, O'Brien replied: \"No, I don't think there's systemic racism.\"\n\nCuriously, the people who recite this trope rarely reflect on the second half of the expression: \"A few bad apples spoil the bunch. \" But let's set that aside.\n\nNo matter how you look at it, the American criminal justice system is riddled with biases. As the Washington Post's Radley Balko cataloged, we know that black people are nearly twice as likely to be pulled over and more likely to be searched once they're stopped even though they're less likely to have contraband; and that unarmed black people are more than three times as likely to be shot by police as unarmed whites.\n\nSo how do we explain this reality?\n\nPaul Butler is a law professor at Georgetown, a former federal prosecutor, and the author of the 2017 book Chokehold: Policing Black Men . His work has long focused on the fundamentals of America's criminal justice system and why they keep reproducing the same outcomes for black Americans. I talked to him about how we got here, why he thinks the criminal justice system is working exactly as designed, and why the \"few bad apples\" argument is complete bullshit.\n\nA lightly edited transcript of our conversation follows.\n\nI'd like this conversation to speak as much as possible to people like me - a white guy who grew up in a small town in the South - who has no experience with any of this, whose life is untouched by this kind of threat, who may not understand why anyone would treat cops like an occupying force and is therefore skeptical of the sort of arguments you're making.\n\nWhat do you say to that person?\n\nI'm glad you started there. I saw a compelling example of this on live TV last Saturday that helps to make the point. MSNBC's Ali Velshi was reporting live from the protest in Minneapolis, and as he was reporting, he said, \"They're starting to shoot.\" The cops were starting to fire rubber bullets. And the protesters were totally nonviolent. They weren't doing anything provocative, and the police just opened fire. And we see it all live on TV.\n\nAs he's running away, Velshi's shot in the leg, but he just keeps reporting. Later, after he's retreated, he sees the cops advancing again and he looks terrified in a way he hadn't before. That's the impact of violent policing on African Americans - and black men disproportionately bear the cost of that.\n\nThe point of policing the hood is to demonstrate that the police officer dominates. That he's the man, regardless of gender, that the officer is the boss, and that everybody else is subordinate. The way that that message is communicated is with fear. Fear for your physical safety. I called this \"torture lite\" in my book Chokehold, and some people thought that that was extreme. But I was actually thinking about a specific thing in international human rights law, and a specific evolution of torture, from the horrible pulling out of your fingernails to the way it works now - which is to make people feel both humiliated and terrified that anything could happen to them at any moment.\n\nA kind of psychological warfare -\n\nExactly. This attitude is present in a lot of police officers who work in communities of color, and it defines the dynamic between them and the people they're supposed to be serving. It impacts all of us. I went to a fancy college and law school; I have a good job and drive a nice car. But every time there's a police car behind me, my heart starts beating quickly. Every black man I know has the same story. Because you just never know.\n\n\"I don't think those police officers saw Mr. Floyd as human. And I'm not sure that's a problem that can be solved by a reform.\"\n\nThat is such a wildly different dynamic than most white people have experienced. And for those people, many of them at least, there's a reflexive dismissal of it. They'll read this as hyperbole or anecdotal and in that sense refuse to grapple with the fundamental claim about the role law enforcement plays in black communities.\n\nLet's think about the Floyd case. Before we get to the killing, let's think about the arrest. The store owner called the police and said that someone had tried to pass a fake $20 bill. The police respond, and what they do is virtually impossible to imagine happening to a white person. What they do is to approach Mr. Floyd's car like he's a violent thug. They order Mr. Floyd and the passengers to exit the car. One officer has his hand on his gun. They put Mr. Floyd in handcuffs. When he falls to the ground, they leave him on the ground in handcuffs, and then, as the whole world knows, they hold him down by his back and knee and legs for 10 minutes until he dies. I just can't imagine that happening to a white person over a $20 bill.\n\nBlack and brown people experience very different treatment from the police than white people do, and it's so endemic that the police just can't help themselves. I thought the most compelling example of that was how differently the CNN reporters were treated in Minneapolis. A white CNN reporter is basically on the same ground, doing the same thing - while cops roll up on the black reporter and arrest him , cops go to the white reporter and say, \"We'd like you to move, please,\" and he says, \"Okay.\" But he doesn't move as far as they would like and they say, \"Could you please move some more?\" And he says, \"Sure.\"\n\nThe thing that's so revealing about that is that it all happens on national television, at a rally about excessive force and racist policing. I could just imagine, at the roll call that morning for the officers, when they're getting their instructions from the sergeant, the sergeant says, \"Okay, guys, we know that we're guarding this rally about police brutality and discriminatory enforcement; let's not be racist, don't be racist, it's really important that we not be racist today.\" And they still can't help themselves.\n\nYou say we don't merely have two systems of justice, one for white people and one for black and brown people, but instead we have \"opposite\" systems of justice. And the system for black and brown people isn't broken - it's working exactly as designed. What does that mean?\n\nPart of the evidence that the system was designed this way, and one of the reasons it recurs over and over again, is because a lot of the conduct that people of color complain about is totally legal. So I don't think the case against the officers in the Floyd case is a slam-dunk by any means. The defense will be that their use of force was reasonable. And they have a case to make. They don't have a great case, given that Mr. Floyd was handcuffed, but what they will say is that he was resisting arrest and they used reasonable force to subdue him. And obviously there comes a point where the reasonableness of that force is extinguished by the fact that his body is lying limp and motionless on the ground. But up until then, I think they have an argument that what they were doing was legal.\n\nOutside of that case, in theory, the power that police have is unreal. I have a police officer buddy who comes and visits my criminal law class, and to demonstrate how much power he has, he invites my students to go on a ride-along in his car, to see what it's like to patrol the streets of DC. He plays a game with them called Pick That Car. He tells the student, \"Pick any car that you want, and I'll stop it.\" So the student will say, \"How about that white Camry over there.\"\n\nHe's a good cop. He waits until he has a legal reason. But he says that he could follow any car, and after five minutes or three blocks, the driver will commit some traffic infraction, and then under the law he has the power to stop the car, to order the driver and the passengers to get out of the car. If he has reasonable suspicion that they might be armed or dangerous, he could touch their bodies, he can frisk them, he can ask to search their car. And it's totally legal. That's an example of the extraordinary power that police have.\n\nAnd that extraordinary power, that constitutional power, is used more aggressively against black and brown men than against white soccer moms.\n\n\"I went to a fancy college and law school; I have a good job and drive a nice car. But every time there's a police car behind me my heart starts beating quickly.\"\n\nIn a way, that gets to the heart of this. Because the difference here is how the same laws are applied differently to different people. We're not talking about different rules for different people formally codified into law. We're talking about the enormous discretion cops have and how, for too many reasons to count, they apply it unevenly.\n\nThat's exactly right. I know it sounds kind of conspiratorial when I say it's designed that way, but one reason I think that is because it happens so often and it's so predictable. And in these kinds of cases, advocates tell the Supreme Court that if you give the police this kind of power, they're going to use it unfairly against people of color. And we have tons of data backing that up. And the Court either discounts that concern or says, \"There's nothing that we can do about it.\"\n\nSo everybody knows how the police will use this power, and true enough, they do. That's why I think that the Ferguson report , which is the report that the US Department of Justice wrote after the uprising in Ferguson, and after Michael Brown was killed, I think that's one of the defining artifacts of our time.\n\nWhy?\n\nA hundred years from now, when people want to know what it was like to be alive in 2020, the Ferguson report is one of the things they'll look at. It's this amazing synthesis of data and stories. The data includes the fact that every single time the police used a dog in Ferguson, they used it against a black person.\n\nCan I give you just one quick story from the report to show you why I think it's so revealing?\n\nPlease.\n\nSo there's one story in there in which a woman calls the police because her boyfriend's beating her up. By the time the police get there, he's gone. The police look around the apartment and they say, \"Does he live here?\" And she says, \"Yes, he does.\" The police say, \"You're under arrest for occupancy permit violation, because his name isn't on the lease.\" When that happened to another woman in Ferguson, she said she would never call the police again, she didn't care if she was being killed. Again, this is how the police do black people and brown people. They don't treat white people like this, certainly not as systematically as they do black and brown people.\n\nI want to ask you about this argument that the policing problem can be reduced to \"a few bad apples.\" Your book is largely about this, and I'd like to know why you think it's bullshit.\n\nFor one, it's insulting to police officers. I don't think police officers are any more racist than law professors or doctors or anybody else. In fact, I think that some people go into that work because they want to be warriors, and that's not constructive, so when we think about change, we need to think about guardianship as a model, not war.\n\nBut I think a lot of people go into the work because they really want to help communities, and they really want to make a difference, and this belief is based on my experience as a prosecutor working with police officers of all backgrounds and of all races. So I don't think that police officers are especially racist. But I do think we give them tools and authority in a context that leads them to deploy it unjustly against people of color.\n\nThe real question we need to answer isn't, \"Why are racist cops doing racist things?\" (that question answers itself) but rather how is it that non-racist cops, or cops who set out with good intentions, succumb to perverse incentives and end up enforcing inequalities they themselves would probably reject in the abstract.\n\nRight, and I think it's about the workplace culture. I tell the story that after I graduated from law school, I worked for a law firm for a couple of years, and then I decided I wanted to be a prosecutor. So I was lucky enough to get a job with the Department of Justice, where they have drug tests. I had been smoking weed recreationally before I joined the Justice Department. When I joined the Justice Department, because I didn't have any trial experience, they sent me to the local prosecutor's office in DC to learn how to try a case. You start out doing low-level cases, including, at that time, marijuana possession and marijuana distribution. I stopped smoking weed just because I knew that there were drug tests, and I didn't want to lose my job. But I prosecuted people for smoking weed. So I understand workplace incentives, and none of us are immune to it.\n\nThe culture of law enforcement is very much a paramilitary culture. You're part of a team and you have to have each other's back. Part of the reason your question is so important is that we're not just talking about white cops, we're also talking about black cops. Police officers of color get caught up in the same loops. In hip-hop, there's a lot of interest in black police officers, and the message you often hear is that black officers are actually worse than white officers, because they want to show off for the white cops.\n\nSo the problem is about culture, and it runs much deeper than a few racists here and there.\n\n\"I don't think police officers are any more racist than law professors or doctors or anybody else\"\n\nIf the problem were merely racist cops, the solution would be easy: screen for racists and remove them. But if the real problem isn't bad cops or bad policing so much as a culture built on a racial hierarchy that law enforcement has historically protected and reinforced, then it's hard to see a path forward.\n\nIt's a huge problem and I don't know how to solve it, but what I do know is how to make a difference in individual cases in a way that will prevent people from getting killed or beat up, or having the law selectively applied to them. I know that there are reforms that can save lives, and even if they're not going to crush white supremacy, if Sandra Bland and George Floyd can live rather than die, I'm cool with that on the way to transformation.\n\nWhat sort of reforms?\n\nIn Chokehold, I argue that people tend to see the problems between black people and police in four different ways. So really quickly, the first way is that the problem is black men. It's the way that we perform masculinity. If we would just pull up our pants, we wouldn't have to worry about being stopped and frisked. There are quite a lot of people who think that.\n\nThe second framing is that the problem is under-enforcement of law, not over-enforcement. That what the black community needs even more than other communities is law and order. So when police selectively enforce the law in those communities, it's actually a kind of reparations, it's a payback for the time when 911 was a joke. And my friends who are prosecutors and police officers of color, that's what they say. They say, \"Hell yeah, I'm tougher in the hood than I am in the suburbs, because that's my community.\" That's how they think.\n\nThen there's what I'd call a more liberal framing, which focuses on the relationship between black people and cops, like the problem is that they're in a bad marriage and they just need to understand each other. This was very much the approach of the Obama administration, emphasizing the need to bring people together alongside tangible reforms like more body cameras and better training.\n\nThe fourth way of thinking about the problem is the focus on white supremacy. This is the new Jim Crow idea. Here, what people suggest is that if you only work on the police, that's treating the symptom. But the disease will metastasize. So in this telling, it started with slavery, went to the old Jim Crow, and now it's the new Jim Crow, enforced via a racially biased criminal justice system. And so the only way things will truly get better is to crush white supremacy.\n\nI'm sympathetic to the new Jim Crow point of view, but at the same time, we can save lives in other ways before we crush white supremacy. That's why I think the third framing through a liberal lens remains very useful, even if at the end of the day it's not going to create the transformation we need, it's worth it, if it will save lives.\n\nSo in the meantime, we can make a difference by teaching cops to intervene when their peers are crossing the line, by teaching them how to deescalate, by changing our entire approach to nonviolent criminal arrests. These things are not going to bring the revolution, but they can save lives.\n\nDo you think it's possible for us to break this cycle?\n\nTo me, that's almost a question about faith. About your belief in humanity. Martin Luther King says the arc of the moral universe bends toward justice. I hope that's right. One of the most poignant moments of that horrific video [of Floyd's death] is there's a bystander who says to the cop, \"Bro, he's human.\" The truth is that I don't think those police officers saw Mr. Floyd as human. And I'm not sure that's a problem that can be solved by a reform.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA world with far less policing is possible. Here's what experts think that world could look like.\n\nby Roge Karma\n\nOn the night of Friday, June 12, a police officer shot and killed Rayshard Brooks , a 27-year-old Black man, outside an Atlanta Wendy's drive-through. Atlanta police officers were called to the scene after receiving a complaint that Brooks was sleeping in his vehicle, which was blocking the drive-through and forcing other cars to drive around it.\n\nVideo evidence shows the interaction starts out calm. Brooks repeatedly asks to leave his car parked and walk to his sister's home, which he says is nearby. But the officer insists he take a field sobriety test, revealing that Brooks had a blood alcohol level slightly above the legal limit. The officer attempts to handcuff Brooks, Brooks resists, and a physical struggle ensues. Brooks grabs the officer's Taser, begins running away, and turns to fire it. Seconds later he is lying on the ground motionless with three bullets inside him.\n\nThis was not the first time a Black man was killed in a police interaction that began with falling asleep in a parked car. It wasn't even the first time in recent weeks. At 5:30 am on Memorial Day - the same day of George Floyd's killing - Dion Johnson was sleeping in his car on the side of a north Phoenix highway when he was approached by an Arizona state trooper who planned to arrest Johnson for \" suspicion of driving impaired .\" According to the officer's account, Johnson resisted arrest and reached for the officer's gun. The officer shot and killed Johnson in self-defense.\n\nBoth cases raise the same basic question: Why were weapons-carrying agents of the state the chosen response to men sleeping in their cars? The same can be asked about a dispute over a (possibly) counterfeit $20 bill . A mistaken drug bust . A traffic citation . A man selling untaxed cigarettes . None of these infractions began with violence; yet, each of them ended in a Black man or woman killed at the hands of armed police. And stories abound of white , Native American , Latino , and Asian American civilians being killed by police in similar situations.\n\nThis dynamic reflects the structure of policing in the US. Here, the same officers who write accident reports and respond to noise complaints also have the capacity to shoot and kill. That means a single police officer has a monopoly over the entire force continuum, from casually talking to aggressively handcuffing to shooting and killing. A situation can escalate from calm conversation to the use of deadly force in a matter of seconds, entirely at their discretion. If whoever had responded to the call had not been carrying tasers and firearms, Brooks would be alive today.\n\nMany European countries view the use of lethal force as a narrow specialization and structure their police forces accordingly. \"If this happened in the UK, the first person to approach Brooks would have been a community support officer,\" says Colin Rogers, a former UK police inspector turned criminologist at the University of South Wales. \"They certainly wouldn't have been armed.\" And even if that interaction went poorly, the officer's backup would have been an officer armed with only a baton and handcuffs, not a gun.\n\nIn 2015, a Guardian investigation found that British police shot dead fewer people (55) in 24 years in England and Wales than American police killed in the first 24 days of 2015 in the US. That disparity can only partly be explained by differences in armed encounters: American police still shot and killed 161 unarmed people in 2015 alone . That's partly because of uniquely high levels of gun ownership in America, which leaves police officers in a constant state of hypervigilance.\n\nIt's also because in the UK, the state officials who hold a vast majority of public safety responsibilities - from patrolling the streets to responding to nonviolent crimes - do not carry firearms. Only about 10 percent of British police carry guns, and they mostly operate on teams of highly trained specialists whose full-time responsibility is to answer calls of the highest possible threat level, like an active shooter or terrorist attack.\n\nWhat if we decided to do the same? What if we decided to make traditional policing - defined by the capacity to deploy deadly force - a narrow specialization, as many calling to defund the police advocate? What would that world look like? What would police no longer do and who would take their place?\n\n\"It is easy for me to imagine a world in which Rayshard Brooks gets driven home that night instead of shot to death,\" says Georgetown Law professor Christy E. Lopez. \"The question I have is whether we have the will and commitment to create a public safety system that makes that world a reality.\"\n\nOver the past few weeks, I've spoken with more than a dozen sociologists, criminologists, policing experts, nonprofit leaders, and legal scholars to better understand the range of alternatives that exist to our current one-size-fits-all model of police response - and how we could design those alternatives to meet unique challenges like the overwhelming presence of firearms , intertwined histories of racism and policing , and relatively high rates of violent crime in the US. Here are four ideas they offered.\n\nThe vast majority of police-civilian interactions happen on the road. According to a 2015 Department of Justice report , of the 50 million Americans who came into contact with the police that year, 25 million were pulled over in a car they were driving or were a passenger in (Black Americans were the most likely to be pulled over). Another 8 million were involved in a car accident. And many of the 9 million who called the police to report non-crimes were reporting traffic accidents.\n\nThere is no justifiable reason why armed police officers should be in charge of road safety. Police officers are not hired for a particular talent in highway navigation, accident report taking, or citation writing. And deploying armed officers to perform such routine tasks introduces the risk of unnecessary lethal force into many millions of encounters every year. The police killing of Philando Castile in 2016 was one instance (there are plenty of others ) of a routine traffic stop going horribly wrong - and it simply wouldn't have happened if the officer hadn't been carrying a gun. Sandra Bland's arrest and subsequent suicide following a failure to signal a lane change was another.\n\nIt isn't difficult to imagine handing over most traffic patrol duties to specialized employees - we already do the same for plenty of other public safety roles, like restaurant and food inspection. Highways England in the UK employs unarmed traffic officers who drive around in distinct vehicles, and many other of the country's traffic duties are left up to \"community support officers\" who can give out citations but are both unarmed and lack arrest power.\n\nSome US cities are even beginning to take steps in this direction, largely because armed police officers are a uniquely expensive way to handle traffic patrol. In 2017, the city of New Orleans endorsed NOPD hiring third-party report-takers for accidents in which there is no injury and no concern about a driver under the influence.\n\nA huge number of calls to the police involve relatively minor interpersonal disputes: disputes over noise levels, trespassing, misbehaving pets, or rowdiness; disputes between spouses, family members, roommates, or neighbors.\n\nWithout a mediator present, it is possible that what starts out as a minor dispute can escalate to violence. But there is no particular reason the job of mediation has to be assigned to armed police officers; if anything, traditional police tend to unnecessarily escalate these situations, resulting in arrests or worse.\n\nThat's why a number of countries such as the UK, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and South Africa have created a distinct class of what can be broadly called \" community safety professionals .\" They are unarmed, lack most formal policing powers, and perform responsibilities like youth outreach, conflict mediation, community patrol, and addressing low-level crime and disorder. Preliminary results of their impact on crime and community well-being have been promising.\n\n\"The idea was for community support officers [the UK's version of this role] to act as a bridge between communities and police officers,\" says Rogers. \"Because we are unarmed, we police with and through communities, not at them.\"\n\nA similar approach has been pioneered by many \"street outreach\" programs in the US like Cure Violence and Advance Peace , which employ \"violence interrupters\" and \"peacemakers\" from within local communities to mediate conflicts before they escalate to the level of violence. Scholarly evaluations of these efforts have shown that non-police mediation can be quite successful when executed properly.\n\n\"If someone is upset or thinking about shooting, the violence interrupters are almost always able to cool that person down and stop them from acting,\" says Cure Violence founder Gary Slutkin. \"The goal is to contain things before they get to the police. If nothing has happened yet, it's none of the police's business.\"\n\nI asked A.T. Mitchell, a former \"violence interrupter\" who now runs Cure Violence's ManUp! program in New York, what he thought of the dispute between George Floyd and the store clerk who claimed he was using a counterfeit $20 bill.\n\n\"What that situation needed was someone to resolve a conflict,\" he told me. \"Did [Floyd] owe an apology? Did he even know what was happening? We don't know. But I'll tell you something: If we got that call, we would've been able to step in between, and that brother would still be here today.\"\n\nOne could imagine cities hiring cadres of \"community mediators\" as employees of the local public health department who are trained in conflict resolution, applied psychology, and relationship management. Like their European counterparts, these mediators would be completely unarmed, lack formal policing powers, and wear uniforms distinct from traditional officers. They could spend their quiet hours building relationships with local community members and maintaining a presence in schools, neighborhoods, and highly trafficked public spaces.\n\nCities could even develop a special 211 or 311 number for concerned neighbors, spouses, or citizens to call when they are witnessing heated exchanges, and could redirect relevant 911 calls to the community mediation unit. If any of these exchanges begin to escalate toward violence, the community mediators could have special silent alert systems (similar to the ones senior citizens use for medical assistance) to call in armed police for backup.\n\n\"Imagine a world where first responders are really good at getting situations calmed down so that people can go on with their lives and nobody ends up being arrested - or worse,\" says Barry Friedman, the director of the Policing Project at New York University. \"In that world, we don't need nearly as many police walking around with guns.\"\n\nOftentimes, a police officer's role bleeds over from mediation into something that resembles social work , usually involving populations like those who are homeless, intoxicated, substance abusers, or suffering from mental illness.\n\nThe results can be disastrous. About half of prison inmates were diagnosed with a mental illness. Around a quarter of fatal encounters with law enforcement involve someone with a mental health condition (and those numbers are possibly severe undercounts ). A massively disproportionate number of police calls and arrests in cities across the country involve homeless populations. In Portland, Oregon, the city's homeless population made up 52 percent of the city's arrests in 2017 even though they comprise less than 3 percent of Portland's population.\n\n\"You wouldn't try to build a house with just a jackhammer,\" says Zachary Norris, director of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights and author of We Keep Us Safe . \"But that's what we're doing when we task police officers with dealing with public health issues like substance abuse, homelessness, and mental illness.\"\n\n\"You wouldn't try to build a house with just a jackhammer. But that's what we're doing when we task police officers with dealing with public health issues.\"\n\nOne of the most promising alternatives to a police-centric model of social work is a program called Cahoots , a collaboration between local police and a community service called the White Bird Clinic that operates in Eugene and Springfield, Oregon. In these cities, police officers aren't dispatched to handle every single 911 call. Instead, about 20 percent of calls - often those involving the homeless, addicted, intoxicated, or mentally ill - are routed to a separate team of specialists extensively trained in mental health counseling, social work, and crisis deescalation.\n\nCahoots responders don't brandish weapons of any kind. They dress in black sweatshirts, listen to their police radios via earbuds, and purposefully speak in calm tones with inviting body language. Their role is closer to that of an EMT for social issues than a traditional police officer: They assess the situation, assist the individual as best they can, and then direct that individual to a higher level of care or service if needed. If the situation escalates, they can also call police in for backup, but that's rare. In 2019, Cahoots received around 24,000 calls and had to call in police backup less than 1 percent of the time.\n\n\"In 30 years, we've never had a serious injury or a death that our team was responsible for,\" Ebony Morgan, a Cahoots crisis worker, told NPR . \"I think that's important.\"\n\nTo top it off, Cahoots saves the Eugene and Springfield police departments around $15 million a year , according to clinic coordinator Ben Brubaker, by taking care of incidents that would otherwise have to be handled by law enforcement or emergency rooms, both of which are far more costly solutions.\n\nThe Cahoots model can easily be scaled to other locations. And lawmakers in cities across the country, including San Francisco , Oakland , and Minneapolis , are considering doing just that.\n\nCities could also think about building on and improving that model. The existing program's biggest limit is the fact that its jurisdiction is only in decidedly \"non-criminal\" calls. That means ordinary police officers may very well be sent to deal with situations that Cahoots crisis workers are far better trained to handle.\n\nThere are two possible remedies here. One is the decriminalization of issues like addiction and homelessness. \"Right now, police response to homelessness is driven by city laws criminalizing it,\" says Maria Foscarinis, executive director of the National Law Center on Homelessness & Poverty. \"Typically, calls about homeless people are about issues like sleeping or begging that should not be addressed by law enforcement.\" Changing laws that criminalize such behavior can broaden the range of activities that a mobile crisis response unit like Cahoots is able to address.\n\nAnother idea is to deploy hybrid response units consisting of both police officers and mobile crisis responders to situations that would normally fall outside of the Cahoots purview. For instance, police might be called to the scene to break up a violent fight. But it is easy to imagine a Cahoots team entering the situation first and attempting to defuse it while police officers wait around the block, out of sight, to be called in only if deemed necessary.\n\n\"I'm really excited about imagining an entirely different model of first responders,\" says Friedman. \"What that means is training people in a very different way, dispatching them in a different way, and giving them a different reward system than we've given cops.\"\n\nThose first three ideas involve solutions that local government officials could incorporate fairly easily into their existing policing models. But what if we changed the model completely? What if, instead of policing at communities, we gave them the resources to police themselves?\n\nA little over 20 years ago, the Australian government did just that.\n\nThe history of the indigenous community in Australia is thick with repression, brutality, and violence at the hands of the state. Descriptions of Indigenous-police relationships read as though they could be pulled straight from the contemporary African American experience in the United States (not to mention the US native communities). As Harry Blagg, a criminologist at Charles Darwin University in Australia, writes :\n\nHistorically, policing was an instrument for controlling, limiting, denying or supervising Indigenous egress into the white domain. According to criminologists, this has left a legacy of over-policing of Indigenous people in the public realm - where they may constitute a threat to public order - and under-policing (underservicing might be a better term) of Indigenous people within their own communities.\n\nThis began to change in the 1990s when a government commission found that Indigenous people were highly overrepresented in prisons and jails as a result of systemic bias. The authors concluded that the only way to end this injustice was to entirely reimagine the way Australians interact with the criminal justice system.\n\nOne recommendation they made was for the government to fund local forms of community self-policing, like the Julalikari Night Patrol in northern Australia. The idea behind the night patrols was simple: to enhance public safety by establishing a buffer between Indigenous people and police forces. This is how Princeton sociologist Patrick Sharkey described his visit to the Nyoongar patrol in Perth, Australia, in his 2018 book Uneasy Peace: The Great Crime Decline, the Renewal of City Life, and the Next War on Violence :\n\nI joined a team led by Annie and Rachel, two extraordinary women who were remarkable to watch in action. I looked on as they tried to calm a shirtless man who was drunk and belligerent in front of a crowded bar. I saw them talk to a man who looked unwell, lying on a bench in the middle of a city plaza, and stay with him as the emergency medical technician asked him questions and eventually took him to get treatment. ...\n\nThe challenges that emerge over the course of a shift change on a nightly basis, but the overarching goal of the patrol teams is to maintain a presence in the public spaces where young people hang out, to search for Aboriginal people who look as if they could use some help, and to give anyone who is causing trouble the chance to cool off or to go home before the police get involved. At times the patrol team's intervention comes with a stern warning, but usually it comes with a warm smile.\n\nWhen reading that description, it's hard not to think about how differently things would have gone for Rayshard Brooks or Dion Johnson if members of this local night patrol had been on duty. Maybe they drive Brooks to his sister's house to spend the night. Maybe they take Johnson to a local shelter to sober up with a warm breakfast. The police are never called.\n\nToday, hundreds of these night patrols have been established in Indigenous communities across Australia, many of them government-funded. The patrols lack formal policing powers, but their legitimacy comes from the fact that they are established by community councils, endorsed by elders, utilize local knowledge, and work within the boundaries of Indigenous law and culture.\n\nBy many indicators, the patrols have been extremely successful. \"Relationships between night patrols and police [are] generally excellent these days,\" Blagg says. \"The police can't manage without them.\" Police don't have a full-time presence in most communities with night patrols. They will step in to calm things down or make an arrest, but typically only when contacted by the local patrol. One study found that patrols in three areas were able to reduce arrests by around 30 percent.\n\n\"That was one of the most inspiring nights of my life,\" Sharkey told me of his visit to the Nyoongar patrol. \"It gave me a vision of what public safety can look like if it is driven by people acting out of genuine concern for their communities.\"\n\nA community-based approach to public safety has also been pioneered in some of America's most violent neighborhoods by many of the \"street outreach\" programs that I mentioned above, the largest and most rigorously evaluated of which is Cure Violence Global .\n\nLike the Indigenous Australian night patrollers, Cure Violence's \"violence interrupters\" are locals with strong community ties, many of whom have done prison time themselves. Their job is to build relationships throughout the community such that they are aware of ongoing disputes, interpersonal tensions, and potential fights before they escalate to the level of either civilian violence or police intervention.\n\n\"We have a level of trust with the community that the police will never have,\" says Mitchell. \"That's because we only hire those who are indigenous to the neighborhood. Information gets around to us long before it ever gets to the police.\"\n\nThe role of violence interrupters goes beyond just on-the-spot mediation. They provide mentorship and economic opportunities to individuals who are considered \"at risk\" of committing violence. In the aftermath of violent shootings, they mobilize the family and friends of victims and respected community leaders to prevent retaliation. And in quiet times, they work to spread social norms of nonviolence.\n\nCure Violence programs have been implemented in 25 US cities, often in neighborhoods that are experiencing high levels of gun violence. And multiple independent analyses of programs in places like New York, Chicago, and Baltimore have shown that the model has the potential to bring about major reductions in violent crime and gun violence at a fraction of what it would cost police forces.\n\nOne option, then, is for local lawmakers to simply scale up the Cure Violence model from one or two neighborhoods to an entire borough or city. Mayor Bill de Blasio recently announced he would be investing an extra $10 million to expand the program to the 20 New York City precincts with the most gun violence.\n\n\"The time is more than right for a large investment in Cure Violence,\" says Caterina Roman, a sociologist at Temple University who has conducted research on the organization's approach. She points out that while the organization has never been tested at the scale that is now demanded, it is also one of the few models that has been shown to successfully make highly violent communities a lot less violent without using the tools of arrest, force, and incarceration.\n\nAnother option is for local lawmakers in the US to experiment with community approaches to policing. Sharkey believes city officials should bring together local civic organizations, community leaders, and residents to form a new community entity tasked with planning a new model for public safety in a predefined number of neighborhoods.\n\nThe group would receive funding equivalent to whatever the police department in that jurisdiction would receive. They would be allowed to use the funds however they choose. They would draw up plans for their community's relationship to the local police department, which will likely serve in some sort of backup capacity in case things escalate. Then, they would be given a minimum of 10 years to run the experiment, with rigorous monitoring and evaluation along the way.\n\n\"Communities themselves should be the ones deciding on these issues,\" says Tracie L. Keesee, a former police officer and the co-founder of the Center for Policing Equity. \"Who do you think should provide services? Who should be in charge of public safety? These questions should be put to the community.\"\n\nThere's no guarantee that any of these suggestions will succeed across the board. When it comes to policing alternatives, even the best existing models haven't been attempted at scale, and there's no telling how different communities will respond to them. To implement any idea on this list would mean venturing into relatively uncharted territory.\n\nThat means there will be failures. Things will go wrong. Systems will break down. Programs will fall apart. Violence may temporarily increase in some places. Occasionally, a violence interrupter or mobile crisis worker will be seriously injured or killed.\n\nBut our current system already represents a kind of profound failure. We live in a country that has built the largest system of human incarceration on earth, where agents of the state kill unarmed members of the communities they are supposed to protect and terrorize those who are still alive. Where peaceful protesters are beaten in the streets.\n\nThe question, then, isn't whether we are willing to live with failure; communities across the country already live with failure every single day. That failure, at least in part, stems from the fact that police officers in the United States are tasked with responsibilities - from traffic patrol to mediation to crisis response - that amplify the risk of unnecessary violence.\n\nThere are plenty of models out there of how we could transfer these responsibilities to non-police personnel and, in doing so, make the use of lethal force far rarer. The question is: Are we willing to give them a try?\n\nYou've read 1 article in the last month\n\nHere at Vox, we're unwavering in our commitment to covering the issues that matter most to you - threats to democracy, immigration, reproductive rights, the environment, and the rising polarization across this country.\n\nOur mission is to provide clear, accessible journalism that empowers you to stay informed and engaged in shaping our world.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThree years after demands for police reform, police are solving fewer crimes. What happened?\n\nby Hady Mawajdeh\n\nIn 2020, after the police-involved killings of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, millions of Americans took to the streets for months to demand police reform. Almost three and a half years later, a report of national crime data, compiled and published by the Federal Bureau of Investigation as part of the Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) Program , indicates that police departments nationwide have changed - for the worse. The data says cops are solving fewer crimes today than they did then.\n\n\"The UCR is sort of the best source of crime data that's released each year,\" crime data analyst Jeff Asher tells Vox. \"It provides a trove of information on what's happening nationally.\"\n\nAsher says UCR data tells us things like whether murder and other violent crime rates are down; the level of staffing in law enforcement; and the percentage of crimes solved (also known as clearance rates).\n\n\"The first thing I look at is the murder clearance rate,\" Asher says. \"And the murder clearance rate fell from above 60 percent in 2019 to just 52 percent in 2022.\"\n\nAsher tells Vox's daily news podcast, Today, Explained , that murder clearance rates aren't the only figure that fell: \"It was really across the board to some of the lowest levels ever reported for every crime.\"\n\nAccording to Asher's analysis of the UCR data, \"For all violent crimes, the clearance rate went from almost 46 percent in 2019 to 36.7 percent in 2022. The same thing happened with property crimes. Property crime went from a 17 percent clearance rate to a 12 percent clearance rate from 2019 to 2022. And so you look at crime by crime, and with the exception of burglary, every crime has seen really a nosedive in the last three or four years.\"\n\nSo why are fewer crimes being solved by police departments? Asher says it's harder to explain the trend than to describe it. But he thinks the data may offer some insights. \"There was a substantial decline in the summer of 2020,\" he says. \"We can relate the drop in clearance rates to everything that's happened in American criminal justice , in policing, in attitudes toward police since the murder of George Floyd in May of 2020.\"\n\nAsher also points out that 2020 began an exodus of officers leaving law enforcement. \"The majority of big cities had fewer officers in 2022 than they did in 2019,\" Asher says. \"If you have fewer officers, you have fewer resources to dedicate to solving crime, which means lower clearance rates. And we do have lots of research that shows that.\"\n\nNoel King, host of Today, Explained , wanted to know what law enforcement thought about Asher's analysis of the FBI's report. How are officers responding to the suggestion that they're not doing their jobs as well as they once were? So she talked with Dallas Police Chief Edgardo \"Eddie\" Garcia, who is also president of the Major Cities Chiefs Association.\n\nA partial transcript of their conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows. Listen to the full conversation wherever you find podcasts.\n\nChief Garcia, we're chatting today because of an annual FBI report that comes out in the fall. One of the data points in that report has to do with the solve rates for violent crimes. And this year, what the data suggests is that that solve rate fell from about 46 percent in 2019 to about 36.7 percent in 2022, meaning fewer violent crimes are being solved. What do you think is happening here? What do you think is causing this drop?\n\nI mean, the one thing that we have to say is that solving a violent crime is not an easy task. And as departments face staffing shortages now, I know that there are other chiefs [across the nation], as am I, that are very reticent to move bodies out of patrol, as that's the number one priority of any department. So you have amazing detectives doing an amazing job that are working a lot. They are overworked in some areas. As departments face staffing shortages, we always look at that patrol, there's no question about it. But, you know, most of us also have a lot of holes to fill in our detective bureaus. And so that is one of the major issues. I believe that if some agencies are seeing drops in their solve rates, I believe we could start there.\n\nWhy do you think you're having staffing problems, personnel shortages?\n\nWhat is often not talked about is really in these last few years, beginning in 2020, honorable police officers have not felt supported. They have not felt supported by their community at times. They haven't felt supported by their administration at times, and they haven't felt supported by their city governments. There's probably not another profession of honorable men and women, and I say honorable because I'm not going to sit here and tell you that every police officer deserves to wear this uniform. They do not. But most of our men and women that are working in this profession are honorable men and women. And I don't care what field you go into, if you don't feel supported, if people don't honor the work that you do and sacrifice in your life every day, you know, I don't know if there are many other professions that have had a defund movement. [And] that's going to have an impact on honorable men and women joining any profession, much less law enforcement. That's important.\n\nWhat do you hear specifically from officers? I imagine you sit and you talk to them and you're alluding to a couple of things. Some real issues have arisen since 2020. The nation goes through an uprising. We see calls to abolish the police altogether. We see slogans like ACAB . When you sit with officers and they tell you it's harder, what are the specifics? What are they talking about?\n\nI started 32 years ago. And I'll tell you what, being a police officer 32 years ago is different than it is today. There's a lot more on officers' plates, quite frankly. Officers are asked to do too much, to deal with a lot of the social ills that are impacting crime. And officers want to get compensated fairly. They feel they're overworked, oftentimes. And so those are some of the issues that I hear.\n\nBut, you know, one of the disconnects that I really believe is occurring now, and I say this because I'm not a stay-in-the-office chief, but a lot of this division is not being driven by neighborhoods. There's not a neighborhood in the city of Dallas - and I can speak for my other colleagues as well, regardless of language spoken, racial makeup, or economic status - that I have ever heard the words, \"We want to see less of you.\" It never happens.\n\nAnd in fact, oftentimes it's our communities of color that plead with me for more officers. I have invited people to come to community meetings with me where they will hear my community let me have it if they are not seeing patrol officers and presence in their neighborhood. And oftentimes it's our most vulnerable communities, and it's not often, but sometimes they'll accuse police departments of providing more police services to other, more affluent areas than the areas of need. And so there's a real big disconnect. And I think people need to get out of their offices and go into neighborhood meetings with police chiefs to hear the same information that I hear at every community meeting that I go to.\n\nI think the reason that FBI data struck a chord, Chief Garcia, is that there is a sense in this country, in parts of this country, that police have stopped doing their jobs. Even if you understand why, you kind of feel like the police are doing less now, if morale is low, that certainly can happen. Do you think there's any truth to the sentiment that police are pulling back because they feel overworked, they feel disrespected? And they feel like doing this job is just going to get you in trouble? I mean, what are you hearing?\n\nYou hit the nail on the head. That is absolutely an issue. They want to ensure that when chaos ensues, they're going to be judged fairly. And one of the dynamics, if the pendulum swings too far, oftentimes officers will feel, is this worth it? Listen, I'll tell you this, proactive policing is absolutely necessary. I can make an officer answer a 911 call for service, that I can do, but I can't make officers be proactive. And the only reason honorable men and women will be proactive is if they feel supported. So when officers don't feel supported, when they don't have morale, what it causes oftentimes is a community to go to their corner, the police go to their corner, and yet there's no one in the middle keeping us safe.\n\nAnd those are things that come not just from my officers or other people that I've spoken to, but from community members themselves. And so certainly that exists. You know, we have a crime plan here in the city of Dallas and in our offices. I go around the country and I talk to individuals about what we're trying to do differently in Dallas with the crime plan. The first thing that I say to people is, \"Please do not screw up a perfectly good crime plan [by not having] your finger on the pulse.\" [If] your men and women don't feel supported, if they don't feel they're going to be treated fairly once chaos ensues, there's no crime plan that's going to work. So your point is 100 percent valid. And that's something that we need to work hard on.\n\nWhat do you think it's going to take to turn this around?\n\nIt takes strong leadership. It takes strong support from city government. I have a very supportive city council, which absolutely is necessary. I have an incredibly supportive city manager. And quite frankly, I have arguably the most supportive mayor of public safety I think there is in the country. And it starts with that. It starts with great community trust and great community understanding. We have to build the department. We can't lose sight of the fact that we need to grow. Nothing will ever amount to having a human being sitting at a desk, sitting in a patrol car, offering that and providing that service. So we need to grow and solve rates will then increase. And to your point, 90 to 100 percent [solve rates] is definitely something we should strive for. But it's not necessarily realistic.\n\nThere are several reasons. Communities don't speak to us. One of the reasons [they don't speak to us] is lack of accountability in the system, in keeping violent criminals in custody. We have witnesses in the city of Dallas that fear for their lives when they come forward, only to see the individual that they came forward to be a witness against - to see them back out on the street does not lend credibility to the system. And it certainly doesn't make them feel safe when they come forward. So we have that to worry about, which is a humongous issue. We need accountability. And that's hugely important. That trust the community has in its police department will have people come forward to speak to us about what's occurring because we can't solve these crimes alone oftentimes. You know, the community is not a monolith. Obviously, we have to get better as professionals. Little question about it. But in my experience, at nearly 32 years and now going into the new year, I'll be in my ninth year as a police chief, whether in California, here in Dallas, our communities have never and still do not want us to go away.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow can you punish Trump officials for violating the law, when federal law enforcement is controlled by Trump?\n\nHow America's opioid crisis became a foreign policy issue.\n\nHow we design prisons and where we choose to build them says a lot about what we think of the people on the inside.\n\nJustice Neil Gorsuch's \"ghost guns\" opinion is extremely narrow, but it is correct.\n\nThe justices are likely to give gun companies a win, but they aren't sure how they will do it yet.\n\nRichard Glossip had everything going for him in his Supreme Court hearing.

      "text": "The terrible timing of Let's Be Cops highlights how little fictional cops resemble Ferguson's cops\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby Emily St. James\n\nAny other week, Let's Be Cops would have been just another movie being released. The umpteenth take on the buddy cop formula, greeted by poor reviews . But this week, the timing of Let's Be Cops 's release yesterday seemed terrible.\n\nIt's not just that Let's Be Cops has that title on a week when events in Ferguson, Missouri, bring to mind not low-level police officers trying to bring down petty criminals but, instead, officers armed with military-grade weaponry confronting protesters (or, worse, the unknown officer who sparked the incident by killing the unarmed Michael Brown ). It's that the whole release strategy behind the modern movie machine involves blanketing the world with marketing, which results in the following bit of awful incongruity on Twitter last night, as pointed out by my friend and former A.V. Club colleague Erik Adams.\n\nMight be time to slow your Let's Be Cops promo roll, Fox. #Ferguson pic.twitter.com/HmZBvJE2Kz\n\nThere probably wasn't much 20th Century Fox could do about the film's release. The protests (and overcompensating response to said protests) didn't begin in earnest until Monday night, only a little over 24 hours before Let's Be Cops began midnight screenings. And early box office returns suggest the movie will do fine, if not be a massive hit. It's a comedy, smartly released at a time when there aren't a lot of comedies, and Fox could probably scale back its marketing efforts (which it will almost certainly have to after last night's events in Ferguson) and not lose too many ticket sales because of that counterprogramming.\n\nBut the terrible timing of Let's Be Cops points to a larger problem in the ways Hollywood tells stories about the police: though the film and television industries continue to tell stories about cops by the boatload, those stories have done a horrible job of evolving to reflect the ways the militarization of police forces can create rifts between officers and the people they're ostensibly protecting.\n\nTo be sure, art usually reflects life, and it can take time for these sorts of things to filter their way into the public consciousness. The horrifying night-vision images of Wednesday's confrontation in Ferguson will eventually be reflected somewhere in something Hollywood produces, because they have been so widely spread and commented upon.\n\nBut movies and TV shows about police officers have long been one of the foremost ways Americans process and reflect upon their feelings about both crime and efforts to stop that crime. We might have more stories about cops than ever, but they seem largely unable or unwilling to think about the issues that have reached a crisis point in Ferguson.\n\nIt seems silly today, but at the time of its debut in 1968, The Mod Squad was widely acclaimed for helping make sense out of things like the era's youth culture and the struggles of both women and people of color to find equality in the workplace. Growing anxiety about violent crime in the '70s found its expression in films like The French Connection and Dirty Harry , while the 1980s' Hill Street Blues is one of the smartest, most compassionate TV shows ever made and an earnest plea for understanding and empathy about the plight of American inner cities that also managed to become a top 30 Nielsen hit.\n\nConsider, also, the wave of buddy cop movies that arrived in the '80s, many of which had surprisingly thoughtful attempts to deal with issues like racial relations ( 48 Hours ) or mental health ( Lethal Weapon ) at or near their cores. Those attempts can seem cloying now, but at the time, they were revolutionary. Even ersatz '90s cop show The X-Files reflected that era's growing suspicion of government action, to say nothing of how Law & Order directly confronted the issues of the day.\n\nIf there's a demarcating line here, it's likely the debut of CSI in 2000.\n\nIf there's a demarcating line here, it's likely the debut of CSI in 2000. The CBS series was too big to ignore, meaning that essentially every cop show on TV had to grapple with it in some way. Most shows chose to just copy it. Oddly enough, CSI is, at least metaphorically, about the growing reliance of police departments on advanced technology that cuts said departments off from the people they're meant to protect. Hill Street and its descendants built out whole universes around their central police precincts. In contrast, CSI 's Las Vegas was divided between the police officers and their cool toys and a city full of cardboard cutouts who existed mostly to kill or be killed.\n\nThere's nothing inherently wrong with this approach. Early CSI was a lot of fun, and even in its dotage, the show is capable of a handful of solid episodes per season. There have always been straightforward \"cops vs. robbers\" stories, and they can be good fun. But what happens when this is the only story viewers get told?\n\nThe CSI approach rapidly became essentially the only approach TV had for telling stories about police officers, while movies about cops were increasingly relegated to the sidelines in favor of big budget extravaganzas. And when the primary story being told about police officers is that all of their new toys are fantastic and they're living in a crime wave straight out of viewers' worst nightmares, it sends subconscious assumptions that are easy to filter out into reality.\n\nThere are a couple of major exceptions to the CSI rule, but neither has proved as fruitful as that show in terms of shifting the TV landscape. The Wire is one of the greatest television shows ever made, a beautiful, bruising, realistic look at all sides of the war on drugs and the death of the American city that has immense empathy for every character within its universe. But it's also sui generis , and therefore much too hard for other shows to copy (to say nothing of how it was never a massive hit and teetered on the brink of cancellation for its entire run).\n\nThe Shield was also (inadvertently) the perfect post-September 11 show.\n\nMore successful in this regard was The Shield , which looked at the uneasy relationship Americans often have with cops who break the law but, nonetheless, get results - in both fiction and reality. In some ways, that show was a very delayed response to the Rodney King beating and the culture of corruption within the Los Angeles Police Department that was made glaringly public after that incident. But in other ways, it was also (inadvertently) the perfect post-September 11 show, about how easy it is to cross moral lines when working to fight crime. If Hollywood is ever going to deal with the militarization of police forces, The Shield 's creator, Shawn Ryan, who has also done several solid military series ( The Unit , Last Resort ), would be a good choice to consider those questions.\n\nBut if you're looking for the TV show or movie that directly deals with these issues, it doesn't exist yet. Hollywood can occasionally be a little slow at dealing with social issues, but this creeping militarization has been going on for a while, with little on TV to reflect either the simple fact of its existence or the moral and ethical issues that go along with it. Indeed, the upcoming CBS show Battle Creek is a series that feels unstuck in time, dealing as it does with an underfunded police department that can't get its hands on good equipment. Real world police departments are getting more and more advanced technology; fictional ones are devolving.\n\nTo some degree, that has something to do with the fact that stories about police officers usually have police officers as protagonists. It's much easier to level the playing field between protagonist and antagonist when the hero is a beat cop up against a serial killer than it is when the hero can ride a tank into battle with civilians. Good storytelling demands dramatic stakes, and tanks tend to skew that equation.\n\nConsider, for instance, the Fox summer series Gang Related , which did deal with a militarized police department, but set it up against a gang that also possessed such technology, creating a show where open war essentially raged on the streets of Los Angeles. That might be fun for an action show, but it doesn't reflect the images from Ferguson, where the conflict was decidedly imbalanced.\n\nWe need more TV shows and movies that reflect the world we're seeing in news reports from Ferguson.\n\nWe need more TV shows and movies that reflect the world we're seeing in news reports from Ferguson, and we need ones that do so directly. Fiction helps us process and make sense of the world, and there's room in the images out of Ferguson (and so many other cities) for an earnest and nuanced consideration of what happens when police officers are given military-grade weaponry. That story could be told from the point-of-view of cops or ordinary citizens or even criminals. But it's there to be told, and it too rarely is - certainly not in projects like Let's Be Cops .\n\nAnd if nothing else, it's time for the CSI template to gain that nuance. There are times when technology is helpful in solving crime (especially in a lab setting), but it's not a de facto good for police departments around the country. To suggest otherwise does a disservice to viewers and storytelling.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nGiven the Court's Republican supermajority, this case is unlikely to end well for trans people.\n\nLearn about saving, spending, investing, and more in a monthly personal finance advice column written by Nicole Dieker.\n\nThe latest news, analysis, and explainers coming out of the GOP Iowa caucuses.\n\nThe economy's stacked against us.\n\nA Texas judge issued a national ruling against medication abortion.

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe NBC sitcom was always about cuddly cops. Now, in its final season, it's uneasy about that idea.\n\nby Emily St. James\n\nAt the beginning of its eighth and final season, Brooklyn Nine-Nine , NBC's venerable comedy about New York City cops, has found itself desperately outrunning its own fantasy.\n\nThe series is a largely conventional TV comedy, and as such, it's always peddled an idealistic vision of a workplace where everybody treats each other like family. On some level, that quality is core to the American sitcom's appeal. But from its earliest days, Brooklyn Nine-Nine has been forced to contend with the fact that it is a comedy about cops in a country where police violence is a serious problem that dominates headlines.\n\nCriticism of Brooklyn Nine-Nine creating a cuddlier version of the NYPD dates back to the show's beginning, even if it never seemed particularly loud. In 2013, early in the show's very first season, the New Republic's David Grossman wrote :\n\nNine-Nine is one of this TV season's top new shows, garnering critical raves and strong enough support from its network, Fox, that it's going to follow the Super Bowl this year. Samberg plays Jake Peralta, a detective who can figure out anything except \"how to grow up.\" It's easy to miss a sitcom's conservatism when the jokes are good, but Brooklyn Nine-Nine is dead-set on maintaining the shiny-on-the-surface, gross-on-the-inside legacy of the Bloomberg/Ray Kelly era.\n\nYet Brooklyn Nine-Nine is beloved by many a young progressive for its diversity and its attempts to tell stories about some of the more difficult aspects of American life right now. Its core cast features two Black men and two Latinas, and its characters, both regular and recurring, include several queer people. The show has aired memorable episodes about racial profiling, workplace sexual assault, and coming out as bisexual.\n\nThe tension between its setting and its attempts to prove its left-leaning bona fides has always been the central contradiction that Brooklyn Nine-Nine could never quite resolve. Some shows would thrive amid that contradiction, exploring the messy realities of a cop who wants to be a good person doing the right thing. But Brooklyn Nine-Nine is a network sitcom, and that means the level of mess can only rise so high.\n\nAnd so we come to the final season of the show, produced amid the Covid-19 pandemic and in the aftermath of the summer 2020 protests against police violence spurred by Derek Chauvin's murder of George Floyd . Brooklyn Nine-Nine wants you to know it's been paying attention - but for now, at least, the show is still stuck being itself.\n\nEarly in \"The Good Ones,\" the first episode of Brooklyn Nine-Nine 's final season to air (as part of a two-episode, hour-long premiere), Detective Rosa Diaz (Stephanie Beatriz) quits the force to become a private investigator. She reasons that as a PI, she can do the thing she loves about her job - solve crimes and help people who've been wronged - without propping up an institution that is rotting from within.\n\nThe other characters, especially Detective Jake Peralta (Andy Samberg), one of Rosa's close friends, aren't exactly thrown by this decision. They mostly agree with her that policing is terribly broken, but they do feel a bit hurt. Rosa was their friend! They live in a sitcom! Friends don't give up on each other in sitcoms!\n\nRosa withdraws from Jake because she knows he thinks the NYPD can reform itself, and she's given up on that idea. The action of \"The Good Ones\" brings the two back together, as they attempt to solve a case Rosa is working that would aim to bring two officers who assaulted a young Black woman to justice.\n\nThey fail to do anything other than get the spurious charges against the woman dropped, and in the process, they realize just how difficult it would be to punish the offending officers with even so much as a slap on the wrist. The systems that protect the police are so deeply entrenched that changing them is beyond the abilities of any one group of officers. Rosa feels vindicated. Jake feels disillusioned. The episode ends on his inability to say anything in defense of the job he loves.\n\nAnd then he just goes on being a cop.\n\n\"The Good Ones\" opens with a very brief flashback to the days of masked-up Covid-19 quarantine, when Rosa quits the force after George Floyd's murder. Then it quickly flashes forward to the present day, where Holt crows that everybody can hang out again, because they're all vaccinated. In reality, many police departments around the country - including the NYPD - have low vaccination rates.\n\nI really do not expect Brooklyn Nine-Nine , a sitcom, to reflect every aspect of our current reality. An episode about one of the characters refusing the vaccination would cut against the show's smiley self at best and verge into \"a Very Special Episode on why you need the vaccine\" territory at worst.\n\nYet Holt's proclamation, to me, showed how outside of reality Brooklyn Nine-Nine now lives, even as it tries desperately to reflect reality. If you want to grapple with the institutional rot within American policing, you can't exactly suggest that there's one precinct where everything goes right. The show is selling a fantasy, but it wants to give itself an excuse to keep selling that fantasy. So it peddles a reality that is also fantastical, where whole station houses with good cops exist, no matter how unlikely.\n\nFrom the end of \"The Good Ones,\" it feels clear to me that the arc of Brooklyn Nine-Nine 's final season will probably involve Jake, who has always defined himself as a cop above all else, leaving the force behind, perhaps to work with Rosa. Where will that leave the rest of the characters? They probably can't all become private investigators.\n\nI don't want to suggest that Jake's doubts about the institution he's devoted his life to are without merit within the world of Brooklyn Nine-Nine, or that he should immediately look at the problems Rosa has pointed out and completely reconfigure his life. Many people - perhaps most people - don't operate that way. We're all built to ignore certain contradictions that protect us from inconvenient or difficult circumstances (like leaving our job without a solid plan to fall back on).\n\n\"The protagonist realizes the organization he works for might be making the world a worse place\" is pretty unusual territory for a beloved sitcom to visit. Arguably, only M*A*S*H spent much time there, by questioning the necessity of US military actions. I would love if the final season of Brooklyn Nine-Nine took an abrupt turn toward M*A*S*H .\n\nBut in the very next episode, \"The Lake House\" (the second half of the one-hour premiere), Brooklyn Nine-Nine is back to its usual sitcom shenanigans. The characters are all on a weekend retreat, designed to get Captain Holt back together with his husband, and Amy is worried about her baby not sleeping long enough, and Boyle is a baby whisperer.\n\n\"The Lake House\" is full of standard sitcom stuff. Certainly, Brooklyn Nine-Nine should not be all heavy topics, all the time. People's lives go on in darkness. We're still patching up marriages and having babies and hanging out with friends, even in a pandemic. Life is never all one thing, and art should reflect that.\n\nYet the episode highlights just how much Brooklyn Nine-Nine will gladly question the institution it's set within while insisting that the people we're watching every week are largely beyond reproach. For as much as Brooklyn Nine-Nine tries to throw cold water on the idea of any cops being \"the good ones,\" its characters are supposed to be, well, \"the good ones.\" Plenty of cops thought Derek Chauvin was one of the good ones, too. So as long as Brooklyn Nine-Nine won't push its characters a bit, it's going to struggle to meet its stated goals.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nHow Kristi Noem and Karoline Leavitt offer two visions of conservative femininity.\n\nDJs, club owners, and patrons alike say there's way too much standing around.\n\nAstrology's enormous appeal, explained for believers and skeptics.\n\nThe surprising truth about milk is hiding in plain sight.\n\n﻿From Dunkin' deodorant to Sabrina Carpenter perfume, smelling good isn't enough - it's all about smelling edible.\n\nA star-studded film explains the hope and hype behind regenerative agriculture.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

The Atlanta high school student was arrested, along with three others, on multiple felony charges, including illegal gun possession and street gang activity.\n\n\"I didn't believe in consequences,\" Caden said.\n\nFrom jail, he called his mom, Tomeka, who \"started breaking down crying,\" Caden said. Tomeka says she spent her entire savings of $8,000 to bail her son out.That's when Clippers and Cops came in and \"changed everything,\" Tomeka said.\n\nThe Atlanta-based program is trying to reduce crime by bringing together police and at-risk kids in a familiar and comfortable setting: the barbershop. Retired Atlanta police officer Tyrone Dennis says he was inspired to start the nonprofit organization in 2018 after working in Atlanta's gang unit for 10 years.\n\n\"We can't arrest our way out of some of these problems. We can't keep doing the same things. And that's basically what Clippers and Cops is, something different. We're not saying it's an end all, but it's what we've decided to do to try to make change,\" Dennis said.\n\nNot only is the organization in barbershops, but also in classrooms. They've visited over 50 schools in Missouri, Tennessee and Georgia.\n\n\"We talk about topics that they want to talk about - decision-making, goal setting, dos and don'ts on traffic stops, rap music, prison- and just try to help them do better at interacting with law enforcement,\" Dennis said.\n\nNearly 7 in 10 adults in the U.S. say they are confident in their local police, according to a recent Gallup poll. But when you break it down by race, that number drops to 56% for Black Americans.\n\nPrograms like Clippers and Cops can improve relationships between police and those they're sworn to protect, creating more trust, an improved sense of community and a decrease in crime of up to 22%, according to the Atlanta Police Department.\n\n\"That's what kids need to see, this what people who look like me, can do, will do, and are willing to do for me,\" said Ingrid Simone, another Cops and Clippers participant.\n\nAt Caden's recent high school graduation, Dennis was there to show support. He was also there with another important piece of paper: prosecutors decided not to move forward with their case and drop all charges against Caden.\n\n\"He had to go execute the plan. If they fall down, they're able to get back up and get their life back on track,\" Dennis said.\n\nCaden is back on track, because Clippers and Cops instilled one of the most important lessons of life: it's not how you start, but how you finish.\n\nJericka Duncan is a national correspondent and anchor of the \"CBS Weekend News.\" She's based in New York City.\n\n© 2024 CBS Interactive Inc.

Could state law be to blame? | Handcuffs in Hallways\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nApril 10, 2024 / 5:00 PM PDT / CBS News California\n\nA bill introduced in the wake of the CBS News & Stations' \"Handcuffs in Hallways\" investigation aims to reduce \"unnecessary\" calls for police at California schools, but one lawmaker could kill it without a vote.\n\nAs part of a nationwide investigation into arrests of young children on campus, a CBS News analysis found police were called to California schools more than 10,000 times in a year. The data reveals they were rarely called for reasons that resulted in an arrest in California.\n\nSome believe that's because, in addition to obvious crimes, California law may require school staff to call the police for behavioral issues that could be better handled by trained school staff and counselors.\n\nNumerous studies find that negative early interactions with police can have lasting effects on kids. Others note that needlessly calling cops to campus is a public safety concern at a time when California law enforcement is understaffed.\n\nInstead of requiring school staff to call the police for a variety of reasons, San Jose Assemblyman Ash Kalra introduced legislation that would authorize schools to call for any reason but it removes the threat of a fine if they don't . Schools are still required to report any violations related to firearms or weapons under federal law.\n\nThe bill also exempts students from a willful disturbance misdemeanor charge for disrupting school activities in their own school district.\n\nThere is no public opposition to the current version of the bill, though some say they worry it could lead to the underreporting of crimes on campus and put undue pressure on teachers to decide when to call the police.\n\nThe Assembly Education Chair, Southern California Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi , has yet to schedule the bill for a hearing and may single-handedly kill the bill for the second year in a row without giving his fellow lawmakers the chance to vote.\n\nWe first introduced you to a boy we refer to as \"C.B.\" during our statewide Handcuffs in Hallways investigation in 2022.\n\nOfficer body camera video captured one of the four times C.B. was handcuffed at his Southern California school, according to court records .\n\nThis time, C.B. was handcuffed for refusing to get up and walk to the principal's office so he could be questioned about accusations that he threw rocks at school resource officers the previous day.\n\n\"They slammed his head to the floor,\" said \"W.B.,\" C.B.'s father. \"(An) officer at least three times his size pressed his neck down with the officer's knee on his neck and back. One officer was twisting his arms.\"\n\nDeputies reported that they handcuffed and detained his son after C.B. kicked one and then attempted to kick another.\n\n\"(T)hey shouldn't have handcuffed him. He's only 70 pounds,\" said W.B. \"Any trained police officer, only one of them should've been able to handle a 70-pound kid.\"\n\nC.B.'s father later sued his Riverside County school district .\n\n\"He is being punished. For the very diagnosis that he has of oppositional defiant disorder,\" said Attorney Dan Stromer.\n\nStromer is a civil rights attorney, who represented CB along with the Disability Rights Education Defense Fund . He explained that the 11-year-old boy had been diagnosed with Oppositional Defiant Disorder, which he says requires a specialized response to non-compliant behavior.\n\nHowever, as the body camera video reveals, less than 90 seconds after officers arrived, they pulled C.B. from his desk, pinned the child down and handcuffed the boy, who continued to struggle.\n\n\"The school knows that he suffers from a diagnosable condition, which is exacerbated by their approach,\" said Stromer.\n\nWe asked the district if they have a specialized policy or trained staff to respond to students with disabilities like C.B.'s.\n\nRepresentatives from the school district said they were unable to comment on litigation or medical issues, but that, \"overall, we work with the sheriff's department to use de-escalation tactics with all students, regardless of known or unknown conditions.\"\n\nWhile C.B.'s case may be extreme, he is certainly not alone.\n\nWhile C.B.'s case may be extreme, he is certainly not alone. A CBS News analysis of U.S. Department of Education Data revealed that, in California, police were called to campuses more than 10,000 times in a single year. However, only about one out of every 18 kids was arrested.\n\n\"Does that tell you that police are being called for incidents that maybe don't warrant a police officer?\" we asked retired Sacramento Sheriff John McGinness.\n\n\"I wouldn't necessarily draw that conclusion,\" he said.\n\nMcGinness gives expert testimony in cases of police misconduct. The former sheriff and school resource officer said a law enforcement presence can help de-escalate a situation. However, he also believes, in some cases, law enforcement is misused on school campuses.\n\n\"There is a time to call in law enforcement. But school rules should be enforced by school authorities,\" McGinness said.\n\nCalifornia state law currently requires school staff to notify law enforcement for a variety of student offenses or face a fine. Some say this can lead to unnecessary calls to the police for issues that may be better handled by counselors and trained staff.\n\nA review of on-campus calls for cops revealed a combination of crimes and behavioral issues, including things like tardy mediation, inappropriate behavior and disrupting school activities, which is a misdemeanor.\n\nAssemblyman Ash Kalra points to various evidence - based research that shows negative early interactions with police can be detrimental and lead to increased bad behavior.\n\n\"Why would we want to criminalize being a child?\" Kalra asked.\n\nAnd at a time when law enforcement is understaffed, he says this is also a matter of public safety.\n\n\"We're using valuable resources, having cops come to campuses thousands of times a year for very minor incidents,\" Kalra said.\n\nSo, he wants to update the education code to decrease unnecessary calls to the police. Instead of requiring school staff to call the police for a variety of reasons, he wants to authorize them to call and remove the fine if they don't.\n\nKalra's bill would also prevent students from being charged with a misdemeanor for disrupting school-related activities in their own district.\n\nSchools would still have to report any violations related to firearms or weapons under federal law.\n\n\"There are absolutely situations where you need to call the police to campus. What we're saying is you shouldn't have to do it every time there's a little incident on campus\" Kalra said.\n\nKalra introduced a similar bill last year , but it died in Assemblyman Al Muratsuchi 's Assembly Education Committee without a vote.\n\nMany people don't realize that one person, a committee chair, has the power to quietly kill any bill in their committee before anyone ever gets a chance to vote. In this case, Muratsuchi simply chose not to schedule Kalra's bill for a hearing, meaning he single-handedly killed the bill last year, and he could do it again.\n\nWe're still waiting for an interview with Muratsuchi, but in a statement, he said:\n\n\"I had a number of concerns with last year's (bill) and offered amendments. We are currently reviewing the new version of the bill (and continue) to have concerns around the potential impact on school safety.\"\n\nHis staff declined to elaborate on what those concerns are but sent us this opposition letter to last year's bill from the Riverside Sheriffs' Association. Incidentally, that is the agency involved in C.B.'s Case.\n\nKalra's already addressed many of their concerns in the amended bill. For instance, the previous bill language required school staff to exhaust other methods of correction before calling the police. This new bill now \"strongly encourages\" other methods but would not prevent immediate calls to the police.\n\nThe California Teachers Association has not taken a stance and there is no formal opposition to the current version, but some say they worry it could lead to crimes on campus going underreported and put undue pressure on teachers to decide when to call police.\n\nLike most children who interact with cops on campus, deputies never actually arrested C.B. and he wasn't charged. A federal court later ruled the incident violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and the district was ordered to change district policies.\n\nBut many, like C.B.'s father and Kalra, want to see changes statewide.\n\nThere are two and a half weeks left for Muratsuchi to schedule the bill for a hearing and let fellow his lawmakers vote on this bill. Otherwise, it dies again without a vote.\n\nJulie Watts is a national-award-winning investigative correspondent for CBS News, covering California.

      "text": "What lessons do police in Europe have for American cops?\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJune 6, 2021 / 9:24 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nThe examples are devastating, sometimes deadly, and certainly familiar.\n\nPatrick Warren Sr. was killed by a police officer in Texas earlier this year, after his family phoned for psychiatric help . In Salt Lake City last fall, Linden Cameron, a teenager with autism, was shot multiple times by police responding to a 911 call from the boy's mom . The teen survived.\n\nWalter Wallace Jr. did not. He was mentally ill and in crisis in Pennsylvania last October when, a family attorney says, his brother called 911: \"They were sent into a situation ill-prepared. They didn't have the training and they didn't have the tools to do the job effectively.\"\n\nPhiladelphia Police, who say Wallace was armed with a knife, shot and killed him . \"The only justice that can come out of this is full reform,\" the attorney said.\n\nThat push for reform prompts comparisons to countries where these deadly encounters are far less common.\n\nCorrespondent Seth Doane asked Lawrence Sherman, a professor of criminology at the University of Cambridge in England, \"How different is policing in America from Europe?\"\n\n\"Oh, it's just like night and day,\" Sherman replied. In the United States, \"If somebody doesn't drop a knife when an officer tells them to, even if they're not threatening somebody, the police can shoot and kill them. It would be murder in Europe.\"\n\n\"Are you saying the law in the U.S. is on the police officer's side and it's the reverse in Europe?\"\n\n\"I would say that the law in the United States goes to extraordinary lengths to justify police preemptive use of shooting,\" he said.\n\nSherman notes that while U.S. police are quicker to use deadly force and kill far more people per officer than those in Europe, more guns on U.S. streets mean law enforcement faces more threats. In fact, police in several European countries (including England, Ireland and Norway) do not carry firearms while on regular patrol.\n\nSherman said, \"It really helps to have a disarmed population. You can't blame the American police, because they don't have one.\"\n\nBut policing, he explained, is also not as strictly regulated in the U.S. For example, Derek Chauvin, the officer who killed George Floyd in Minneapolis , had more than a dozen misconduct complaints ... and he was training other officers.\n\n\"You would not have a field training officer with a very bad disciplinary record in the English police system. That's inconceivable,\" Sherman said.\n\nMaria Haberfeld, a professor of police science at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, describes policing in America today as \"in complete chaos.\"\n\nHow is it chaotic? \"Because we have 18,000 different police departments. We have 50 states with 50 different minimal standards for training and recruitment.\"\n\nHaberfeld feels many police are willing, but not ready to do their job, because of insufficient training. In the U.S., the average police academy runs 17 weeks, whereas in Norway and Finland, police training runs three years ; in Germany, between two and three years.\n\nDoane asked, \"What's the effect of this lesser training?\"\n\n\"We're going to see people pushing back against the enforcement, and the quality of enforcement, that that they're receiving,\" Haberfeld replied.\n\nPublic outrage followed the suffocation death of Daniel Prude at the hands of police in Rochester, N.Y. , after family members said they dialed 911 to report he was suffering a \"psychotic episode.\"\n\nAccording to a recent survey, police in the U.S. spend more than 20 percent of their time responding to people with mental illness. Sweden, facing similar problems, developed a \"mental health ambulance,\" which is dispatched with a police unit when there is a mental health call. Andreas Carlborg explained their service works, in part, because health workers have access to medical records that police do not: \"If you would talk to the police department in the United States, I think most of them would agree that they have to deal with these cases, and this should really primarily be dealt with by trained health care professionals, not the police.\"\n\nCalls for reform in the U.S. are growing louder, but in a country with roughly 18,000 police departments, the hurdles to reform are structural and systemic.\n\nFor more info:\n\nStory produced by Mikaela Bufano.

      "text": "George Floyd's family, others see inequality in penalties for ex-cops\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJuly 29, 2022 / 8:34 AM CDT / AP\n\nMINNEAPOLIS - Three former Minneapolis police officers went before a federal judge during the last week to be sentenced for violating George Floyd's civil rights, and for each man, U.S. District Judge Paul Magnuson handed out penalties well below what prosecutors sought and below federal guidelines.\n\nTou Thao, who held back concerned bystanders as Derek Chauvin knelt on Floyd's neck, got 3 1/2 years. J. Alexander Kueng, who pinned Floyd's back, got three. And Thomas Lane, who held Floyd's feet and asked twice about rolling the Black man on his side, got 2 1/2.\n\nFor some Floyd family members and activists, the penalties were too small - and a bitter reminder of a justice system they say does not treat all people equally.\n\n\"Once again, our judicial system favored people that should be locked up forever,\" Floyd's uncle, Selwyn Jones, said Thursday. The officers, he said, \"contributed to the most brutal, heinous killing in most of our lifetimes.\"\n\nFloyd, 46, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin, who is white, knelt on his neck for 9 1/2 minutes as Floyd repeatedly said he couldn't breathe and eventually grew still. The killing, recorded by bystanders, sparked protests worldwide and a reckoning over racial injustice in policing.\n\nChauvin, who pleaded guilty to a federal count in which he admitted willfully depriving Floyd of his right to be free from unreasonable seizure, was sentenced to 21 years for that and for an unrelated case involving a 14-year-old boy.\n\nLane, Thao and Kueng were all convicted of depriving Floyd of medical care; Kueng and Thao were also convicted on a second count of failing to intervene. When issuing sentences in cases that include multiple defendants, judges have to look at each defendant's level of culpability and issue sentences that are proportional. Legal experts who spoke to The Associated Press did not expect any of them to receive sentences as long as Chauvin's.\n\nMark Osler, a professor at the University of St. Thomas School of Law and former federal prosecutor, called the sentences for the three \"groundbreaking,\" saying it's rare for officers who don't directly commit killings to be held accountable.\n\nParis Stevens, Floyd's cousin and a co-chair of the George Floyd Global Memorial, said she didn't think Lane, Kueng and Thao should have gotten the same penalty as Chauvin - but the sentences they got were too low. She said police officers should be punished more harshly because of the power they hold, and said the three men could have helped Floyd, but didn't.\n\n\"They stood by and kind of watched,\" she said.\n\nStevens saw favoritism in Magnuson's sentences.\n\n\"I think all officers get favoritism in the court of law. Because historically that's the way it's played out,\" she said.\n\nAt their sentencing hearings, Magnuson said Lane, who is white, and Kueng, who is Black, were rookies. He called Thao, who is Hmong American, a \"good police officer, father and husband.\" While he said the officers were culpable for violating Floyd's rights, Magnuson also mentioned numerous letters of support that each officer received. And during Chauvin's sentencing, Magnuson appeared to suggest that Chauvin bore the most blame in the case, telling him: \"You absolutely destroyed the lives of three young officers by taking command of the scene.\"\n\nToshira Garroway, an activist who attended the sentencing hearings on Wednesday to support Floyd's girlfriend, took exception to Magnuson's assessment of Thao as \"a good police officer, father and husband.\"\n\n\"That was irrelevant to what he did on May 25, 2020,\" Garroway said.\n\nAyesha Bell Hardaway, who directs the Social Justice Law Center at Case Western Reserve University, said the judge \"seemed to really have lost track of what occurred during those 9 minutes and 30 seconds\" and what she called an \"egregious\" killing.\n\nShe said Floyd's killing sparked widespread awareness of the harm that excessive force and tactics can have, but worried that the sentences will undermine momentum for police reform.\n\n\"When someone dies and we're only talking about the potential of two years in prison, I think there's a strong concern, a well-founded concern, that this removes the motivation for police to be more mindful of the way they choose to use force against individuals on the street,\" Hardaway said.\n\nOsler said any prison time for a police officer would likely make other officers think twice about declining to intervene.\n\n\"We should hope that it has the impact of changing behavior and prodding them to intervene when a life can be saved,\" he said.\n\nAngela Harrelson, an aunt of Floyd's, said the judge showed favoritism when he allowed the three men to remain free pending sentencing and afterward - although that is frequently done in federal cases. Still, she celebrated the guilty verdicts as progress toward holding police accountable for their actions.\n\n\"There's a lot of triumphs that have been made in pushing forward. We are on the right track and police officers are being held accountable,\" Harrelson said. \"For Black and brown people, we are dismantling the system. It is peeling away before our eyes.\"\n\nIn separate proceedings in state court, Chauvin was convicted of murder and manslaughter and was sentenced to a 22 1/2 years, which is being served at the same time as his federal sentence. Lane pleaded guilty in state court to one count of aiding and abetting second-degree manslaughter and is awaiting sentencing there. Kueng and Thao face an Oct. 24 trial on charges of aiding and abetting both murder and manslaughter.\n\n© 2022 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Duty To Intervene: Floyd Cops Spoke Up But Didn't Step In\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nJune 7, 2020 / 2:32 PM CDT / CBS Minnesota\n\nMINNEAPOLIS (WCCO) -- Minneapolis was among several cities that had policies on the books requiring police officers to intervene to stop colleagues from using unreasonable force, but that didn't save George Floyd and law enforcement experts say such rules will always run up against entrenched police culture and the fear of being ostracized and branded a \"rat.\"\n\nPower dynamics may have been magnified in the Floyd case because two of the four officers involved were rookies and the most senior officer on the scene was a training officer, Derek Chauvin, a 19-year police veteran who was seen putting his knee on the back of the black man's neck despite his cries that he couldn't breathe.\n\nEven though lawyers for the rookie officers say both men voiced their concerns about Chauvin's actions in the moment, they ultimately failed to stop him. Chauvin is now charged with second-degree murder, and his three fellow officers are charged with aiding and abetting.\n\n\"This is a lesson for every cop in America: If you see something that is wrong, you need to step in,\" said Joseph Giacalone, a former New York police sergeant who now teaches at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"There are a lot of gray areas in policing, but this was crystal clear. ... You're better off being ostracized by the group than going to prison for murder.\"\n\nAdded Andrew Scott, a former Boca Raton, Florida, police chief who testifies in use-of-force cases: \"They're suffering the effects of an organizational culture that doesn't allow that or reward that behavior. The fraternity of law enforcement is a tight fraternity and fraternities have a group think.\"\n\nAttorneys for the two rookies, Thomas Lane and J. Alexander Kueng, emphasized their place in police hierarchy in the now-fired officers' initial court appearance this past week. They noted both were on just their fourth day as full-fledged cops at the time of Floyd's May 25 arrest, while Chauvin was an authority figure as a designated training officer for new cops.\n\n\"They're required to call him 'Sir,'\" Lane's attorney, Earl Gray, told the judge. \"He has 20 years' experience. What is my client supposed to do but to follow what the training officer said? Is that aiding and abetting a crime?\"\n\nGray noted that Lane questioned Chauvin's actions during the arrest, and Kueng's lawyer Thomas Plunkett said his client told fellow cops, \"You shouldn't be doing this.\"\n\nBut according to the criminal complaints that detailed Floyd's arrest on suspicion of passing a counterfeit bill, the officers didn't back up their words with actions.\n\nLane held Floyd's legs and Kueng held his back while Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd's head and neck. That's when Floyd repeatedly said \"I can't breathe, \"Mama\" and \"please.\" At one point, Floyd said, \"I'm about to die.\" Nevertheless, Chauvin, Lane and Kueng didn't move. And a fourth officer, Tou Thao, continued standing nearby keeping onlookers back.\n\nMoments later, Lane asked \"should we roll him on his side?\" Chauvin replied: \"No, staying put where we got him.\" Lane said he was worried Floyd would experience excited delirium, a condition in which a person can become agitated and aggressive or suddenly die, according to the documents.\n\n\"That's why we have him on his stomach,\" Chauvin replied.\n\nDespite his concerns, Lane didn't do anything to help Floyd or to reduce the force being used on him, the complaint said. Neither he, nor Keung and Chauvin moved from their positions until an ambulance came and took Floyd to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.\n\nMinneapolis police added a \"duty to intervene\" policy in 2016, saying officers are required to \"either stop or attempt to stop another sworn employee when force is being inappropriately applied or is no longer required.\" City officials moved Friday to strengthen that duty by seeking to make it enforceable in court, and to require officers to immediately report to their superiors when they see use of any neck restraint or chokehold.\n\nSimilar \"duty to intervene\" policies and initiatives had been in place for years in New York City, Miami and New Orleans. And since the Floyd case, Dallas and Charlotte, North Carolina, are among the places that have enacted such policies.\n\nBut, Scott said, \"There's policy and then there's practice. More likely than not, practice and custom will prevail over policy.\"\n\nDepartments often don't reward officers for interfering with their colleagues or reporting that they broke policy, Scott said. And officers who do intervene risk being ostracized by their fellow officers and branded as an informer in the ranks.\n\n\"In law enforcement, if you're considered an individual who can't be trusted, you're not going to have the timely back-up from other officers,\" Scott said. \"That's a legitimate fear factor.\"\n\nGeoff Alpert, a criminology professor at the University of South Carolina, said that when Lane questioned Chauvin in the moment, he was undoubtedly \"scared to death.\"\n\nBut ultimately, Alpert said, \"he wasn't courageous enough\" to physically intervene to stop him. \"He knew he would get hell from the 19-year veteran and all his buddies.\"\n\nLost in the furor over Floyd's case and the national protest and debate over issues of race and police brutality is the fact that half of the four officers involved in his arrest were minorities, hired as part of a Minneapolis police program credited with helping to diversify the largely white force.\n\nThao, a 34-year-old of Southeast Asian Hmong descent with more than a decade on the force, and Kueng, a 26-year-old African-American rookie who previously worked as a department store security guard, were both part of the community service officer program that brings in recruits to work part-time with the goal of making them regular members of the force.\n\nChauvin, 44, is white, as is Lane, though he is an outlier of a different sort, a 37-year-old rookie who joined the police after working as a juvenile detention guard.\n\nChuck Wexler, executive director of the Police Executive Research Forum, a Washington-based think tank, said getting officers to take action, sometimes against more experienced colleagues, is at the heart of stopping abuses by police.\n\n\"These new officers are put in a position where they're told, 'This is your mentor. He will teach you,\"' he said. \"A 20-year veteran is supposed to know what he is doing and clearly he didn't. He made every mistake possible.\"\n\n© 2020 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

I knew it from a very young age, and I loved it,\" she said.\n\n\"I loved working in the community and being around people and helping and making a difference - as cliché as that sounds,\" she said, \"but I really did. I enjoyed it.\"\n\nHurley even tattooed her star number on her arm ★19490★, and planned on retiring at 55 with 30 years of service. But things didn't go accordingly.\n\nNow 41, Hurley put in for early retirement and took a $65,000 pay cut to become a junior high teacher. She attributes her exit to stress and lack of time off brought on by the turbulent years of the pandemic and a series of department re-organizations that repeatedly moved cops to unfamiliar neighborhoods.\n\n\"I gave up a full pension. I gave up a nice paycheck. I gave up insurance and pretty much almost everything that I loved once,\" she said. \"I gave that up for something else.\"\n\nHurley is not alone. Since 2019, she is one of about 3,300 officers who retired, resigned, were fired - or lost their lives while wearing the badge - according to the CBS 2 Investigators analysis of data from the Chicago Department of Human Resources.\n\nSince 2019, Chicago has hired about 1,600 officers - about half the amount of the departures.\n\nPolice Supt. David Brown touted recent hires to replenish ranks, but an analysis shows those efforts are facing an uphill battle to stanch the bleeding of personnel, which is outpacing the rate of new hires.\n\n\"Chicago Police Department's recruiting has really turned a corner in a positive way. At this point this year, we've recruited and hired more new Chicago police officers than we did in all of 2019,\" Brown said at a September 12 press conference .\n\nThe police department says it's focusing efforts on recruiting applicants that reflect the city's diversity.\n\n\"From visiting military bases, to job fairs, to more than a dozen historically black colleges and universities, we are meeting with potential applicants from within Chicago and across the country.\" the department said in a statement.\n\n\"Obviously, we're quite challenged with a backlog with vacancies of about 1,400. But we have these last several months made a significant stride in hiring Chicago police officers,\" Brown continued.\n\nBrown said he was aiming to have 700 officers hired by the end of September, but the department only hired 588 officers by the end of last month, according to a police statement.\n\nPolice departments across the country are dealing with the same issue as officers join other workers in the so-called \"great resignation.\" But while some workers may be dissatisfied with their jobs and pay, policing faced a reckoning in the wake of George Floyd's murder, particularly in Chicago, which has grappled with decades of police scandals.\n\nOfficers such as Hurley cited exhaustion and lack of support as the reason for calling it quits, leading to a disillusionment of the job many considered their dream.\n\n\"The hours, you know, were pretty typical. I worked a straight shift. But then that started to change,\" Hurley said.\n\nShe said her hours changed drastically after George Floyd, with days off getting canceled regularly.\n\n\"It was like Groundhog Day,\" Hurley said. \"You'd go to work, you'd be there 12-plus hours. You'd come home, you'd sleep, you'd eat, you'd do it again.\"\n\nShe said the schedule chaos made it difficult to have a work/life balance and have time with her wife and two sons.\n\n\"You're like a zombie,\" she said. \"You're not even coherent. You're kind of just going through motions.\"\n\nWhile officers like Hurley walked away en masse, many others didn't want to wait long enough to collect a pension. Since 2019, about 760 officers have resigned. More officers resigned in 2021 and so far in 2022 than any other year in two decades, according to city data.\n\nThat's what one former Chicago officer did, calling it quits with less than 10 years on the force.\n\nThe former officer asked to remain anonymous as he is seeking employment with suburban police departments, and went by John instead. CBS2 Investigators independently confirmed his employment - and commendations.\n\n\"When I left the job, it was a heartbreak for me. I definitely cried. I felt like I lost part of my identity,\" he said.\n\nJohn said after the summer of 2020, his life was upended by working several weeks in a row with canceled days off and attending court on his scheduled days off.\n\nIn the aftermath of Floyd's murder, protests erupted in Chicago and other cities. Demonstrations downtown on May 30, 2020 , were followed by civil unrest and looting in the heart of the city's tourist district in the Loop and on Michigan Avenue.\n\nThe mayor and Brown ordered the bridges over the Chicago River to be raised, suspended public transit downtown, and implemented a citywide curfew. Gov. JB Pritzker mobilized hundreds of National Guard troops to assist police.\n\nThe following days, looting and violence spread around the city. Lightfoot said the 911 center received 65,000 calls in a 24-hour period - about 50,000 more than average.\n\nThe effect on police staffing was immediate, with officers working 12-hour shifts and no days off the following weeks. The Fraternal Order of Police (FOP), the union representing Chicago officers, filed a motion in June of 2020 , asking the city to bring in help so officers could rest.\n\n\"After 2020 until when I left in early 2021, days off were getting canceled literally every weekend,\" said John, the former officer.\n\n\"They would literally have no advanced warning whatsoever. You can imagine what that does to a family that you don't have time to see anyone, right?\" he continued. \"And what that does to plans. You can't plan accordingly. Everything's thrown out the window.\"\n\nThe resignations and retirements picked up pace in 2021, a year which saw a bitter fight between Lightfoot and the union over a Covid vaccine mandate . That year saw more than 1,000 officers exit Chicago's force - the most in almost 20 years.\n\nWhen asked in May about officers working so many days in a row, Brown responded: \"I don't know where you get the 11 days in a row, so let's just slow it down a little bit.\"\n\nLightfoot responded to questions about officer burnout at a June 22 press conference where she defended her administration's policy of automated speed cameras.\n\n\"I think the infamous head of the FOP has said as part of his campaign they're being worked like mules. That's just simply not correct,\" Lightfoot said. \"We understand there's a lot of stress and strain on being a police officer, that part of that is inherent in the job.\"\n\nFOP president John Catanzara countered Lightfoot's claim.\n\n\"Fact: cops are burnt out, they are not getting that needed time off, and they absolutely don't have enough support from this mayor or superintendent. Period,\" Catanzara told the Chicago Tribune .\n\nThe tension continued into August, when the Chicago Inspector General's Office issued a scathing report that rebuked the mayor's assertions.\n\nThe report found about 1,000 officers worked 11 consecutive days or more between April and May of this year. The report did not examine officer hours before that time period.\n\nLightfoot and Brown would eventually do an about-face, and implement a policy that would ensure officers will have no more than one requested day off canceled a week, except during holidays.\n\n\"We know that we've got to make sure that there is a process by which officers have time off,\" Lightfoot said on August 29 . \"Tired, emotionally wrought officers is not good for them, not good for their families, and not good, frankly, for the community members that they're serving.\"\n\nMeanwhile, officers like John had already started looking at police jobs in the suburbs.\n\nSince 2019, nearly 450 officers have gone to work in police departments in the suburbs, as well as university police departments, and positions within the office for the Cook County State's Attorney, according to an analysis of data from the Illinois Law Enforcement Training and Standards Board.\n\n\"Last year where we had about 45 applicants, the vast majority of those were from the city of Chicago,\" said interim Cicero Police Supt. Thomas Boyle.\n\n\"We have hired approximately five applicants from the city of Chicago out of that pool,\" he said. \"They're grateful to be able to plan their life and have days off. This is just my opinion as a supervisor in our department. I think it's critical to an officer's or any employee's well-being.\"\n\nBoyle said that lateral hires occur when a police department hires an officer from another jurisdiction that has two years of full-time police experience and certification from Illinois or another state. This allows his department to skip the academy process.\n\nIn Cicero, when officers inquire about a lateral application, they will present their ID and badge. One notable applicant was Ella French, a Chicago Police officer who was killed in the line of duty during a traffic stop last year .\n\nShe picked up an application just two days prior to her murder.\n\n\"We certainly would have loved to have had the opportunity to review her application...obviously that was not the case,\" Boyle said.\n\nFrench was the only officer killed in the line of duty last year, and one of 82 who died since 2019.\n\nThe city has a ways to go to replenish its ranks.\n\nLightfoot unveiled her 2023 budget last week , which is her last budget before running for re-election.\n\nShe budgeted for roughly 14,000 full-time positions in the police department, roughly the same amount as this year. Even so, the department is still short about 1,890 positions from the city's 2022 budget, which includes about 1,200 rank-and-file officer positions.\n\nAfter years of calls from activists to reduce police funding and allocate money elsewhere, the proposed budget for next year increases the police budget by $100 million, to a total of about $1.94 billion.\n\nEven with reduced headcount, Chicago still has one of the largest police forces in the country, more so when adjusted for population .\n\nThat has observers asking not only how big the department should be, but what they're fundamentally tasked with doing.\n\n\"I want some stakeholder -     the mayor, the police department, the police union -    to do a staffing study,\" said Tracy Siska, executive director of the Chicago Justice Project, a nonprofit organization that advocates for changes in justice policy with data. \"We don't know if we need more than that number or less.\"\n\nThe police department did commission a police staffing study in 2017 , which was done by Alexander Weiss, the former director of the Center for Public Safety at Northwestern University.\n\nThe study, which the city paid $150,000 to conduct , said that the department should deploy officers to beats with the highest number of calls, according to the Sun-Times.\n\nThe police department did not implement those recommendations, which would have moved officers out of districts with fewer calls.\n\nDespite that outcome, another staffing study was done by the Crime Lab at the University of Chicago , which also recommended additional resources to areas with high call volumes.\n\n\"We want people to wait as little as possible to get police services,\" Siska said. \"I care what the data says.\"\n\nSiska shares company with Chicago Inspector General Deborah Witzburg, whose office conducted the canceled days off report.\n\n\"The larger question of staffing analysis, how does the department determine who should be assigned where and how many members belong in each district on each watch?\" Witzburg said. \"It's easy for the department to say we're canceling days off, because it's Memorial Day weekend, and we need more people working. More than what? How many is the right number? And how do we know that?\"\n\nThe answer to that question is currently being debated on a national stage in an election year, as Republican candidates use Chicago as an example of as a city plagued with violent crimes - even though crime has increased in many other cities during the pandemic.\n\nGov. JB Pritzker has come under fire from his Republican opponent Darren Bailey as being soft on crime and not supporting police officers.\n\nLightfoot has faced repeated criticism from opponents like Ald. Raymond Lopez (15th) and former Chicago Public Schools chief Paul Vallas , who say she's not doing enough for the city's cops.\n\nWhile politicians fight it out through their campaigns, the Chicago Police Department continues to ramp up their hiring efforts, even creating a unit dedicated solely to retention and recruitment.\n\nBut for former officers like John, the suburban police districts may offer them an opportunity to continue policing while maintaining a work/life balance.\n\nAs for Amy Hurley, who now teaches social studies at Christ the King, a Catholic grade school, the decision to walk away for good was needed.\n\n\"I will say when I walked out of headquarters, the day I turned in my badge and my shield and I felt like a ton of bricks was lifted from my shoulders,\" Hurley said. \"I knew from that minute that I had made the right decision.\"\n\nEditor's note: This article was updated at 7:53PM to include response from Police Department.\n\nCall out for officers\n\nThis is the first in a series of reports on Blue Burnout.

      "text": "Arizona police union says Tempe cops who refused to dive into lake to save drowning man were following their training\n\nThe Tempe, Arizona, cops who refused to rescue a man drowning in an area lake were following their training by not jumping in to save him, according to the local police union.\n\nMembers of the Tempe Police Department receive \"no training in water rescues\" and do not have \"equipment to help people at risk of drowning,\" the Tempe Officers Association - which represents officers of the Tempe police force - said in a statement to Insider on Tuesday.\n\n\"Attempting such a high-risk rescue could easily result in the death of the person in the water and the officer, who could be pulled down by a struggling adult,\" the union said. \"Officers are trained to call the Fire Department and/or get the Tempe Police boat. That is what officers did here.\"\n\nThree Tempe police officers have been put on paid leave as the department investigates their response to the May 28 drowning of 34-year-old Sean Bickings.\n\nThe City of Tempe has not identified the cops involved, and body camera footage released by the city blurred their faces and their nametags.\n\nBickings, who the city has described as \"unsheltered,\" drowned after he jumped into the Tempe Town Lake while talking with police.\n\nThe Tempe officers who were at the scene at the time did not go into the water after Bickings even as he struggled to stay afloat and pleaded for help, according to a police body-camera-footage transcript that was released by the city last week.\n\n\"I'm drowning,\" Bickings told Tempe Police Department officers during the incident, the transcript shows.\n\nWhen officers told Bickings to go over to a pylon, he responded, \"I can't. I can't.\"\n\n\"OK, I'm not jumping in after you,\" an officer told Bickings, who then responded, \"Please help me. Please, please, please.\"\n\n\"I can't touch. Oh, God, please help me. Help me,\" Bickings said.\n\nThe Tempe cops were speaking with Bickings just after 5 a.m. after someone reported seeing a dispute between Bickings and a woman who identified herself to police as his wife, officials said.\n\nOfficials said Bickings climbed over a 4-foot metal fence and hopped into the water as cops were running the couple's names through a database to check on any outstanding arrest warrants as part of standard procedure.\n\nThe Tempe Officers Association noted in its statement that the cops' exchange with Bickings \"was largely cordial prior to Mr. Bickings' entering the lake\" and said he had been \"free to go at any time.\"\n\nThe Tempe Officers Association called the death of Bickings \"a human tragedy.\"\n\n\"To watch the 11-minute video leading up to Mr. Bickings' entering Tempe Town Lake and to understand how this 911 call ended is to see an awful loss of life. Our grief mirrors our community's grief. No one wanted this incident to end as it did,\" the union said.\n\nThe union said it will \"work for a change\" in how the city and the Tempe Police Department \"approach potential water incidents in Tempe Town Lake, including instituting training and equipment changes.\"\n\n\"We will work with the city and the community to ensure that such an incident never happens again,\" the union said.\n\nTempe Police is conducting Bickings' death investigation and the Arizona Department of Public Safety will review that investigation after it is finished, the city said.\n\nThe Scottsdale Police Department has also begun an \"administrative review of the critical incident response,\" according to the city.\n\n\"Tempe initiated this step for public trust and transparency. That investigation is expected to take several weeks,\" the city said.\n\nThe city said that it and the Tempe Police Department \"are examining water response protocols and equipment needs for officers as well as for placement of rescue equipment around bodies of water.\"\n\nAdditional portions of police body-camera footage surrounding the May 28 incident are expected to be released later this week.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Phoenix police say cops were shot trying to retrieve a baby during an early-morning standoff that left 5 officers injured\n\nFive Phoenix, Arizona, police officers were shot during a chaotic standoff situation early Friday during which, at one point, cops were fired at while trying to retrieve a baby, authorities said.\n\nThe gunfire unfolded after Phoenix Police Department officers were called to a home over a report of a shooting, Phoenix Police Chief Jeri Williams told reporters.\n\nA woman was also critically injured in the standoff, Williams said. She added that a man opened fire as an officer approached the house, striking the cop multiple times.\n\n\"There was a baby in the home who at some point was placed in a carrier and placed outside,\" Williams said.\n\nWhen police went to go bring the baby to safety, the suspect continued to shoot, hitting four other cops who then returned fire, Williams said.\n\n\"The suspect then barricaded himself in the home,\" she told reporters as the scene remained active.\n\nThe Phoenix police department said in a tweet at around 8 a.m. local time that the \"barricade situation has been resolved\" and that there was \"no threat to the public.\"\n\nWilliams said four of the five officers are \"recovering\" and one was seriously injured, but \"is on the road to recovery.\" A separate police official said the baby is \"OK.\"\n\nWilliams called the shooting \"senseless.\"\n\n\"It doesn't need to happen and it continues to happen over and over again,\" she said.\n\nWilliams pointed to the recent shooting of Phoenix police officer Tyler Moldovan , who was shot eight times in December while responding to a call. A tribal officer in Arizona, Preston Brogdon , was also shot earlier this week.\n\nAccording to FBI crime statistics, released in October, killings of police officers rose by 51 percent over a nine-month span in 2021 compared to 2020. The FBI study said there was an increase in assaults against police between 2020 and 2019 - it said 4,071 more officers were assaulted in 2020 than in 2019, a 7 percent increase.\n\nThis story is developing.

      "text": "An NYPD detective scored freebies and raked in money running a private security company from his precinct. His bosses didn't care.\n\nFor years, Deborah Giaco was a beloved technology aide for a small Long Island school district, praised by colleagues for her \"warm and caring nature.\" On paper, though, she was also the owner of a security company that touts ties to the Secret Service and claims to have a roster of trained agents with experience as bodyguards, bomb detectors, hostage negotiators and SWAT team members.\n\nBut while Deborah Giaco owned the company on paper, her husband Stephen, then an NYPD detective, was in charge. According to two former colleagues, Stephen Giaco ran the company, D. Sterling, from the Midtown North precinct where he was based, using public resources for his private benefit.\n\nHe stashed metal detectors and charged walkie-talkies in the precinct's community affairs office, and gave employees keys so they could walk into what was supposed to be a secure facility and take the equipment to D. Sterling jobs.\n\nD. Sterling has provided security for awards shows, movie premieres, and other events hosted by some of the same institutions that Giaco was supposed to protect in his day job, like Radio City Music Hall and the Museum of Modern Art. On several occasions, Giaco was at the same events in his official capacity, collecting overtime. And he would dole out free tickets to some events to his superiors, a whistleblowing colleague told Insider.\n\nWhile the ultimate volume of D. Sterling's business isn't clear, contemporaneous notes and other evidence reviewed by Insider suggest it was a huge operation. But according to the NYPD's responses to Insider's record requests, Giaco appears to have violated NYPD policy by failing to disclose his family side gig. NYPD regulations require officers to provide detailed descriptions of their second jobs and get several sign-offs. NYPD records going back 2013 show Giaco never mentioned D. Sterling, even though he sometimes disclosed work for another employer.\n\nThe operation illuminates the risks that can arise from police officers' unmonitored off-duty employment. Moonlighting without adequate oversight can mean conflicts of interest for cops - and it can leave them exhausted, potentially putting the public at risk when overworked officers get behind the wheel of a car or use force.\n\n\"Off-duty employment is ripe for abuse because if an officer feels they lack supervision, they'll do what other humans do, which is try to skate,\" said Keith Taylor, a former high-ranking NYPD official.\n\n\"I can't imagine an officer getting concert or baseball tickets and then handing those out as incentives or freebies to folks in management,\" said Ken Wallentine, a Utah police chief and law enforcement expert who has written about off-duty employment. \"To me, that just stinks terribly.\"\n\nThe Giacos didn't respond to several voicemails left at numbers listed for them in public databases, and D. Sterling didn't respond to messages sent to its email address.\n\nGiaco, who is now retired from the NYPD, ran D. Sterling from his precinct office at least as far back as the 1990s, according to Lance Trent, a retired crime-prevention detective who shared an office with Giaco and witnessed his conduct for years. Trent said he worked jobs for the company, but eventually called him out in an unsigned letter to the NYPD Internal Affairs Bureau in 2002, which he shared with Insider. Among other things, he wrote that Giaco was providing clients - he named seven - with perks that private-sector competitors couldn't.\n\n\"His security business has become extremely large for the simple reasons that he can easily provide his clients with extras,\" like barriers, parking signage, city permits and special treatment, Trent wrote.\n\nTrent said Giaco came into the office one day and described having been confronted by Internal Affairs about the letter. He said he tried to play it cool, but suspected Giaco knew he'd written it. Eventually, Trent said, Giaco took to calling him \"rat boy.\"\n\n\"I was blackballed,\" Trent told Insider. At one point, someone put a small rubber rat on his desk. Even though it was typical for crime-prevention detectives to be offered the chance to move to a community-affairs role, Trent added, \"I was passed over seven times because I was the rat.\"\n\nMidtown North is an enviable place to work. It doesn't have much violent crime, and it's home to some of America's top businesses and tourist attractions like Rockefeller Center. Some cops call it Fort Hook , because officers with a \"hook\" - a friend in the mayor's office or NYPD headquarters - have an easier time getting assigned there.\n\nAs a detective in the community affairs unit, Giaco was essentially an ambassador for the police department. The connections he made on the job helped him find jobs for D. Sterling and land free tickets to events like a 2019 old-school hip-hop show featuring Vanilla Ice that he doled out to a chief, said Trent, who kept detailed notes on the activities he overheard and observed that he shared with Insider.\n\nInsider found that dozens of events in Trent's notes took place when and where he noted them. Trent also identified D. Sterling personnel, and provided reference photos, in the background of events like the 2019 premiere of Jordan Peele's \"Us\" at the Museum of Modern Art and Nik and Lijana Wallenda's 2019 tightrope walk across Times Square .\n\nD. Sterling continued to use the Midtown North precinct to store its supplies even after Giaco retired in 2017 with support from his old pals at the precinct, Trent said. In photos from 2018 seen by Insider, Detective Mike Dugan can be seen packing up equipment for a D. Sterling employee standing nearby.\n\nIn a statement for this article, the NYPD said only, \"Det. Stephen Giaco retired in July of 2017\" and referred Insider to its patrol guide.\n\nTrent said numerous senior officers were aware of the operation, but turned a blind eye. Mark Iocco, a former NYPD inspector assigned to the precinct who retired last year, once said that \"there are three units in Midtown North: community affairs, crime prevention and D. Sterling,\" Trent recalled. Iocco didn't respond to calls or emails.\n\nAt a 2016 Alicia Keys concert in Times Square, Trent wrote, \"Sterling had 39 guys.\" Four men in D. Sterling shirts are visible when an ABC cameraman followed Nik Wallenda down a short corridor after his high-wire act.\n\nDespite efforts to combat corruption, policing in New York has been rife with misconduct. The current deputy mayor for public safety, Phil Banks, was named in FBI affidavits after failing to pay taxes on over $500,000 in rent and suspicious cash deposits, according to The City . (The mayor's office has defended Banks; Banks' lawyer told the New York Post in 2018 the money came from rent, an inheritance, and \"poker games.\")\n\nPrivate security is a common second job for cops, two former NYPD officers told Insider, and Giaco probably wasn't the only one to do it under-the-radar.\n\n\"In all the precincts in Midtown...there were people that had security companies,\" one said. \"I don't know what they net, but I'd say the big guys, their gross receipts were definitely seven figures.\"\n\nTrent said his negative experience with Internal Affairs in 2002 made him hesitant to reach out again, even though D. Sterling's activities continued until Trent's 2021 retirement.\n\nEverett Stern, a whistleblower-turned-security consultant who has worked with Trent, said he urged local and state authorities to investigate his claims and provided an intelligence report that summarized them to several agencies, including the New York Attorney General's office and the current commander of the Midtown North precinct. They either didn't respond or passed the buck, Stern said. The New York AG's office didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"Not to at least open an inquiry or get back to me and say, 'Do you have more information,' or 'Who's the whistleblower,' it doesn't make sense to me,\" Stern said. \"Why would they not do that?\"\n\nFor years, groups like the International Association of Chiefs of Police have sought to spread awareness of the risks of not properly regulating and supervising police officers' off-duty work. But not all departments have heeded the warnings, and scandals persist.\n\nIn Los Angeles, police captain Cory Palka wound up at the center of a firestorm after the New York Attorney General learned that he had tipped off CBS - where he moonlighted as private security - to a criminal complaint made against its CEO Les Moonves. He is reportedly still under investigation. Palka did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAnd in Miami, police watchdogs wrote in 2019 that cops appeared to bend the rules to work at bars and clubs that officially barred their employment.\n\n\"The majority of security companies in New York City are heavily tied in with law enforcement, not just in the NYPD, but also in the feds,\" said John Macari, a retired lieutenant. \"A lot of that stuff's not authorized.\"\n\nAnd issues posed by off-duty employment aren't unique to large departments. Wallentine, the Utah police chief, said he knew of a city where an officer was caught tipping off the manager of an event hall where he or she had worked off-duty to be wary of serving underage or inebriated patrons at a particular event because undercover police would be present.\n\nSecond jobs can also leave officers exhausted and play a role in bad decisions - with fatal consequences. Mohamed Noor, the Minneapolis police officer who was convicted of manslaughter for killing Justine Ruszczyk Damond, went from working a seven-hour private security shift to a ten-hour police shift. He was about seven hours into the shift when he shot Damond.\n\nUse of force isn't the only risk when cops work too long. New York City's Department of Investigation, which tracks city government conduct, found that police overtime correlated with lawsuits, civilian complaints, and car crashes.\n\nThe department said it couldn't analyze the impact of cops' second jobs because the NYPD \"does not require officers to report those hours and does not monitor or track them.\"\n\n\"Ultimately, the agency - by allowing that off-duty employment to occur - is taking a risk,\" said Taylor, the former senior NYPD official.\n\nMattathias Schwartz contributed reporting.\n\nJump to"

That is what officers did here,\" the union said.\n\nThe three officers involved in the incident were put on paid leave as the department investigates their response to the drowning.\n\nIf the officers were not properly trained to go in the water in an attempt to save Bickings, Dworkin says their hands were tied.\n\n\"They had no other choice unless they were trained, specifically trained for water rescue and equipped for water rescue,\" said Dworkin.\n\nDworkin noted that \"most\" cops are not trained to perform such a rescue and that even lifeguards trained through organizations like the American Red Cross are taught to only perform a water rescue using a flotation device.\n\n\"The general public looks at police officers and firefighters as if they're wearing capes, that they're capable of responding to any type of emergency and the reality is that most police officers are not trained or equipped to perform a water rescue,\" Dworkin said.\n\nWater safety experts Insider spoke to agreed that entering the water without rescue equipment or training could lead to multiple victims.\n\n\"You don't want to go into the water to rescue someone unless you have no other recourse,\" retired US Coast Guard commander Dave Smith, who founded the Michigan-based Smith Aquatic Safety Service in 1981, told Insider.\n\nHe explained, \"A drowning human goes berserk and they only want one thing and that's air and they'll climb up on a rescuer to get air.\"\n\n\"If you don't know what to do and you're in the water with a person who is drowning, get away from them because you're likely to drown yourself, unfortunately,\" he said.\n\nSmith, whose company primarily trains emergency responders in water rescue and accident prevention, said that he has taught first responders for years to keep a personal floatation device and a rescue \"throw bag\" in their vehicles.\n\n\"Any community that has water and emergency service personnel responding potentially to accidents in the water needs to have just a simple life jacket in each of their vehicles,\" Smith said.\n\nAdditionally, Smith said that he recommends police departments turn to organizations that teach basic rescue training.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Police officers are getting raises for wearing body cameras - at the expense of taxpayers\n\nPolice unions, responding to increasing calls for cops to be equipped with body cameras, are seeking taxpayer-funded raises for officers being asked to wear them.\n\nComing in the form of both increased wages and bonuses, some law enforcement unions, like the Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #5, call the benefits \" accountability pay .\"\n\nThe Globe and Mail reported in 2021 that Philly police sought a 5% pay raise for wearing the cameras during contract negotiations. While the complete 5% was not granted, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported officers received a one-time bonus of $1,500 in addition to raises of 2.75% in 2021 and 3.5% in 2022 and 2023.\n\nBut Pennsylvania cops aren't the only ones seeking more compensation for complying with public calls for more transparency, which have increased since George Floyd was killed by a police officer who knelt on his neck for more than nine minutes.\n\nIn Worcester, Massachusetts, officers were granted an annual $1,300 stipend for complying with bodycam requirements, The New York Times reported.\n\n\"I cannot imagine that when community members called for police transparency and justice, beyond body cams, that they envisioned that it would come with a reward,\" the outlet reported Etel Haxhiaj, one of three Worcester city councilors who opposed the stipend during a vote in May, said.\n\nIn addition to a $3.9 million contract with the company supplying the department with body cameras, the $1,300 stipends will cost Worcester an estimated $2 million over five years, the outlet reported. In Rhode Island, state troopers sought a $3,000 annual pay increase. Similar raises were granted to officers in Las Vegas and are being sought out by departments in Seattle, New York, and New Jersey.\n\nWhile the calls for increased pay for wearing body cameras have increased, their adoption is already reasonably widespread across the United States. In November 2018, the Bureau of Justice Statistics published a report on the use of body-worn cameras by law enforcement agencies and found that 47% of general-purpose agencies had body-worn cameras available for officers; for large police departments, that number increased to approximately 80%.\n\nAmong agencies that had acquired body-worn cameras, 60% of local police departments and 49% of sheriffs' offices had fully deployed their body-worn cameras, BJS found.\n\nRepresentatives for the National Fraternal Order of Police, New England Police Benevolent Association, Philadelphia Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #5, and Rhode Island State Police did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment.\n\nBodycam footage is often regarded as a benefit to both officers and civilians because it can be used to verify evidence and significantly reduces claims of misconduct levied against officers - one study by the Body-Worn Camera Training and Technical Assistance Team, a DOJ-funded research and training agency, estimates up to 90%.\n\n\"It's literally laughable how the situation has been manipulated by the unions,\" the Times reported Charles Katz, a criminologist at Arizona State University, said: \"Which other pieces of equipment that protect officers' careers and lives have they charged extra for? They're not charging extra for Kevlar vests.\"\n\nHowever, despite their benefits, high-profile cases, including the beating death of Tyre Nichols in February, involved officers either purposely turning off or failing to turn on their body cams while engaged in misconduct. In March, an Oklahoma City police chief requested an officer turn his camera off after the chief was pulled over for drunk driving, Insider reported.\n\n\"The whole purpose of the cameras was accountability,\" Joseph Hennessey, a defense lawyer, told the Times \"and they're shutting them off.\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Judge delays sentencing for Mississippi police 'goon squad' that tortured and sexually assaulted two Black men\n\nA federal judge has, for the second time, postponed sentencing for six former Mississippi cops who pleaded guilty to a long list of state and federal charges for torturing two Black men.\n\nSentencing had been set to begin on January 16, but a court hearing schedule shows that US District Judge Tom Lee has pushed back sentencing to March 19. In October, he granted motions from some former officers to delay sentencing after their attorneys said they needed more time to evaluate sentencing reports and prepare objections.\n\nThe men admitted in August to subjecting Michael Corey Jenkins and Eddie Terrell Parker to numerous acts of racially motivated, violent torture. In a January 2023 episode, a group of six officers burst into a home without a warrant and assaulted Jenkins and Parker with stun guns, a sex toy, and other objects, prosecutors said in court, reading a lengthy description of the abuse.\n\nAfter a mock execution went awry when Jenkins was shot in the mouth, they devised a coverup that included planting drugs and a gun. False charges stood against Jenkins and Parker for months.\n\nThe conspiracy unraveled after one officer told the sheriff he had lied , leading to confessions from the others.\n\nFormer Rankin County sheriff's Deputies Brett McAlpin, Hunter Elward, Christian Dedmon, Jeffrey Middleton and Daniel Opdyke, and former Richland city police Officer Joshua Hartfield, who was off duty during the assault, pleaded guilty to numerous federal and state charges, including assault, conspiracy and obstruction of justice.\n\nThey agreed to prosecutor-recommended sentences ranging from five to 30 years, although the judge isn't bound by that agreement. Time served for separate convictions at the state level will run concurrently with the potentially longer federal sentences.\n\nThe charges followed an investigation by The Associated Press that linked some of the deputies to at least four violent encounters with Black men since 2019 that left two dead and another with lasting injuries.\n\nProsecutors say some of the officers called themselves the \"Goon Squad\" because of their willingness to use excessive force and cover up attacks.\n\nJump to"

The cops are now suing him for 'emotional distress' and 'embarrassment.'\n\nRap artist Afroman is being sued by seven police officers who say his music videos inappropriately used footage of them raiding his home.\n\nIn a lawsuit dated March 13, four deputies, two sergeants, and one detective from Adams County Sheriff's Office in Ohio accused the rapper of profiting off their \"humiliation\" and \"mental distress.\"\n\nThey demanded up to $100,000 of the proceeds from his songs, music videos, concert tickets, and merchandise sales, which they say were promoted using footage of the cops without their consent, per the lawsuit seen by Insider.\n\nThe officers had a search warrant to raid Afroman's home in August. Afroman, whose real name is Joseph Foreman, was cited in the warrant, a copy of which was obtained by FOX affiliate WXIX-TV reporter Ken Baker. The warrant was issued for an investigation into possession of illegal drugs or drug paraphernalia, as well as kidnapping.\n\nForeman was not present when police arrived at his home. But his wife filmed the raid , and the rapper also obtained footage from his family's security cameras. He was not charged with any crime after the raid.\n\nForeman then featured the clips in music videos on YouTube for at least two of his songs.\n\n\"Lemon Pound Cake\" features Foreman singing about how the officers sought to find drugs in his home, but instead discovered lemon pound cake on the kitchen counter.\n\nIn \"Will You Help Me Repair My Door,\" Foreman uses clips of the officers looking through his possessions.\n\nThe officers' lawsuit said they received death threats because of the music videos and several social media posts Foreman made with the footage. They also said they \"suffered embarrassment, ridicule, emotional distress, humiliation, and loss of reputation.\"\n\nThe complaint also demands that the rapper stop using footage of the officers on social media and in his music videos.\n\nIn a Thursday Instagram post responding to the lawsuit, Foreman said he plans to counter-sue.\n\n\"I am a law-abiding taxpaying citizens who was violated by criminals camouflaged by law-enforcement!\" he wrote.\n\n\"My video footage is my property,\" he added.\n\nThe Adams County Sheriff's Office and an attorney for Foreman did not immediately respond to Insider's requests for comment sent after business hours.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Police officers are trained to frame their police reports to deceive, former cop turned academic says\n\nWhen Thomas Nolan was a lieutenant at the Boston Police Department from 1995 to 2004, he was the go-to guy for cops on the force needing help crafting their police reports after an on-duty use of force.\n\nIn his 27 years on the force, Nolan was never much of a \"street cop,\" he told Insider, but \"I could write pretty well.\"\n\nHe'd routinely advise his subordinates to incorporate a short list of buzzwords in their reports to frame themselves as the hero and the suspect - who might have been injured or killed - out as the aggressor. Those use of force reports ultimately were chock-full of words like \"resist,\" \"overcome,\" \"vigorous,\" \"violent,\" \"subdue,\" \"fear,\"and  \"attack,\" Nolan said, even if they were exaggerations.\n\nNow an associate professor of sociology at Emmanuel College, Nolan regrets taking part in what he believes is the systemic deception that is police report writing.\n\n\"I thought these cops were out there doing the right thing and catching bad guys, and oftentimes did it in ways that might not pass legal muster, and I got them over the hurdle,\" Nolan told Insider. \"I thought that was something that was my contribution, my necessary contribution.\"\n\nNolan has come to realize that \"framing the narrative\" to demonize people who were, in some cases, victims is widespread in American policing and it bolsters a police culture of misconduct, where officers are trained and socialized to believe they're above the law.\n\nThe rise in cellphone video and police body cameras might be the beginning of the end of this kind of misrepresentation, though, as more frequently the public is seeing high profile cases where the initial police report and department statement on use of force incidents doesn't line up with what clearly occurred in the recorded evidence.\n\nFollowing the killing of George Floyd, for example, Minneapolis police said he died from \"medical incident during police interaction.\" There was no mention in the initial statement of the nine minutes and 29 seconds that Derek Chauvin pinned Floyd to the ground with his knee while the man begged for his life until he stopped breathing.\n\nIn the 2019 arrest of Ronald Greene , Louisiana State troopers said the man died in a car crash following a police chase. This narrative lived on for two years until the Associated Press obtained and published body camera footage from the scene that showed troopers stunning, hitting, and dragging Greene on the ground outside of his car as he apologized for leading them on a chase and telling them he was scared.\n\nIt was later learned that the ranking Louisiana trooper at the scene tried to cover up the incident by denying the existence of his body-camera footage, the AP reported.\n\nWidely reported inconsistencies like these have caused the public and the media to grow more skeptical of police narratives as controversial use of force encounters come to light.\n\n\"What we've seen unfold over the years since videos have become just everyday ubiquitous depictions of police interactions with the public, is that there's pretty solid evidence that the police have misrepresented and mischaracterized incidents they're involved in,\" Nolan said. \"The recordings give substance to the skepticism that many people now have about police and their version of the events\"\n\nIn 2019, Nolan published \"Perilous Policing,\" a social sciences textbook that examines law enforcement in America.\n\nOne of the chapters is dedicated to how police report writing can be - and often is - manipulated to misrepresent and protect officers involved in questionable conduct on the job.\n\n\"This stilted, imprecise 'legalese' is the commonly used verbiage found in the police lexicon and forms the base of the narrative that police use throughout the United States,\" he wrote in the book. \"The purpose of the narrative is ultimately to exculpate the police from any blame or allegation the use of force being described was unnecessary, inappropriate, excessive, or unlawful.\"\n\nNolan told Insider that when he sees stories about police incidents he's capable of reading between the lines.\n\nTo him, unarmed robbery almost always translates to shoplifting, for example. Another trick is for officers to list themselves as a victim in a report in an effort to justify their use of force, he said.\n\n\"A use of force report, they're all the same,\" he said. \"They basically say that ...  the officer was met with 'vigorous resistance,' or maybe 'was attacked' and in the attempt to overcome this resistance, the officer - and they always describe themselves in the third person - was forced and had no other choice but to use the force.\"\n\nThis kind of misrepresentation is less common in the routine incident reports, where officers are simply filling in the blanks. \"The real artwork\" comes in during narrative writing, which is seen in use of force reports, Nolan said.\n\nThe goal, he said, is to paint the officers involved in the \"most favorable light.\"\n\n\"It's something that I was trained in. It's handed down. It's a skill that can be an art form,\" Nolan said. \"I was very adept at crafting narratives, so the police would come in, officers off the street, and describe what they had done. I had to assist them and train them to put it into the language that was going to be palatable to the higher-ups and to the public.\"\n\nNot every former officer agrees with Nolan's take on police report writing, though.\n\nAlfred Titus, a former NYPD homicide detective and hostage negotiator, told Insider that police are trained in report writing, but deception is not built into that curriculum. Justification is.\n\nIf an officer used force, that behavior is only allowed under specific legal circumstances, he said. So when they fill out the report, they need to make it clear why they believed that force was necessary.\n\n\"No. There are no protocols in place that teach an officer how to hide facts or skew facts so that they are in their favor or so they do not look liable,\" said Titus, who is now a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice. \"Police officers are trained to describe the incident in a way that the laws or violations that occurred are clearly spelled out.\"\n\nFor example, in an assault case, it's common to explain that the victim was \"placed in fear.\" If there was resisting arrest, the phrases \"flailing of the arms\" or \"refused to be handcuffed\" are commonly seen in reports, he said.\n\n\"Terminology like that is commonly used in police reports to just match it up with the actual laws, in the way that the statutes are written,\" Titus said. \"So if, if an officer is charging resisting arrest, or if he decided that he had to use his taser, he would have to justify that in the language that he used in the police report. That part is true.\"\n\nTitus told Insider that he can't think of one case in his 23 year career where an officer he knew at the NYPD wrote a police report that was inconsistent with what was later proved to be the facts of the case.\n\nThere are cases where justification of force could go overboard, Titus said, pointing to the case of former Minneapolis Police Officer Derek Chauvin.\n\n\"Obviously in the George Floyd case, there was no justification for that whatsoever. The officer definitely overstepped his boundaries and was extremely abusive,\"  he said, noting that Chauvin was ultimately charged and convicted of Floyd's murder.\n\n\"This is not really a report writing issue, but I do recall that during that Derek Chauvin claimed [at trial] that the crowd was so loud and it was so concerning that he lost focus. It was one of his excuses for why he didn't realize that his knee was on [Floyd's] neck for so long,\" Titus said. \"With something like that, it's clear as a law enforcement officer you should be more than used to dealing with crowds. If you have a perpetrator in custody, that should obviously be your focus.\"\n\nTitus said that police report writing is a topic that comes up at periodic service training. If issues are showing up in reports, that's something training officers might address, he said.\n\n\"Towards the end of my career in 2016, the detective bureau had almost quarterly training for the detectives where we would go in and they would give an update on everything that has been changing and then they would address report writing,\" Titus said. \"But detective report writing is far more excessive than police officer report writing, so it's kind of two different things. But there is training and if that was found to be a problem, then it would be addressed there.\"\n\nNolan said that departments are going to have to get stricter about ensuring reports are as accurate as possible if they want to rebuild trust with communities in an age where video recordings are readily available.\n\nHe's not aware of any reform efforts happening in this area, but said some leadership have built policies that say deception is not OK.\n\nFormer Boston Police Commissioner Ed Davis, for example, instituted a \"zero tolerance policy\" for lying in reports, Nolan said.\n\n\"He said that any police officer who was found to have lied in any official reporting or any court testimony would be terminated,\" Nolan said. \"That was his public proclamation. Now, as far as anyone knows, no one ever gotten fired for lying, but it was a step in the right direction.\"\n\nFormer NYPD Police Commissioner James P. O'Neill announced a similar policy in 2018 regarding lying under oath.\n\nThe NYPD has a written policy that identifies penalties for making false of misleading statements.\n\nIntentionally making a false official statement comes with a presumptive penalty of termination, according to the policy seen by Insider.\n\nIntentionally making a misleading statement comes with the lesser presumptive penalty of losing 30 vacation days and dismissal probation. Dismissal probation is when an officer is dismissed from the department, signs a letter acknowledging that, but the penalty is suspended for a year while they are on probation.\n\nMaking a false statement that is not proven to be intentional is still cause for penalty, but only at the loss of 10 vacation days.\n\nIn 2018, there were 12 officers accused of making false statements and all of them pleaded or were found to be guilty, according to data in a publicly available NYPD discipline report from that year.\n\nOf them, one was dismissed, seven were given dismissal probation, and seven were given penalty days.\n\nNolan said that the biggest factor in determining whether an officer will likely be fired for being misleading in their reports is usually how high profile the incident becomes.\n\nHe points to the 2015 killing of Walter Scott in South Carolina.\n\nIn that case, then-officer Michael Slager stopped Scott for a broken brake light and, in the end, shot him in the back as he fled.\n\nSlager was found to have lied in his initial report - saying that Scott had attacked him - which contradicted video that surfaced later.\n\nSlager has since pleaded guilty to a federal civil rights charge and is serving a 20 year sentence.\n\nJust like Chauvin, Slager was fired before charges came down, when the video of the killing was made public.\n\n\"The chief fired that police officer and I think he fired him, not because of any kind of wrongdoing on the part of the police officer, but because of the widespread outrage that followed the release and distribution of this video,\" Nolan said.\n\nMore often, though, police leadership will take the side of the officer, disputing any inconsistencies by saying the video didn't show the whole encounter.\n\n\"And oftentimes it doesn't,\" Nolan said. \"It's not to say that there are people manipulating or editing videos, but oftentimes we don't see what may have precipitated the event that we witnessed on the recording, and that may be relevant.\"\n\nNolan said that this narrative, though, is \"an out\" for departments and their spokespeople so they might be able to continue deceptive practices even when recordings do exist.\n\n\"It's my sense that the police are going to continue this,\" Nolan said. \"It's formulaic. This kind of stilted legal-sounding jargon that the police use is a way that they use language to give some sort of an official imprimatur that this is a justification for what they did.\"\n\nJump to"

The city's investigation confirmed allegations that Portillo had received a DUI prior to being hired as police chief, which he did not disclose in his job application, according to the outlet.\n\nBlackstone told the outlet that the city decided to disband the police department rather than conduct individual investigations into every officer. Any officer who wants to stay with the department must reapply once the city hires a new police chief, CBS reported.\n\n\"We're going to have a new police department that everybody in the community can trust,\" Blackstone told the outlet.\n\nIn an interview with KHOU , Portillo defended his vetting of the officers he hired, saying that several of them had faced \"retaliation\" at their previous police departments.\n\n\"There's more to just what's on paper,\" Portillo told the outlet. \"That's where I rely on my captain and my background investigators to go in and say 'hey, what's the truth behind this?'\"\n\nSheriff's deputies from the nearby Smith County Sheriff's Office are helping respond to calls in Coffee City until the town can hire a new police force, according to CBS .\n\nJump to"

      "text": "'Cops' Show Canceled Amid Worldwide Protests Against Police Violence\n\nEric Deggans\n\nSince 1989, Cops has made riveting television from verité footage of arrests and emergency calls - often capturing scenes of police interacting with clueless suspects - filmed by riding along with police officers.\n\nBut the long-running unscripted show has been canceled after 32 seasons. The Paramount Network dropped it amid widespread protests nationwide about policing.\n\nThe show's 33rd season was scheduled to debut next Monday.\n\nThe Paramount Network issued a terse statement Tuesday, saying, \"Cops is not on the Paramount Network and we don't have any current or future plans for it to return.\"\n\nThe series ends as protests following George Floyd's killing by Minneapolis officers have motivated a fresh look at how shows like C ops boost the image of police.\n\nFloyd's death launched a debate over systemic prejudice in mass culture. HBO Max decided to pull the classic film Gone With The Wind from its library over racist depictions in its story until the company crafts a way to include context and a denunciation of its racism to accompany the movie.\n\nCops is one of the first examples of unscripted, so-called \"reality TV.\" It debuted in 1989 on the then-new Fox network, before CBS' Survivor or MTV's The Real World .  It was a low-cost production embedding camera crews with police as they answered calls, promising a transparent, authentic look at policing.\n\nBut critics noted troubling issues. Despite a disclaimer at each episode's start saying the people depicted were \"innocent before proven guilty in a court of law,\" the footage often suggested otherwise, with the show rarely following up to find out if the charges were ever proven.\n\nThere was always the suspicion that the very presence of cameras might encourage officers to arrest or detain people to create exciting footage. Episodes could seem like a cavalcade of working class people caught in degrading situations, sometimes connected to addiction issues, encouraging viewers to look down on suspects.\n\nA podcast dissecting Cops , called Running From Cops , alleged that some officers unfairly pressured suspects to allow the show to broadcast their arrest and that some camera people were armed and overtly helped police. In one episode of the podcast, Host Dan Taberksi says that before cellphone videos, Cops was \"the dominant cultural depiction of how real policing works in America.\"\n\nShows similar to Cops have also faced controversy : Live PD is connected to an incident in Texas where a black man died after he was shot with a stun-gun during a traffic stop while the program's cameras were rolling.\n\nStill, Live PD is one of the most-watched shows on cable; a spokesman for A&E says the channel is evaluating when it may return.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Reform pressures have many cops leaving the job. APU GOMES/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nA demonstrator holds her hands up while she kneels in front of the Police at the Anaheim City Hall on June 1, 2020 in Anaheim, California. Reform pressures have many cops leaving the job.\n\nThe historic calls for police accountability, reform and attempts at racial reckoning have left police departments nationwide struggling to keep the officers they have and attract new ones to the force.\n\nThe crisis comes as many cities continue to grapple with the fallout from the pandemic and sharp increases in shootings and murders.\n\nIn many places, police morale has plunged and retirements and resignations have soared. A June survey of nearly 200 departments by the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF), a nonprofit think tank, shows a startling 45% increase in the retirement rate and a nearly 20% increase in resignations in 2020-21 compared to the previous year.\n\n\"We are in uncharted territory right now,\" PERF's Executive Director Chuck Wexler says. \"Policing is being challenged in ways I haven't seen, ever.\"\n\nThe exodus is affecting departments large, small and in between. The research group's survey shows that in the largest departments with 500 hundred or more officers, the retirement rate increased by nearly 30%. Overall, new police hiring has dropped 5%.\n\nAnd the timing of these staffing problems couldn't be worse: multiple cities are seeing startling increases in shootings and murders just as more areas start to return to a sense of normalcy following 15 months of pandemic-induced disruptions. Large cities have seen a 24% spike in killings so far this year , following a more than 30% rise in homicides last year. Overall crime figures, however, went down during the pandemic.\n\n\"So at that very moment you're hoping you can put police out there to try to deal with crime, you're seeing the workforce shrinking with an unprecedented number of retirements and resignations,\" Wexler says.\n\nPresident Biden addressed the sharp rise in homicides and shootings Wednesday. He touted his administration's plan to tackle gun crime by cracking down on gun sellers who fail to run required background checks. The president is also redirecting some $350 billion in federal stimulus money toward police departments in cities where crime is up. The spike in violent crime follows nearly two decades in which violent crime trended downward. \"This takes us back to levels, homicide rates, that we would have seen in the late '90s,\" says law professor Ronald Wright at Wake Forest University.\n\nExit interviews in the PERF survey and other data show that a key factor in the police resignations and retirements is the national conversation and protests that center on changing what the police do , how they're funded, and how to better hold officers accountable for abuse of force and racial bias.\n\nSome cities are pushing for police to no longer be the first responders for persons in a mental health homeless or substance use crisis.  Studies show that nearly a quarter of fatal police encounters followed calls about \"disruptive behavior\" directly tied to a person's mental illness and/or substance abuse disorder.\n\n\"Let's be honest, the conversation nationally has really been very, very much questioning police authority, what they do, how they do it,\" PERF's Wexler says. \"So if you wake up every day and that's what you hear, it takes its toll.\"\n\nFor some officers that toll means  a career change.\n\n\"You know, cops need to be resilient and they are. But for some, if they have an opportunity to do something different, that's what's happening,\" he says.\n\nThe recruitment challenge is likely to only get worse as the economy further rebounds in the months ahead. Recruitment was already a serious challenge before the pandemic and racial justice protests, as we've reported .\n\nMaking matters worse, it can take on average six months to a year or longer to recruit, hire and train an officer.\n\nAs Miami-Dade Police Chief Art Acevedo recently put it in an interview with NPR, addressing the crime surge amid the recruitment challenges is about more than expanding patrols in high-crime areas.\n\n\"It's also making sure that you have the proper supervision, the proper oversight and the proper mindset in terms of how we approach the way we treat the community,\" Acevedo said. \"I think when we do that, people appreciate you. If you harass them, then they become, I think, upset, and you start heading your relationship in the wrong direction.\"\n\nActivists and analysts alike say police leaders can and should do more to actively engage in the fraught and complex national conversation about race and law enforcement underway.\n\n\"How do we find a middle ground between where the police need to be and where the reform issues are?\" Wexler asks, noting that the areas with the highest spikes in shootings are among the most economically disadvantaged or in communities with people of color. \"So the people who most need the police right now, that's what we should be concerned about. Maybe there's an opportunity to to see a way to find a middle ground.\"\n\nThe recruiting and retention crisis is affecting departments across the nation. While not a representative sample of the nation's more than 18,000 police departments, the PERF survey includes responses from departments small and large and nonetheless offers insight into a festering problem for American policing.\n\nIn Minneapolis this April former officer Derek Chauvin was convicted of multiple murder counts in the death of George Floyd. Since his murder the police department there has lost nearly 300 officers from attrition, disability leave and retirements, Minnesota Public Radio reports. So far this year the number of gunshot victims in Minneapolis is up 90% from last year .\n\nIn Seattle, police leaders are warning of a staffing crisis after more than 180 officers quit last year and almost 70 others have left so far this year, the AP reports. Exit interviews show the majority who left tired of City Council policies, including threats of layoffs and cuts as well as an anti-police climate.\n\nIn Philadelphia from January through April of this year at least 79 Philadelphia officers took the city's Deferred Retirement Option Program, meaning they intend to retire within four years, according to the mayor's office. In the same time period last year, just 13 officers made that move.\n\nNPR member station WGBH reports that in Watertown, Mass., Police Chief Michael Lawn posted on social media to try to attract new applicants last year, just six people attended the event and only two dozen took the civil service test. It was among the suburban Boston town's lowest turnout in department history.\n\n\"This job has changed,\" Chief Lawn told WGBH News. \"Nobody wants this job anymore.\"\n\nChandler, Ariz., is now offering cash incentives up to $5,000 to try to attract and hire new officers and dispatchers, as NPR member station KJZZ reports. In 2020, the chief in Tempe abruptly resigned. The station says departments across Arizona report recruitment challenges.\n\nIn comments to PERF for their report police leaders make clear the challenges are the worst they've seen. PERF granted the officials anonymity so they could speak freely.\n\n\"We have seen an approximate 40% reduction in applicant packets this last fiscal year. In addition, we are seeing fewer 'above average' candidates,\" one official wrote, adding. \"The current rhetoric and negativity surrounding law enforcement is having a negative impact on the number and quality of applicants we recruit.\"\n\nAnother senior police official told PERF that many of those are applying are not meeting the minimum requirements. They are \"failing either the background investigation or polygraph. Minority hiring, a significant goal, has been considerably more difficult,\" the official wrote, adding. \"Police accountability has been a source of conversation and concern among those who are hired, and those who left.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Images by Steve Skinner Photogra/Getty Images hide caption\n\nCritics say American officers should be trained in defensive tactics, especially empty-hand techniques, so that they depend  less on tasers and guns.\n\nA couple of summers ago in Poulsbo, Wash., in a crowded park before a fireworks show, a man named Stonechild Chiefstick was bothering people, according to police. They got complaints about him seeming intoxicated and \"doing crazy stuff.\"\n\nAt first, the cops just talked to him about it. But when they got a report that he'd threatened someone with a screwdriver, they went to arrest him. The encounter ended with police shooting and killing him.\n\n\"I don't understand it. I don't understand why they just shoot,\" says Trishandra Pickup, his former fiancée and mother of his children.\n\nThe interaction was caught on a body camera , but it was knocked to the ground before the crucial moment. Some witnesses say Chiefstick lunged at the officers with the screwdriver before he was shot. The police department ruled the shooting justified.\n\nBut Pickup says police exaggerated the threat from Chiefstick.\n\n\"You can't just shoot and kill everyone when you feel they might do something,\" she says. \"And it to me seems like they should be a little more brave.\"\n\nPickup is part of a coalition of people who've lost loved ones to police shootings, and who successfully pushed through a package of new state laws restricting police use of force and changing the way it's investigated.\n\nPolice reform activists often point to the example of other developed countries, where police rarely shoot people. They ask why the U.S. can't be more like the United Kingdom, where most officers are still unarmed and the number of people they kill every year is in single digits .\n\nPolicing experts say that's apples-and-oranges.\n\n\"You really can't compare the two countries,\" says Bill Bratton, who was twice commissioner of the New York Police Department, as well as chief of the Los Angeles Police Department. He's written a new memoir about policing, The Profession.\n\n\"In America, you have the issue of gun violence,\" he says. \"It drives me crazy when  we have these comparisons with other western civilized countries - France, Germany - nobody has the level of gun violence we have and the threat that guns create for our officers.\"\n\nThat's certainly true. Forty-eight American officers were shot and killed last year , a danger their British counterparts rarely face.\n\nYet, even when you take guns out of the equation - when someone is clearly holding something else, such as a screwdriver or a knife - American police still shoot and kill far more often than their European counterparts.\n\nWhere it's assumed in the U.S. that rushing at a police officer with a knife will get you shot, in the U.K. you're very likely to survive.\n\n\"There is a greater investment in training, in terms of dealing with people who have behavioral problems,\" says Jerry Ratcliffe, a professor of criminal justice at Temple University who spent years as a police officer in the U.K.  \"You can find videos online of British police showing a level of restraint , and waiting until [more] officers turn up with shields.\"\n\nHe recalls having to do repeated refresher training on how to use shields or nightsticks to subdue someone enough to wrest a blade from his hand, a kind of training he says is rare in the U.S.\n\n\"Here, in too many instances, we see just a person walking around the street with a knife, and at some point they get within a certain distance of an officer, and lethal force is deployed,\" he says.\n\nBecause firearms are the biggest threat to officers in the U.S., he says, that taints all interactions, even when the person in question isn't holding a gun.\n\n\"Before the officers leave the academy they're already sensitized to the perceived heightened level of risk that police officers face in society,\" Ratcliffe says. \"And I think that's the big difference between training in the United States and training in other countries that I've worked with.\"\n\nSome people inside American policing see that tendency, too. Brandon del Pozo, who spent 19 years as an NYPD officer, says police academies have convinced officers that \"the closer you are to a person, as a suspect, the more dangerous it is.\"\n\nHe points to the legacy of lessons such as the \"21-foot-rule,\" the controversial notion that it's unsafe to let someone with a blade get closer than that.\n\n\"Things like that have encouraged cops to keep their distance and use weapons more often,\" del Pozo says.\n\nTwo years ago, when he was police chief in Burlington, Vt., del Pozo published an op-ed in The New York Times calling on American police to take a lesson from unarmed colleagues in the U.K. and try to rely less on their guns - even when facing someone with a knife.\n\n\"Part of valor is taking risks for the right reasons. And the sanctity of human life is a good reason to take a risk,\" del Pozo says.\n\nBut that's not an easy sell. Chad Lyman is a Las Vegas police officer and defensive tactics trainer. He doesn't recommend American police start trying to grab knives out of people's hands - in part because of the risk to bystanders. \"If, in the battle for the knife, my right hand gets injured to the point it doesn't function, I'm never going to lethal force,\" Lyman says. \"If I lose to this guy, he'll just start stabbing everybody else who's got their cell phone out, watching him stab me.\"\n\nAt the same time, Lyman agrees that American police can learn from the British. He says American officers aren't trained enough in defensive tactics, especially in empty-hand techniques, so they end up depending too much on tasers - which often don't work - and guns.\n\n\"We're moving away from those days when we would just weigh in and start grabbing guys. And controlling them and using force, in a grappling context,\" Lyman says. \"I do think more grappling is the answer.\"\n\nBut if American police were to start \"grappling\" more, there would be a price to pay. Comparing 2019 statistics for the U.S. and the U.K., NPR found that British officers reported being assaulted and injured at nearly four times the rate as their American counterparts.\n\nThere's another factor to consider: the gun on the American officer's belt. Unlike the British, American officers know that if they get close enough to wrestle with someone, they're close enough to have the gun stolen and used against them.\n\nJerry Ratcliffe, the criminal justice professor, says Americans should be honest about all this, when they ask officers to wait longer before pulling the trigger. \"Are we prepared to accept the likelihood that police homicides are going to increase?\" Ratcliffe asks. \"And are we being reasonable in asking police officers to accept that increased risk?\"\n\nElaine Simons thinks so.\n\n\"It's very hard, but it's also a responsibility that I think comes with having a badge,\" says Simons.\n\nShe lost her foster son to a police shooting in Auburn, Wash., and she's part of the coalition that pushed through the stricter use-of-force law in Washington state. \"You have a dual responsibility to protect and make sure that people are safe,\" she says. \"And yet, impacted families are not feeling that we're having that same due process for our loved ones.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

They administered Narcan, a medication that reverses opioid poisoning.\n\n\"She's breathing,\" a cop says. \"Stay with me!\"\n\nThe Tavares police department blamed the incident on fentanyl. Local officials declined NPR's requests for an interview, as did Bannick. Speaking with WKMG , a television station in Orlando, she said she felt lucky to be alive.\n\n\"If I didn't have backup there, I wouldn't be here today,\" she said soon after the incident.\n\nReports of police suffering severe medical symptoms after touching or inhaling powdered fentanyl are common, occurring \"every few weeks\" around the U.S. according to experts interviewed by NPR.\n\nBut many experts say these officers aren't experiencing fentanyl or opioid overdoses.\n\n\"This has never happened,\" said Dr. Ryan Marino, a toxicologist and emergency room physician who studies addiction at Case Western Reserve University. \"There has never been an overdose through skin contact or accidentally inhaling fentanyl.\"\n\nMany police officers clearly believe fentanyl poses a significant risk. The synthetic opioid is powerful, killing tens of thousands of Americans every year.\n\nBut medical experts say it's difficult to get fentanyl into the body. That's why people addicted to the drug often smoke it or inject it using needles.\n\nSeizures of fentanyl have escalated in recent years and the synthetic opioid is common on American streets. Many police feel their health is threatened by contact with trace amounts of the drug. US Justice Department hide caption\n\nSeizures of fentanyl have escalated in recent years and the synthetic opioid is common on American streets. Many police feel their health is threatened by contact with trace amounts of the drug.\n\n\"Fentanyl does not pass through the skin efficiently or well,\" Marino said. \"The dry powder form that's encountered in street drugs is not going to pass through the skin in any meaningful way.\"\n\nResearchers also say the risk of fentanyl powder poisoning someone when it's airborne like dust is extremely low.\n\n\"There's never been a toxicologically confirmed case,\" said Brandon Del Pozo, a former police chief who studies addiction and drug policy at Brown University.\" The idea of it hanging in the air and getting breathed in is highly highly implausible - it's nearly impossible.\"\n\nNPR reached out to the Tavares Florida police department and Officer Bannick asking for toxicology reports or other information confirming she was affected by fentanyl. They declined to make that medical information public.\n\nWe also contacted numerous other law enforcement and government agencies, as well as researchers around the U.S.\n\nWe couldn't find a single case of a police officer who reported being poisoned by fentanyl or overdosing after encountering the street drug that was confirmed by toxicology reports.\n\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sent a statement to NPR saying the agency does believe some officers nationwide have experienced medical symptoms after encountering fentanyl. None of those cases involved actual overdoses and none appeared life-threatening.\n\n\"The health effects...were such that responders needed medical attention and could not continue performing their duties,\" said Dr. L Casey Chosewood with the CDC's National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health.\n\nOne 2021 case study cited by CDC of a police department in Ohio found common symptoms described by police included lightheadedness, palpitations, and nausea.\n\nDel Pozo believes the real risk to police officers from street fentanyl isn't accidental overdose. He says the more serious health impact is being caused by anxiety and stress, driven by fear.\n\n\"Imagine you do a job every day where you just think being near a certain car or a certain person [who might have fentanyl] could kill you,\" Del Pozo said.\n\nOfficials walk past images of illegal drugs outside the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building on May 13, 2021, in Los Angeles. Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP hide caption\n\nOfficials walk past images of illegal drugs outside the Edward R. Roybal Federal Building on May 13, 2021, in Los Angeles.\n\n\"It's a real mental health problem for officers. It's just not necessary to have that fear.\"\n\nDel Pozo said many reported fentanyl overdoses among police involve symptoms that look more like panic attacks than opioid overdoses.\n\n\"So when an officer just at the thought of being exposed to fentanyl falls over, goes unconscious or panics, that's a health problem. That's something the officer needs help for.\"\n\nExperts say this heightened fear grew after the first fentanyl warnings were issued by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration half a decade ago.\n\nIn June 2017, Chuck Rosenberg, head of the DEA under Presidents Obama and Trump, appeared in a video urging cops to treat fentanyl as a major risk.\n\n\"Fentanyl is deadly,\" Rosenberg warned. \"Exposure to an amount equivalent to a few grains of sand can kill you.\"\n\nA few months later, however, toxicology researchers issued a report contradicting that assessment . They too could find no cases where officers had been poisoned by fentanyl.\n\n\"The risk of clinically significant exposure to emergency responders is extremely low,\" they concluded.\n\nThe DEA's website still includes a warning to police about the risks of brief skin contact or inhalation of airborne powder.\n\nResearchers say the risk to police officers from street fentanyl exposure is \"extremely low,\" but warnings like this one can be found on the Drug Enforcement Administration's website.

As the data shows, it's complicated.\n\nMartin Kaste\n\nPolice officers are on trial or facing charges in multiple state-level murder cases this fall. But if you look at national numbers, the trend toward more police prosecutions is not that clear.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: This fall, a number of police officers are on trial, accused of killing people in the line of duty - three in Colorado, another three in Washington state, and more trials are looming as five officers in Memphis have been charged with second-degree murder for the beating death of Tyre Nichols in Memphis. For years, the Black Lives Matter movement demanded that more police be prosecuted after such deaths. And as NPR's Martin Kaste reports, some think that may now be happening. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Elaine Simons believes things are changing. In 2019, a former foster child of hers, a young man named Jesse Sarey, was shot to death in a struggle with a police officer in Auburn, Wash. At first, she says, the criminal justice system responded slowly. ELAINE SIMONS: It wasn't until the murder of George Floyd in 2020 that it became a catalyst. Something woke up the world. KASTE: After George Floyd, the officer who shot Simons' foster son was charged with second-degree murder and assault. Simons is waiting for the trial to start, probably early next year. SIMONS: It does something to your spirit, you know? We want resolution. KASTE: In the meantime, she's planning to watch the trial of three other cops charged with murder or manslaughter in an unrelated death in nearby Tacoma. She also stays in touch with families of other people killed by police. She just came back from New York, where she met the mother of Eric Garner. His death in 2014 sparked protests, especially when the officer who wrestled him to the ground was not criminally charged. Now, Simons says, families like Garner's are seeing what she calls a glimmer of hope. SIMONS: Because they're starting to see, in different states, charges are starting to go forward, and that resolution is starting to look like almost a reality for a lot of people. KASTE: But if you look at national numbers, it's not clear that things have changed that much. Criminologist Philip Stinson has been counting the number of state and local officers charged with murder or manslaughter for on-duty shootings every year since 2005. PHILIP STINSON: Well, it certainly - it goes up after about 2014. But it's just a few cases. We go from maybe eight or nine or 15 to 15 or 20 instead. KASTE: In other words, the number of cops charged for shooting deaths has gone from single digits a decade ago to low double digits now. STINSON: And in the years where we have seen increases in terms of the numbers of officers charged, what we have noticed is that quite often that's a result of several officers being charged out of the same criminal incident. So it makes it look like there's more going on there. KASTE: Instead of counting how many cops have been charged, you could count deaths and see how many of those lead to charges. That's how the Mapping Police Violence project does it. The founder is Samuel Sinyangwe. He says the percentage of deaths that lead to criminal charges has been holding steady - between 1 and 3%, though there may be some lag time in his stats. SAMUEL SINYANGWE: There are cases where prosecutors will charge an officer, you know, many months or even a year after the case. And so the numbers for more recent years might go up slightly. KASTE: One reason to think that the numbers might go up is that in some places, the laws have changed. Washington state, for instance, lowered the bar for convicting an officer. It's no longer necessary to prove, quote, \"actual malice.\" California tightened the rules for when cops may use deadly force, and Colorado made it a crime for an officer to fail to intervene when another one uses excessive force. TED BUCK: The threshold, I think, for charging an officer has most definitely changed over the last four or five years. KASTE: Ted Buck is an attorney who defends police in civil actions in Washington state. He doesn't do many criminal cases for police because he says those are still relatively rare. And he doesn't expect criminal prosecutions to increase much either, despite that lower legal threshold. In part, he says, this is because of all the video evidence that we have now. Yes, it's true, he says, that video sometimes makes the case against an officer... BUCK: But that same huge amount of evidence that is now available through video footage is also being looked at in all these other cases, and it's leading prosecutors to decide not to charge. KASTE: And Buck thinks that's as it should be. Both he and criminologist Philip Stinson agree that the prosecution numbers are basically static right now. But while Buck believes that's because most police do the right thing, Stinson sees it as evidence that prosecutors are still hesitant to go after cops and that juries are still reluctant to convict them.

She also stays in touch with families of other people killed by police. She just came back from New York, where she met the mother of Eric Garner. His death in 2014 sparked protests, especially when the officer who wrestled him to the ground was not criminally charged. Now, Simons says, families like Garner's are seeing what she calls a glimmer of hope. SIMONS: Because they're starting to see, in different states, charges are starting to go forward, and that resolution is starting to look like almost a reality for a lot of people. KASTE: But if you look at national numbers, it's not clear that things have changed that much. Criminologist Philip Stinson has been counting the number of state and local officers charged with murder or manslaughter for on-duty shootings every year since 2005. PHILIP STINSON: Well, it certainly - it goes up after about 2014. But it's just a few cases. We go from maybe eight or nine or 15 to 15 or 20 instead. KASTE: In other words, the number of cops charged for shooting deaths has gone from single digits a decade ago to low double digits now. STINSON: And in the years where we have seen increases in terms of the numbers of officers charged, what we have noticed is that quite often that's a result of several officers being charged out of the same criminal incident. So it makes it look like there's more going on there. KASTE: Instead of counting how many cops have been charged, you could count deaths and see how many of those lead to charges. That's how the Mapping Police Violence project does it. The founder is Samuel Sinyangwe. He says the percentage of deaths that lead to criminal charges has been holding steady - between 1 and 3%, though there may be some lag time in his stats. SAMUEL SINYANGWE: There are cases where prosecutors will charge an officer, you know, many months or even a year after the case. And so the numbers for more recent years might go up slightly. KASTE: One reason to think that the numbers might go up is that in some places, the laws have changed. Washington state, for instance, lowered the bar for convicting an officer. It's no longer necessary to prove, quote, \"actual malice.\" California tightened the rules for when cops may use deadly force, and Colorado made it a crime for an officer to fail to intervene when another one uses excessive force. TED BUCK: The threshold, I think, for charging an officer has most definitely changed over the last four or five years. KASTE: Ted Buck is an attorney who defends police in civil actions in Washington state. He doesn't do many criminal cases for police because he says those are still relatively rare. And he doesn't expect criminal prosecutions to increase much either, despite that lower legal threshold. In part, he says, this is because of all the video evidence that we have now. Yes, it's true, he says, that video sometimes makes the case against an officer... BUCK: But that same huge amount of evidence that is now available through video footage is also being looked at in all these other cases, and it's leading prosecutors to decide not to charge. KASTE: And Buck thinks that's as it should be. Both he and criminologist Philip Stinson agree that the prosecution numbers are basically static right now. But while Buck believes that's because most police do the right thing, Stinson sees it as evidence that prosecutors are still hesitant to go after cops and that juries are still reluctant to convict them.

For years, the Black Lives Matter movement demanded that more police be prosecuted after such deaths. And as NPR's Martin Kaste reports, some think that may now be happening. MARTIN KASTE, BYLINE: Elaine Simons believes things are changing. In 2019, a former foster child of hers, a young man named Jesse Sarey, was shot to death in a struggle with a police officer in Auburn, Wash. At first, she says, the criminal justice system responded slowly. ELAINE SIMONS: It wasn't until the murder of George Floyd in 2020 that it became a catalyst. Something woke up the world. KASTE: After George Floyd, the officer who shot Simons' foster son was charged with second-degree murder and assault. Simons is waiting for the trial to start, probably early next year.

It's no longer necessary to prove, quote, \"actual malice.\" California tightened the rules for when cops may use deadly force, and Colorado made it a crime for an officer to fail to intervene when another one uses excessive force. TED BUCK: The threshold, I think, for charging an officer has most definitely changed over the last four or five years. KASTE: Ted Buck is an attorney who defends police in civil actions in Washington state. He doesn't do many criminal cases for police because he says those are still relatively rare. And he doesn't expect criminal prosecutions to increase much either, despite that lower legal threshold. In part, he says, this is because of all the video evidence that we have now. Yes, it's true, he says, that video sometimes makes the case against an officer... BUCK: But that same huge amount of evidence that is now available through video footage is also being looked at in all these other cases, and it's leading prosecutors to decide not to charge. KASTE: And Buck thinks that's as it should be. Both he and criminologist Philip Stinson agree that the prosecution numbers are basically static right now. But while Buck believes that's because most police do the right thing, Stinson sees it as evidence that prosecutors are still hesitant to go after cops and that juries are still reluctant to convict them.

His death in 2014 sparked protests, especially when the officer who wrestled him to the ground was not criminally charged. Now, Simons says, families like Garner's are seeing what she calls a glimmer of hope. SIMONS: Because they're starting to see, in different states, charges are starting to go forward, and that resolution is starting to look like almost a reality for a lot of people. KASTE: But if you look at national numbers, it's not clear that things have changed that much. Criminologist Philip Stinson has been counting the number of state and local officers charged with murder or manslaughter for on-duty shootings every year since 2005. PHILIP STINSON: Well, it certainly - it goes up after about 2014. But it's just a few cases. We go from maybe eight or nine or 15 to 15 or 20 instead. KASTE: In other words, the number of cops charged for shooting deaths has gone from single digits a decade ago to low double digits now. STINSON: And in the years where we have seen increases in terms of the numbers of officers charged, what we have noticed is that quite often that's a result of several officers being charged out of the same criminal incident. So it makes it look like there's more going on there. KASTE: Instead of counting how many cops have been charged, you could count deaths and see how many of those lead to charges. That's how the Mapping Police Violence project does it. The founder is Samuel Sinyangwe.

BUCK: But that same huge amount of evidence that is now available through video footage is also being looked at in all these other cases, and it's leading prosecutors to decide not to charge. KASTE: And Buck thinks that's as it should be. Both he and criminologist Philip Stinson agree that the prosecution numbers are basically static right now. But while Buck believes that's because most police do the right thing, Stinson sees it as evidence that prosecutors are still hesitant to go after cops and that juries are still reluctant to convict them.

We go from maybe eight or nine or 15 to 15 or 20 instead. KASTE: In other words, the number of cops charged for shooting deaths has gone from single digits a decade ago to low double digits now. STINSON: And in the years where we have seen increases in terms of the numbers of officers charged, what we have noticed is that quite often that's a result of several officers being charged out of the same criminal incident. So it makes it look like there's more going on there. KASTE: Instead of counting how many cops have been charged, you could count deaths and see how many of those lead to charges. That's how the Mapping Police Violence project does it. The founder is Samuel Sinyangwe. He says the percentage of deaths that lead to criminal charges has been holding steady - between 1 and 3%, though there may be some lag time in his stats. SAMUEL SINYANGWE: There are cases where prosecutors will charge an officer, you know, many months or even a year after the case. And so the numbers for more recent years might go up slightly. KASTE: One reason to think that the numbers might go up is that in some places, the laws have changed. Washington state, for instance, lowered the bar for convicting an officer. It's no longer necessary to prove, quote, \"actual malice.\" California tightened the rules for when cops may use deadly force, and Colorado made it a crime for an officer to fail to intervene when another one uses excessive force. TED BUCK: The threshold, I think, for charging an officer has most definitely changed over the last four or five years. KASTE: Ted Buck is an attorney who defends police in civil actions in Washington state. He doesn't do many criminal cases for police because he says those are still relatively rare. And he doesn't expect criminal prosecutions to increase much either, despite that lower legal threshold. In part, he says, this is because of all the video evidence that we have now.

Experts say the risk is 'extremely low'\n\nARI SHAPIRO, HOST: There's widespread fear among police that they could be poisoned with fentanyl while on the job. The powerful drug is common on the streets these days, and fentanyl is often present when officers respond to an overdose. But medical experts say the danger to first responders has been exaggerated. They worry a fentanyl panic is harming police and putting the public at risk. NPR addiction correspondent Brian Mann reports. BRIAN MANN, BYLINE: Last December, Officer Courtney Bannick was on the job for the Tavares Police Department in Florida when she came into contact with powdered street fentanyl. The footage from another cop's body camera is frightening. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: She's ODing. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #2: ODing. MANN: She's ODing, officers say. Bannick is lowered to the ground and treated with Narcan, a medication that quickly reverses most opioid fentanyl overdoses. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #3: Keep breathing. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: All right. Stay with me, OK? (CROSSTALK) MANN: Speaking in December with WKMG News in Orlando, Bannick said she's lucky to be alive. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) COURTNEY BANNICK: If I didn't have backup there, I wouldn't be here today. MANN: The Tavares Police Department declined NPR's request for interviews, as did Bannick. Reports like this one of police being harmed by fentanyl occur regularly across the U.S. With the synthetic opioid now present in most of the country, many officers clearly believe they're in real danger. But Dr. Ryan Marino says the science shows police aren't being accidentally poisoned by fentanyl on the job. RYAN MARINO: This has never happened. There has never been an overdose through skin contact or accidentally inhaling fentanyl. MANN: Marino is a toxicologist and emergency room physician who studies addiction at Case Western Reserve University. He says it's understandable police are afraid. Fentanyl is incredibly powerful. That's why tens of thousands of people overdose every year when using the street version of the drug. But it's actually really hard to get fentanyl into the body. That's why people addicted to the drug often smoke it or inject it using needles. MARINO: So fentanyl does not pass through the skin efficiently or well. The dry powder form that is encountered in street drugs is not going to cross through the skin in any meaningful way. MANN: Researchers also say fentanyl powder doesn't poison people when it's airborne like dust. Brandon del Pozo was a former police chief who studies addiction at Brown University. BRANDON DEL POZO: There's never been a toxicologically confirmed case. The idea of it hanging in the air and getting breathed in is just highly, highly implausible. It's nearly impossible. MANN: NPR reached out to the Tavares, Fla., Police Department and Officer Bannick, asking for toxicology reports or other information confirming she was affected by fentanyl. They declined to make that medical information public. We contacted numerous other law enforcement and government agencies and researchers around the country and couldn't find a single case of a police officer who overdosed on fentanyl confirmed by toxicology reports. A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told NPR the agency does believe a small number of first responders nationwide have experienced real symptoms after encountering fentanyl on the job. None of those cases involved overdoses. None were life-threatening. Del Pozo, the former police chief, believes the most serious risk to police officers isn't accidental overdose. It's anxiety and stress caused by misinformation about fentanyl. DEL POZO: I mean, imagine you do a job every day where you just think, you know, being near a certain car or being near a certain person could kill you. It's a real mental health problem for officers. The good fortune is that it's just not necessary to have that fear. MANN: Del Pozo says many reported fentanyl overdoses among police involved symptoms that look more like panic attacks than opioid overdoses. Experts say this heightened fear began when the first fentanyl warnings were issued by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration half a decade ago. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK ROSENBERG: Fentanyl is deadly. Exposure to an amount equivalent to a few grains of sand can kill you. MANN: Chuck Rosenberg, head of the DEA under Presidents Obama and Trump, urged local cops to treat fentanyl as a major risk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROSENBERG: It is extremely dangerous to users and to those who simply come into contact with it. If you're a first responder, that could be you. MANN: In 2017, just a few months after that video was posted, toxicology researchers issued a report contradicting the government's assessment, concluding that the danger to law enforcement from street fentanyl is extremely low. Ryan Marino, the toxicologist and emergency room physician at Case Western, says fear of fentanyl is making it harder for police to do their jobs protecting the public. MARINO: I have seen that play out in reality where someone who is truly experiencing an overdose, someone who has overdosed on fentanyl, will not be resuscitated appropriately or in a timely manner because of this fear that getting close to them, touching them could cause some sort of secondhand overdose. MANN: With fentanyl deaths still at record levels, local police are often the first responders on the scene. Experts say how they're trained, how they view the dangers of fentanyl and how they do their jobs could mean life or death for many people with addiction. The CDC says it's updating guidelines for first responders encountering fentanyl. That new information is expected in the next month. Brian Mann, NPR News. Copyright © 2023 NPR.

The footage from another cop's body camera is frightening. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: She's ODing. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #2: ODing. MANN: She's ODing, officers say. Bannick is lowered to the ground and treated with Narcan, a medication that quickly reverses most opioid fentanyl overdoses. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #3: Keep breathing. UNIDENTIFIED POLICE OFFICER #1: All right. Stay with me, OK? (CROSSTALK) MANN: Speaking in December with WKMG News in Orlando, Bannick said she's lucky to be alive. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) COURTNEY BANNICK: If I didn't have backup there, I wouldn't be here today. MANN: The Tavares Police Department declined NPR's request for interviews, as did Bannick. Reports like this one of police being harmed by fentanyl occur regularly across the U.S. With the synthetic opioid now present in most of the country, many officers clearly believe they're in real danger. But Dr. Ryan Marino says the science shows police aren't being accidentally poisoned by fentanyl on the job. RYAN MARINO: This has never happened. There has never been an overdose through skin contact or accidentally inhaling fentanyl. MANN: Marino is a toxicologist and emergency room physician who studies addiction at Case Western Reserve University. He says it's understandable police are afraid. Fentanyl is incredibly powerful. That's why tens of thousands of people overdose every year when using the street version of the drug. But it's actually really hard to get fentanyl into the body. That's why people addicted to the drug often smoke it or inject it using needles. MARINO: So fentanyl does not pass through the skin efficiently or well. The dry powder form that is encountered in street drugs is not going to cross through the skin in any meaningful way. MANN: Researchers also say fentanyl powder doesn't poison people when it's airborne like dust. Brandon del Pozo was a former police chief who studies addiction at Brown University. BRANDON DEL POZO: There's never been a toxicologically confirmed case. The idea of it hanging in the air and getting breathed in is just highly, highly implausible. It's nearly impossible. MANN: NPR reached out to the Tavares, Fla., Police Department and Officer Bannick, asking for toxicology reports or other information confirming she was affected by fentanyl. They declined to make that medical information public. We contacted numerous other law enforcement and government agencies and researchers around the country and couldn't find a single case of a police officer who overdosed on fentanyl confirmed by toxicology reports. A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told NPR the agency does believe a small number of first responders nationwide have experienced real symptoms after encountering fentanyl on the job. None of those cases involved overdoses. None were life-threatening. Del Pozo, the former police chief, believes the most serious risk to police officers isn't accidental overdose. It's anxiety and stress caused by misinformation about fentanyl. DEL POZO: I mean, imagine you do a job every day where you just think, you know, being near a certain car or being near a certain person could kill you. It's a real mental health problem for officers. The good fortune is that it's just not necessary to have that fear.

MANN: Marino is a toxicologist and emergency room physician who studies addiction at Case Western Reserve University. He says it's understandable police are afraid. Fentanyl is incredibly powerful. That's why tens of thousands of people overdose every year when using the street version of the drug. But it's actually really hard to get fentanyl into the body. That's why people addicted to the drug often smoke it or inject it using needles. MARINO: So fentanyl does not pass through the skin efficiently or well. The dry powder form that is encountered in street drugs is not going to cross through the skin in any meaningful way. MANN: Researchers also say fentanyl powder doesn't poison people when it's airborne like dust. Brandon del Pozo was a former police chief who studies addiction at Brown University. BRANDON DEL POZO: There's never been a toxicologically confirmed case. The idea of it hanging in the air and getting breathed in is just highly, highly implausible. It's nearly impossible. MANN: NPR reached out to the Tavares, Fla., Police Department and Officer Bannick, asking for toxicology reports or other information confirming she was affected by fentanyl. They declined to make that medical information public. We contacted numerous other law enforcement and government agencies and researchers around the country and couldn't find a single case of a police officer who overdosed on fentanyl confirmed by toxicology reports. A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told NPR the agency does believe a small number of first responders nationwide have experienced real symptoms after encountering fentanyl on the job. None of those cases involved overdoses. None were life-threatening. Del Pozo, the former police chief, believes the most serious risk to police officers isn't accidental overdose. It's anxiety and stress caused by misinformation about fentanyl. DEL POZO: I mean, imagine you do a job every day where you just think, you know, being near a certain car or being near a certain person could kill you. It's a real mental health problem for officers. The good fortune is that it's just not necessary to have that fear. MANN: Del Pozo says many reported fentanyl overdoses among police involved symptoms that look more like panic attacks than opioid overdoses. Experts say this heightened fear began when the first fentanyl warnings were issued by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration half a decade ago. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK ROSENBERG: Fentanyl is deadly. Exposure to an amount equivalent to a few grains of sand can kill you. MANN: Chuck Rosenberg, head of the DEA under Presidents Obama and Trump, urged local cops to treat fentanyl as a major risk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROSENBERG: It is extremely dangerous to users and to those who simply come into contact with it. If you're a first responder, that could be you. MANN: In 2017, just a few months after that video was posted, toxicology researchers issued a report contradicting the government's assessment, concluding that the danger to law enforcement from street fentanyl is extremely low. Ryan Marino, the toxicologist and emergency room physician at Case Western, says fear of fentanyl is making it harder for police to do their jobs protecting the public. MARINO: I have seen that play out in reality where someone who is truly experiencing an overdose, someone who has overdosed on fentanyl, will not be resuscitated appropriately or in a timely manner because of this fear that getting close to them, touching them could cause some sort of secondhand overdose. MANN: With fentanyl deaths still at record levels, local police are often the first responders on the scene. Experts say how they're trained, how they view the dangers of fentanyl and how they do their jobs could mean life or death for many people with addiction. The CDC says it's updating guidelines for first responders encountering fentanyl. That new information is expected in the next month. Brian Mann, NPR News. Copyright © 2023 NPR.

Reports like this one of police being harmed by fentanyl occur regularly across the U.S. With the synthetic opioid now present in most of the country, many officers clearly believe they're in real danger. But Dr. Ryan Marino says the science shows police aren't being accidentally poisoned by fentanyl on the job. RYAN MARINO: This has never happened. There has never been an overdose through skin contact or accidentally inhaling fentanyl. MANN: Marino is a toxicologist and emergency room physician who studies addiction at Case Western Reserve University. He says it's understandable police are afraid. Fentanyl is incredibly powerful. That's why tens of thousands of people overdose every year when using the street version of the drug. But it's actually really hard to get fentanyl into the body. That's why people addicted to the drug often smoke it or inject it using needles. MARINO: So fentanyl does not pass through the skin efficiently or well. The dry powder form that is encountered in street drugs is not going to cross through the skin in any meaningful way. MANN: Researchers also say fentanyl powder doesn't poison people when it's airborne like dust. Brandon del Pozo was a former police chief who studies addiction at Brown University. BRANDON DEL POZO: There's never been a toxicologically confirmed case. The idea of it hanging in the air and getting breathed in is just highly, highly implausible. It's nearly impossible. MANN: NPR reached out to the Tavares, Fla., Police Department and Officer Bannick, asking for toxicology reports or other information confirming she was affected by fentanyl. They declined to make that medical information public. We contacted numerous other law enforcement and government agencies and researchers around the country and couldn't find a single case of a police officer who overdosed on fentanyl confirmed by toxicology reports. A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told NPR the agency does believe a small number of first responders nationwide have experienced real symptoms after encountering fentanyl on the job. None of those cases involved overdoses. None were life-threatening. Del Pozo, the former police chief, believes the most serious risk to police officers isn't accidental overdose. It's anxiety and stress caused by misinformation about fentanyl. DEL POZO: I mean, imagine you do a job every day where you just think, you know, being near a certain car or being near a certain person could kill you. It's a real mental health problem for officers. The good fortune is that it's just not necessary to have that fear. MANN: Del Pozo says many reported fentanyl overdoses among police involved symptoms that look more like panic attacks than opioid overdoses. Experts say this heightened fear began when the first fentanyl warnings were issued by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration half a decade ago. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK ROSENBERG: Fentanyl is deadly. Exposure to an amount equivalent to a few grains of sand can kill you. MANN: Chuck Rosenberg, head of the DEA under Presidents Obama and Trump, urged local cops to treat fentanyl as a major risk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROSENBERG: It is extremely dangerous to users and to those who simply come into contact with it. If you're a first responder, that could be you. MANN: In 2017, just a few months after that video was posted, toxicology researchers issued a report contradicting the government's assessment, concluding that the danger to law enforcement from street fentanyl is extremely low. Ryan Marino, the toxicologist and emergency room physician at Case Western, says fear of fentanyl is making it harder for police to do their jobs protecting the public. MARINO: I have seen that play out in reality where someone who is truly experiencing an overdose, someone who has overdosed on fentanyl, will not be resuscitated appropriately or in a timely manner because of this fear that getting close to them, touching them could cause some sort of secondhand overdose. MANN: With fentanyl deaths still at record levels, local police are often the first responders on the scene. Experts say how they're trained, how they view the dangers of fentanyl and how they do their jobs could mean life or death for many people with addiction. The CDC says it's updating guidelines for first responders encountering fentanyl. That new information is expected in the next month. Brian Mann, NPR News. Copyright © 2023 NPR.

MANN: Researchers also say fentanyl powder doesn't poison people when it's airborne like dust. Brandon del Pozo was a former police chief who studies addiction at Brown University. BRANDON DEL POZO: There's never been a toxicologically confirmed case. The idea of it hanging in the air and getting breathed in is just highly, highly implausible. It's nearly impossible. MANN: NPR reached out to the Tavares, Fla., Police Department and Officer Bannick, asking for toxicology reports or other information confirming she was affected by fentanyl. They declined to make that medical information public. We contacted numerous other law enforcement and government agencies and researchers around the country and couldn't find a single case of a police officer who overdosed on fentanyl confirmed by toxicology reports. A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told NPR the agency does believe a small number of first responders nationwide have experienced real symptoms after encountering fentanyl on the job. None of those cases involved overdoses. None were life-threatening. Del Pozo, the former police chief, believes the most serious risk to police officers isn't accidental overdose. It's anxiety and stress caused by misinformation about fentanyl. DEL POZO: I mean, imagine you do a job every day where you just think, you know, being near a certain car or being near a certain person could kill you. It's a real mental health problem for officers. The good fortune is that it's just not necessary to have that fear. MANN: Del Pozo says many reported fentanyl overdoses among police involved symptoms that look more like panic attacks than opioid overdoses. Experts say this heightened fear began when the first fentanyl warnings were issued by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration half a decade ago. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK ROSENBERG: Fentanyl is deadly. Exposure to an amount equivalent to a few grains of sand can kill you. MANN: Chuck Rosenberg, head of the DEA under Presidents Obama and Trump, urged local cops to treat fentanyl as a major risk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROSENBERG: It is extremely dangerous to users and to those who simply come into contact with it. If you're a first responder, that could be you. MANN: In 2017, just a few months after that video was posted, toxicology researchers issued a report contradicting the government's assessment, concluding that the danger to law enforcement from street fentanyl is extremely low. Ryan Marino, the toxicologist and emergency room physician at Case Western, says fear of fentanyl is making it harder for police to do their jobs protecting the public. MARINO: I have seen that play out in reality where someone who is truly experiencing an overdose, someone who has overdosed on fentanyl, will not be resuscitated appropriately or in a timely manner because of this fear that getting close to them, touching them could cause some sort of secondhand overdose. MANN: With fentanyl deaths still at record levels, local police are often the first responders on the scene. Experts say how they're trained, how they view the dangers of fentanyl and how they do their jobs could mean life or death for many people with addiction. The CDC says it's updating guidelines for first responders encountering fentanyl. That new information is expected in the next month. Brian Mann, NPR News. Copyright © 2023 NPR.

MANN: The Tavares Police Department declined NPR's request for interviews, as did Bannick. Reports like this one of police being harmed by fentanyl occur regularly across the U.S. With the synthetic opioid now present in most of the country, many officers clearly believe they're in real danger. But Dr. Ryan Marino says the science shows police aren't being accidentally poisoned by fentanyl on the job. RYAN MARINO: This has never happened. There has never been an overdose through skin contact or accidentally inhaling fentanyl. MANN: Marino is a toxicologist and emergency room physician who studies addiction at Case Western Reserve University. He says it's understandable police are afraid. Fentanyl is incredibly powerful. That's why tens of thousands of people overdose every year when using the street version of the drug. But it's actually really hard to get fentanyl into the body.

But it's actually really hard to get fentanyl into the body. That's why people addicted to the drug often smoke it or inject it using needles. MARINO: So fentanyl does not pass through the skin efficiently or well. The dry powder form that is encountered in street drugs is not going to cross through the skin in any meaningful way. MANN: Researchers also say fentanyl powder doesn't poison people when it's airborne like dust. Brandon del Pozo was a former police chief who studies addiction at Brown University. BRANDON DEL POZO: There's never been a toxicologically confirmed case. The idea of it hanging in the air and getting breathed in is just highly, highly implausible. It's nearly impossible. MANN: NPR reached out to the Tavares, Fla., Police Department and Officer Bannick, asking for toxicology reports or other information confirming she was affected by fentanyl. They declined to make that medical information public. We contacted numerous other law enforcement and government agencies and researchers around the country and couldn't find a single case of a police officer who overdosed on fentanyl confirmed by toxicology reports. A spokesperson for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention told NPR the agency does believe a small number of first responders nationwide have experienced real symptoms after encountering fentanyl on the job. None of those cases involved overdoses. None were life-threatening. Del Pozo, the former police chief, believes the most serious risk to police officers isn't accidental overdose. It's anxiety and stress caused by misinformation about fentanyl. DEL POZO: I mean, imagine you do a job every day where you just think, you know, being near a certain car or being near a certain person could kill you. It's a real mental health problem for officers. The good fortune is that it's just not necessary to have that fear. MANN: Del Pozo says many reported fentanyl overdoses among police involved symptoms that look more like panic attacks than opioid overdoses. Experts say this heightened fear began when the first fentanyl warnings were issued by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration half a decade ago. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) CHUCK ROSENBERG: Fentanyl is deadly. Exposure to an amount equivalent to a few grains of sand can kill you. MANN: Chuck Rosenberg, head of the DEA under Presidents Obama and Trump, urged local cops to treat fentanyl as a major risk. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) ROSENBERG: It is extremely dangerous to users and to those who simply come into contact with it. If you're a first responder, that could be you. MANN: In 2017, just a few months after that video was posted, toxicology researchers issued a report contradicting the government's assessment, concluding that the danger to law enforcement from street fentanyl is extremely low. Ryan Marino, the toxicologist and emergency room physician at Case Western, says fear of fentanyl is making it harder for police to do their jobs protecting the public. MARINO: I have seen that play out in reality where someone who is truly experiencing an overdose, someone who has overdosed on fentanyl, will not be resuscitated appropriately or in a timely manner because of this fear that getting close to them, touching them could cause some sort of secondhand overdose. MANN: With fentanyl deaths still at record levels, local police are often the first responders on the scene. Experts say how they're trained, how they view the dangers of fentanyl and how they do their jobs could mean life or death for many people with addiction. The CDC says it's updating guidelines for first responders encountering fentanyl. That new information is expected in the next month. Brian Mann, NPR News. Copyright © 2023 NPR.

MANN: In 2017, just a few months after that video was posted, toxicology researchers issued a report contradicting the government's assessment, concluding that the danger to law enforcement from street fentanyl is extremely low. Ryan Marino, the toxicologist and emergency room physician at Case Western, says fear of fentanyl is making it harder for police to do their jobs protecting the public. MARINO: I have seen that play out in reality where someone who is truly experiencing an overdose, someone who has overdosed on fentanyl, will not be resuscitated appropriately or in a timely manner because of this fear that getting close to them, touching them could cause some sort of secondhand overdose. MANN: With fentanyl deaths still at record levels, local police are often the first responders on the scene. Experts say how they're trained, how they view the dangers of fentanyl and how they do their jobs could mean life or death for many people with addiction. The CDC says it's updating guidelines for first responders encountering fentanyl. That new information is expected in the next month. Brian Mann, NPR News. Copyright © 2023 NPR.

But police departments across Florida and the Dakotas have repeatedly used it to hide the names of officers who use force on the job. And the law may be spreading, too.\n\nby Kenny Jacoby , USA Today and Ryan Gabrielson , ProPublica\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis story was co-published with USA Today.\n\nIn January 2019, a Dollar Tree employee in Masaryktown, Florida, called 911 after a homeless man stole $70 of beer, wine, candy and cookies. A sheriff's deputy had little trouble finding him - the man had passed out drunk in a nearby ditch with an open box of Reese's Pieces.\n\nThe deputy took the man to the hospital, where he became irate. With his left wrist handcuffed to the bed, he started swinging his right arm wildly. To get the suspect \"under control,\" the deputy pepper-sprayed him in the face.\n\nThe Hernando County Sheriff's Office provided a copy of the use-of-force report to USA TODAY and ProPublica in response to a public records request. Blacked out was one crucial detail: the deputy's name.\n\nUnder a law passed to protect crime victims, the deputy was entitled to privacy, officials said. He'd suffered a battery: The flailing suspect had been attached to a pulse monitor, and the wire hit near the deputy's shoulder.\n\nIntroduced in memory of a young woman murdered by her ex-boyfriend, Marsy's Law was created to offer crime victims a slate of rights, including protecting them and their families from harassment by their attackers.\n\nNow, as police across the nation face cries for accountability amid mounting evidence of brutality and systemic racism, law-enforcement agencies in Florida are using Marsy's Law to shield officers after they use force, sometimes under questionable circumstances.\n\nFlorida agencies have used it to hide the names of officers who sent a 15-year-old boy to the hospital, officers who fired bullets into moving cars and officers who released their K9 dogs on drunk and mentally ill people.\n\nMarsy's Law passed first in California in 2008 and, through a well-funded campaign by the woman's brother, is the law in 11 other states. It happened each time by ballot initiative, allowing voters to adopt all of its implications with a single yes.\n\nNow, it is on the ballot in Kentucky, a state still reeling from the botched raid that killed Breonna Taylor, a 26-year-old Black medical worker in Louisville. Had it been in place this March, the public may not have learned the identities of the three white officers who opened fire.\n\n\"This constitutional amendment is so ambiguous and has lent itself to so much misinterpretation, misapplication, inconsistency,\" said Amye Bensenhaver, director of the Kentucky Open Government Coalition and a former assistant state attorney general. \"We will have those problems emerge, just as they have emerged in Florida.\"\n\nThe law increasingly has been co-opted by police. It got on Florida's ballot in 2018 after being introduced by a sheriff and revised with the help of two statewide law enforcement associations. Officers say it allows them to claim victim status in use-of-force cases where they say the suspect was the aggressor.\n\nAt least half of Florida's 30 largest police agencies said they apply it to shield the names of on-duty officers, a USA TODAY and ProPublica investigation found. For the agencies that do, reporters requested and reviewed thousands of pages of police reports from use-of-force incidents since January 2019.\n\nThe sheriff's offices in Collier and Charlotte counties, in southwest Florida, have withheld deputies' names in roughly 1 in 6 incidents in which an officer used force that resulted in a civilian's injury. For the sheriff's office in Hernando County, an hour's drive north of Tampa, it's nearly 1 in 3.\n\nLocal newsrooms in almost every region of Florida have been denied officers' names under Marsy's Law, with the Tampa Bay Times , the Tallahassee Democrat and The Palm Beach Post covering the controversy extensively.\n\nThe agencies rarely redacted the names of the suspects on whom they used force, including juveniles and mentally ill people in the thick of a crisis.\n\nSometimes, the injuries officers cited when they invoked the victim status were as minor as a scraped knee, soreness or a twisted wrist. In one case, a Hernando County deputy photographed and noted a \"minor, blunt-forced injury to my left index finger, causing a bone bruise on the lower joint of the same finger.\"\n\nThe sheriff's office refused to provide the pictures, even ones that blurred or blacked out the deputy's face, citing Marsy's Law and a provision in the state public records law that exempts photos of law enforcement officers from disclosure.\n\nOfficers sustained no injuries in at least half of the incidents for which they claimed victims' rights, records show. Even minor movements that officers perceived as threatening, such as walking aggressively or reaching into a pocket, qualified as batteries on officers - triggering the law's protection, according to the agencies.\n\nCourt records still typically provide police officers' names. When criminal charges are filed against defendants, courts release unredacted versions of the same records police black out. But court records aren't public if the defendant is a juvenile, and there are no charges to file if the suspect is dead.\n\nAt least seven police agencies have withheld the names of officers who've killed civilians: the sheriff's offices in Broward, Sarasota, Manatee, Charlotte and Hernando counties, and the police departments in Tampa and Tallahassee. Five of the deceased were white, two were Black and one was Hispanic.\n\nA Tallahassee police officer brought the problems with Marsy's Law to light in May when he claimed victimhood status after fatally shooting Tony McDade, a Black transgender man who allegedly stabbed a neighbor's son to death before pointing a gun at the officer.\n\nTallahassee police Chief Lawrence Revell didn't release the names of the officers involved, prompting protests outside the police station and in the streets. Days later, the Florida Police Benevolent Association sued the city to make sure it wouldn't change course. The police union's lawsuit cited the growing anger over police violence as a reason to hide their names.\n\n\"His fear for his safety is reasonable, especially given the current unrest that has followed in the wake of George Floyd's death in Minneapolis,\" the union said in court filings.\n\nMutaqee Akbar, the attorney for McDade's family, said the police still haven't told him the names of the officers, which has prevented both him and the public from investigating the officers' past conduct. He worries about the implications for Black men across Florida, whom police kill at a disproportionate rate, state data shows.\n\n\"We always say, 'Police as a whole are not all bad,' but they're protecting those who are at least perceived to be bad with Marsy's Law,\" Akbar said. \"I don't think the public would have voted for it if they had known these consequences to it. And I don't believe that this was in the true spirit of what the law is.\"\n\nThe identities of officers who've used violence against civilians is vital information that the public has a right to know, said Barbara Petersen, the former head of Florida's First Amendment Foundation. Had the Minneapolis Police Department withheld the identity of Derek Chauvin, the officer charged with killing Floyd, the public may not have learned of his extensive history of using excessive force, Petersen said.\n\nThe notion that a law enforcement officer responding to a call could be considered a crime victim, she said, is \"mind-boggling. ... How are we supposed to know if they've acted appropriately? How do we know they haven't done this before?\"\n\nMatt Puckett, executive director of the Florida Police Benevolent Association, acknowledged there should be limits on when officers can invoke Marsy's Law.\n\n\"We need to have the [state] Supreme Court issue a ruling on it, because it's always going to be very subjective ... as to what would be worthy of a shield from victim's information,\" Puckett said. \"It's not hard to see a circumstance where you would go, 'OK, that probably seems like not a fair use of the of the law.'\"\n\nPasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco introduced Marsy's Law in Florida. Now, he is one of the most vocal advocates for using it to automatically shield deputies' names, including those of two in his agency who fired at a car driven by a man wanted for a string of carjackings in October 2019. The deputies said they were the victims of aggravated battery because the man allegedly tried to ram them with his car.\n\nThe alleged ramming was not shown in the soundless video released by the office. USA TODAY and ProPublica requested the incident report on Oct. 12 and the full video on Oct. 20; the office has not yet provided them.\n\n\"The provision exists for victims across the spectrum, regardless of their profession,\" said Nocco's spokesman, Chase Daniels. \"We believe there is the capability to both protect the victim and provide transparency under Marsy's Law, which we have done.\"\n\nNocco and three other county sheriffs who routinely use Marsy's Law - Brevard's Wayne Ivey, Collier's Kevin Rambosk and Charlotte's Bill Prummell - declined to comment. In an emailed statement, Hernando County Sheriff Al Nienhuis said that Florida voters, \"intentionally or unintentionally, did not provide exceptions based on the victim's positions or actions.\"\n\n\"Unless or until there is clarification by the Legislature or the Courts, I have elected to err on the side (of) caution and the side of any crime victim,\" Nienhuis said.\n\nLauren Book, a state senator from Broward County and sexual assault survivor who campaigned for Marsy's Law, introduced legislation in 2019 that would have exempted on-duty officers from the privacy benefits of the law, but her bill never got so much as a committee hearing.\n\n\"We need an implementing bill to create some clarity,\" Book said. \"Shielding the identities of law enforcement was never the intention. The goal was to protect victims of crimes - period, the end.\"\n\nThe controversial crime victims' rights law was born of a tragedy.\n\nIn 1983, Marsalee Ann Nicholas, a 21-year-old student at the University of California, Santa Barbara, who went by Marsy, was stalked and shot to death by her ex-boyfriend, Kerry Michael Conley, when she came home for Thanksgiving.\n\nConley was arrested but remained free on bail for two years until he was convicted of second-degree murder. At a grocery store a week after her death, Conley allegedly accosted Nicholas' mother, who was on her way home from the funeral. The family said it had not been notified that Conley was out on bond.\n\nNicholas' mother and stepfather, Marcella and Bob Leach, became prominent advocates for victims' rights, as well as harsher sentences for convicted felons. Along with Marsy's brother, Henry Nicholas, the Leaches co-founded a nonprofit support organization for families of homicide victims, which they ran for decades.\n\nNicholas, the billionaire co-founder of Broadcom Corp., in 2007 spearheaded a campaign to pass a comprehensive bill of rights for California crime victims. He recruited former Gov. Pete Wilson, legal scholars, law enforcement officials and victims' rights advocates to draft a constitutional amendment bearing his sister's name.\n\nIn 2008, California passed it as a ballot measure with nearly 54% of the vote.\n\nThe following year, Nicholas launched a national organization, Marsy's Law for All, which has spent more than $100 million working to pass similar amendments in other states. So far, 11 more have active laws on the books: Florida, Georgia, Illinois, Nevada, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Pennsylvania, South Dakota and Wisconsin.\n\nWhile none of the states explicitly exempt on-duty police officers from the benefits of any part of the law, only in Florida, North Dakota and South Dakota can police officers use the law to shield their names from the public. That's because those states' amendments eliminate a key phrase from an original provision of the law that prohibits the release of information that could be used to \"locate or harass\" a victim.\n\nWhereas California and others states' provisions prohibit \"the disclosure of confidential information to the defendant,\" North Dakota's version passed in November 2016 deleted the words \"confidential\" and \"to the defendant\" - leaving a provision that simply prohibits the disclosure of victim \"information\" to anyone. Florida and South Dakota followed suit in 2018.\n\nNorth Dakota Attorney General Wayne Stenehjem quickly tried to clarify that the law does not protect the names of victims, unless they are children or the victims of sex crimes or domestic violence.\n\n\"There is nothing under Marsy's Law that protects the name of a victim or the victim's family,\" he wrote in January 2017 guidance.\n\nCops disregarded that guidance. In October 2017, a Bismarck police officer invoked Marsy's Law after shooting and wounding a man who he said punched him and gouged his eyes. The agency declined to identify the officer, but The Bismarck Tribune uncovered his name and published it - prompting protesters to gather outside the newsroom in support of police.\n\nIn the months after, more North Dakota officers invoked the law, with support from Marsy's Law for All: \"Police officers can be victims just like anyone else,\" spokesman Henry Goodwin told the Grand Forks Herald in July 2018.\n\nLiz Brocker, spokeswoman for the North Dakota Attorney General's Office, said the state's top lawyer can only provide advice to police. \"By law, we have no jurisdiction or authority over local law enforcement agencies,\" she said, \"and we do not enforce or take complaints about Marsy's Law.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the law was working its way onto Florida's ballot.\n\nIt had been introduced to Florida's Constitutional Revision Commission, which gathers every 20 years to examine the state constitution and debate potential revisions. In this unusual process, politicians appoint 37 commission members to propose amendments and, if approved by at least 22 members, refer them directly to the ballot for a vote.\n\nThe 2017 commission was made up almost entirely of Republicans, many with direct ties to then-Gov. Rick Scott. Two members proposed similar versions of Marsy's Law: Nocco, the Pasco sheriff, and Timothy Cerio, Scott's former chief legal adviser.\n\nBoth versions contained the same \"locate or harass\" provision that was making news in North Dakota. Yet according to transcripts and videos from the commission proceedings, the issue never came up.\n\nDuring a commission meeting in March 2018, Cerio thanked the Florida Sheriffs Association, the Florida Police Chiefs Association and several top state prosecutors for their support and their revisions to the initiative.\n\n\"It is especially meaningful to me that so many of these officials we look to, who played key roles in our criminal justice system, have frankly reviewed and have had direct input into the crafting, and maybe a little re-crafting, of Marsy's Law,\" Cerio said, according to a meeting transcript.\n\nIn November 2018, Florida voters passed it by a 23-point margin.\n\nGail Gitcho, a senior adviser for Marsy's Law For All, insists that police influence was limited. \"While law enforcement agencies did weigh in on some provisions of the language, not a single law enforcement officer or agency or organization had a hand in crafting, drafting or writing the privacy provision. None. Zero.\"\n\nThe Florida Sheriffs Association and Florida Police Chiefs Association said they both provided input on Marsy's Law before it went to the ballot, but neither weighed in on the privacy provision. Spokespeople for the organizations said they were unaware at the time of how officers could use it to shield their identities.\n\n\"The association did not consider or analyze the laws of North Dakota or any other state when evaluating the proposed amendment to Florida's constitution,\" said William Stander, a spokesman for the Florida Police Chiefs Association, noting that the organization was not involved in drafting the law.\n\n\"The Florida Police Chiefs Association has not advocated for a particular interpretation of this or any other issue raised by the amendment, and we continue to call on the Florida Legislature to further clarify these ambiguities.\"\n\nThe Florida Sheriffs Association declined to take a stance also.\n\nCerio did not respond to multiple calls and emails.\n\nAs police agencies across Florida adjusted to the new victims' rights amendment in early 2019, the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office put together a PowerPoint presentation to tell deputies how to follow Marsy's Law. The last slide spelled out those who are not considered victims under the amendment, including suspects, the deceased and witnesses to a crime. A final note read, \"Police Officers cannot invoke Marsy's Law in the course of their official duty.\"\n\nJacksonville deputies begged to differ. In January, their union sued in state court, arguing they, too, had a right to confidentiality under the amendment. The case is awaiting trial.\n\nFive months later, after a pair of fatal shootings, including that of McDade, by Tallahassee police officers, the Florida Police Benevolent Association sued the city of Tallahassee to block the release of the officers' names.\n\nJudge Charles Dodson was not convinced. In July, he cited the public's right to access government records and ruled that the court \"cannot interpret Marsy's Law to shield police officers from public scrutiny of their official actions.\"\n\nThe police union is appealing the case, and the officers' names are still sealed. In the meantime, Dodson's ruling has not stopped police agencies in other parts of the state from using the law to their advantage.\n\nUSA TODAY and ProPublica surveyed 50 of the state's largest police agencies about their interpretations of the law.\n\nOf the 36 agencies that provided responses or records, 19 - including Miami Police Department and Hillsborough County Sheriff's Office - said they apply the law to officers, 15 said they do not and two said they weren't sure. The rest refused to answer or did not respond.\n\nOf the 19, 12 have withheld the name of at least one deputy, with the others saying the situation has not yet come up.\n\nFatal shootings account for a fraction of the incidents. Far more often, police are withholding the names of officers involved in violent altercations with juveniles, intoxicated people or people experiencing mental health episodes. For instance:\n\nThere is little uniformity in how the law is applied, with some agencies saying officers must invoke the law and others applying it automatically. Even within the same county, police agencies' interpretations conflict. For example, the St. Petersburg Police Department allows its officers to invoke a right to confidentiality under Marsy's Law if they choose. The Pinellas County Sheriff's Office, which covers areas right outside the city, does not.\n\nThe law has also hampered the public's right to know about important incidents involving civilians. In 2019, a Sarasota County day care worker was charged with abuse, caught on camera dragging and pushing children. The sheriff's office refused to name the day care , saying that the victims opted into Marsy's Law, and that naming the facility could have identified the children to the public.\n\nJohn Herrell, a spokesman for the Lake County Sheriff's Office in central Florida, which does not apply the law to deputies, said: \"While I like the intent of Marsy's Law, I'm not a fan of its verbiage, and I hate the confusion it has created.\"\n\nWhen Florida police request protected status under Marsy's Law, it is often unclear from whom they are seeking protection.\n\nIn most states, Marsy's Law narrowly protects victims and their families from being harassed by defendants. Yet in one southwest Florida case, deputies didn't object to sharing their names with the man who they claimed violently assaulted one of them, while telling USA TODAY and ProPublica that such information was a critical secret.\n\nTrent Gilliland walked out of an upscale cocktail lounge in Naples, Florida, without paying his drink tab in September 2019.\n\nFive Collier County Sheriff's deputies approached him outside the bar, police reports show. Gilliland began taunting the deputies, calling them \"motherfuckers\" and \"bitches\" who had \"easy jobs.\" The deputies warned him to watch what he said, the reports show.\n\n\"Or what?\" Gilliland responded. \"What are you going to do?\"\n\nAccording to the deputies' version of events, Gilliland clenched his fists and stepped toward one deputy, who pushed him back. Gilliland then allegedly grabbed the deputy's wrist and pulled his fingers back so far that the deputy thought his wrist might break. He and another deputy tackled Gilliland, and a different deputy released his German shepherd on him \"to prevent injuries to deputies.\" The dog bit Gilliland's hip.\n\nGilliland was hospitalized and treated for two puncture wounds, then jailed for battery on a police officer and resisting arrest with violence, a felony. The deputy suffered a \"minor\" wrist injury and a scraped knee, the report shows.\n\nGilliland had forgotten his debit card, he told USA TODAY and ProPublica, and before the deputies arrived, he and the bar manager had agreed he would pay his tab the next day. They explained as much to the deputies after a security guard called them, the report shows. But the deputies still wouldn't let him leave over concerns he would drive home drunk. Gilliland acknowledged being \"smart\" with the deputies. The next thing he remembers, he was \"eating the pavement.\"\n\n\"I was obviously intoxicated, but I was no threat,\" he said. \"There's no way I could have twisted his finger if he had his knee on my back and three others were handcuffing me.\"\n\nThese 68 videos show clear apparent instances of police officers escalating violence during protests. Here's what we learned about each case.\n\nThe deputies never charged Gilliland for failing to pay his tab, and prosecutors dropped the battery charge, court records show. But he continued to face a felony charge of resisting arrest with violence, which carries a maximum sentence of five years imprisonment. He said his attorney told him that the video of the incident did not \"look good\" for him. (When reporters requested photos and videos from the case, the sheriff's office said it possessed none, even though the report states \"photographs were taken of the injuries.\")\n\nGilliland took a plea agreement that reduced the felony charge to a misdemeanor. He remains on probation for another year. As part of the deal, he must pay a fine, take an anger management class and write apology letters to all of the deputies involved in the incident.\n\n\"I did it because I had to, not because I wanted to,\" Gilliland said. \"I don't think I was treated fairly. I feel like I should have gotten a letter of apology.\"\n\nHis public defender gave him the details he needed to write the letters; he addressed them to each of the five deputies by name.\n\nRyan Gabrielson\n\nRyan Gabrielson was a reporter for ProPublica covering health care.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "Few Cops We Found Using Force on George Floyd Protesters Are Known to Have Faced Discipline\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nLast summer, ProPublica compiled 68 videos that appeared to show police officers using disproportionate force against protesters during the nationwide events following George Floyd's death in police custody.\n\nWe had culled the videos from hundreds circulating on social media in the wake of the protests and highlighted the cases that seemed to clearly show officers using disproportionate force. We then reached out to dozens of law enforcement agencies whose officers are in the videos and asked some straightforward questions: Have the officers' police departments investigated the incidents? And what consequences, if any, have the officers in the videos faced?\n\nAs time passed, we've been checking in with the departments to get their answers.\n\nAfter a year, we wanted to give a final update on what we know: Departments have disclosed discipline for 10 officers.\n\nA Seattle Police Department officer received a written reprimand for striking a protester with \"six to eight punches over six seconds.\" In Grand Rapids, Michigan, an officer shot a man in the shoulder at close range with a long-range tear gas round. He received two days without pay. In Salt Lake City, an officer received \" coaching and counseling \" for using a shield to push an elderly man.\n\nSix officers were initially fired, though two got their jobs back after a review. Criminal charges are also pending against 11 officers, including some who have already faced internal discipline.\n\nIn 17 cases that we followed, the departments have decided not to discipline the officers or could not identify them.\n\nInvestigations are still ongoing in 25 of the cases. This includes a high-profile case in Buffalo, New York, where two officers pushed a man backward , causing him to hit his head on the pavement. A grand jury dismissed felony assault charges against the officers, but a decision on departmental discipline is still pending.\n\nFinally, in 18 instances, ProPublica could not determine the disciplinary outcome - either because the department did not respond or the department said it could not share the information.\n\nThe weaving journey of accountability has played out starkly around one of the cases in Atlanta.\n\nIn May 2020, the mayor announced the firing of two officers just a day after they were involved in the violent arrest of two college students who were pulled from a car.\n\nBut the officers quickly sued to get their jobs back, citing a lack of due process. In February, Atlanta's Civil Service Board agreed. The two officers are once again employed by the department but remain on administrative leave. The incident remains under investigation. Criminal charges have also been filed against the officers , including assault, though the district attorney who brought them has since been voted out of office.\n\nRead More\n\nOne reason departments have declined to comment on the status of cases is that the incidents have been subject to litigation. But the back and forth on such suits can be illuminating.\n\nResponding to a lawsuit by a protester who was hit by a Los Angeles Police Department vehicle, the city wrote that the \"force used against plaintiff, if any, was caused and necessitated by the actions of plaintiff, and was reasonable and necessary for self-defense.\"\n\nIn about half of the cases we reviewed, including one resulting in discipline, the officer or officers involved have not been publicly identified. Sometimes, it's not even clear which law enforcement agency they worked for.\n\nIn Minneapolis, where Floyd's death occurred, sparking outrage across the world, a video captured the moment in May when officers patrolling a neighborhood fired paint rounds at a woman's home while enforcing a curfew.\n\nA Minnesota National Guard spokesperson told ProPublica the agency was \"not involved\" in the incident. The Minneapolis Police Department said the incident was \"not our agency.\" The Minnesota State Patrol said that it reviewed the video of the incident, and that \"the officer who fired the marking round was not a State Patrol trooper.\" When asked which agency the officers who fired the paint round were from, the spokesperson said it was \"unclear.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nI identify documents, sources and specialized datasets to advance investigations.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "ProPublica logo\n\nGilded Badges\n\nPolice culture can be insular and tough to penetrate, but the public can hold law enforcement accountable. Here are important methods and context you need to know.\n\nby Andrew Ford , Asbury Park Press\n\nHow New Jersey Cops Profit From Police Unions and Avoid Accountability\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis article was produced in partnership with the Asbury Park Press, which is a member of the ProPublica Local Reporting Network .\n\nThe death of George Floyd at the hands of police in Minneapolis has drawn historic levels of interest in police misconduct and drawn condemnation from law enforcement leaders nationwide.\n\nAs a reporter covering law enforcement for the Asbury Park Press in New Jersey, and now in partnership with ProPublica's Local Reporting Network, I use investigative reporting techniques to strengthen police accountability. Other journalists do the same . But, in truth, any citizen can apply the same methods to ensure the law enforcement system they're funding is serving them well.\n\nPolice culture can be insular and tough to penetrate. But I've been surprised by how often it's possible, though time consuming, to expose important issues by requesting and examining records and data from police departments and other government agencies and engaging citizens and key leaders. So here are five techniques concerned citizens, journalists and policymakers can use to examine police conduct in their communities.\n\nIf you're alarmed by what you saw in Minneapolis, or other recent incidents of apparent police misconduct, the first step is to find out if the agency in question has a written policy on the use of force. Does the policy dictate when officers should or shouldn't use force? What tactics are they allowed to use? Is there any rule against choking a suspect?\n\nIt's important to know if the officers involved were following the policies and procedures that are supposed to guide their behavior. Police actions that strike an onlooker as inappropriate may actually be within a department's rules. It's possible the rules themselves are inconsistent with best practices elsewhere.\n\nSubscribe to the Big Story newsletter.\n\nAsk the department for its policies on the practices that concern you, like restraining suspects or the use of pepper spray or Tasers. You may also need to request rules set by a county or state authority. Ask for written copies. You may be required to file a formal public records request, which I will describe below. And if there is no existing written policy, that might be something worth questioning itself.\n\nIf you're having trouble understanding a policy, try running it by an attorney, academic, elected official or a journalist in your community.\n\nHow I did it: I did a deep dive into policies about drug testing after a police captain was killed in a car crash in 2016, and I exposed that he was drunk and on drugs at the time . I spoke to his chief and learned their department didn't have a policy for random drug testing. I wondered why that was the case and looked to the state attorney general's office, which sets many police rules . The rules allowed departments to choose whether they wanted to do random testing, and my reporting identified more than 100 that did not . After our story, the state attorney general mandated random drug testing for cops across the state .\n\nYour tax dollars pay for just about everything a police department does, which includes generating tons of reports, dispatch logs, video recordings and data about what officers do every day. Any citizen is entitled to see those public records to understand how the government works.\n\nThe agency may say the public records law does not allow you to have access to some documents - information about confidential informants and medical records, for example. The laws that dictate what's considered public vary by state, so check out the national guide by the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press . Information the agency considers off limits may also be redacted, and it may take time to get a response.\n\nWe want to hear from police officers, public employees and community members who can help us learn more about police misconduct in New Jersey and why it's allowed to continue.\n\nEven with the hassles and limitations, public records laws are empowering and I've been surprised by how much I can obtain. My policy is always to ask and make a records clerk explain why I can't have taxpayer-funded records. Follow up to ensure important requests aren't lost or ignored. Assume you should be able to see everything. Your state's public records law may even include a presumption that records are open and exemptions are an exception. You may run into roadblocks that you can't overcome on your own. In some cases, journalism organizations have had to sue to obtain public records. Your budget may not allow for an attorney, but some states have mediators that you can go to if you think your request is being wrongly denied.\n\nIt's striking how much information the government collects but then does not review. So you might be the first person to ask for a particular body of records and put them together to identify an important trend which you can share with leaders who weren't paying attention to the issue. Your local journalists may also be very interested in the information you have gathered.\n\nSometimes it's hard to even know which records exist. That's where documents commonly known as records retention schedules come in handy. Government agencies use these to track which records they keep and how long they hold onto them. Use the schedules to help you see what you might be able to obtain. These are available all over the country. Just for fun, I looked up the city of Los Angeles - they call them records disposition schedules and found them for agencies ranging from the Police Department to the zoo . The agency of interest to you might use a different name for the document, so call them and ask if they have a written guide that shows which records they maintain and for how long.\n\nHow I did it: I started investigating police car chases after I saw the government keeps summaries of those incidents , including how many people are arrested or injured. I saw I could add up those figures and see if the benefits of the chases outweighed the risks and harm. I discovered that chases in recent years usually didn't end with an arrest, and that lots of people get hurt, including cops and bystanders.\n\nIf you're interested in scrutinizing the type of misconduct we saw in Minneapolis, you could request use of force reports. New Jersey made those public a few years ago, and Newark Star-Ledger journalists used them to great effect . ProPublica has that data available here for a fee .\n\nIf I were investigating a case of violence by the police I'd ask for:\n\nI might also request policies that dictate how an agency handles complaints against officers. Some states consider substantiated complaints against individual officers to be public records, so you could request them, depending on where you live. WNYC has a helpful breakdown of where that information is public. If you're looking for video from police body cameras, the Reporters Committee has a guide that shows the places where those are considered public. If you want to obtain recordings of 911 calls, they have a guide for those , too.\n\nYou could also be more general and ask the relevant department for substantiated internal affairs complaints alleging excessive force in the past year or so, if those are public in your state. Departments might keep summary data on internal affairs complaints, so ask for the most recent copy of that, too.\n\nEngaging law enforcement leaders is essential to understanding policing, and their involvement is key to fixing problems. My access and experience as a white man who works for a news organization may be different than someone else's experience. It also depends on who you talk to and their openness to criticism. But I think we stand the best chance of a good outcome if we deal with each other respectfully.\n\nMany policing issues are handled at the local, county or state level. Part of your work will involve figuring out who is responsible for the issue you're concerned about.\n\n\"All policing is local,\" former Milwaukee police Chief Edward A. Flynn told me. Like many cities, Milwaukee is also experiencing unrest and criticism of the police. Flynn, a well-known law enforcement leader, encouraged conversations between citizens and cops, possibly aided by a neutral third party like a local faith leader.\n\n\"The key to changing policing is on the ground level,\" he said. He added that it helps for citizens to praise the good work they see from their officers. He encouraged the public to consider crime statistics when scrutinizing police tactics.\n\nI have found that the police themselves are often open to talking to me about the problems in their profession. Many I have talked to feel bad when things go wrong.\n\nHow I did it: I've been amazed at who is willing to talk to me when I simply take the time to ask. As part of my investigation into police car chases , I talked to a former cop who lost her police officer husband when his vehicle was struck during a high-speed pursuit. I was touched by the way she took hours from her busy life to tell me some of her most painful memories and share her insights as a former cop.\n\nI took my findings to the attorney general, the state's largest police union and to lawmakers who vowed action. \"It appears to me there's a lot more harm done than good right now,\" one of them said about the high-speed incidents.\n\n\"If the community has an issue either positive or negative with their law enforcement, then they should definitely have a conversation with the mayor, council and police chief,\" said New Jersey Assemblyman Gordon Johnson, a former cop who has participated in community discussion about police issues.\n\nContact information for law enforcement leaders is often available online. They may regularly attend meetings that are open to the public.\n\nShow police leaders the problem that concerns you, using specific examples and quantifying the damage broadly. Show them the harm. Be careful to be fair. Frame the violations by showing how they go against policies or laws or best practices. Back up what you're saying with the evidence you've acquired.\n\nHow I did it: To highlight the dangers of police car chases, I introduced readers to Eric Larson, a young father killed when his car was hit by a motorcyclist fleeing police. Then I quantified the harm based on the records I had obtained: \"New Jersey police pursuits killed at least 55 people in the past decade and injured more than 2,500.\"\n\nRemember that there's always a different view to your perspective. Integrate it into your presentation if it is legitimate. Acknowledging the counterpoints helps you focus and ask tougher questions. In the car chase story, I made sure to also note incidents in which police chased a suspected killer and men wanted in connection to a shooting. Sometimes police chase violent criminals, but is it worthwhile for cops to chase someone for a traffic violation?\n\nPolicing is tough work, and there are times when cops use justified force. Differentiate how the issue you identified deviates from what's appropriate.\n\nChange is incremental and can take years. You will likely have to repeat yourself and persist in your efforts. But if you've found an issue of serious public importance - like the use of force incidents we've seen lately from the police - there may be ongoing examples you can point to as you make your case to decision-makers.\n\nKemp's explosive allegation, just days before the closely contested 2018 election, drew wide attention. But newly released documents show that there was no such hack.\n\nIt may be worthwhile to reach out to local journalists with what you've found. News outlets often have a tip line you can call. Or, find a reporter who covers similar issues and call or email them with what you've found. I take calls like this frequently and look forward to them. Academics who study criminal justice may also be interested. You can look them up at your local college or university. When reaching out to reporters or academics, keep it brief and focus on the facts.\n\nThe wave of protests is hitting home for many people, including in my newsroom in New Jersey. On Monday, police arrested my Asbury Park Press colleague Gustavo Martínez Contreras after he filmed officers tackling two minors to the ground in Asbury Park.\n\nI'm continuing to investigate police accountability problems in New Jersey this year in partnership with ProPublica's Local Reporting Network. If you have a tip for me, please share it .\n\nIf you have questions about applying the suggestions in this column, please email me at [email protected] . And if you find anything interesting as you start to investigate law enforcement practices, please let me know.

Reporter Alec MacGillis asks: Will the result be different this time?\n\nby Alec MacGillis\n\nExamining the News\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis article was co-published with The Atlantic and is not subject to our Creative Commons license.\n\nAcross the United States, cities are experiencing turbulence and a rise in gun violence following the protests of abusive policing sparked by the May 25 death of George Floyd in Minneapolis. More than 110 people were shot in that city in the month following Floyd's death, eight fatally. In Atlanta, 106 people were shot over a 28-day period ending July 11, up from 40 over the same period last year.\n\nThis isn't the first time in recent years that America has seen such protests followed by a spike in violence. In the spring of 2015 , the death of Freddie Gray, 25, from injuries sustained in police custody brought demonstrators into the streets of Baltimore. The protests flared into rioting and looting. Soon afterward, the city's chief prosecutor announced criminal charges against the officers involved in the arrest. The officers' colleagues responded by pulling back on the job, doing only the bare minimum in the following weeks. In the resulting void, crews seized new drug corners and settled old scores. Homicides surged to record levels and case-closure rates plunged . \"The police stopped doing their jobs, and let people fuck up other people,\" Carl Stokes, a former Democratic city councilor in Baltimore, told me last year. \"Period. End of story.\"\n\nThe protests of recent months, which reignited again in August following the shooting of a man by police in Kenosha, Wisconsin, as he leaned into his vehicle, have created real momentum for efforts to reform police departments. In many cities, though, rank-and-file police officers are greeting these efforts with an apparent pullback. They say they are aggrieved by the charges against their fellow officers, public criticism of their department as a whole or growing calls to greatly reduce their powers and resources. In several cities, rising violence is already undermining support for shifting resources out of police departments, including among many Black residents and elected leaders . If reformers hope to succeed in curbing overpolicing, they will first have to overcome the challenge of underpolicing, which has often allowed officers to exercise an effective veto on reform.\n\nMichael McGinn dealt with a police pullback when he was mayor of Seattle in 2012. And, he told me, the problem has a straightforward solution: A mayor facing a police pullback has to make it plain that officers are accountable to the elected government they serve. That starts, he said, with relatively small steps, such as demanding that officers uncover their badge numbers. And if officers refuse? \"Anyone who doesn't follow an order gets sent home. That's what you do with someone who doesn't follow orders in a semi-military organization. You fire them.\"\n\nIn Minneapolis, where the City Council approved legislation that would put up for referendum the wholesale replacement of the Police Department, residents have reported a notable decrease in police presence. \"All you see now is them with their windows up,\" one told The Washington Post . In Atlanta, many officers started calling in sick in reaction to the 11 charges, including felony murder, filed against Garrett Rolfe on June 17. The former Atlanta police officer shot and killed Rayshard Brooks, who had been found asleep in his car in a drive-thru, following a tussle with Rolfe and his partner after he failed a sobriety test. Brooks ran from Rolfe and his partner and fired a Taser that he had wrestled from the partner.\n\nThe interim police chief, Rodney Bryant, was left to plead with the officers on his force to do their job. \"I implore you to channel your concerns for your fellow officers by having their back. At this moment, I implore you to remember why you became a police officer. We did not choose this line of work because it was easy,\" he said . \"We became officers because we wanted to help people in distress, make a difference in our communities and simply serve and protect.\n\nBryant's appeal echoed the plea made to Baltimore officers in the spring of 2015 by Anthony Batts, then the city's police commissioner, as homicides soared following Gray's death. \"I talked to them again about character and what character means,\" Batts told me and other reporters. \"I'm sharing with them what it is to put that holster on every day, to put that badge on every day, to put that uniform on every day: the character that it takes, the responsibility that comes with that, and our responsibility to this community and to the 9-year-old little boys who are playing in the middle of the street that get shot. (Batts was replaced as commissioner a few weeks later.)\n\nIt is too early to say whether the Atlanta and Minneapolis officers' pullback will result in a continuing surge of violent crime. In the case of Baltimore, as a ProPublica investigation explored in detail last year , a police pullback appeared to be an instigating element that combined with other problems to create a breakdown of civil order in the city. The rise of violence there has yet to abate , five years later, and has resulted in more than 500 deaths over and above the average homicide toll of the decade prior to 2015.\n\nRises and falls in crime rates are notoriously hard to explain definitively. Scholars still don't agree on the causes of a decadeslong nationwide decline in crime . Still, some academics who have studied the phenomenon in recent years see evidence that rising rates of violence in cities that have experienced high-profile incidents of police brutality are driven by police pullbacks. Many criminologists also cite the general deterioration of trust between the community and police, which leaves residents less likely to report crimes, call in tips or testify in court. Added to that are the dynamics that are now likely also driving a rise in violent crime, even in cities that have not witnessed recent high-profile deaths at police hands: the economic and social stresses of the pandemic lockdowns, including disruptions to illegal drug markets, and the usual seasonal rise in violence during summer.\n\nLawrence Grandpre, the research director with Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle, a Baltimore activist organization, cautions against overstating the role of underpolicing in the rise in violence. He argues that some of the cities where police are coming under scrutiny are also ones where Black residents have been struggling the most with long-standing inequities that could fuel disorder in this time of protest and pandemic-induced stress. \"The dynamics that drive violent crime are intra-community dynamics,\" he told me. \"It's the accumulation of historical trauma in communities. Look to the social and economic disruption of COVID and the sense of hopelessness and desperation that falls on these communities that feel that nothing is working. ... When you're under stress and feel hopeless, it's more likely that these conflicts spiral into violence.\"\n\nAlongside such local dynamics, though, the shared recent experience of cities such as Baltimore, Atlanta, and Minneapolis points to one of the biggest challenges facing municipal leaders who are trying to hold police officers accountable for possible abuses of power and reform their police departments as a whole: the prospect that officers will pull back, staging a silent strike that, at best, leaves the city unable to contend with a spike in violence or, at worst, helps give rise to one.\n\nThe problem is not new, but the politics surrounding it have suddenly changed. For decades, it was political death to run afoul of the police and their powerful unions. Now the electorates of many cities have shifted further left and grown more vociferous about demanding police reform and even defunding departments, which puts more pressure on elected leaders to take a tougher stand against their departments than they might have in years past.\n\nThat means big-city mayors including Atlanta's Keisha Lance Bottoms, New York's Bill de Blasio and Chicago's Lori Lightfoot face a daunting challenge. They have to navigate two problems at the same time: reining in overpolicing while also preventing underpolicing, the consequences of which are every bit as dire. And a great many lives are riding on how well they pull that off.\n\n\"The real issue,\" McGinn told me, \"is what actions will mayors take to reassert control over the police department? Can a mayor admit they don't have control and take more firm action to gain control? That's a big bridge for a mayor to cross. But if you don't cross that bridge, then you have the situation we have across America.\n\nIn Atlanta, the police union has responded to the pressure for accountability and reform by blaming its critics. \"Officers are fed up. They've been treated like crap both by their fellow citizens and their own legislators,\" said Vince Champion, the southeast regional director for the International Brotherhood of Police Officers, which represents most Atlanta officers. \"You can't have it both ways - call us and we come to do our job, but then if our job gets ugly, we're the bad guys.\"\n\nSome of the activists seeking to defund or limit policing might welcome this line of argument - see how you like life without us . But many other activists battling against abuses say they recognize the need for policing, done properly, and they worry about what will happen if police respond to calls for reform by pulling back. \"A lot of the onus for the violence falls right at the feet of law enforcement,\" Gerald Griggs, the first vice president of the NAACP's Atlanta branch, told the Post . \"There are certain elements in our community that don't take a break when the police take a break. You're sworn to protect and defend, but when there are a few rogue [police] being held accountable you decide to shirk your responsibility?\"\n\nAs mayor of Seattle, McGinn inherited policing trouble: He was tasked with negotiating a consent decree in 2012 with the U.S. Department of Justice to overhaul the city's Police Department following several incidents of police force against minority residents, including the fatal shooting of a Native woodcarver and an officer punching a 17-year-old Black girl in the face. The federal government has imposed more than 40 such decrees or other forms of settlement , and conducted about 30 investigations that did not result in decrees, since Congress gave it the authority to do so in 1994, after the police beating of Rodney King in Los Angeles. And many of the decrees have been met with what experts call \"de-policing\" by officers upset about the scrutiny or worried about running afoul of new limits.\n\nMcGinn, a garrulous Democrat who was the Washington State chairman of the Sierra Club before running for office, said in an interview that he was getting reports at the time that officers were taking less initiative to act on possible offenses they witnessed on their rounds and settling more often for responding to calls that came in. But it was a subtle enough shift to escape much notice. \"There were still police doing police things,\" he said.\n\nA former Seattle police officer who was on the force during the consent-decree period explained how this dynamic often played out. (Like the other officers quoted in this story, he spoke on the condition of anonymity because his current position does not authorize him to speak with the media.) Among the elements of the city's consent decree was a broadened definition of \"use of force,\" which required reporting even an arrestee's complaint that handcuffs had caused physical pain. The decree also put in place an early warning system for officers racking up use-of-force incidents at a high rate. Many officers concluded it wasn't worth the hassle to arrest someone for relatively minor offenses, such as public disturbance or loitering, the former officer said.\n\nThese 68 videos show clear apparent instances of police officers escalating violence during protests. Here's what we learned about each case.\n\n\"I made two arrests two days in a row one week, and both turned into paperwork clusterfucks,\" the former officer said. \"When you've accumulated two or three use-of-force complaints in a week, you'll say: 'I just need to stop. I need to stop doing this.'\" Among the sort of policing that fell away, the former officer said, was officers' routine sweeps of areas where drug users congregated, to check their names for outstanding warrants, which would often net suspects in local burglaries. Meanwhile, he said, several dozen of the department's more proactive-minded officers responded to the new rules and paperwork by simply deciding to \"lateral out\" to a job in another police department.\n\nAnd police officers opposed to the consent decree that McGinn negotiated didn't just engage in underpolicing - they found an even more effective way to protest it: The union endorsed his opponent in the 2013 election, Ed Murray, and made a $15,000 campaign expenditure on his behalf. After Murray narrowly defeated McGinn, the new interim police chief he installed dismissed claims of misconduct against a group of officers. (Murray later resigned amid allegations of child sexual abuse. He denied the charges and was not prosecuted, though the city did settle at least one civil case filed by a man accusing Murray of abuse.)\n\nIn Seattle, the pullback correlated with a rise in street crimes and disorder. The city has relatively high rates of property crime, and it has become so well known for highly visible homelessness and drug use that a local TV station owned by the conservative Sinclair Broadcast Group aired an hourlong documentary last year called \" Seattle Is Dying .\"\n\nBut the post-consent-decree pullback did not result in a rise in violent crime in the city, whose homicide rate remained very low compared with other large cities. In this, the city is representative of a broader trend, according to two recent de-policing studies. Richard Rosenfeld, a criminologist at the University of Missouri at St. Louis, and Joel Wallman, the director of research for the Harry Frank Guggenheim Foundation, examined the impact of arrest rates in 53 large cities on homicide rates from 2010 to 2015. They found that arrests, especially for less serious crimes such as loitering, public intoxication, drug possession and vagrancy, had already been dropping over that period, even prior to the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement in 2014. And they found that in nearly all of those cities, the declining arrest rates did not result in higher rates of violence. To put it another way: Over the first half of the past decade, many cities shifted away from the \"broken windows\" style of policing popularized in New York under former Mayor Rudy Giuliani, but even as they did so, violent crime continued to decline in most places, as it has since the early 1990s.\n\nSimilarly, a June working paper by Roland Fryer, a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research, and Tanaya Devi found that in most cities where police have been under federal investigations in recent decades, a step that often leads to consent decrees, rates of violent crime have not increased - just as they didn't in Seattle.\n\nThere was one set of exceptions in the latter study, though. Federal investigations and de-policing did correlate with a sharp rise in violent crime in cities that had experienced what the study referred to as \"viral\" incidents: a high-profile, highly controversial instance of police using deadly force against a civilian - precisely what several cities are contending with today.\n\nIn Baltimore in 2015, the underpolicing was so conspicuous that even some community activists who had long pushed for more restrained policing were left desperate as violence rose in their neighborhoods. \"We saw a pullback in this community for over a month where it was up to the community to police the community. And quite frankly, we were outgunned,\" the West Baltimore community organizer Ray Kelly told me in 2018. In fact, the violence got so out of hand - a 62% increase in homicides over the year before - that even some street-level drug dealers were pleading for greater police presence: One police commander, Melvin Russell, told New York magazine in 2015 that he'd been approached by a drug dealer in the same area where Gray had been arrested, who asked him to send a message back to the police commissioner. \"We know they still mad at us,\" the dealer said. \"We pissed at them. But we need our police.\"\n\nOne veteran Baltimore police officer said that the 2015 pullback was the result of almost instantaneous demoralization that spread across the department. Officers resented the lack of official direction and protective equipment during the riots, he said, and the charges against the six officers involved in Gray's arrest, which the Baltimore state's attorney, Marilyn Mosby, had delivered in a ringing tone from the steps of the city's War Memorial Building. The resentment was exacerbated by the fact that Mosby's own office had recently requested heightened enforcement in exactly the area where Gray was arrested.\n\n\"You were responding to calls - if an old lady was being robbed, you were going to stop them. But as far as being very aggressive and doing proactive patrolling of the sort that Mosby had demanded, that was over,\" the officer said. \"We did exactly what you wanted! And a horrible accident occurred.\n\nThe pullback carried local resonance: Baltimore had been the site of the nation's last major police strike, in 1974, when nearly half of the department's 2,800 officers joined a strike by sanitation workers, jail guards, highway repairers, and park and zoo maintenance workers over wage increases deemed inadequate amid rising inflation. \"I'm a cop/my life is on the line/but not for 5.5%\" and \"I will not die for 5 1/2%,\" read signs on the picket line. After a spike in looting and arson, the governor sent in state police as reinforcements. The strike ended after four days. The city delivered a larger wage increase the next year, but the police commissioner fired more than 80 officers for organizing the strike and revoked the union's collective-bargaining rights, which were not restored until 1982.\n\nIn the spring of 2015, a formal strike was out of the question. The local chapter of the Fraternal Order of Police sent no signals about a pullback, the veteran officer said. There was no need to - the cues coming from other officers, particularly from more veteran ones toward more junior ones, were enough. \"They were very careful about not saying anything official or unofficial that you should lay down and not do your job. But the writing was on the wall,\" the officer said. \"It was the sense that you need to look out for yourselves and not put yourself in harm's way or put yourself at any [legal] risk, because you aren't going to have the support of the department.\"\n\nThe role of underpolicing amid the rising tide of violence was evident even to the staunchest advocates for reining in the police. \"Police 'not doing their job,' I don't think can be the sole explanation,\" Grandpre, the local activist, told me in 2019. \"I do think, however, there is a perception among people in street organizations that the police are not doing their job. And that perception creates the feeling that they could get away with it now, when there was a feeling they could not get away with it four or five or six years ago.\"\n\nBaltimore became the classic example of the exception observed by the Fryer and Devi study: a city in which a \"viral\" incident brings about a federal investigation into policing practices correlated with a notable increase in violent crime. The other five exceptions cited in Fryer and Devi's paper were Chicago; Cincinnati; Riverside, California; and Ferguson, Missouri, where the fatal 2014 shooting of Michael Brown led Sam Dotson, then the St. Louis police chief, to coin the phrase \"Ferguson effect\" to describe rising violence in his own, larger city following protests.\n\nIn their paper, Fryer and Devi note that spikes in violence were not observed in cities that had a viral incident but no ensuing federal investigation, such as North Charleston, South Carolina, following the 2015 police shooting of Walter Scott as he ran from an officer. In those cases, Fryer said in an interview, police seem able to compartmentalize the criticism of the incident, rather than see it as an indictment of the entire force. \"If the police feel like the management has their back, which is what they tend to feel if there's a viral incident and no investigation, then they continue on,\" Fryer said.\n\nFryer said he was also struck to find that investigations not sparked by viral incidents also did not produce spikes in violent crime. But something about the combination of the two - a viral incident leading to an investigation - seemed to lead to police pullbacks and higher rates of violence. \"What I've heard [officers] say is: 'I don't want to be the next YouTube sensation. All I want is my pension. I've got a family to worry about.' They're putting their life on the line to do this work, and if it's not going to be appreciated then they're pulling back,\" he said. \"It's incredible the amount of media intensity that happens when there's a viral incident. It's not that investigations are different, they're the same, but it's the view that, If I make a mistake under these circumstances, it's going to be career altering.\"\n\nRosenfeld, the co-author of the study showing how little impact de-policing has had on violent crime in most cities in recent years, told me that Fryer and Devi's study was \"complementary\" to his own in identifying an exception to the overall trend in a handful of cities. \"Those are cities where the community's relationship with police is enormously fraught, and in those situations, people tend to withdraw from the police and take matters into their own hands,\" he said. \"It's not just what police are or aren't doing that could be provoking more incidents. It's also the community reacting to police brutality.\"\n\nIn Baltimore, the pullback has persisted five years later, in an evolved form. The resentment that police harbored over the charges against the six officers has dissipated; none of the cases ended with a conviction. Now, the veteran officer said, the continued decline in arrest rates and proactive-policing levels are driven more by uncertainty over what is allowed under the city's new consent decree, even after multiple training sessions. Some of the sessions have been useful, the officer said - for instance, on the rules around searches and seizures. But officers are still uncertain about the expanded use-of-force definitions, he said, which include forcible handcuffing, as in Seattle, and about when and how they are allowed to clear crowds from major drug corners, so they often choose to simply drive by them. \"The officers are confused. I have no idea what I can do and what I can't do, and I've been an officer for 20 years,\" he said. \"The good members of the community want us to do our job. But the small number of noisy people who are getting in trouble over and over are out there dictating policy to the detriment of the city.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the 2015 surge in violence has yet to ebb five years later. The department's efforts to win back the trust of the community have been hugely undermined by a police-corruption scandal that resulted in guilty pleas and convictions for a dozen officers, with charges outstanding against several more, the subject of a newly released book by two local journalists. The city finished last year with 348 homicides, even more than in 2015, and is on pace for nearly that many this year.\n\nThe hope remains that, over time, the consent-decree reforms will curb abuses and help rebuild community trust in the department, which in turn will make it easier to solve and prevent violent crimes. Departments - notably, Los Angeles' - have managed to climb back from riots and scandal with the help of a consent decree while presiding over a reduction in violence.\n\nBut that hope is qualified for some reformers by local nuances. For one thing, Baltimore's consent decree requires that the city hire more police officers, in contravention of activist calls to greatly reduce spending on policing. For another thing, Grandpre notes that the consent decree has made it harder for his organization and others to demand specific state-level reforms, such as increasing funding for witness protection in Baltimore. When they went to Annapolis to testify for that, the response was essentially that this was the purview of the federal government, given the consent decree. \"It's a barrier to offer[ing] more targeted forms of police-community reform,\" Grandpre said. \"They focus on abstract professional notions in ways that deter the more substantive reforms on the ground.\"\n\nThe nationwide protests that erupted after Minneapolis police killed George Floyd suggest that his death may have given rise to something relatively new, the equivalent of a viral incident in each individual American city. And in some cities where municipal leaders have supplied the other ingredient researchers identified - signaling their support for broad reforms - police pullbacks appear well under way.\n\nDuring the protests that followed Floyd's death, Seattle police withdrew from their precinct house in the Capitol Hill neighborhood, allowing the area to become an \"autonomous\" zone. In the following days, they were slow to respond to several emergency calls in or near the zone, including a shooting inside the area that left a 19-year-old dead and another injured. (The police attributed their slow response to having been impeded by the zone's occupiers.) Many officers have also refused to uncover their badge numbers, deterring identification.\n\nMcGinn has been observing from the sidelines as the city, now under the leadership of Mayor Jenny Durkan, appears to be experiencing its own version of a silent strike protesting the activists and Durkan, who initially said the autonomous zone had a \" block-party atmosphere . There s a lot of evidence that the police today are not fully under control of the mayor. No mayor can admit that, but all evidence seems to suggest that,\" McGinn said in July, just before police finally moved to clear the autonomous zone. \"They're engaging in their own version of civil disobedience - showing that they're the thin blue line and that without them there will be chaos. That's what they believe and they want to go out there and prove it.\"\n\nIn New York, the 205 shootings in June were the most for that month in the city since 1996, and shootings are up 72% over the first seven months of the year compared with last year. Police Commissioner Dermot Shea has said that his officers are feeling constrained by a new bill passed by the City Council that makes it a crime to put their knee into someone's back and are feeling demoralized by a general lack of public support. Regardless of motivations, what is beyond dispute is that arrest rates have fallen sharply in the city since May, while violence has been rising, In the week of May 24, according to The New York Times , there were 113 gun arrests citywide; by early June, the weekly tally was down to 71, and by late June, it was at 22.\n\n\"There's a slowdown without a doubt, and NYPD is allowing it,\" the chairman of the City Council's public safety committee, Donovan Richards, told the   Times . \"We've seen what the NYPD will do when they want to keep record low shootings over the course of the last few years. Every year, we're breaking this record, we're breaking this record. There's not an effort being made at this point.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in Portland, Oregon, where protests over Floyd's death have lingered longer than in most other cities, 15 people fell victim to homicide in July, the city's deadliest monthly toll in decades, while police have been fuming over the newly elected district attorney's decision to dismiss many of the cases against protesters, which has in turn led to reports of disengagement by officers . All told, homicides in the 50 largest cities are up by nearly a quarter over the first half of the year, according to a Wall Street Journal analysis, while many other crimes, including robberies and burglaries, are generally down.\n\nThe former Seattle officer predicted that any pullbacks would follow the same template they had in his city. Officers with less than 10 years of experience who still want to engage in proactive policing might move to other departments. \"They're going to leave, because they received the message politically that it's not being supported,\" he said. Officers who have 10 or years or less until retirement will likely stay. Also sticking around will be officers with lengthy records of complaints - \"'internal affairs' jackets that are too ugly\" - because it's hard for them to get hired elsewhere. Something of the sort appears to be under way in Minneapolis, where 65 officers have already left the department this year, well above the usual attrition rate of about 45 a year, according to the Times, and dozens of other officers on the force of about 850 have taken temporary leave since Floyd's death and the ensuing protests.\n\nThe Seattle officer also predicted that officers who remain will scale back by, for instance, taking longer than necessary to handle a 911 call, just to fill their shift. A Washington, D.C., police officer told me he was already seeing signs of such easing back in his department, which has avoided a viral incident on par with the Floyd and Brooks deaths but has faced criticism for its aggressive response to the recent protests. \"I haven't seen anyone say we're not going out because of this, but I have seen people take more time,\" the D.C. police officer said.\n\nThe D.C. officer, like those from Seattle and Baltimore, was quick to underscore how appalled officers were by the video of the death of George Floyd under the knee of the Minneapolis officer Derek Chauvin. \"All of my colleagues had a feeling of broken hearts,\" he said. \"It was a sadness.\" What has driven the widespread demoralization among officers, the officers said, was not the public condemnation of Chauvin, but the protests' focus on police in general as the overwhelming target of their ire.\n\nAs many police see it, government and society have failed Black citizens and their neighborhoods on countless levels, and they have left it to the police to reckon with the consequences and then to bear the blame. The blame is especially hard to take, the officers say, when it comes from well-to-do white liberals who have moved to segregated suburbs or kept their kids in heavily white schools, yet are quick to accuse officers of racism. \"It's systemic. But wealthy whites in Northwest [D.C.] see a cop on Fox 5 do something that's awful and they want to blame the cop and keep it moving and not accept the responsibility that we all have,\" the D.C. officer said. \"It's great to Zoom into a City Council hearing and repeat what you heard at your Georgetown class.\n\nFueling the resentment of such criticism is the perception that some well-off critics are untouched by the high levels of violence in the neighborhoods that the officers spend a lot of their time patrolling. The officers also note that - as James Forman Jr. wrote about in his 2017 book, \"Locking Up Our Own: Crime and Punishment in Black America\" - many residents of these neighborhoods see more of a need for a greater police presence than some activist rhetoric reflects. \"They don't have a stake in the game,\" said the Baltimore officer of the police's more privileged critics. \"Where was the outrage of these people the weekend that 11 people were murdered [in Baltimore]? Instead, people were rioting over the murderous act by this ridiculous asshole,\" Chauvin.\n\nThe Baltimore officer was among those detailed for the protests over George Floyd, which ended up being far more contained than the Freddie Gray protests five years ago, as well as the recent protests in other cities. Still, he said, it was hard to stand there and absorb the anger and scorn. \"It's demoralizing. After 20 years, it's soul-crushing. I know I do good in the community. That's what I do, at great sacrifice to my family and my health. The collateral damage of dealing with horrible, depressing stuff day after day, it adds up,\" he said. \"People are just so angered, and their anger is directed at us, because we are part of the machine and the system that has oppressed them. To have them screaming 'All cops are bad; you're a murderer' is soul-crushing. I know better, but it just is.\"\n\nThere is, in fact, a city that seemed to make it through a recent police pullback and the spike of violent crime that followed, and that can provide a model for mayors who want to pursue policing reforms. Fryer and Devi's research paper cites Chicago's 2016 homicide surge , alongside Baltimore's, as an instance in which a police pullback accompanied a sharp rise in violent crime. In Chicago's case, the pullback followed charges against the officers involved in the killing of Laquan McDonald. The 17-year-old was shot 16 times by police in 2014, but the video of the shooting wasn't released until a year later. Chicago saw its homicide tally spike from 478 in 2015 to 756 in 2016, an increase nearly as large as that suffered by Baltimore from 2014 to 2015.\n\nBut unlike Baltimore, Chicago saw its homicide tally retreat after the spike, with three straight years of declines , down to 482 last year - still one of the highest rates in the country, but 35% lower than in 2016. And the declines were happening as the city was entering into its own federal consent decree stemming from McDonald's killing.\n\nThe city's current deputy mayor for public safety, Susan Lee, says the improved trajectory could be attributed partly to Eddie Johnson, the police superintendent installed by then-Mayor Rahm Emanuel in April 2016. Johnson grew up in one of the city's most notorious housing projects and had sufficient credibility with many officers to rally them back to the job at hand. (He was fired late last year after officers found him sleeping in his car after drinking.)\n\nAdditionally, a coalition of several dozen local organizations and foundations made a unified investment in violence reduction. \"The horrendous spike in murders brought a citywide response that was about embracing [the Police Department] but also about the community stepping up and saying, 'We need to do more,'\" Lee told me.\n\nThis success story had a disheartening coda, though. Amid this year's nationwide rise in violence, Chicago is now experiencing one of the worst increases of all, putting it on pace to near its 2016 total, alongside several high-profile episodes of looting downtown, most recently again on Aug. 10 .\n\nLee cautioned against seeing all apparent police withdrawals through the lens of rank-and-file resentment. In some cases, she said, officers are still operating under the limits imposed by COVID-19 concerns, or are simply weary from protest details, which, along with coronavirus quarantines, have been pulling many of them from their beat. \"We've had a transition from the closures to reopening ramping up, and there's a level of uncertainty from that. They're working 12-hour days for multiple days. There's a sheer exhaustion factor. All of that would translate into folks saying, 'Officers are not working as hard.'\" The key to making sure that officers were not edging into a more deliberate withdrawal, Lee said, lay with command staff. \"It all goes back to supervision and whether those frontline supervisors are holding people accountable for their work product.\"\n\nBack in Baltimore, the next person to face the threat of police pulling back from the job they are paid to do is likely going to be Brandon Scott, the 36-year-old City Council president who narrowly won the recent Democratic mayoral primary and is thus nearly guaranteed to win the November general election. Scott, who grew up in one of the city's most homicide-plagued neighborhoods, watched from his perch as chairman of the council's public safety committee as the recent pullback occurred and violence filled the void. He told me that he was confident that he would be able to address the threat of withdrawal, should it arise again, partly because of the personal ties he's built over the years with many in the department. \"Leaders lead,\" he said. \"You have to have leaders that are able to communicate to multiple groups of people, who have relationships with different groups of people. It doesn't mean they'll always be happy with everything you do, but they'll appreciate that you did it in a thoughtful way.\"\n\nAnd what if officers in Baltimore, or elsewhere, still hold back? \"Most of these places have failure-to-obey-lawful-duty provisions, and they should follow them,\" Scott said. \"You signed up to protect people.\"\n\nAre you a public health worker or front-line medical provider?

Some of those former officers now say it's no surprise white nationalists were able to storm the building.\n\nby Joshua Kaplan and Joaquin Sapien\n\nThe Effort to Overturn the Election\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nWhen Kim Dine took over as the new chief of the U.S. Capitol Police in 2012, he knew he had a serious problem.\n\nSince 2001, hundreds of Black officers had sued the department for racial discrimination. They alleged that white officers called Black colleagues slurs like the N-word and that one officer found a hangman's noose on his locker. White officers were called \"huk lovers\" or \"FOGs\" - short for \"friends of gangsters\" - if they were friendly with their Black colleagues. Black officers faced \"unprovoked traffic stops\" from fellow Capitol Police officers. One Black officer claimed he heard a colleague say, \"Obama monkey, go back to Africa.\"\n\nIn case after case, agency lawyers denied wrongdoing. But in an interview, Dine said it was clear he had to address the department's charged racial climate. He said he promoted a Black officer to assistant chief, a first for the agency, and tried to increase diversity by changing the force's hiring practices. He also said he hired a Black woman to lead a diversity office and created a new disciplinary body within the department, promoting a Black woman to lead it.\n\n\"There is a problem with racism in this country, in pretty much every establishment that exists,\" said Dine, who left the agency in 2016. \"You can always do more in retrospect.\"\n\nWhether the Capitol Police managed to root out racist officers will be one of many issues raised as Congress investigates the agency's failure to prevent a mob of Trump supporters from attacking the Capitol while lawmakers inside voted to formalize the electoral victory of President-elect Joe Biden.\n\nAlready, officials have suspended several police officers for possible complicity with insurrectionists, one of whom was pictured waving a Confederate battle flag as he occupied the building. One cop was captured on tape seeming to take selfies with protesters, while another allegedly wore a red \"Make America Great Again\" hat as he directed protesters around the Capitol building. While many officers were filmed fighting off rioters, at least 12 others are under investigation for possibly assisting them.\n\nTwo current Black Capitol Police officers told BuzzFeed News that they were angered by leadership failures that they said put them at risk as racist members of the mob stormed the building. The Capitol Police force is only 29% Black in a city that's 46% Black. By contrast, as of 2018, 52% of Washington Metropolitan police officers were Black. The Capitol Police are comparable to the Metropolitan force in spending, employing more than 2,300 people and boasting an annual budget of about a half-billion dollars.\n\nThe Capitol Police did not immediately respond to questions for this story.\n\nSharon Blackmon-Malloy, a former Capitol Police officer who was the lead plaintiff in the 2001 discrimination lawsuit filed against the department, said she was not surprised that pro-Trump rioters burst into the Capitol last week.\n\nIn her 25 years with the Capitol Police, Blackmon-Malloy spent decades trying to raise the alarm about what she saw as endemic racism within the force, even organizing demonstrations where Black officers would return to the Capitol off-duty, protesting outside the building they usually protect.\n\nThe 2001 case, which started with more than 250 plaintiffs, remains pending. As recently as 2016, a Black female officer filed a racial discrimination complaint against the department.\n\n\"Nothing ever really was resolved. Congress turned a blind eye to racism on the Hill,\" Blackmon-Malloy, who retired as a lieutenant in 2007, told ProPublica. She is now vice president of the U.S. Capitol Black Police Association, which held 16 demonstrations protesting alleged discrimination between 2013 and 2018. \"We got Jan. 6 because no one took us seriously.\"\n\nRetired Lt. Frank Adams sued the department in 2001 and again in 2012 for racial discrimination. A Black, 20-year veteran of the force, Adams supervised mostly white officers in the patrol division. He told ProPublica he endured or witnessed racism and sexism constantly. He said that before he joined the division, there was a policy he referred to as \"meet and greet,\" where officers were directed to stop any Black person on the Hill. He also said that in another unit, he once found a cartoon on his desk of a Black man ascending to heaven only to be greeted by a Ku Klux Klan wizard. When he complained to his superior officers, he said he was denied promotions and training opportunities, and suffered other forms of retaliation.\n\nIn an interview, he drew a direct line between racism in the Capitol Police and the events that unfolded last week. He blamed Congress for not listening to Black members of the force years ago.\n\n\"They only become involved in oversight when it's in the news cycle,\" said Adams, who retired in 2011. \"They ignored the racism happening in the department. They ignored the hate.\"\n\nThe department's record in other areas of policing have drawn criticism as well.\n\nIn 2015, a man landed a gyrocopter on the Capitol lawn - top officials didn't know the airborne activist was coming until minutes before he touched down. In 2013, when a lone gunman opened fire at the nearby Navy Yard, killing 12 people, the Capitol Police were criticized for standing on the sidelines. The force's leadership board later determined its actions were justified.\n\nLast month, days after a bloody clash on Dec. 12 between militant Trump supporters and counterprotesters, Melissa Byrne and Chibundu Nnake were entering the Capitol when they saw a strangely dressed man just outside the building, carrying a spear.\n\nHe was a figure they would come to recognize - Jacob Chansley, the QAnon follower in a Viking outfit who was photographed last week shouting from the dais of the Senate chamber.\n\nThey alerted the Capitol Police at the time, as the spear seemed to violate the complex's weapons ban, but officers dismissed their concern, they said.\n\nOne officer told them that Chansley had been stopped earlier in the day, but that police \"higher ups\" had decided not to do anything about him.\n\nWe don't \"perceive it as a weapon,\" Nnake recalled the officer saying of the spear.\n\nChansley told the Globe and Mail's Adrian Morrow that Capitol Police had allowed him in the building on Jan. 6, which would normally include passing through a metal detector, although he was later charged with entering a restricted building without lawful authority, violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. As of Tuesday, he had not yet entered a plea .\n\nFor Byrne and Nnake, their interactions with the \"QAnon Shaman\" on Dec. 14 highlighted what they perceive as double standards in how the Capitol Police interact with the public.\n\nLike many people who regularly encounter the force, Nnake and Byrne said they were accustomed to Capitol officers enforcing rules aggressively - later that day, Nnake was told that he would be tackled if he tried to advance beyond a certain point. \"As a Black man, when I worked on the Hill, if I forgot a badge, I couldn't get access anywhere,\" he told ProPublica.\n\nCongress, which controls the agency and its budget, has a mixed record of oversight. For the most part, Congress has been deferential toward the force, paying attention to its workings only after serious security failures, and even then, failing to meaningfully hold its leaders accountable.\n\nRep. Eleanor Holmes Norton, a Democrat from D.C. who is a nonvoting member of Congress, told ProPublica she believes a national commission should be formed to investigate what occurred at the Capitol on Jan. 6, similar to what followed 9/11.\n\n\"Congress deserves some of the blame,\" she told ProPublica. \"We have complete control over the Capitol Police. ... Long-term concerns with security have been raised, and they've not been dealt with in the past.\"\n\nThe force has also suffered a spate of recent, internal scandals that may prove pertinent as Congress conducts its investigation.\n\nCapitol Police officers accidently left several guns in bathrooms throughout the building in 2015 and 2019; in one instance, the loaded firearm was discovered by a small child.\n\nThe agency has been criticized for a lack of transparency for years. Capitol Police communications and documents are not subject to the Freedom of Information Act and, unlike many local law enforcement agencies, it has no external watchdog specifically assigned to investigate and respond to community complaints. The force has not formally addressed the public since the riot last week.\n\nBrian David Sicknick, 42, died of injuries sustained while trying to protect the Capitol. Family members say they don't want his death politicized. But they do want to understand what happened.\n\n\"All law enforcement is opaque,\" said Jonathan M. Smith, executive director of the Washington Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights and Urban Affairs. \"At least most local police departments are subject to some kind of civilian oversight, but federal police agencies are left to operate in the shadows.\"\n\nThe agency's past troubles have rarely resulted in reform, critics said.\n\nAfter the April 2015 gyrocopter incident, Congress held a hearing to examine how 61-year-old postal worker and activist Doug Hughes managed to land his aircraft after he livestreamed his flight. Dozens of reporters and news cameras assembled in front of the Capitol to watch the stunt, which was designed to draw attention to the influence of money in politics. Capitol Police did not learn of the incoming flight until a reporter reached out to them for comment, minutes before Hughes landed.\n\nDine defended the force's response to the incident, pointing out that Hughes was promptly arrested and no one was hurt.\n\nFormer Rep. Jason Chaffetz, a Republican from Utah, then the chairman of the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, harshly criticized the department and other federal agencies for what he perceived as an intelligence failure.\n\n\"The Capitol Police is terrible and pathetic when it comes to threat assessment,\" Chaffetz told ProPublica in an interview. \"They have a couple people dedicated to it, but they're overwhelmed. Which drives me nuts. ... It's not been a priority for leadership, on both sides of the aisle.\" He said he is not aware of any serious changes to the force's intelligence gathering following the debacle.\n\nNorton, who also pressed Dine at the hearing, told ProPublica the intelligence lapses surrounding the gyrocopter landing should be considered a \"forerunner\" to last week's riot.\n\n\"For weeks, these people had been talking about coming to the Capitol to do as much harm as they can,\" Norton said. \"Everyone knew it. Except the Capitol Police.\" Reports show the force had no contingency plan to deal with an escalation of violence and mayhem at last week's rally, even though the FBI and the New York Police Department had warned them it could happen.\n\nLaw enforcement experts said that the agency is in a difficult position. While it has sole responsibility for protecting the Capitol, it must work with other nearby federal law enforcement agencies, Washington's Metropolitan Police and the National Guard in case of emergencies.\n\nIn an interview, Nick Zotos, a former D.C. National Guard commander who now works for the Department of Homeland Security, said that the roughly two dozen agencies responsible for public safety in Washington can cause territorial disputes, finger-pointing and poor communication.\n\n\"This is not a D.C. thing, necessarily, although it's probably the worst in D.C.,\" Zotos said. \"Police departments just don't play with each other nicely.\"\n\nBlackmon-Malloy told ProPublica that divisions within the Capitol Police could be just as dangerous, not only for Congress but for Black officers themselves. \"Now you got to go to work on the 20th,\" she told ProPublica, alluding to the inauguration. \"And stand next to someone who you don't even know if they have your back.\"\n\nDara Lind , David McSwane and Kirsten Berg contributed reporting.\n\nJoshua Kaplan\n\nI'm a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter at ProPublica, where I write about the government, money and power.\n\nJoaquin Sapien\n\nJoaquin Sapien is a reporter at ProPublica covering criminal justice and social services.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "\"I Don't Trust the People Above Me\": Riot Squad Cops Open Up About Disastrous Response to Capitol Insurrection\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThe riot squad defending the embattled entrance to the west side of the U.S. Capitol was surrounded by violence. Rioters had clambered up the scaffolding by the stage erected for the inauguration of President Joseph Biden. They hurled everything they could get their hands on at the cops beneath: rebar, plywood, power tools, even cans of food they had frozen for extra damage.\n\nIn front of the cops, a mob was mounting a frontal assault. Its members hit officers with fists and baseball bats. They grabbed at weapons slung from the officers' waists. They unleashed a barrage of M-80 firecrackers. Soaked in never-ending streams of bright orange bear spray, the officers choked on plumes of acrid smoke that singed their nostrils and obscured their vision.\n\nOne officer in the middle of the scrum, a combat veteran, thought the rioters were so vicious, so relentless, that they seemed fueled by methamphetamine. To his left, he watched a chunk of steel strike a fellow officer above the eye, setting off a geyser of blood. A pepper ball tore through the air over his shoulder and exploded against the jaw of a man in front of him. The round, filled with chemical irritant, ripped the rioter's face open. His teeth were now visible through a hole in his cheek. Blood poured out, puddling on the pavement surrounding the building. But the man kept coming.\n\nThe combat veteran was hit with bear spray eight times. His experience overseas \"was nothing like this,\" he said. \"Nothing at all.\"\n\nOver the last several weeks, ProPublica has interviewed 19 current and former U.S. Capitol Police officers about the assault on the Capitol. Following on the dramatic video of officers defending the building that House lawmakers showed during the first day of the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump, the interviews provide the most detailed account to date of a most extraordinary battle.\n\nThe enemies on Jan. 6 were Americans: thousands of people from across the country who had descended on the Capitol, intent on stopping Congress from certifying an election they believed was stolen from Trump. They had been urged to attend by Trump himself, with extremist right-wing and militia leaders calling for violence.\n\nMany of the officers were speaking to reporters for the first time about the day's events, almost all anonymously for fear of retribution. That they spoke at all is an indication of the depth of their frustration over the botched response. ProPublica also obtained confidential intelligence bulletins and previously unreported planning documents.\n\nCombined, the information makes clear how failures of leadership, communication and tactics put the lives of hundreds of officers at risk and allowed rioters to come dangerously close to realizing their threats against members of Congress.\n\nIn response to questions for this story, the Capitol Police sent a one-sentence email: \"There is a multi-jurisdictional investigation underway and in order to protect that process, we are unfortunately unable to provide any comment at this time.\"\n\nThe interviews also revealed officers' concerns about disparities in the way the force prepared for Black Lives Matter demonstrations versus the pro-Trump protests on Jan. 6. Officers said the Capitol Police force usually plans intensively for protests, even if they are deemed unlikely to grow violent. Officers said they spent weeks working 12- or 16-hour days, poised to fight off a riot, after George Floyd was killed by Minneapolis police - even though intelligence suggested there was not much danger from protesters.\n\n\"We had intel that nothing was going to happen - literally nothing,\" said one former official with direct knowledge of planning for the Black Lives Matter demonstrations. \"The response was, 'We don't trust the intel.'\"\n\nBy contrast, for much of the force, Jan. 6 began like any other day.\n\n\"We normally have pretty good information regarding where these people are and how far they are from the Capitol,\" said Keith McFaden, a former Capitol Police officer and union leader who retired from the force following the riot. \"We heard nothing that day.\"\n\nFor the members of the riot squad who formed the first line of defense on the Capitol's lower west terrace on Jan. 6, the lack of information could not have come with higher stakes.\n\nThrust into the most intense battle of the insurrection, the roughly two dozen officers bought lawmakers crucial time to scramble for safety. For about 100 heart-pounding minutes, they slipped and skidded across a stone surface slick with blood and bear spray, attempting to hold their ground against a rampaging mass of thousands.\n\nTo many of them, it felt like no one was in charge of the Capitol's defense. All they could hear on the police radio were desperate cries for help.\n\nAt one point, the combat veteran was forced to stumble back from the line, his face so covered in bear spray he could barely see or breathe.\n\nWhen he came to, a surge spilled over to his south. The crowd pushed over several bike racks. He realized the unfathomable had happened. His squad had lost the line; the mob could now enter the Capitol. There was no choice but to fall back. The officers stumbled over blood and debris until they were pressed against a limestone wall at the rear of the terrace. The mob had them cornered.\n\nThe officers, drained from their standoff, found a narrow staircase leading to an entrance of the building. But it could fit only one officer at a time. So they took turns climbing it as the crowd closed in, screaming obscenities and threatening murder.\n\n\"You fucking faggots!\" one shouted. \"You're not even American!\"\n\nWaiting to climb the stairs, the combat veteran feared the worst. \"This is where they'll find my body,\" he thought.\n\nOn the morning of Jan. 4, members of a civil disturbance unit gathered in a briefing room. A small group of officers were shown a document from Capitol intelligence officials that projected as many as 20,000 people arriving in Washington that week. The crowd would include members of several militia and right-wing extremist groups, including the Proud Boys, the Boogaloo Bois and the white supremacist Patriot Front. Some were expected to be armed, according to one officer who attended the briefing. The document anticipated that there could be violence.\n\nThe officers weren't allowed to physically share the document with anyone else, but they relayed its substance to the rest of their squad in a separate meeting. Together, the unit members discussed possible scenarios and pored over a map of the Capitol and its surroundings to identify vulnerable areas that could erupt in conflict.\n\nThe iconic west front of the Capitol emerged as an obvious target. Donald Trump was going to speak at the Ellipse across from the White House; from there, it's a direct walk past the Washington Monument and the reflecting pool outside the Capitol to the western facade of the building. The riot squad knew that if the crowd was going to violently confront police, that's where it would probably happen.\n\nBut the intelligence the unit relied on to make that judgment was not widely shared within the department. Several officers assigned to other commands told ProPublica they received no warning whatsoever going into Jan. 6. \"We went to work like it was a normal fucking day,\" one said.\n\n\"It was business as usual,\" said another, who has been on the force for more than 15 years. \"The main thing we were told was to be on the lookout for counterdemonstrators.\"\n\nThe Capitol Police force is made up of four main divisions, each responsible for safeguarding its own section of the Capitol complex. But ProPublica learned that these divisions operate in silos, often out of sync with one another. On Jan. 6, their failure to coordinate led to disastrous results. One group of officers was left stranded, separated from their riot gear, which sat unused on a parked bus near the Capitol while unprotected officers endured beatings with metal pipes and flagpoles.\n\nThe officers said that in the past, weekly Capitol Police intelligence briefings had kept the force well-informed about potential security threats from upcoming events. But those briefings stopped years ago.\n\nSeveral weeks before Jan. 6, many officers were ordered by their leadership to return their helmets because they were so old, the officers said. One officer told ProPublica he had received his helmet decades ago, and the padding was rotted out. Many said their helmets were never replaced. On the day of the riot, the department only had helmets available in medium size, one officer said. Many officers didn't have gas masks. Most hadn't received riot training in years.\n\n\"They've been asking about this for over 10 years - this kind of equipment, this kind of training,\" said one officer, who asked for anonymity out of concern for retribution. \"We've always talked about the big one.\"\n\nMcFaden, the officer who retired last month after more than two decades as a Capitol Police officer, said that the communication failure going into Jan. 6 was consistent with recent history.\n\nAs second-in-command at the Capitol Police union, McFaden said, he met with then-Chief Steven Sund and other leaders of the force every two weeks.\n\n\"We'd consistently ask them, for years, 'What are the contingency plans for upcoming events?'\" McFaden told ProPublica. \"We'd always get either a no response, or that things were in flux and it's a national security issue and we can't divulge that information at this time.\"\n\nIn the absence of communication from the upper ranks on how to prepare, officers turned to social media or to each other.\n\nOne officer said he first heard about the planned protest a week before, when a friend from another federal agency called him to say, as he recalled: \"You all are gonna have your hands full next week. You got some mean boys coming up there.\" The officer was confused. \"What do you mean?\" he replied.\n\nAs the day drew nearer, the chatter became more tense. Twitter and Facebook were abuzz with hotel rooms filling up, and Trump supporters were pouring into Washington, announcing their plans to initiate a \"civil war\" or \"revolution.\" On a well-trafficked pro-Trump forum, one of the most popular posts from Jan. 5 said Congress \"has a choice to make tomorrow\": certify Trump's victory, or \"get lynched by patriots.\"\n\nOfficers, particularly the younger ones, spent shifts glued to their phones, forwarding ominous posts to their sergeants.\n\nSimilar warnings reached the Capitol Police's intelligence division. ProPublica obtained a previously unreported 17-page Capitol Police operational plan that showed select officials were notified of \"numerous social media posts\" encouraging protesters to arrive armed.\n\nThe document, which is dated Jan. 5, also states that white supremacists and the Proud Boys were expected to attend the rally, along with \"other extremist groups,\" including antifa, the left-wing movement that has clashed with far-right groups and drawn the ire of some Republicans. The plan called for \"counter-sniper teams\" on the Capitol dome and officers monitoring for concealed weapons, but did not discuss a potential breach of the Capitol.\n\nOther intelligence reports reviewed by ProPublica reveal inconsistencies - a sign of internal confusion about how best to respond.\n\nProPublica also obtained four daily reports from the department's intelligence division that were shared widely among commanders of the force, spanning the dates Jan. 4 through Jan. 7. The documents make no mention of expected extremist groups or the possibility that demonstrators would be armed. Instead, they note simply that \"folks could organize a demonstration on USCP grounds.\"\n\nThe intelligence reports provide a kind of threat scale that gauges the likelihood of arrests. The Jan. 6 rally was scored as \"improbable,\" meaning it had a 20% to 45% chance of resulting in arrests. Two small anti-Trump counterdemonstrations organized by local left-wing and antifascist groups were assigned the same risk level.\n\nSund, who submitted his resignation as chief of the Capitol Police on Jan. 7, later said he had tried to call in the National Guard two days before the riot. He said the sergeants-at-arms - the House and Senate officials responsible for security of lawmakers - denied his request . Both officials have since resigned. Reached by phone, former House sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving declined to comment. Former Senate sergeant-at-arms Michael Stenger did not immediately respond to a message left by phone.\n\nIn an emailed response to questions for this story, Sund said he and other departmental leaders were not responsible for assigning risk levels to upcoming events, and that he is \"not sure of the process\" the Capitol Police intelligence division uses to assess risk. He said intelligence was shared with division commanders to pass along to their troops, and that he emailed the assistant and deputy chiefs on Jan. 5 to ensure officers knew what to expect the following day. Sund also said \"the force did much more to prepare for the events of January 6 than we did to prepare for BLM demonstrations,\" including expanding the perimeter around the Capitol and coordinating support from Metropolitan police. He said any \"breakdown in communication\" on Jan. 6 was \"surely the result of the extraordinary events of that day.\"\n\nHe also defended his actions in an eight-page letter to congressional leaders dated Feb. 1, saying, in essence, that he and his fellow leaders did the best they could with the information they had.\n\nSund said he ordered an \"all hands on deck\" response, meaning every available officer \"would be working.\" He said he deployed about 250 specialized crowd control officers, \"approximately four platoons\" of which were outfitted in riot gear. He said that during the riot he urgently requested help from a variety of federal and local agencies. He added that the Capitol Police ordered more helmets and received about 100 of them on Jan. 4. But he acknowledged that \"a number of systems broke down.\"\n\n\"I also wish we had had better intelligence and warnings as to the possibility of this type of military style armed insurrection,\" Sund wrote, pointing out that there was a shared responsibility across a number of agencies. \"The entire intelligence community seems to have missed this.\"\n\nAt 7 a.m. on Jan. 6, an officer on the department's midnight shift finished work and got into his car near the Capitol. Already, swarms of people were walking past, waving Trump flags. He sat in the driver's seat for a minute, watching. He called up an old colleague and marveled at the crowd.\n\nThe officer was surprised his superiors were letting him off duty. During the Black Lives Matter protests last summer, the night shift had often been held over to help. But he hadn't heard anything from his bosses, so he drove home to the Maryland suburbs and went to sleep. When he woke up, he saw on television what was happening and sped back, following an unmarked police car that had its lights flashing.\n\nMeanwhile, officers belonging to the riot squad were making their way into the district to start their shifts. They could see throngs of people pouring out of Union Station, the railway hub within sight of the Capitol. They, too, were startled by the number of people on the streets that morning - it seemed that at every red light, a hundred demonstrators crossed in front of them. The officers hurried to prepare themselves for a long day.\n\nAt 10 a.m., as Trump supporters began to gather to listen to the president, the riot squad held roll call at a building a few blocks from the Capitol steps. There was little new to share from the intelligence division. Instead, the riot squad's sergeants played clips found on social media: videos of protesters meeting in cities across the country, getting ready to drive to D.C. They told officers to make sure they had filters in their gas masks and snacks in their pockets.\n\nWith no real direction from their superiors, the sergeants tried to get their troops mentally prepared.\n\n\"You guys all drove in, you guys saw the same thing we did,\" one of the sergeants told the officers, according to members of the team. \"If something happens,\" another instructed, \"just find work.\"\n\nThe unit put on their riot gear: helmets and body armor. Shields were placed in strategic areas around the Capitol complex, though some officers later said they could not get to them. One sergeant gave officers a final warning. \"If this goes good, then we'll laugh about it,\" he told them. \"But if it goes bad, it'll change your life and you'll never forget about it. They'll talk about this for years and years and years.\"\n\nThe riot squad members got on a bus to await their orders.\n\nSitting in his gear, one officer was struck by the age range of the people in attendance. \"People had their little kids, 2-year-olds, babies in strollers,\" he recalled. An elderly woman with a walker inched toward the Capitol: \"Every two steps, she has to stop and catch her breath.\"\n\nAfter about an hour, the radio crackled: A possible bomb had been found outside the Republican National Committee headquarters, southeast of the Capitol complex. Capitol Police officers raced to the scene.\n\nOn the bus, the information did not set off panic. Suspicious packages are discovered all the time on the Hill; usually they are false alarms.\n\nThen another, more urgent call went out. A 10-33, code for an officer in distress. An officer had been knocked backwards and hit her head on a flight of steps. The outer perimeter surrounding the west front of the Capitol had been breached.\n\nNormally, the sergeants on the bus would wait for orders. But one snapped. \"Fuck this, we're going,\" he said. The bus steered around the Capitol, barely squeezing between parked cars and protesters that had clogged a drive alongside the building.\n\nRealizing they were effectively marooned, the sergeants ordered the riot squad off the bus. They began to walk across a wide lawn outside the Capitol.\n\nAs the officers drew closer, they realized that the lower section of the building's west terrace was guarded only by what is known as a \"soft squad,\" officers with little protective gear dressed in neon yellow outerwear and baseball caps. The rioters were attempting to pull away metal barricades known as \"bike racks,\" and striking officers with their fists. With about 150 yards to go, the squad members broke into a dead sprint.\n\nOnce they reached the lower steps, the riot officers spread out behind the soft squad, tapping its members out, one by one. The riot squad came into formation in front of their less-protected colleagues: about two dozen officers attempting to hold 120 feet of open space, behind the line of barricades.\n\nLooking out toward the Mall and the Washington Monument, the squad realized the grass had disappeared from view, blocked out by a crowd of thousands.\n\nAt about 1 p.m., Trump gave a rousing speech to protesters, suggesting they head to the Capitol to protest the election certification. \"We're going to walk down\" to the Capitol, where they must \"fight,\" he said.\n\n\"We're going to the Capitol,\" he told the increasingly agitated crowd of protesters. \"We're going to try and give [Republicans] the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country.\"\n\nVice President Mike Pence had just arrived in the House Chamber. The lawmakers awaiting him still hadn't realized just how dire the situation was becoming.\n\nTo Sund, it was already clear that \"the situation was deteriorating rapidly,\" he wrote in his letter. He requested support from a number of agencies, including the Secret Service, and asked the sergeants-at-arms to authorize the National Guard and declare a state of emergency. According to the letter, Sund recalled that Irving, the House sergeant-at-arms, said he \"needed to run it up the chain of command.\"\n\nOutside on the lower west terrace, the rioters had begun launching their offensive. At first, they pushed officers from across the bike racks, almost testing to see what they could get away with. Soon it became a fistfight. In what felt like minutes, it turned into an all-out brawl involving scores of armed rioters.\n\nTo the police on the line, it seemed like every time they shoved one protester back, three more surged ahead to take their place.\n\n\"Some of them, as they are holding a thin blue line flag, looked you dead in the eye and said, 'Pick a side,'\" one officer told ProPublica.\n\nOne officer hit a demonstrator and watched a pistol pop out of the rioter's waistband. The officer picked the weapon up off the ground and, with no time or backup to initiate an arrest, put it in his pocket and continued fighting.\n\nPlumes of tear gas billowed behind the police line. Officers were startled by the sight of department commanders joining their desperate troops to defend the Capitol.\n\nInspector Thomas Loyd, the man in charge of the department's Capitol Division, threw off his hat and raised his fists. Deputy Chief Eric Waldow waded into the crowd. With the build of a linebacker, he cut a menacing figure, throwing punches as the bear spray stained his white uniform orange.\n\nThe two are now revered by the department's rank and file, who complain that other leaders were missing in action. Waldow and Loyd referred ProPublica to the Capitol Police public information office, which declined to comment.\n\nThe only other high-ranking official who officers said they heard on the radio that day was Yogananda Pittman, the department's assistant chief for protective and intelligence operations. Multiple officers told ProPublica that Pittman addressed the troops only once on the radio, when she ordered that the Capitol be locked down. Loyd, the union said in a public statement in January, had already given the same order about an hour before.\n\nElsewhere, another riot squad was in even worse shape. These officers had been dispatched to help quell a group of protesters gathered near a monument west of the Capitol. But they had been instructed by their superior officers to leave their gear on a bus. Now they were separated from the bus, defenseless.\n\n\"They were holding back some protesters, with just bike racks,\" said McFaden. \"Well, those bike racks actually were used as weapons against the officers. Who had the bright idea of sending a hard squad with no gear? ... The coordination was just not there.\"\n\nMcFaden said that one member of that squad was hit in the head by a bike rack and knocked unconscious.\n\nAs the battle raged, officers stationed away from the combat were still trying to figure out if they were authorized to respond. They heard calls on their radios for \"all available units.\" But officers at fixed posts didn't know what that meant.\n\n\"How the fuck am I supposed to know if I'm available?\" thought one officer, stationed at a perimeter post with no rioters in sight. The officer's supervisors didn't know either. The group decided to stay put: If they left, there was a chance their post could be overrun. They were stuck listening to their colleagues fight and cry for help over the radio.\n\nMcFaden was also stationed away from the rioters, tasked with guarding a parking garage on the Rayburn House Office Building's west side. From his post, he had a clear view of the battle on the west front, but he'd received orders to stay at the garage entrance. At 56 years old, he had worked for the Capitol Police House Division for more than 20 years. He was slated to retire in just a few weeks. Now he was watching, powerless, as flash-bang grenades went off in front of a building he was sworn to protect.\n\nBy this point, time had become a blur to the officers at the west front. But somewhere around 1:15 p.m., it felt for a moment like the cavalry arrived. Dozens of officers in black riot gear came over the wall on the south side of the terrace. Washington's Metropolitan Police Department, the only other members of law enforcement on the west front in riot gear that day, had arrived.\n\nBut the reinforcements could only slow the crowd. About an hour and a half after the Metropolitan police arrived, the rioters broke through the line. In the melee, a rioter was captured on video hurling a fire extinguisher at the Capitol police. It struck an officer in the head, giving him a concussion, according to his colleagues.\n\nThe rioters pulled at least two of the Capitol Police officers in riot gear into the crowd, stealing their batons and pepper spray and setting off a kind of human tug of war, before other officers were eventually able to pull their colleagues out.\n\nSoon, the police had their backs against a wall. They formed a semicircle, doing their best to defend themselves against jabs with flagpoles and shots from bear spray canisters and pepper spray guns.\n\nThe officers made their way toward the staircase leading up to the second floor of the west terrace. A line of officers pushed each other up the narrow steps. When they got to the terrace, they rushed through a door leading to the inside of the building. Metropolitan police formed a wall of riot shields behind them, sealing off the entrance.\n\nThe crowd never made it through the doors. Video footage shows a Metropolitan police officer trapped in the door, screaming in agony. As the police poured inside, some members of Congress were still on the House floor, yet to be evacuated.\n\nAt around this time, Sund was on a conference call with four different agencies and had just learned that he needed Pentagon approval to activate the National Guard. According to Sund's letter, Lt. Gen. Walter Piatt, the director of Army staff, remained skeptical. \"I don't like the visual of the National Guard standing [in] a line with the Capitol in the background,\" Piatt said, suggesting that the guard relieve Capitol Police officers from their fixed posts instead. Piatt and the Department of Defense did not immediately respond to an emailed list of questions. (In a statement on Jan. 11, Piatt denied making such a comment. He later acknowledged that he \"may\" have said it.)\n\nOnce inside, the riot squad searched desperately for water. The pepper spray and bear spray cocktail was overwhelming, seeping through the tiny breathing holes of their masks.\n\nOfficers spat out phlegm and vomited into trash cans. When they eventually found water, they rushed to wash the chemicals out of their eyes and put their helmets back on. They climbed up another flight of stairs to get to the Capitol crypt, the circular room directly beneath the rotunda.\n\nAs the officers ascended, they met more rioters, who were being pushed down the stairs by Metropolitan police. The Capitol police felt like they were swimming upstream through a mob, grabbing the protesters by their limbs and shoulders as they tried to reach the next level of the Capitol.\n\nOne officer said the crypt looked like something out of a Michael Bay movie, trash strewn everywhere, the air thick with smoke.\n\nAfter the crypt was cleared, another officer made it to the Capitol rotunda. He said he still can't shake the scene: On the walls, a 19th-century frieze depicted the Battle of Lexington and the signing of the Declaration of Independence; on the ground, pepper balls whizzed into the crowd and the smell of chemicals wafted through the air.\n\nMcFaden, too, finally got a call to jump into the action, and was ordered to the rotunda. When he arrived beneath its domed ceiling, already breathless from the run over, he got hit in the face with bear spray.\n\n\"I felt like you could fry an egg on my forehead,\" he said.\n\nBy about 4 p.m., other agencies had arrived in the rotunda: FBI SWAT teams, police officers from surrounding counties. Law enforcement moved in lines two or three deep, pushing the demonstrators out of the building's east doors.\n\nWith their guns drawn, officers teamed up and began searching the Capitol, clearing rooms one by one. Members of Congress were now huddled with their staff, cowering petrified behind furniture they had piled against their office doors.\n\nThe first 150 or so members of the National Guard finally arrived at 5:40 p.m.\n\n\"I still cannot fathom why in the midst of an armed insurrection, which was broadcast worldwide on television, it took the Department of Defense over three hours to approve an urgent request for National Guard support,\" Sund wrote in his letter. In response to questions for this story, the National Guard sent a timeline that confirmed their 5:40 p.m. arrival and referred ProPublica to a press release stating they worked with Capitol and Metropolitan police \"to assist with an immediate response.\"\n\nAt around 8 p.m., Capitol Police declared the complex secure. It was pitch-black outside by the time the riot squad that fought on the west front reunited. There was little conversation. They sat exhausted on the steps by the Memorial Door, helmets at their feet, staring at each other in disbelief. Some hugged each other. Others cried.\n\nOne saw that he had missed 17 calls and nearly 100 text messages. High school friends he hadn't spoken to in years reached out on Instagram. In text after text, the same words: \"I saw the news.\" \"Call me when you get this.\" \"I love you.\"\n\nThe messages made some of the news coverage that came later, in which police were accused of siding with the mob, easier to stomach. He knew nothing he had done that day could be construed as complicit with the rioters. It looked like at least some of his friends and relatives knew it too.\n\nSeveral officers said they didn't get home until the early morning hours of the next day. One said when he got home he went straight to his washing machine to put his bear-spray-soaked uniform into a cold-water wash. Another said that he could not get rid of the smell or the itch of the chemicals for days.\n\nFor a week afterward, one officer said, he cried nightly. Three Capitol Police officers died in early January: Brian Sicknick, who was sprayed with a chemical substance on the 6th, collapsed at the Capitol that evening, and died the next day after suffering two strokes; Howard Liebengood, who died by suicide following the riot; and Eric Marshall, who died of cancer four days before the riot. Almost 140 Capitol and Metropolitan police officers were injured on Jan. 6, according to a union statement. One had two cracked ribs and two smashed spinal discs.\n\nA week or so later, McFaden and union chair Gus Papathanasiou met with leadership for the first time since Sund's resignation on Jan. 7. Acting Chief Pittman, Assistant Chief Chad Thomas and other senior officers were in attendance.\n\nLoyd, the inspector who had thrown punches on the west front, was also there. McFaden had the sense that Loyd was only brought in to defuse tension with the union, which had more questions than leadership had answers.\n\nPittman acknowledged that the force was in a dark place and a culture change was sorely needed. But McFaden said the acting chief quickly became taciturn. When she was asked where she and her fellow chiefs were during the riot and why they weren't on the radio, she dodged the question.\n\nMeetings with union leadership usually last at least an hour, but after 30 minutes, McFaden said, Pittman got up to leave for another engagement.\n\nThe union leaders were enraged. They turned to Thomas and asked why he wasn't on the radio that day.\n\n\"He said he was trying to do that for like 10 to 15 seconds, and he couldn't get on the radio,\" McFaden said. \"This event lasted for hours. ... I mean, come on.\" Pittman and Thomas did not respond to calls for comment.\n\nRead More\n\nIt was only through Pittman's testimony at a closed Congressional briefing on Jan. 26 that most Capitol Police officers learned that the force did in fact have intelligence warnings of possible violence. She admitted that the department failed to adequately act on it.\n\nThe officers said they are still waiting for an apology. Many are looking for new jobs.\n\n\"Let's face it. Now the whole world knows where the vulnerabilities of the Capitol are,\" said one officer. \"I don't trust the people above me to make decisions to bring me home safe.\"\n\nUpdate, April 19, 2021: This story originally stated that Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick had been struck over the head with a fire extinguisher during the insurrection on Jan. 6 and died of his injuries the next day. On Jan. 7, the U.S. Capitol Police said in a statement that Sicknick \"passed away due to injuries sustained while on-duty.\" On April 19, the Washington medical examiner released its cause and manner of death determination, ruling that Sicknick died of natural causes. Sicknick was sprayed with a chemical substance outside the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, suffered two strokes, and died on Jan. 7, the medical examiner said. Following the release of the medical examiner's ruling, the Capitol Police said in a statement, \"This does not change the fact Officer Sicknick died in the line of duty.\" Two people have been arrested and charged for allegedly assaulting Sicknick during the riot.\n\nKirsten Berg and Zipporah Osei contributed reporting.\n\nJoaquin Sapien is a reporter at ProPublica covering criminal justice and social services.\n\nI'm a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter at ProPublica, where I write about the government, money and power.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "\"Someone Tell Me What to Do\"\n\n\"Please help. I don't want to die.\"\n\n\"Just be as quiet as a mouse.\"\n\n\"Please let the cops come in.\"\n\n\"The kids are not in there.\"\n\n\"He's, uh, barricaded in one of the offices.\"\n\n\"Who's fucking in charge?\"\n\nThe children hid. They dropped to the floor, crouching under desks and countertops, far from the windows. They lined up against the walls, avoiding the elementary school doors that separated them from a mass shooter about a decade older than them. Some held up the blunted scissors that they often used to cut shapes as they prepared to fight. A few grabbed bloodied phones and dialed 911. And as students across the country have been instructed for years, they remained quiet, impossibly quiet. At times, they hushed classmates who screamed in agony from the bullets that tore through their small bodies. Then, they waited. Waited for the adults, whom they could hear in the hallway. If they were just patient, those adults would save them. Hundreds of law enforcement officers descended on Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas, that day in May 2022. They, too, waited. They waited for someone, anyone, to tell them what to do. They waited for the right keys and specialized equipment to open doors. They waited out of fear that the lack of ballistic shields and flash-bangs would leave them vulnerable against the power of an AR-15-style rifle. Most astonishingly, they waited for the children's cries to confirm that people were still alive inside the classrooms. \"I'm watching that door. No screams. No nothing. No nothing. You know. Things you would think you would hear if there had been kids in there,\" Cpl. Gregory Villa, who had been with the Uvalde Police Department for 11 years, told an investigator days after the attack that left 19 children and two teachers dead. If there were children inside, Villa said, officers would have probably heard the shooter saying, \"'Hey, everybody shut up,' and then kids are like, 'Oh no, I gotta, I want my mommy.'\"\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power.

Sign up for newsletters from The Texas Tribune and from FRONTLINE .\n\nVilla, who received active shooter training four years earlier, was among several officers who told investigators that they didn't believe children were in the classrooms because they were so quiet. The children's strict adherence to remaining silent was, in fact, part of their training. Officers' own training instructs them to confront a shooter if there is reason to believe someone is hurt.\n\n\"I just honestly thought that they were in the cafeteria because it seemed like all the lights were off and it seemed like it was really quiet. I didn't hear any screaming, any yelling. I literally didn't hear anything at all,\" Uvalde police Staff Sgt. Eduardo Canales recalled to an investigator. \"You would think kids would be yelling and screaming.\"\n\nThe accounts of law enforcement's actions during one of the worst school shootings in history are among a trove of recorded investigative interviews and body camera footage obtained by ProPublica, The Texas Tribune and FRONTLINE. Together, the hundreds of hours of audio and video offer a startling finding: The children in Uvalde were prepared, dutifully following what they had learned during active shooter drills, even as their friends and teachers were bleeding to death. Many of the officers, who had trained at least once during their careers for such a situation, were not.\n\nMass shootings have become a fact of American life, with at least 12 0 since the 1999 Columbine High School shooting. Debates often erupt along partisan lines as anguished communities demand change. When children are gunned down, calls for tighter gun laws are matched with plans for arming teachers and hardening schools.\n\nOne thing that seemingly unites all sides is the notion of better training for law enforcement. But, in actuality, few laws exist requiring such instruction.\n\nWatch the Film\n\n\"Inside the Uvalde Response,\" a documentary that is part of the collaboration, premieres Dec. 5 at 10 p.m. EST on PBS stations ( check local listings ) and will be available to stream on the PBS App , YouTube and FRONTLINE's website .\n\nIn the wake of the Columbine shooting, law enforcement agencies across the country began retooling protocols to prevent long delays like the one that kept officers there from stopping the two shooters. Key among the changes was an effort to ensure that all officers had enough training to engage a shooter without having to wait for more specialized teams.\n\nMore than two decades later, law enforcement's chaotic response in Uvalde and officers' subsequent explanations of their inaction show that the promise of adequate training to respond to a mass shooting has yet to be fully realized.\n\nOfficers failed to set up a clear command structure. They spread incorrect information that caused them to treat the shooter as a barricaded suspect and not an active threat even as children and teachers called 911 pleading for help. And no single officer engaged the shooter despite training that says they should do so as quickly as possible if anyone is hurt. It took 77 minutes to breach the classroom and take down the shooter.\n\n\"It's pretty stunning that we're 24 years after the Columbine massacre and we're still dealing with a lack of training on how to deal with these active assailants,\" said Mo Canady, executive director of the National Association of School Resource Officers. \"I'm not sure who is to be held responsible for that, but it really is unacceptable that officers are not getting that training.\"\n\nEditor's Note\n\nA nationwide analysis by the news organizations shows states require far more training to prepare students and teachers for a mass shooting than they do for the police who are expected to protect them.\n\nAt least 37 states have laws mandating that schools conduct active shooter-related drills. All but four of those states require them at least annually.\n\nIn contrast, only Texas and Michigan have laws requiring training for all officers after they graduate from police academies. Texas' law is the strongest in the country, mandating that officers train for 16 hours every two years. That requirement came about only after the Uvalde massacre.\n\nThe absence of legislation has created an uneven and inconsistent approach, which fails to ensure that officers not only receive the training they need to confront a mass shooter, but drill often enough to follow it in the adrenaline-soaked atmosphere of a real shooting, law enforcement experts said. Some also emphasize the importance of multiagency training so that officers are not responding to a crisis alongside people they've never worked with before. Yet few states, if any, require agencies to train together.\n\nAbout 72% of the at least 116 state and local officers who arrived at Robb Elementary before the gunman was killed had received some form of active shooter training during their careers, according to an analysis of records obtained by ProPublica, the Tribune and FRONTLINE. Officers who received training before the Uvalde shooting had most commonly taken it only once, which law enforcement experts say is not enough. Only three officers would have met Texas' new standard for training.\n\nThe news organizations reached out to each of the officers in this piece. An attorney representing officers with the Uvalde Police Department said the city has ordered them not to comment because of an ongoing internal investigation. Officers with other agencies did not return phone calls, texts and emails or declined to comment.\n\nAcross the country, officers are increasingly responding to situations with active shooters, some of whom have access to weapons originally designed for war. In the absence of gun control legislation, sales of these types of weapons have increased.\n\nUnlike military service members who spend the majority of their time training for the possibility that they may someday see combat, police spend the bulk of their days responding to a variety of incidents, most of which do not involve violent encounters. Experts say that leaves many unprepared as the nation's tally of mass shootings grows.\n\nNo clear consensus exists on just how much training is sufficient, though experts agree on the need for repetition. Even then, consistent training cannot guarantee that officers will do everything right, said John Curnutt, assistant director at Texas State University's Advanced Law Enforcement Rapid Response Training Center, which is rated as the national standard by the FBI. Still, Curnutt said, routine training is the best way to improve officers' response.\n\n\"It has to be really driven into somebody to the point where it becomes instinctive, habitual,\" Curnutt said. \"Before you really get a chance to think about it, you're already doing it. And it takes more than 10 or 11 times to get that good at something like this that is going to be incredibly difficult to do when you know that, 'I'm about to die, but I'm going to do this anyway.' Who thinks like that? Not everybody. We know that. Not everybody that's in uniform does.\"\n\nIt was 11:30 a.m. on May 24, 2022. The timer that Elsa Avila set had just gone off, notifying her fourth grade class that the extra minutes she'd given them to make shoes out of newspapers for a STEM challenge had drawn to a close. Now they were going outside to test how long the shoes held up on the school track.\n\nAvila gathered the children for a photo before they formed a single-file line. At the front, one of the students peered into the hallway. \"Miss, there's a class coming in and they're screaming and they're running to their room,\" Avila recalled the student saying as the teacher of 27 years described the details of that day to investigators.\n\n\"You let their teacher worry about them,\" Avila replied, believing that the student was simply reporting unruly behavior.\n\nThis was different, the girl insisted. The children were scared. So, Avila peeked into the hallway.\n\n\"Get in your rooms!\" Avila heard a woman scream.\n\n\"So I just slammed my door back in, turned off the lights and, at that time, the kids know, because we practice these drills, they know: 'OK, shut the door, you know. Slam the lights. We've got to go into our positions,'\" Avila recalled.\n\nSo I just slammed my door back in, turned off the lights and, at that time, the kids know, because we practice these drills, they know.\"\n\n\"So I just slammed my door back in, turned off the lights and, at that time, the kids know, because we practice these drills, they know.\"\"\n\nThe educator and her students formed an \"L,\" crouching down against the two walls that were farthest from the doors and windows. It was a drill they'd practiced so much that, at times, it had become tiresome. The training that Avila had hoped they'd never have to use: Run. Hide. Fight.\n\nFor now, they hid.\n\nAvila stood up momentarily to make sure that her students were safe.\n\nIt was then that a bullet pierced the wall, ripping into the teacher's stomach.\n\nAvila fell to the ground and dropped her phone. After dragging herself to the phone, she scrolled through previous texts to find one that included a group of teachers from the school.\n\n\"Im shot,\" she wrote at 11:35 a.m., mistakenly texting her siblings before eventually also messaging her colleagues.\n\nOnly five minutes had passed since Avila's timer rang for what was intended to be a celebratory moment.\n\nIn that time, the gunman had entered the building after crashing a truck into a nearby ditch and police had received their first 911 call from a teacher informing them that the shooter was in the school. In those five minutes, the teenage shooter unleashed nearly 100 rounds of gunfire.\n\nA child's drawing for investigators shows how students in Room 109, two doors away from the shooter, followed their training.\n\nChildren and teachers formed an \"L,\" crouching against the walls farthest from doors and windows.\n\nIn the drawing, the child wrote \"hide,\" reflecting a key part of the training.\n\nOne of Avila's students was among those injured. Bullet fragments struck 10-year-old Leann Garcia on the nose and mouth. Blood dripped onto her clothes as her friend, Ailyn Ramos, held her and tried to keep her from screaming out in pain.\n\n\"If I die, I love you,\" Leann whispered to Ailyn.\n\n\"As long as you're in here with me, you're not going to die,\" Ailyn later recalled responding in an interview with the news organizations. (Ailyn's account, like those of all the children named in this piece, is included with the permission of a parent.)\n\nWith their teacher flitting in and out of consciousness, the children huddled together. For a moment they did something that their lockdown training had not taught them, but that their teacher had always told them to do in difficult times, Ailyn told the news organizations.\n\nThey prayed.\n\n\"Please let the cops come in.\"\n\nOutside of the school, Uvalde police Sgt. Daniel Coronado heard the unmistakable gunfire from the shooter's semiautomatic rifle. \"Oh, shit, shots fired! Get inside,\" Coronado yelled at about 11:35 a.m. while breathlessly running toward the building.\n\nEntering a smoke-filled hallway, Coronado, a 17-year veteran of the department, walked past printouts of summer sandals that had been brightly colored by children, who were now nearing their last day of school. Seconds later, there was another round of gunfire from rooms 111 and 112, the adjoining classrooms from which the shooter was terrorizing teachers and children.\n\nThe shots injured Canales and Lt. Javier Martinez, two Uvalde police officers who had initially approached the classrooms. Blood trickled from Canales' ear and bullet fragments grazed Martinez's head. Both officers retreated. Though hurt, Martinez again ran toward the door. No one followed. He eventually pulled back. The officers had taken active shooter training only once: Martinez in 2014 and Canales the year before the shooting.\n\nSome officers, including Uvalde police Staff Sgt. Eduardo Canales and Lt. Javier Martinez, rushed in on the west side of the school.\n\nThe gunman was in adjoining classrooms 111 and 112.\n\nInjured teacher Elsa Avila and her students waited for help in Room 109.\n\nOthers, including Uvalde police Sgt. Daniel Coronado and the school district police chief, Pete Arredondo, entered on the south side.\n\nThe gunman was in adjoining classrooms 111 and 112.\n\nInjured teacher Elsa Avila and her students waited for help in Room 109.\n\nSome officers, including Uvalde police Staff Sgt. Eduardo Canales and Lt. Javier Martinez, rushed in on the west side of the school.\n\nOthers, including Uvalde police Sgt. Daniel Coronado and the school district police chief, Pete Arredondo, entered on the south side.\n\nThe failure to engage the shooter was the first in a handful of critical missteps by officers in the initial 10 minutes. Each ran counter to what the training teaches.\n\nAmong the missteps was the fact that no one took charge or set up a command post to guide the response, which experts say should happen quickly after arrival. Another was Coronado's decision to relay an unconfirmed report from a school resource officer that the suspect was holed up in an office. The information proved to be inaccurate, and the misunderstanding helped shape officers' approach to the incident.\n\n\"Male subject is in the school on the west side of the building,\" Coronado radioed at 11:41 a.m. \"He's contained. We got multiple officers inside the building at this time. Believe he's, uh, barricaded in one of the offices. Male subject's still shooting.\"\n\nThough some officers struggled with malfunctioning radios, Coronado's words reached enough of them to contribute to a widespread belief that the shooter was possibly alone inside a room with no victims, even as evidence mounted that children and teachers were in danger.\n\nInitially believing he was responding to an active shooter, Texas Department of Public Safety Special Agent Colten Valenzuela told an investigator that his mindset changed after arriving at the school.\n\n\"When we did get there, we were told that it was a barricaded subject, so that kind of flipped the direction,\" Valenzuela said.\n\nAsked by an investigator about the determination that the shooter was barricaded, Coronado, who completed active shooter training a decade earlier, said: \"I don't know where that came out of, you know what I mean? You're just reacting to what you're dealing with at that moment in time.\"\n\n\"You don't see any bodies,\" Coronado added. \"You don't see any blood. You don't see anybody yelling, screaming for help. Those are motivators for you to say, 'Hey, get going, move,' but if you don't have that, then slow down.\"\n\nYou don't see any bodies? You don't see any blood. You don't see anybody yelling, screaming for help. Those are motivators for you to say, 'Hey, get going, move,' but if you don't have that, then slow down.\"\n\n\"You don't see any bodies. You don't see any blood.

In some cases, the delays are well-known. In Orlando, Florida, officers waited about three hours to take down a shooter at the Pulse night club in 2016 despite 911 calls indicating some hostages were shot. The initial officer who responded to the 2018 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, never entered the building where a shooter killed 17 students and staff.\n\nOther missteps have not been as widely scrutinized. In Las Vegas in 2017, two officers stayed on the hotel floor below a shooter instead of rushing upstairs to confront him as he spewed bullets into a crowd of concertgoers. The next year in Thousand Oaks, California, officers attempted to confront a shooter within minutes of arriving at the scene. Some retreated after he shot at them. Police did not reenter to engage the shooter again for more than 40 minutes, even as victims remained inside.\n\nIn contrast, several officers credited their repeated training after they were celebrated for acting expeditiously to take down a shooter in March at a private Christian school in Nashville, Tennessee. Such instruction, they said, allowed them to momentarily ignore the emotion of stepping over a victim to get to the shooter so as to prevent further harm. About two months later, an officer in Allen, a Dallas suburb, shot a gunman minutes after his killing spree began at an outlet mall. Police and fire officials later praised years of joint training as key to the swift response.\n\nThe ability to work together was absent in Uvalde, Ruby Gonzalez, a school resource officer, told an investigator. Despite most of the officers being trained, various agencies that arrived at the scene were not accustomed to working together and had their own operating procedures, Gonzalez said.\n\n\"We couldn't find a way to work together because each agency wanted to do things how they, how they see fit,\" she said when asked if she believed the response that day followed the training she had taken.\n\nAt the time of the Uvalde shooting, Texas required only that school resource officers take an eight-hour active shooter course. The requirement did not apply to thousands of officers in police departments and sheriff's offices across the state, contributing to vast disparities in training.\n\nAbout 84% of the DPS officers who responded to the Uvalde shooting before the gunman was killed had been trained. Yet only about 67% of the Uvalde Police Department officers and roughly 36% of the Uvalde County Sheriff's Office deputies had taken active shooter courses, according to an analysis of records that detail training after officers graduate from academies.\n\nCollectively, local and state agencies sent at least 116 officers to the Uvalde shooting before the breach. While a majority of those officers had received some instruction to confront an active shooter, about half had not been trained since 2018 or before. That was the year a gunman entered Santa Fe High School near Houston and killed 10 people.\n\nFederal law enforcement agencies, who sent about 180 officers to the scene before and after the breach, declined to provide training records for their officers, leaving the amount of instruction they received unclear. A spokesperson for Customs and Border Protection, the agency with the majority of the federal officers on scene, said in a statement that it continues to review the response and is \"committed to identifying any improvements to training or tactics.\"\n\nOf the 116 state and local officers who  responded to Robb Elementary School before the shooter was stopped:\n\n33 had received no active shooter training\n\n43 had received active shooter training once\n\n40 had received active shooter training more than once\n\nOf those, three had enough training to meet the new state requirement\n\nOf the 116 state and local officers who  responded to Robb Elementary School before the shooter was stopped:\n\n33 had received no active shooter training\n\n83 had received some form of active shooter training\n\n43 had received active shooter training once\n\n40 had received active shooter training more than once\n\nOf those, three had enough training to meet the new state requirement\n\nDPS and the Uvalde sheriff's office did not respond to questions about their departments' training. A spokesperson for the city of Uvalde said that since the shooting, officials have purchased equipment like shields and breaching tools and have expanded training to include surrounding agencies.\n\nUvalde officers will also be among those required to meet Texas' new standard - 16 hours of instruction every two years.\n\nThe post-Uvalde mandate is rare.\n\nIn the vast majority of states, officers are only required to prepare to confront a shooter in academies that train new recruits, but even that can vary widely between four and dozens of hours of instruction. Once those officers get the training, most are not required under the law to ever take it again.\n\n\"If we're not training the right way and we're not preparing ourselves and our kids and our responders, then we're going to keep doing this for the next 25 years,\" said John McDonald, who developed the school safety program in Jefferson County, Colorado, which includes Columbine, after the 1999 shooting. \"We're going to say, 'Geez, for 50 years we haven't figured it out.' Well, shame on us.\"\n\nNicole Ogburn, a teacher in Room 102, used her Apple Watch to dial 911 three times but couldn't get through. On her fourth try, at 11:40 a.m., one of the city's two dispatchers finally picked up.\n\nOgburn reported that there was an active shooter at the school, saying she could hear the gunshots outside of her classroom.\n\n911 dispatcher: You can hear the gunshots being fired?\n\nOgburn: Yeah, they're in the building. I don't know. There's been a lot. A whole lot. And I got a message that somebody, somebody is shot in another classroom.\n\n911 dispatcher: Somebody is shot in a classroom, ma'am? OK, can you tell me ...\n\nOgburn: Not mine. In another one. Another classroom. I don't know. I don't know. Please hurry. Hurry.\n\n911 dispatcher: What room number? What room number? Can you tell me what room?\n\nOgburn: I'm in Room 102.\n\n911 dispatcher: Is he going to be across from you?\n\nOgburn: I don't know where he's at right now. I got to go. I can't let him hear me. I can't let him hear me.\n\nWhile Ogburn was on the phone with 911, dispatchers received another call. This time from Pete Arredondo. The school district police chief, who had taken active shooter training four times during his nearly 30-year career, was supposed to take charge, according to the district's active shooter plan.\n\nArredondo, who had dropped his radio on the way into the school and didn't have a body camera, asked the dispatcher for backup and more equipment.\n\n\"I'm inside the building with this man. He has an AR-15. He shot a whole bunch of times. We're, yes, we're inside the building,\" Arredondo told the dispatcher. \"He's in one room. I need a lot of firepower, so I need this building surrounded, surrounded with as many AR-15s as possible.\"\n\nIn that brief moment, Arredondo would learn from the dispatcher what police could not see on the other side of the classroom doors: Someone was injured.\n\nArredondo does not appear to have shared the information with other officers, according to body camera footage and radio calls reviewed by the news organizations.\n\nActive shooter training instructs that officers should act immediately if there is reliable evidence that an attacker is killing people or preventing critically injured victims from getting medical attention.\n\nBut 17 more minutes passed before officers opened the door to Ogburn's classroom. Even then, their discovery of children was an accident.\n\nUvalde County Sheriff's Deputy Reymundo Lara recalled to investigators how he came to realize there were children in the room. Lara, who had not taken active shooter training, said he took a tactical position, aiming at the classroom where the shooter remained.\n\n\"I was like, you know what, my feet need to be a little bit more comfortable,\" Lara added. \"So, I get up, open the door. I propped it open so I could stick my leg in and lay back down and aim at the classroom where this suspect's at. Something is telling me, 'Hey, just check the classroom.'\"\n\nAt first, Lara did not see anything. The lights were off and a movie played on the TV.\n\nThen, the deputy spotted children.\n\n\"Hey,\" Lara yelled. \"We got kids in this room.\"\n\nOfficers rushed to help Ogburn and her students escape through the window. \"Kids coming out. Kids coming out. Kids coming out,\" Coronado said, his body camera picking up the moment they were pulled out through the window.\n\nCoronado's heart sank. \"Oh shit, there's kids,\" he recalled thinking while speaking with investigators. \"That was the first time that we realized, no, there are kids inside the building.\"\n\n11:56 a.m.\n\nUvalde police Sgts. Daniel Coronado and Donald Page tell another officer outside of the school that there are no children inside.\n\n11:57 a.m.\n\nUvalde County Sheriff's Deputy Reymundo Lara opens a classroom door and discovers children inside.\n\n11:58 a.m.\n\nThe children are evacuated from their classroom through the window.\n\nThough officers were now aware that children and teachers remained in classrooms, Avila and her students continued to wait to be rescued.\n\nStill losing blood from the gunshot wound to her stomach, the teacher knew she had to stay awake for her students.\n\n\"I didn't want to pass out because I didn't want to leave them alone,\" she recalled in an interview with an investigator.\n\nMoments of darkness were punctuated by the children trying to keep her calm. She could hear some of them saying, \"Don't let her go to sleep.\"\n\n\"Miss, we love you. We love you,\" she recalled one telling her. \"Miss, you're going to be OK.\"\n\nAvila could hear the school district chief, who began trying to negotiate with the shooter 24 minutes after officers entered the school.\n\n\"Can you please put your firearm down? We don't want anyone else hurt,\" Arredondo said.\n\nAt one point, the children in Avila's class heard people fiddling with their door. \"Police open up!\"\n\n\"I thought it was a trick,\" Leann, the injured 10-year-old, recalled thinking during an interview with investigators.\n\nNone of the children said anything. How could they know it was not the shooter?\n\nIndeed, the students did as they were taught to do in their drills.\n\n\"We tell kids if someone's knocking on a door and says, 'Police officer, open up,' don't open the door. We tell teachers that all the time. And we test it,\" said McDonald, who now serves as chief operating officer of The Council for School Safety Leadership, an organization that helps school leaders respond to threats and tragedies. \"That could be someone trying to trick you to come out. Cops have keys. They have the ability to breach. They have tools to get in. They will come in.\"\n\nBut the police didn't come into Avila's classroom at that moment. They also did not try to enter rooms 111 and 112, where the shooter remained, after learning from Ruben Ruiz, a school resource officer, that his wife, Eva Mireles, was injured in one of them.\n\nAt 11:56 a.m., Ruiz pushed urgently through a scrum of officers, attempting to get closer to his wife's classroom after she'd called to tell him what happened.\n\n\"She says she's shot, Johnny,\" Ruiz said as an officer stopped him from pressing forward.\n\nInstead of acting on the information, officers guided him outside and took away his gun.\n\nOne of the officers who heard Ruiz was Justin Mendoza. The rookie officer, who had only been with the Uvalde Police Department for about two years, had not received active shooter training, according to state records.\n\nMendoza said officers knew they needed to get into the classrooms, including Mireles', but they didn't have the right equipment. His sentiment was shared by more than a dozen officers who, in interviews with investigators, expressed fear of the shooter's semiautomatic rifle .\n\n\"Like I said, we didn't have any shields, no, no flash-bangs, no nothing that we could've used to create a distraction,\" Mendoza recalled, \"to, not only, like, not to sound selfish, but make sure we go home at the end of the day, but at least more of these kids can go home at the end of the day.\"\n\nThough officers signed up for the job knowing that they were putting their lives at risk, they'd never been confronted with a mass shooter, Mendoza said.\n\n\"None of us ever thought any of this situation would ever happen here, in Uvalde,\" he said.\n\nLike I said, we didn't have any shields no flash-bangs, no nothing that we could've used to create a distraction, to, not only like, not to sound selfish, but make sure we go home at the end of the day, but at least more of these kids can go home at the end of the day.\"\n\n\"Like I said, we didn't have any shields, no, no flash-bangs, no nothing that we could've used to create a distraction, to, not only, like, not to sound selfish, but make sure we go home at the end of the day, but at least more of these kids can go home at the end of the day.\"\n\nAbout 40 minutes after the shooting began, officers received an urgent broadcast over their police radios that experts said marked another crucial moment that should have prompted them to immediately confront the shooter.\n\nA child who was in one of the adjoining rooms with the shooter had reported a \"room full of victims. Full of victims at this moment,\" a dispatcher said over the radio.\n\n\"Fuck, full of victims,\" one officer said aloud after hearing the radio communication. \"Child called 911 and said room's full of victims.\"\n\nMinutes later, the dispatcher radioed again: \"Be advised, we do have one teacher that is still alive with wounds and eight to nine children.\"\n\nOfficers did not hear the grueling 17-minute call in which 10-year-old Khloie Torres and her friend Miah Cerrillo pleaded for help, repeatedly asking for police assistance. They didn't hear Khloie, who had been struck by shrapnel from the shooter's bullets, as she quietly begged for them to hurry, telling the 911 operator: \"There's a lot of dead bodies. Please help. I don't want to die.\" The same officers who said that the children's silence kept them from rushing the classroom didn't get to listen in as the dispatcher repeatedly told Khloie to keep the children quiet. They didn't hear her promises that officers were on their way to save Khloie and her classmates.\n\nDespite some radios not working inside the school, officers who heard the dispatcher's broadcast now knew that children and at least one adult remained alive, trapped with the shooter on the other side of the door. Those details, along with earlier signs that included sporadic gunfire and information that an officer's wife was shot but still alive in the classroom, should have jogged in their minds a key lesson from training. They should have moved swiftly to stop the killing and stop the dying, experts said.\n\n\"You know kids are in there. You know you have a teacher that's hurt. You've been shot at already. You've got an officer that's been wounded. I mean, I think the intel is there,\" said McDonald, the school safety expert who reviewed the footage at the request of the news organizations. \"The environment is there. So how do you get in that room? What are your options to get in that room? And I think that has to be a priority. You already had one officer who said his wife was in there several minutes ago. Stop the dying.\"\n\nInstead, law enforcement officers, including members of a highly trained Border Patrol tactical team that had just arrived, continued to wait, even as they received some specialized equipment that they said they needed to breach the metal door and enter the classroom. No one ever checked the door to see if it was unlocked, although a state House committee that later reviewed the shooting determined it probably was.\n\nDays after the attack, Uvalde police Officer Michael Wally recalled to an investigator the moment he heard there were victims in the classroom with the shooter. It didn't make sense, Wally told him. Since he arrived at the school, he'd been asking who was leading the response. Who was the officer in charge? No one provided an answer, but he was repeatedly told the school district police chief was negotiating with the shooter.\n\nArredondo later told the Tribune and investigators that he did not view himself as in charge. He defended his actions and those of others.\n\n\"I kept going back to who is OIC. Who is, who's, who's fucking in charge? Excuse my language, but who's, who's in charge?\" recalled Wally, who last took an active shooter course in 2015. \"I'm a patrol officer. I can't, you know, I'm not in there. I'm not in the hallway. I'm not talking to our gunman. I'm not talking to the guy who's talking to our gunman. No communication is coming back out to me. So there's got to be someone else. There's got to be someone else that's in charge. Someone tell me what to do.\n\nI kept going back to who is OIC. Who is, who's, who's fucking in charge? Excuse my language but who's, who's in charge?\"\n\n\"I kept going back to who is OIC. Who is, who's, who's fucking in charge? Excuse my language, but who's, who's in charge?\"\n\n\"And you know this, you've probably been wearing a badge a lot longer than I have,\" Wally told the investigator, \"but chain of command is everything. And, it was not there.\"\n\nIn the absence of clear leadership and communication, misinformation continued to spread.\n\nShortly after the radio communication from the dispatcher, a Border Patrol medic arrived. He asked about the victims. A state game warden quickly replied that they had not heard of any injuries. \"Uh, yes there are,\" a Uvalde police detective responded.\n\nThe medic pushed his way into the building and began setting up a triage station to treat the wounded. There, law enforcement officers, including members of the Border Patrol strike team, huddled, body camera footage shows.\n\nThe minutes continued to tick away as the team prepared to enter the room.\n\n12:12 p.m.\n\nUvalde police Officer Justin Mendoza and Uvalde police Detective Jose Rodriguez hear a dispatcher tell officers that a child said Room 112 was full of victims.\n\n12:18 p.m.\n\nSix minutes later, state game warden Dennis Gazaway mistakenly tells Border Patrol medic Diego Merino-Ruiz that there are no injured children inside but is quickly corrected by Rodriguez.\n\nThough officers had already broken through windows to evacuate students, they fixated on finding keys to unlock the three classrooms that still had children in them.\n\nArredondo had earlier decided that they would not enter the two adjoining classrooms that would force them to confront the shooter until they cleared others first, according to his interview with investigators and body camera footage.\n\nThat left Avila's classroom. Over the years, the teacher had learned that the only way the door to Room 109 would lock was if she slammed it closed. That is just what she did that day to ensure that the shooter could not enter.\n\nArredondo later told investigators that he knew his decision would likely be scrutinized, but he did what he thought was best at the time. He said that he believed the shooter had probably killed at least one person inside rooms 111 and 112, but that he knew that children in other classrooms remained alive.\n\n\"The preservation of life around everything around him, I felt was priority,\" Arredondo said.\n\nOfficers tried prying Avila's door open with a knife. They also tested various keys that did not work in search of a master key. Eventually, they decided that the only way in would be through the outside and began breaking the window.\n\nAvila's students started crying as officers yelled, \"Police, we're here to help you!\" Some ran toward the window. Others waited, Avila recalled. They still did not know whether to trust the voices from outside.\n\n\"They didn't want to move until I told them to move,\" the injured teacher recalled. \"So, then I stood up, and I told them, 'Come on guys.'\"\n\nAs soon as the classroom was cleared at 12:26 p.m., Arredondo signaled that officers could begin breaching the classrooms with the shooter. \"Got a team ready to go? Have at it,\" he can be heard saying on body camera footage as officers stood around him.\n\nIt's unclear if that message ever made it to the Border Patrol tactical team, which was on the other end of the hallway, or if anyone, at that point, was heeding the school district chief's direction.\n\nOver the next 24 minutes, Khloie and other children in Room 112 continued to rely on one another for survival.\n\nDespite the excruciating wait, now more than 50 minutes from the time the shooter had fired the initial volley of shots, the children continued to follow their training. They hid and remained quiet, even as several of them had injuries that made such silence inconceivable.\n\n\"I looked around, and I was like, people were cuddling up to each other, they were like, 'I'm going to die,'\" Khloie later told an investigator. \"And I was like: 'You're not going to die. Just be really quiet.'\"\n\n\"I remember telling everybody that 'we're going to get through this, and just don't make a sound,'\" she added. \"'Just be as quiet as a mouse.'\"\n\nI remember telling everybody that 'we're going to get through this and just don't make a sound. Just be as quiet as a mouse.'\"\n\n\"I remember telling everybody that 'we're going to get through this, and just don't make a sound. Just be as quiet as a mouse.'\"\n\nInstead of being protected, Khloie told the investigator, she became the protector.\n\nKhloie worked to calm her classmate Kendall Olivarez, who wailed in pain. Kendall was wedged under a teacher who had been killed by the shooter, and bullets had pierced the girl's arm, back and leg. Khloie helped pull Kendall from under her teacher. They crawled beneath a table as they hid from the shooter who was in the adjoining classroom. Meanwhile, Mireles, their other teacher, was losing blood and cried out for her daughter.\n\nKhloie grabbed her foot and tried to comfort her. \"Don't be scared,\" she told her.\n\nDesperate for help, Khloie's friend Miah dialed 911 one last time, pleading with the operator to send police. They were coming, the dispatcher assured her, adding that if anyone entered the classroom, the children should pretend to be asleep.\n\nAs she waited, Miah, who had been struck by shrapnel, sobbed quietly into the phone.\n\nFinally, 77 minutes after the shooter entered the school, 54 minutes after one of the officers reported that his wife had been shot and 38 minutes after a dispatcher shared that there were victims in the classroom, the adults had arrived to help.\n\nAt 12:50 p.m., a team led by the Border Patrol strike team entered Room 111. The gunman jumped out of a closet, firing at a federal officer and grazing him in the head. Officers returned fire, killing the shooter.\n\nStill on the phone with the 911 operator, Miah, who was hiding in Room 112, mistakenly thought the gunman was coming for her.\n\nShe later recalled the moment to an investigator, saying, \"I was, like, thinking it was him, he came back in the classroom. And then I look up and it was the police and all my friends started running towards them. And me and my friend were crying because we were scared. We ran to the hallway and I saw people, pass - dead and then blood on all of the floor.\"\n\nI was, like, thinking it was him, he came back in the classroom. And I look up and it was the police and all my friends started running towards them. And me and my friend were crying because we were scared. We ran to the hallway and I saw people, pass - dead and then blood on all over the floor.\"\n\n\"I was, like, thinking it was him, he came back in the classroom. And then I look up and it was the police and all my friends started running towards them. And me and my friend were crying because we were scared. We ran to the hallway and I saw people, pass - dead and then blood on all of the floor.\"\n\nFirst responders tried to rush out the living, taking Mireles, who still had a pulse, outside to be treated by medics. EMS declared her dead about an hour later in an ambulance that never left the school . Two children also had a pulse when they were taken out but later died. With insufficient ambulances to treat victims, police placed six children in a school bus, including Miah, Khloie and Kendall.\n\nWith them were two state troopers who were suddenly forced to act as medics, although they lacked qualifications. With blood from those who were injured around her soaked into her hair and clothes, and smeared on her face and hands, Khloie cried. She wanted her dad and she wanted to know if one of her friends survived, though she knew the answer even before asking.\n\nShe also wanted the officer to know that she had tried.\n\n\"Ma'am, I was on the phone with the police officer,\" Khloie told a state trooper through tears.\n\n\"Oh, that was you?\" the trooper asked.\n\n\"Yes, ma'am.\"\n\n\"OK, OK, you were so brave. Y'all were so brave, OK?\" the officer said, stroking her head.\n\n\"I was trying not to cry,\" Khloie replied.\n\n1:02 p.m.\n\nKhloie Torres, on a school bus with other classmates, tells Department of Public Safety Special Trooper Crimson Elizondo that she called 911.\n\nWarning: The following video has a loud ringing sound and shows a distressed child covered in blood that is not her own. We are publishing it with the family's consent.\n\nMore than two hours after the shooting began, the school was quiet once again.\n\nDavid Joy, a Border Patrol supervisor in Uvalde, picked up a body camera that an officer dropped. It was still recording.\n\nOnce in his car, he called his daughters' school.\n\n\"I need, I need to talk to the principal as soon as I possibly can,\" Joy said to the woman who answered the phone, explaining that he was a Border Patrol agent working out of the Uvalde station. After asking if she had heard about what happened, he said, \"There's some stuff that was extremely like, I, like there are some issues that I have with the way things, I want to be able to talk with somebody to just give you some advice and stuff that kind of slowed us down a little bit that maybe would be able to, God forbid something, God forbid something happen and y'all aren't set up for it.\"\n\nIn the weeks that followed the shooting, hundreds of officers recounted their role in the failed response during interviews with state and federal investigators.\n\nSome said they did all that they could under the circumstances. Others sobbed. They recalled seeing the children's lifeless bodies, the fear in the faces of the survivors. They had already felt the anger from residents in the city of 15,000 people who were forced to bury two teachers and 19 children, some of whom were related to officers. Several wrestled with whether they could have done more. A few wondered if any amount of training could have prepared them for that day.\n\n\"It, it, it was a horrific thing and we lost no matter what. Um, I, I, I want to learn from it, you know,\" Coronado, the Uvalde police sergeant, told an investigator. \"I, I want, I, I, I want, I want an opportunity to have someone better than me tell me, 'Hey, we could've done this or we could've done that.' You know what I mean? I, I, I, I, I, I want that.\"\n\nIt, it, it was a horrific thing and we lost no matter what. Um, I, I, I want to learn from it, you know.

He did not attend their funerals, telling an investigator that some of his relatives \"think that we fucking let 'em die.\"\n\nThe initial probe by the Texas Rangers, the DPS' investigative arm, is complete but has not been made public. Of the hundreds of officers who responded that day, less than a handful have been fired, including Arredondo. An attorney representing Arredondo released a statement before he was terminated , saying that his client was being used as a \"fall guy.\" Several officers from various agencies either resigned, were reassigned or retired.\n\nThis story is part of our series Under the Gun. See the full series .\n\nNews organizations, including ProPublica and the Tribune, have sued the state for records that would help families and the public better understand what happened that day. The state has repeatedly fought their release, citing an ongoing criminal investigation by the Uvalde district attorney, who has said that she plans to present a case before a grand jury this year. A state district judge ruled in the newsrooms' favor , though DPS has said it plans to appeal.\n\nThe wait for the findings has now grown to 18 months. It's unclear whether and when they will be released.\n\n\"I just wish someone would have taken charge. I wish someone would've ...,\" Wally, the Uvalde police officer, said while talking with an investigator in the days after the shooting, his voice trailing off. \"And I know this is going to be open record one day. Let it be on open record. Fuck politics. Someone take charge. Let's fix this. That's what I wanted.

      "text": "Cops\n\nI n 1994, three years after America recoiled in horror at footage of Los Angeles police officers tasing, kicking, and beating Rodney King with batons, and two years after riots broke out in the wake of the officers' acquittals on charges of assault with a deadly weapon and use of excessive force, the Los Angeles Police Department welcomed the makers of Cops into their squad cars. Shot at the height of the show's relevance, on the heels of several Emmy nominations, that seventh season featured all of its standard tropes, from heroic men in blue to drug-addled, occasionally naked suspects to wild car chases. And it enabled two of the country's biggest, most controversial police forces-the New York Police Department as well as the LAPD-to launder their reputations in a series that always granted departments final cut approval.\n\nThat same year saw the publication of multiple studies that uncovered Cops ' racist subtext and confirmed it was biased in favor of police. Not only were the officers it spotlighted disproportionately white and the suspects disproportionately Black or brown; it also overstated both the prevalence of violent crime and the effectiveness of policing. Such critiques escalated over the years, as endless bystander videos of police fatally shooting unarmed Black people supplanted Cops as the default image of policing in America. In 2013, under pressure from the activist group Color of Change, Fox dropped the show, and it bounced around cable until the Paramount Network canceled it again, in 2020, amid nationwide protests over George Floyd's murder at the hands of veteran Minneapolis cop Derek Chauvin . But in our hyperpartisan era, even that tragedy couldn't end the show's 33-year run. Picked up by Fox News streaming service Fox Nation last year, Cops has now cemented its long association with right-wing politics. - Judy Berman\n\nContact us at letters@time.com ."

      "text": "'I'm Going to Make a Change.' Police Departments Struggle to Recruit Black Cops, So This HBCU Came Up With a Plan\n\nW hen Tyrese Davis got accepted into Lincoln University's police academy, the first of its kind at a historically Black college or university, his instinct was to keep it a secret.\n\nDavis, 22, prides himself on being the first man in his family to go to college, so the acceptance on Jan. 6 was monumental. It meant he was one step closer to building a future for himself amid the economic tumult of the pandemic. But it came after months of civil unrest following the death of George Floyd in policy custody, and on the very day insurrectionists stormed the U.S. Capitol , where police would turn out to have been on both sides of the law.\n\nAs a Black man from Baltimore, where anger over Freddie Gray's 2015 death while under arrest remains raw, Davis worried about backlash from his community. \"I didn't want to let it be known that I was joining a law-enforcement academy,\" he says. \"I didn't want to be frowned upon.\"\n\nSo on Jan. 19, when the academy opened in Jefferson City, Mo., where Davis lives on campus, he didn't share the news with his hometown friends, even though he was making history as part of the first police class at an HBCU. But more than a week later, when he learned that authorities in Rochester, N.Y., had handcuffed and pepper-sprayed a 9-year-old Black girl-the latest in a string of high-profile use-of-force incidents-Davis got fed up with hiding his dreams from friends and began posting photos of himself on Facebook wearing body armor and training at the gun range.\n\n\"It's my career, not their career,\" he says. \"I want them to realize that I'm going to make a change. That's what we need right now.\"\n\nResearch suggests he's right. Throughout history, police forces in the U.S. have been predominantly white and male. In 2016, the most recent year for which data is available, about 72% of local police officers were white and nearly 88% were male, according to the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS). About 64% were both white and male, and about 11% were Black-a profile largely unchanged since 1997. A new study published in February in the journal Science found that Hispanic and Black officers use force less frequently than white officers, especially against Black people, evidence that diversity can improve police treatment of communities of color.\n\nBut nearly a year into the uprising against police brutality and systemic racism, it's harder than ever for police departments to recruit and retain officers, particularly those of color. Nationwide, fewer people are applying for the job, and more experienced cops are retiring or quitting in droves, threatening public safety as major cities witness crime spikes.\n\n\"People are just resigning because they've had enough,\" says West Lafayette police chief Troy Harris in Indiana. \"There's a cloud over law enforcement.\"\n\nHarris' department, which serves some 86,000 people, saw a 75% drop in applications from July to December 2020 and had six officers retire or walk off the 50-member force last year. Of the 37 applicants that year, only one was Black, according to the chief. \"If we can't keep up, it'll be a burden and a significant problem,\" says Harris, who worries he'll have to reassign community outreach officers to fill patrol shifts.\n\nIn Aurora, Colo., where 23-year-old Elijah McClain died after police held the unarmed Black man in a chokehold, at least 87 people resigned, retired or were fired from the police department in 2020, compared with 54 the year before, according to the agency. Twenty more employees left the force in the first 40 days of 2021 alone-nearing the number of exits for all of 2015-just as the city is experiencing a significant increase in major violent crimes, including assaults and robberies.\n\n\"There's no pretty picture down the road,\" says Los Angeles County sheriff Alex Villanueva. The sheriff says homicides and assaults are \"going through the roof\" but that his agency is \"probably the most understaffed\" in the nation, with less than one deputy for every 1,000 residents. \"It's pretty grim,\" Villanueva says.\n\nFrom 2013 to 2016 , the number of full-time sworn officers in the U.S. dropped from roughly 725,000 to 701,000, according to the BJS. About 63% of police leaders surveyed by the Police Executive Research Forum (PERF) in 2019 reported a decrease in the number of people applying for police officer positions over the past five years. In that time frame, 41% said their officer shortage has worsened. Job applications have plummeted about 50% in Seattle and 70% in Jefferson County, Colo., the PERF survey found.\n\nAll that was before Floyd's death put police at the center of the largest sustained social-justice mobilization in modern U.S. history. The sense of crisis was compounded by the Capitol breach. At least 39 members of U.S. law-enforcement agencies from 17 states were found to have attended the rally, according to the news and analysis site The Appeal . One of them was reportedly a top recruiter for the Kentucky state police. Among the Capitol Police, at least six officers have been suspended with pay, and 29 others are being investigated for their actions, officials said.\n\nSmall wonder, then, that police work carries a stigma among some Black Americans. According to a 2018 survey by the University Southern Mississippi of more than 770 U.S. criminal-justice students, 28% of Black respondents said their family and friends would not approve of their becoming a patrol officer. Police chiefs say cultural perceptions and family objections are major obstacles that prevent recruits of color from applying. And though law enforcement is one of the few remaining portals to the middle class that does not require a college degree, the thousands of dollars charged by some police academies can be an obstacle, especially with no guarantee of a job.\n\nDavis was fortunate to gain support from his family when he applied to Lincoln, but their warnings are in the back of his mind. \"My mom always tells me, 'You're entering a Caucasian world,' and she just wants me to be careful,\" he says.\n\nI want them to realize that I'm going to make a change. That's what we need right now.\n\nDavis is one of eight Black students in the academy's inaugural class of 11 students, which also includes two Black women. One of the white students is Christopher Cade, a 37-year-old state parole officer who signed up for the $6,000 course after seeing so many demoralized cops leaving the profession. \"No one wants to do the job anymore,\" he says. It made the military veteran want to fill their shoes. \"I enjoy doing the right thing when nobody's looking,\" Cade says. \"Not many people are willing to do that.\"\n\nLincoln University police chief Gary Hill hoped to attract students with that mentality and drive when he dreamed up the academy about three years ago while working at the Cole County sheriff's department in Jefferson City. There, he came across interns from Lincoln University, his alma mater, who were eager to find an inclusive local place to learn about policing. \"I thought, Lincoln has the resources, it has the students, the facilities. It would just be a great idea,\" says Hill, who left the sheriff's department to lead Lincoln's police force in 2016.\n\nDuring the pandemic, nearly 75% of law-enforcement agencies altered recruitment and hiring practices, including canceling or adjusting polygraphs and physical-fitness assessments, according to a separate PERF survey of more than 140 agencies. In some cases, the changes succeeded in drawing applications. The Naperville police department in Illinois, which eliminated its $45 application fee in order to appeal to low-income recruits, saw applications double at the peak of protests over Floyd's death. More than 850 hopefuls applied to join the force throughout the summer, according to Naperville police chief Robert Marshall. Of the 455 applicants who moved on to take a written exam, 34 were Black men and women, more than double the number in the previous round of recruits in 2018. Jason Arres, the department's deputy chief, believes the applicants felt a \"call to action,\" similar to what prompted him to leave his corporate career to become a police officer six days after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. \"It's still a very noble profession,\" Arres says.\n\nBut unlike Naperville's, the overwhelming majority of agencies are struggling as more cops, hired during departmental expansions in the 1980s and '90s, reach retirement age. Traditional sources of new recruits, including the military and family members of current officers, are no longer filling the gap. And today's applicants, police chiefs say, are less inclined to work holidays, weekends and nights or commit to a job that's getting harder and more dangerous. \"They want to live normally,\" says Benjamin Bliven, the police chief in Wausau, Wis. \"We're human beings.\"\n\nPolice work is hard. Officers spend a great deal of their day dealing with social problems, including homelessness, mental illness and substance abuse. In tense encounters, their every move is recorded by body cameras or bystanders' phones. In 2020, more than 260 law-enforcement officers died in the line of duty, a 96% increase over 2019 and the most killed since 1974, according to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. More than half those deaths were caused by COVID-19.\n\nIn 2019, the FBI says 89 officers were killed on duty, including 48 who were gunned down or run over while making arrests, responding to disturbance calls or conducting investigations and traffic stops. There were more than 170 law enforcement suicides in the U.S. in 2020, and more than 230 the year before, according to Blue H.E.L.P., a nonprofit which works to help officers struggling with PTSD, depression and other mental health issues.\n\n\"It takes a special person at this point to say, 'Yeah, I want to do that,'\" says Connecticut's Stonington police chief, J. Darren Stewart.\n\nAs a child, Ti'Aja Fairlee knew she wanted to become a police officer. She was drawn to reading crime and mystery books and was fixated on police cars, even though she had mostly negative interactions with law enforcement growing up in East St. Louis, Ill. Her father had multiple run-ins with police, who beat him, Fairlee says, and the officers who lived near her were \"rude.\"\n\nWhen Fairlee joined Lincoln University's police academy, some of her family members called her a \"traitor,\" as did strangers on the street who saw her in her academy uniform. For a moment, the 20-year-old says, \"I felt like I'm betraying my dad.\" But Fairlee thinks about the constant injustices that communities of color face daily and how she has never met a police officer who is both Black and a woman. As the Black Lives Matter movement exploded last year, she knew the profession needed more people who looked like her. \"It kind of pushed me to do better,\" she says.\n\nIn my eyes, I don't think all officers are the same. I want to change that stigma.\n\nIt's a sentiment shared overwhelmingly among students in Lincoln's first police academy. In 2014, when Davion Waters was a high school freshman, police detained him, mistaking him for a robbery suspect in his first bad encounter with police. Waters says he was walking home from the library in St. Louis when two police officers pulled up in a patrol car, immediately handcuffed him and made him sit on the curb until they confirmed they indeed had the wrong person. Waters, 13 at the time, says he was \"shaken up\" by the incident. Later that year, he started an internship with the same police department that detained him.\n\n\"It's about changing the whole culture,\" says Waters, now 22. \"In my eyes, I don't think all officers are the same. I want to change that stigma.\"\n\nIn 2018, when Hill pitched the idea for a police academy to Lincoln University's new president, Jerald Jones Woolfolk, she greenlighted it on the spot. Hill then went to work securing necessary state approvals and support from local leaders. When it was time to recruit students in the middle of 2020, Hill worried that societal upheaval might deter them from enrolling. The opposite happened. With just word-of-mouth advertising and some flyers, 27 students applied. Fourteen were not admitted because of financial and background-check issues, and two dropped out in January for personal reasons, Hill says.\n\nThe program runs 22 weeks, on evenings and Saturdays. Students learn how to shoot a firearm and when to use force, as well as how to respond to domestic-violence and child-abuse calls and how to deal with death encountered on the job. Hill says the academy steers away from the military-style teaching methods that traditional police academies have been criticized for using. He says a chunk of the curriculum focuses on de-escalation strategies and that he has personally vetted the instructors, who are all local law-enforcement officers.\n\nThey need African American cops. I'm hopeful I'll be offered at least three jobs.\n\nRecently, the students picked apart a seven-minute video of a police officer in McKinney, Texas, pushing a bikini-clad Black teenage girl to the ground at a pool party and kneeling on her back to restrain her. It's one of many now notorious police-force incidents that the class studies. When Lincoln's seniors graduate from the academy on June 24 and pass the required state exam for a license, Hill says they'll have a leg up on other competitors because of their college education, academy training and lived experiences.\n\n\"They need African-American cops,\" says India Stelzer, a 21-year-old academy cadet from Hayti, Mo. \"I'm hopeful I'll be offered at least three jobs.\"\n\nHill hopes many of the roughly 100 other HBCUs across the nation will soon follow suit. However, many can't because of state laws that prohibit independent police academies from existing outside of official law-enforcement agencies; Washington State, for example, requires police recruits to go through its state-run Basic Law Enforcement Academy. So far, Hill says he's working to open a branch of Lincoln's police academy at Harris-Stowe State University, an HBCU in St. Louis. And following a 2020 executive order for racial equity in criminal justice, North Carolina's department of public safety established a paid internship program for HBCU students interested in going into law enforcement. In December, nine students from HBCUs throughout North Carolina completed the 12-week program, and an additional eight began a new internship rotation this February.\n\nIt takes a special person at this point to say, 'Yeah, I want to do that.'\n\n\"We're forming a greater relationship with those HBCUs, because now we have more of a presence and they know who we are,\" says recruitment manager Dan Hill, who oversees North Carolina's program. \"They can see that we are a viable career opportunity for their students.\"\n\nStill, without changes in the way communities of color view police, some of Lincoln's students worry about their chances for success. Stelzer, who has four relatives in law enforcement, is concerned about being the only Black officer in her department and facing racism in and out of work. \"It's honestly scary,\" she says. Fairlee is fully expecting this, saying that if she enters the field with that mindset, \"it won't hurt as much\" when it happens.\n\nSince he stopped keeping his career goals a secret, Tyrese Davis hasn't received as much negativity from his friends as he thought he would. Half of the reactions have been supportive, and he's relieved the other half have just been ambivalent. \"I didn't really have to be ashamed of it anymore,\" he says.\n\nHe knows the road ahead will not be easy. Davis, who grew up in a predominantly Black neighborhood in Baltimore, says he experienced racism for the first time only in 2017 after he left to attend college in predominantly white Garden City, Kans. There, he says, he was followed to the checkout line while shopping at Walmart and has been pulled over by police for allegedly playing music too loud in his car. \"It was really a shocker,\" he says. The experiences left Davis feeling less than human and uncomfortable in his skin.\n\nAfter the events of 2020, he says, he debated whether he still wanted to enter law enforcement, but Floyd's death was the \"gasoline to my flame.\" He thinks about all he's accomplished already. Most of his high school friends didn't go to college, but in May, Davis is set to graduate from Lincoln, where he's made the dean's list multiple times and plays offensive tackle for the school football team on a scholarship.\n\n\"I broke that recurring cycle,\" he says. \"One young Black man can empower many other ones.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Some Experts Say COPs Are 'Distracting' and Need Fixing\n\nThis story was originally published by Grist .\n\nDiplomats, academics, and activists from around the globe will gather yet again this week to try to find common ground on a plan for combating climate change. This year's COP, as the event is known, marks the 28th annual meeting of the conference of the parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. More than 70,000 people are expected to descend on Dubai for the occasion.\n\nIn addition to marathon negotiations and heated discussions, the fortnight-long assembly will see all manner of marches, rallies, speakers, advocacy, and lobbying. But, aside from fanfare, it remains unclear how much COP28 will, or can, achieve. While there have been signs that the United States and China could deepen their decarbonization commitments , countries have struggled to decide how to compensate developing countries for climate-related losses . Meanwhile, global emissions and temperatures continue climbing at an alarming rate.\n\nThat has left some to wonder: Have these annual gatherings outlived their usefulness?\n\nTo some, the yearly get-togethers continue to be a critical centerpiece for international climate action, and any tweaks they might need lie mostly around the edges. \"They aren't perfect,\" said Tom Evans, a policy analyst for the nonprofit climate change think tank E3G. \"[But] they are still important and useful.\" While he sees room for improvements - such as greater continuity between COP summits and ensuring ministerial meetings are more substantive - he supports the overall format. \"We need to try and find a way to kind of invigorate and revitalize without distracting from the negotiations, which are key.\"\n\nOthers say the summits no longer sufficiently meet the moment. \"The job in hand has changed over the years,\" said Rachel Kyte, a climate diplomacy expert and dean emerita of the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. She is among those who believe the annual COP needs to evolve. \"Form should follow function,\" she said. \"And we are using an old form.\"\n\nDurwood Zaelke, co-founder and former president of the Center for International Environmental Law, was more blunt. \"You can't say that an agreement that lets a problem grow into an emergency is doing a good job,\" he said. \"It's not.\"\n\nEstablished in 1992, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is an international treaty that aims to stabilize greenhouse gas emissions and avoid the worst effects of climate change. Some 198 countries have ratified the Convention, which has seen some significant wins.\n\nThe 1997 Kyoto Protocol marked the first major breakthrough, and helped propel international action toward reducing emissions - though only some of the commitments are binding, and the United States is notably absent from the list signatories. The 2015 Paris Agreement laid out an even more robust roadmap for reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with a target of holding global temperature rise to \"well below\" 2°C (3.6°F) above preindustrial levels, and \" pursuing efforts \" to limit the increase to 1.5°C (2.7°F).\n\nAlthough the path to that future is narrowing, it is still within reach, according to the International Energy Agency . But, some experts say, relying primarily on once-a-year COP meetings to get there may no longer be the best approach.\n\n\"Multilateral engagement is not the issue anymore,\" Christiana Figueres said at a conference earlier this year . She was the executive secretary of the Convention when the Paris agreement was reached, and said that while important issues that need to be ironed out on the international level - especially for developing countries - the hardest work must now be done domestically.\n\n\"We have to redesign the COPs.... Multilateral attention, frankly, is distracting governments from doing their homework at home,\" she said. At another conference a month later, she added, \"Honestly, I would prefer 90,000 people stay at home and do their job.\"\n\nKyte agrees and thinks it's time to take at least a step back from festival-like gatherings and toward more focused, year-round, work on the crisis at hand. \"The UN has to find a way to break us into working groups to get things done,\" she said. \"And then work us back together into less of a jamboree and more of a somber working event.\"\n\nThe list of potential topics for working groups to tackle is long, from ensuring a just transition to reigning in the use of coal. But one area that Zaelke points to as a possible exemplar for a sectoral approach is reducing emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas with more than 80 times the warming power of carbon dioxide in the first 20 years after it reaches the atmosphere.\n\n\"Methane is the blow torch that's pushing us from global warming to global boiling,\" he said. \"It's the single biggest and fastest way to turn down the heat.\"\n\nTo tackle the methane problem, Zaelke points to another international agreement as a model: the Montreal Protocol. Adopted in 1987, that treaty was aimed at regulating chemicals that deplete the atmosphere's ozone layer, and it has been a resounding success. The pollutants have been almost completely phased out and the ozone layer is on track to recover by the middle of the century. The compact was expanded in 2016 to include another class of chemicals, hydrochlorofluorocarbons.\n\n\"It's an under-appreciated treaty, and it's an under-appreciated model,\" said Zaelke, noting that it included legally binding measures that the Paris agreement does not. \"You could easily come to the conclusion we need another sectoral agreement for methane.\"\n\nZaelke could see this tactic applying to other sectors as well, such as shipping and agriculture. Some advocates - including at least eight governments and the World Health Organisation - have also called for a \"Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty\", said Harjeet Singh, the global engagement director for the initiative. Like Zaelke, Kyte, and others, he envisions such sectoral pushes as running complementary to the main Convention process - a framework that, while flawed, he believes can continue to play an important role.\n\n\"The amount of time we spend negotiating each and every paragraph, line, comma, semicolon is just unimaginable and a colossal waste of time,\" he said of the annual events. But he adds the forum is still crucial, in part because every country enjoys an equal amount of voting power, no matter its size or clout.\n\n\"I don't see any other space which is as powerful as this to deliver climate justice,\" he said. \"We need more tools and more processes, but we cannot lose the space.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "We're Re-examining How We Portray Cops Onscreen. Now It's Time to Talk About Superheroes\n\nI n the past several weeks, as calls to defund the police have gone mainstream , pop culture critics and fans have been reconsidering how Hollywood heroizes cops . Legal procedurals and shoot-em-up action movies have long presented a skewed perception of the justice system in America, in which the police are almost always positioned as the good guys. These \"good cop\" narratives are rarely balanced out with stories of systemic racism in the criminal justice system . The \"bad guys\" they pursue are often people of color, their characters undeveloped beyond their criminality.\n\nIn this period of reckoning, the long-running show Cops and the widely-watched Live PD have been canceled. Actors and writers who contributed to police procedurals are criticizing their own work and donating money to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund . Parents are protesting benevolent portrayals of canine cops in the children's television show Paw Patrol . And Ava DuVernay's film collective ARRAY is launching the Law Enforcement Accountability Project (LEAP) to highlight stories of police brutality and counteract a biased narrative.\n\nBut as we engage in this long overdue conversation about law enforcement, it's high time we also talk about the most popular characters in film, the ones who decide the parameters of justice and often enact them with violence: superheroes.\n\nSuperheroes have dominated popular culture for the last decade-they are fixtures of the highest-grossing movies and icons to more than just our children. They are beacons of inspiration: protesters dressed as Spider-Man and Batman have turned up at recent Black Lives Matter demonstrations. And yet what are superheroes except cops with capes who enact justice with their powers?\n\nWith a few notable exceptions (more on those later), most superhero stories star straight, white men who either function as an extension of a broken U.S. justice system or as vigilantes without any checks on their powers. Usually, they have some sort of tentative relationship with the government: The Avengers work for the secretive agency S.H.I.E.L.D.; Batman takes orders from Gotham police commissioner Gordon; even the villainous members of the Suicide Squad execute government orders in exchange for commuted prison sentences. And even when superheroes function outside the justice system, they're sometimes idolized by police because they are able to skirt the law to \"get the job done.\"\n\nIn fact, real-life police officers sometimes adopt the symbolism of these rogue anti-heroes. The Punisher, a brutal vigilante introduced in a 1974 Spider-Man comic who also starred in a 2017 Netflix series, has become an emblem for some cops and soldiers-to the point where Marvel felt the need to address this idolatry in the pages of its comics. In a 2019 story, a group of police fanboys run up to the Punisher and say, \"We believe in you.\" One shows off a Punisher skull sticker on his car. The Punisher rips the sticker off and says, \"We're not the same. You took an oath to uphold the law. You help people. I gave that up a long time ago. You don't do what I do. Nobody does.\" Another cop replies, \"Like it or not, you started something. You showed us how it's done.\"\n\nThe Punisher is representative of a larger problem in superhero narratives. When Batman ignores orders and goes rogue, there's no oversight committee to assess whether Bruce Wayne's biases influence who he brings to justice and how. Heroes like Iron Man occasionally feel guilt about the casualties they inflict, but ultimately empower themselves again and again to draw those moral lines.\n\nIn the real world, meanwhile, tolerance for law enforcement acting with impunity is eroding. Those calling for the dismantling of modern policing point, in part, to the lack of consequences faced by officers who have killed Black people like George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Elijah McClain and many others without being fired or prosecuted-or at least with significant delays and public pressure before action was taken. As these urgent conversations dominate the news, it's increasingly unclear how either the \"arm of the law\" or the vigilante narrative can survive without serious reconsideration.\n\nMost of the blockbuster Marvel and DC comics movies skirt the issue of who should define justice for whom. Captain America: Civil War and Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice briefly float the idea of superhero oversight but both devolve into quip-filled CGI fistfights. (In fairness, the Civil War storyline in the Marvel comics more thoughtfully plumbs the depths of that socio-political debate.)\n\nWhat's more, given that the creators and stars of these movies have historically been white men, it's hardly surprising that so few reckon with issues of systemic racism-let alone sexism, homophobia, transphobia and other forms of bigotry embedded in the justice system or the inherent biases these superheroes might carry with them as they patrol the streets, or the universe.\n\nThere is some history of reckoning with policing in Black superhero films. Blade , the 1998 Wesley Snipes superhero movie, launched the superhero movie boom we're still in today, giving Marvel its first box office smash. The movie, written and directed by white men, references tensions between Black communities and the police. In one scene , two cops walk in on Blade fighting what is clearly a monstrous vampire and begin shooting at Blade instead. Blade turns around and asks, \"Are you out of your damn mind?\" It's played as a throwaway moment, but one that rings true decades on. (Marvel announced last year that two-time Oscar winner Mahershala Ali will star in Blade reboot.)\n\nMore recently, racial injustice has become the centerpiece for some superhero films. The clearest example of that shift is Black Panther , Ryan Coogler's 2018 superhero movie that takes as its main subject the oppression of BIPOC people worldwide. In that movie, Black Panther, a.k.a. T'Challa (Chadwick Boseman), rules over Wakanda, a secluded, scientifically-advanced African country unfettered by colonialism. He faces off against a would-be usurper named Killmonger (Michael B. Jordan), who argues that Wakanda must abandon its policy of isolationism and help combat systemic oppression across the world.\n\nT'Challa eventually discovers that his own father and Killmonger's father had a similar debate in the 1990s. When Killmonger's father was deployed to America as a spy, he became radicalized by the racism he saw there. He smuggled weapons from Wakanda to help Black people suffering in America. When T'Challa's father confronts Killmonger's father, the latter argues, \"Their leaders have been assassinated. Communities flooded with drugs and weapons. They are overly policed and incarcerated. All over the world, our people suffer because they do not have the tools to fight back.\" Killmonger's father eventually loses his life for his political stance.\n\nT'Challa's arc is to realize his nemesis is right: While Killmonger and his father broke laws and enacted violence for their cause, their conviction that people of color have historically lacked the tools to fight systemic oppression was correct. T'Challa eventually comes to represent a compromise between these two viewpoints: He uses his relative privilege to empower people who have been held back by colonialism and racism but finds non-violent methods to do so.\n\nAt the end of the movie, T'Challa opens a community center in Killmonger's hometown, Oakland. He asks his girlfriend to run a social-outreach program for Black communities and his tech-savvy sister to head up an education program-the same sorts of community investment that activists calling to redistribute police budgets into social support systems are now calling for. A Black Panther sequel is in the works from Coogler, and audiences can expect further exploration of this tension between policing and community support.\n\nIt's not just that superheroes act like members of law enforcement; sometimes they interact with them directly. Spider-Man has long had a complicated relationship with the NYPD. Last year's Spider-Man video game received some pushback over what many critics called \" copaganda .\" In that game, Peter Parker is a fan of the police, even fantasizing about being \"Spider cop.\" He spends much of the game fixing surveillance towers for the NYPD.\n\nBut the introduction of Miles Morales, who made his debut in the comics in 2011, could offer opportunities to explore the contentious relationship between New Yorkers and police. Miles, who is half-Black, half-Puerto Rican, is the son of a cop. In 2018's animated Spider-Man: Into the Spiderverse , Miles' father doesn't know his son's secret identity. Miles spends much of the movie trying to reconcile his father's love for him with his dislike for Spider-Man as a vigilante.\n\nA Spiderverse sequel is in the works, and many fans hope it will focus more on Miles (and less on Peter) and deal with race more directly . Before that, a Miles Morales video game will arrive, hopefully with a more nuanced take on the NYPD than the game that preceded it. With a Spider-Man who's a young man of color in a city with a painful, recent history of stop-and-frisk policies disproportionately inflicting trauma on young Black and brown men, it will be a striking oversight if it doesn't.\n\nBut the superhero property that most directly engages with corruption in policing is Watchmen . In Alan Moore's 1986 graphic novel, vigilantes who believe they have the right to fight and live by their own moral codes often prove themselves despicable bigots or megalomaniacs. One particular image of so-called heroes confronting a riot looks an awful lot like the recent videos we've seen of police officers shooting rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters.\n\nStill, the comic was a product of its time and its storylines that have not all aged well. Damon Lindelof's 2019 HBO series adapted from the comic \"remixes\" the original story and serves as a spiritual sequel. (In recognition of its relevance to the current moment, HBO made all episodes briefly available to watch for free over the Juneteenth holiday weekend.) Unlike Moore's story, which ultimately becomes a tale of white men fighting over power, Lindelof's show begins with the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre. As Victor Luckerson writes in the New Yorker , that event was \"the country's most significant incident of racial terrorism, during which the city's 'Black Wall Street' was strafed by planes and burned to the ground by white supremacists, abetted by the National Guard. It's a true story that will be left out of schoolbooks, mislabelled a 'race riot,' and deliberately forgotten .\" This misremembering of history becomes a theme of the show.\n\nAfter that preface, the show fast-forwards to modern-day Tulsa and centers primarily on Angela (Regina King), a cop pursuing a white nationalist terrorist group akin to the KKK. In order to fight them, cops have begun to cover their faces and adopt superhero alter egos. The portrayal of the police is complicated: Angela, a Black woman, is a cop and the hero of the show. She also does some objectionable things, like kicking the crap out of a suspect in an interrogation room and lying to the FBI.\n\nBut as the mysteries unravel, it becomes clear that Watchmen' s real intent is to revisit one of the most lauded stories in the comic book world and re-examine it from the perspective of historically excluded Black characters. In doing so, the show reveals the connective tissue that links harm committed against Black people from the Tulsa Massacre to the racism that Angela deals with in the present day. Black heroes rise up to meet the darkest force, one that's ignored by most superhero stories: racism.\n\nIf Hollywood is to do better in telling these stories, more creators of color need to be given the reins to tell them. It's worth noting that while Lindelof employed a diverse writers' room, it likely took his name and cache as the creator of Lost and The Leftovers to get such an ambitious story greenlit. Similarly, while the director of Spiderverse, Peter Ramsay, became the first Black man to win an Oscar for animation, Sony initially approached the two white men (who ended up producing the film), Lego Movie directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller, with the opportunity to make an animated Spider-Man.\n\nWriters must also shake the notion that they are bound by the strictures of outdated intellectual property. These days, few big-budget projects move forward unless they are based on existing IP. But the success of Watchmen suggests that creators can snatch up those familiar characters and still weave a new story, with new politics and a new perspective, using only fragments of what came before. Just as the Watchmen series is a radical departure from a dusty Reagan-era graphic novel, both Black Panther and Into the Spiderverse borrowed the names and backstories of their main characters from the comics but took those characters in new and ambitious directions.\n\nOnly when this creative freedom is encouraged and Hollywood offers more opportunities to BIPOC creators-and white creators use their capital to support creators who are too often overlooked-will we get more superhero tales that adequately grapple with the complexity of justice in America.\n\nWrite to Eliana Dockterman at eliana.dockterman@time.com"

      "text": "Cops and Little Britain Cut After Protests Put Spotlight on TV\n\nT he long-running police reality show \"Cops\" was canceled by the Paramount Network this week, and reruns of a popular British comedy have been cut from Netflix Inc. - the latest signs of how the media industry is grappling with portrayals of race and policing.\n\nAfter pulling \"Cops\" from its schedule, ViacomCBS Inc. confirmed on Tuesday that the show was canceled. \"'Cops' is not on the Paramount Network and we don't have any current or future plans for it to return,\" the network said in a statement. The reality show, which had aired on various networks for three decades, billed itself as a \"raw and realistic series\" with \"unprecedented access into the daily lives and work of police\" across the U.S.\n\nThe British comedy \"Little Britain\" was removed from several streaming services, including Netflix, the BBC's iPlayer and BritBox, over its repeated use of blackface, according to multiple reports. A BBC spokesperson told the Telegraph newspaper that \"times have changed\" since the sketch comedy program first aired in the mid-2000s. But other shows with blackface portrayals or white actors caricaturing people of color are still available on streaming services, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nGlobal protests against racism and police brutality following the death of George Floyd have put TV shows under scrutiny. And the cancellations highlight the liabilities that streaming companies face with their historical libraries, which often contain rights to shows featuring insensitive or outright racist scenes and themes that couldn't possibly be greenlighted by a major studio today.\n\nAT&T's HBO Max removed Gone With the Wind, the 1939 Oscar-winning epic drama often criticized as having glorified the South during and after the Civil War. HBO Max in a statement saidthe movie \"is a product of its time and depicts some of the ethnic and racial prejudices that have, unfortunately, been commonplace in American society.\"\n\nHBO Max plans to return the film \"with a discussion of its historical context and a denouncement of those very depictions,\" however it will be presented as originally created, the network said, \"because to do otherwise would be the same as claiming these prejudices never existed.\"\n\nDisney has refused to run 1946 film \"Song of the South,\" which features racial stereotypes, on the company's Disney+ streaming service. Executive Chairman Bob Iger told a shareholder who asked about the film earlier this year that, \"It was just not appropriate in today's world.\"\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "National Affairs: The Cops & the Comrades\n\nFollow @TIME\n\nFor more than 13 years, the New York Police Department and the Communist\nParty have been secretly and successfully planting spies in the\ninnermost echelons of each other's organizations. They have engaged not\nonly in mutual theft of all kinds of information, but also in a\nnever-ending game of blindman's buff calculated to ferret out the\nopposition's operatives. The details of this undercover competition\nbecame public for the first time last week, as the department\nprosecuted one of the Communists' most successful plants -a\n42-year-old lieutenant named Arthur Miller, who has spent 16 years on\nthe force and, before being unmasked, stood 16th among 633 officers in\nline for promotion to captain.\n\nThe tale of the department's Special Squad No. 1, a group which was\nordered to infiltrate the party back during World War II, came to light\nwhen a secret report to Mayor Fiorello La Guardia was made public\nduring Miller's trial. The report, dated April 4, 1944, noted that 28\ndetectives and policewomen had become dues-paying members of the party\nand had supplied daily reports on its inner workings. \"So deeply did\nsome of our investigators bore into the party,\" it stated, \"that one of\nthem acted as a courier between the American Communist Party and an\nagent in Portugal ...\"\n\nThe Communists' parallel activities were disclosed when one John\nLautner, former security chief for the New York State Communist Party,\ntook the stand for the prosecution. The police had wondered for years\nhow twelve of their 28 World War II spies were discovered and thrown\nout of the party. The Communist informant, said Lautner, was Lieut.\nMiller, who joined the force in May 1937, and faithfully sent the party\ninside information. After he reported that the anti-Communist squad was\nbeing formed, the Communists managed to get four police-department\nmembers assigned to it.\n\nIn 1949, however, Miller asked Lautner to let him resign from the force:\nhe had been suspected of Communist activity, had been shunted to a\nharmless police post near Prospect Park. Brooklyn, and was afraid his\nwife was about to betray him. Lautner refused to let him quit: if New\nYork's Communist-dominated American Labor Party gained more political\npower. Miller might well have become police commissioner. The Communist\nlieutenant accepted the verdict, stayed faithfully on duty until the\ndepartment finally gathered enough solid evidence to cite him for\ntrial. But Miller disappeared in a flash after that, and last week's\nproceedings (which resulted in his dismissal from the force) were\nconducted with the defendant's chair empty.\n\nAs the case against Miller drew to its close, the department announced\nthat it was investigating 15 more officers, one of them an old-hand\nwoman detective, who were also suspected of being Communists. The cops\nand the comrades, it seemed obvious, were still spying on each other as\nbusily as ever."

      "text": "There Is a Simple Solution to America's Policing Problem: More Female Cops\n\nF rom Cagney & Lacey to The Closer , Hollywood has long dreamed of powerful women police officers, unfortunately the reality on the ground is nothing like what we see on the screen.\n\nIn 2013, the most year where statistics are available, just 13 percent of police officers nationwide were women, according to the National Center for Women & Policing . That number is likely lower in rural areas as the group tended to survey urban forces, which are more likely to hire women. I use the past tense here because the Center, due to lack of funding, has essentially been defunct for the last three years, leaving America with no national association for female police.\n\nAnd yet America has never needed female cops more. In an era of Ferguson, riots in Baltimore and record high police shootings , increasing the number of female cops would go a long way to solving many of these problems . Women police almost never use excessive force, though they use the same amount of regular force. Studies show they draw their weapons less, tend to look for non-physical solutions and are much better at community outreach.\n\n\"What women never think is: 'Can I wrestle this guy to the ground?' She's more likely to control the situation with voice and presence than any kind of physical tool,\" former Houston Mayor Anise Parker told me for my chapter of women in law enforcement in my book, Broad Influence: How Women Are Changing the Way America Works.\n\nWomen officers tend to save their municipalities a substantial amount of money . Lawsuits alleging the use of excessive force by police cost taxpayers millions of dollars every year. Female officers are the defendants far less often than men, and male officers cost between 2.5 and 5.5 times more to taxpayers because of payouts to settle such suits, according to a study by the Feminist Majority Foundation and the National Center for Women & Policing.\n\nFor example, the City of Los Angeles paid $63.4 million between 1990-1999 in lawsuits for excessive force and other violent complaints against male officers. By contrast, it paid $2.8 million for similar allegations against female officers, but not one of those complaints was for excessive force. Male officer payouts in cases of brutality and misconduct were 23 times the amount paid in cases involving women; in cases involving killings, settlements for male-involved lawsuits were 43 times of those involving women; and 32 times the amount paid to settle female-involved assault and battery cases.\n\nWhile this does reflect the fact that there are simply more male cops than females cops, notably, there was no difference in the amount of routine force reported by gender, only in the use of excessive force. Incidents in which suspects are maimed or killed in custody are subject to an excessive force investigation. Generally, there are substantially fewer public complaints against female police, according to another study , such as for rudeness or other bad behavior.\n\nAlmost all of the high-profile cases in recent memory-Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Laquan McDonald, Tamir Rice, Walter Scott, Alton Sterling, Philando Castile-have involved male police officers. (The exception: One of the officers involved in the Freddie Gray case in Baltimore is a woman , though the criticism of her was that she did not call for medical attention when she saw he was unresponsive.)\n\nWomen have a long history of social work and community outreach, and female police officers tend to excel at community building. Ever since women started serving on the police force, they have focused on community outreach. The first female police officers-Lola Baldwin in Portland, Oregon, in 1908 and Alice Stebbins in Los Angeles in 1910-were former social workers, and most early female officers dealt almost exclusively with women and children. Study after study show that the tools of social work-an overwhelmingly female occupation-is critical in modern policing, and that women's softer skills may counter the escalation of conflicts.\n\nYet women remain underrepresented in law enforcement because of \"widespread discriminatory hiring and selection practices,\" according to the National Center for Women & Policing. Advancement has been slow. From 1971, when women accounted for just 1.4 percent of police departments to 13 percent of police officers nationwide in 2013.\n\nThere is also a dearth in any recent research on women in police forces. Most studies are from the 1980s or 1990s when the first waves of women were integrating. There are no current statistics on women in police academies and there are no discernable, ongoing moves to add women to police forces. Despite the evidence that women help make policing better, little is being done beyond efforts by individual forces, which vary by city and state.\n\nSome programs are vigorous-Dallas, for example, has 26 percent women on its police force. Others are nonexistent. Nationally, next to nothing is being done to change hiring policies, develop training programs, or launch recruitment drives. And the Federal Bureau of Investigation remains one of the most challenging workplaces for women in Washington; only 19 percent of agents are women.\n\nAs President Obama on Thursday sits down with activists and cops at the White House , the discussion has largely revolved around race. What is lacking is a discussion of how gender might also impact, and help solve, the problem.\n\nJay Newton-Small is author of the recent book, \"Broad Influence: How Women Are Changing the Way America Works.\" Available on Amazon.com and bookstores everywhere.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "Police Kill Too Many People-White and Black\n\nI n March, something happened in Kentucky that tragically seems, in light of what happened to Alton Sterling and Philando Castile last week, business as usual. Constable Bobby Smith wanted to serve a warrant to Brandon Stanley, who tried to evade him. Smith tracked Stanley down to a convenience store and shot him dead .\n\nAround the same time in Arizona, Daniel Shaver was playfully waving a pellet gun out of a motel window. A police officer detained him, and despite Shaver complying with all of his demands (there is a video) shot him dead . Also around this time in North Dakota, James Scott, allegedly intoxicated, dropped a gun and fled police officers but refused to put his hands up when detained; they shot him dead .\n\nThe men in these cases were white, not black, and yet all three were killed by police officers under circumstances that would almost surely have elicited indignant protest nationwide if they were black.\n\nCases of this kind are dismayingly numerous. Last February, an officer saw Andrew Thomas get into his SUV, suspected he was drunk and gave chase. Thomas' vehicle rolled over, and the officer shot him in the neck as he was climbing. Thomas died in the hospital. Then in Fresno last month, Dylan Noble, 19, was stopped by police officers , had his hands up, but after reaching into his waist band was shot several times, at one point lifting his arm to say that he had been shot. There is a video; he's dead now.\n\nI am neither Republican nor conservative, and am not writing this out of some partisan allegiance to right-wing dismissals of Black Lives Matter. The amount of hate mail I get for supporting protests against the cops about black shooting deaths deep-sixes any notion of me as a reactionary. I seek progress on the main obstacle to getting past race in this country: the tensions between black people and the cops, including so many black people's sense of the police as a racist occupying army.\n\nThe heart of the indignation over these murders is a conviction that racist bias plays a decisive part in these encounters. That has seemed plausible to me, and I have recently challenged those who disagree to present a list of white people killed within the past few years under circumstances similar to those that so enrage us in cases such as what happened to Tamir Rice, John Crawford, Walter Scott, Sam Debose and others.\n\nThe simple fact is that this list exists.\n\nExample go on and on. Last December in Mississippi, officers tried to stop Michael Parker for a moving violation. Parker sped away; during the ensuing chase Parker was shot dead . Last year in January, a Montana officer, suspecting Loren Simpson of car theft , referred to him to his partner as a \"little f*cker\" of the sort who \"go steal cars, they go break into sh*t.\" The cops pursued Simpson, and when he tried to turn away from them they shot him dead, even though federal guidelines prohibit firing into moving vehicles. Back one more year, in 2014, the deaths of James Boyd , Alfred Redwine and Mary Hawkes in New Mexico were similar stories; what happened to Pastor Jonathan Ayers in 2009 in Georgia is but one example further back than that. (Ex-Baltimore police officer and criminology professor Peter Moskos' blog is useful for data of this kind.)\n\nThe parallels in these cases with ones we have heard more about are chilling. Shaver's waving the pellet gun parallels John Crawford , shot and killed two summers ago for playing with a toy BB gun at a Walmart. Dylan Noble's reaching into his pocket and being killed for it parallels what seems to have happened to Alton Sterling and other black victims. The officer's depiction of Loren Simpson as one of a menacing \"they\" recalls George Zimmerman's \"these a**holes, they always get away\" in his 911 call about Trayvon Martin.\n\nThis list of whites dying at the hands of cops must inform how we go forward in grappling with the issues. Hillary Clinton and President Obama have suggested that the time has come to revive a national conversation on race . Many might reasonably assume that on the topic of the police, the purpose of this conversation will be to inform white America of the role that racist bias plays in these lethal encounters. However, might we open up to the possibility that the conversation will also include black people learning that racist bias may play much less of a role in these cases than one might think?\n\nA common response will be that cops kill more black people proportionately than whites. According to a survey by the Washington Post , whites are 62% of the population but were roughly half of those killed by cops since January 2015, while blacks are 13% of the population but were about a quarter of those killed. However, this isn't the slam dunk dismissal it may seem.\n\nFor example, from the 1970s through the 1990s, claims that too many black people were on welfare were often dismissed on the basis that more whites were numerically-despite that more black people were proportionally. Moreover, many would argue that disproportionate poverty levels among black people render them more likely to encounter police officers in the first place-vastly unfair, but different from the problem being simply cops' standing racist bias.\n\nIn any case, I'm not sure statistics of this kind are what truly undergird the hurt we feel in these times. When a black man is killed by a cop, do we grieve more because there are 46 million of us as opposed to 198 million whites? I doubt it: most Americans never hear about the white men's deaths at all.\n\nRather, we operate according to a meme under which cops casually kill black men under circumstances in which white men are apparently let off with a hand slap-and occasional cases of just that are what often get around social media, suggesting that they are the norm. That meme is quite understandable given the existence of racism in America. However, in 2016 that meme is vastly oversimplified.\n\nControversy will continue, such as over whether race affects how likely officers are to be exonerated for killings of this kind. However, at the end of the day any intelligent engagement with these issues must keep front and center that there was a Daniel Shaver for John Crawford, a Michael Parker for Walter Scott, a James Scott for Laquan McDonald. Economist Roland Fryer's conclusions , stunning even to him, that cops use more force against black people but do not kill them more than they kill whites is perhaps less perplexing than it seems.\n\nIt can be hard to adjust the narratives we process life through, especially when the past and even present justify that narrative in so many ways. However, on black people and the cops, the stakes are grievously high. Our conversation must be based on facts, and the facts in 2016 are different than they once were. We can all agree that the police kill too many innocent people, but at this point, we can disagree-as eminently reasonable minds-that the cops kill out of bigotry.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com"

      "text": "US police show cancelled after George Floyd death\n\nOne of America's longest running reality TV police shows has been cancelled amid protests against police brutality over George Floyd's death.\n\nCable network Paramount said it had no plans for Cops, which first aired more than three decades ago, to return.\n\nThe future of another reality TV police show, Live PD, is in doubt.\n\nThe A&E cable TV network hit has been engulfed by controversy since the death of another unarmed black man who was heard pleading: \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nCops ran for 25 years after first being broadcast on Fox in 1989, before it was taken up by Paramount's predecessor, Spike TV, in 2013.\n\nIts 33rd season had been due to air on the ViacomCBS-owned network on Monday.\n\nA Paramount spokesperson told US media on Tuesday: \"Cops is not on the Paramount Network and we don't have any current or future plans for it to return.\"\n\nThe show was temporarily pulled from air late last month as protests gathered pace over the death of Floyd, an unarmed black man who died on 25 May in Minneapolis, Minnesota, after a police officer knelt on his neck. He was heard saying: \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nSince Floyd's death, some activists and opinion writers have called for reality TV police shows to be yanked from air.\n\nThey have argued that the genre portrays police officers as action-heroes and stigmatises African-American communities.\n\nThe future of Live PD, another programme that follows police on patrol around the nation, is also uncertain.\n\nLast week the A&E cable network pulled episodes and said it was evaluating whether to bring the show back.\n\nA&E said its decision was out of \"respect for the families of George Floyd and others who have lost their lives\".\n\nLive PD is under scrutiny following last year's death of Javier Ambler, a black man from Texas.\n\nThe 40-year-old father-of-two died on 28 March 2019 following a 22-minute police chase that ended in the city of Austin.\n\nLive PD was filming sheriff's deputies when the pursuit began.\n\nTravis County District Attorney Margaret Moore has accused A&E of failing to hand over its video footage of Ambler's death to investigators.\n\nWilliamson County deputies reportedly began chasing Ambler because he failed to dim his headlights to oncoming traffic.\n\nPolice body-camera video shows Ambler - who had been on his way home from a poker night with friends - on the ground with several officers.\n\nAmbler tells the sheriff's deputies he has congestive heart failure and repeatedly says: \"I can't breathe.\"\n\nA post-mortem examination said Ambler died of congestive heart failure and hypertensive cardiovascular disease associated with morbid obesity \"in combination with forcible restraint\".\n\nThe death was ruled a homicide.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Police officers widely misusing body-worn cameras\n\nPolice officers are switching off their body-worn cameras when force is used, as well as deleting footage and sharing videos on WhatsApp.\n\nA BBC investigation has uncovered more than 150 reports of camera misuse by forces in England and Wales - described as \"shocking\" by a leading officer.\n\nIn one case, siblings faced a two-year legal battle over footage showing officers' use of force against them.\n\nThe Home Office says police use of cameras must be lawful and justified.\n\nThe roll-out of body-worn cameras, costing at least £90m over the past decade, was intended to benefit both victims and the police - protecting officers against malicious complaints and improving the quality of evidence collected.\n\nBut during a two-year investigation, the BBC has obtained reports of misuse from Freedom of Information requests, police sources, misconduct hearings and regulator reports.\n\nThe cameras were introduced to improve policing transparency, but we found more than 150 camera misuse reports with cases to answer over misconduct, recommendations for learning or where complaints were upheld.\n\nThe most serious allegations include:\n\nThe failures uncovered by the BBC are \"unlawful\" in some cases, says the National Police Chief Council's lead for body-worn video, Acting Chief Constable Jim Colwell.\n\n\"Those incidents go to the heart of what undermines confidence in policing,\" he says.\n\nHe believes more footage should now be released in order to improve public trust.\n\nAmong evidence obtained by the BBC are multiple previously unreleased videos of an incident which illustrates some of the concerns held about the use of cameras.\n\nSiblings Louisa, 25, and Yufial, 23 were prosecuted after being accused of assaulting and abusing officers at a Black Lives Matter protest in London in May 2020. They always maintained their innocence and that the police assaulted them.\n\nThey faced a two-year legal battle to obtain crucial body-worn video evidence showing use of force by police against them.\n\nThe demonstration, outside Parliament, began peacefully but later ended in confrontation.\n\nThe clash, which only lasted a little longer than a minute, led to Louisa being restrained by a group of officers using a technique described as involving an \"enormous\" use of force by one restraint expert.\n\nMobile phone footage shared on social media showed her head being pressed into the ground.\n\nBoth siblings were arrested and charged. Yufial was accused of assaulting an officer, while Louisa was accused of being threatening or abusive towards another.\n\nFootage seen by the BBC shows Louisa being pushed by a female officer while another shows Yufial being struck by a male officer, who is then pulled back by colleagues.\n\nBodycam cops uncovered\n\nBody-worn cameras were supposed to increase transparency in policing but this investigation has uncovered more than 150 reports of failings. We reveal how cameras have been switched off when force was used, videos have been deleted or not disclosed, and footage has been shared on social media.\n\nWatch now on BBC iPlayer (UK Only)\n\nThe video wasn't initially disclosed to either of them.\n\n\"[I kept thinking] I'm not going crazy, I know what happened, I saw the officer punch my brother,\" Louisa says.\n\nThey were both eventually acquitted. At Yufial's hearing, the judge said it seemed the prosecution had deliberately failed to disclose relevant information.\n\nThe BBC has heard multiple complaints that video is not being shared with defence teams under disclosure rules, despite its increasing importance in criminal cases.\n\nWe also learned that no body-worn video was disclosed from the camera of the officer who used force on Louisa.\n\nThe Met told the BBC it accepts there were errors with disclosure of evidence in Louisa and Yufial's case and apologised in a statement. Despite this, it proceeded with a second case against Louisa, alleging she had provided false information at the police station. She was recently acquitted again.\n\nNo action has been taken against any of the officers involved.\n\nThe siblings say their \"two-year nightmare\" has had a significant impact on their lives. Louisa deferred a law degree for three years, fearing a prosecution, while Yufial lost his job. Both blame the police misuse of body-worn video.\n\nThe Met says body-worn cameras act as an \"independent witness\" - and are used millions of times a year.\n\nBut forces almost never release this footage to the press after significant incidents or in response to Freedom of Information requests.\n\nAlthough some forces have scrutiny panels, and regulators will review footage as part of misconduct proceedings, the police are largely responsible for scrutinising camera use themselves.\n\nThe BBC was only able to obtain footage of an assault by an officer in Wolverhampton, for which he was given a custodial sentence, after attending his criminal trial, where it was shared under legal obligations to disclose evidence.\n\nThe West Midlands Police officer had been responding to an alarm on a bus in 2021. Only one of the six attending officers had switched their cameras on.\n\nThat PC filmed the officer in charge assaulting a man - and told the court the same officer then asked him not to upload the footage on return to the station.\n\nDo you have more information about this story?\n\nYou can reach Noel directly and securely through encrypted messaging app Signal on: +44 7809 334720 or by email at noel.titheradge@bbc.co.uk\n\nForces tend to release footage to accompany news stories which show the results of successful operations or following prosecutions in major cases.\n\nHowever, in the US, some police forces have quickly released footage of significant incidents - even where their actions may face criticism.\n\nIn 2021, police in Ohio published footage of Ma'Khia Bryant, 16, being fatally shot while holding a knife. While the video supported the police's view that she appeared to be dangerous, it also raised questions about whether a Taser or other tactic could have been used.\n\nBut in the UK, Merseyside Police has repeatedly refused to provide videos of two officers switching off their cameras during an incident where a man was punched five times - a decision supported by the Information Commissioner. The force argued the footage did not provide \"any tangible benefit to the public\".\n\nAn unsuccessful appeal at an Information Tribunal - part of which was held as a closed hearing, meaning the footage couldn't be viewed - ruled that it should not be released. Although not unusual for information tribunal hearings, closed sessions are more usually reserved for subjects involving national security in other proceedings.\n\nSeparately, the tribunal also ruled against releasing videos showing a British Transport Police officer turning off his colleague's camera on two occasions - one during a shift where he intentionally damaged a detained person's phone, and another when a search for drugs was being carried out on a young man.\n\nJudge Sophie Buckley found that the footage was the officer's \"personal data\" - and releasing video of the moment of de-activation would be \"meaningless\".\n\nPolice forces' attitudes towards cameras are wrong, says Baroness Louise Casey, who conducted a year-long review into the Met Police published in March, and found it lacked accountability and transparency.\n\n\"There are too many dark things that go on that we are not seeing,\" she told the BBC.\n\nShe said many senior police officers believe body-worn video exists almost to cover their backs: \"The sooner they get their heads around the fact that it's a tool that would help them build trust they'd be on to something - instead of hiding it.\"\n\nThe NPCC's Jim Colwell, Acting Chief Constable of Devon & Cornwall Police, says the vast majority of body-worn video shows good policing, but publication of footage should be the default where lawful to do so.\n\nBut he added that releasing footage was a challenge because the current legal framework - which includes data protection law - works against transparency.\n\nThe Home Office declined to say whether it planned to change how cameras were used or amend legislation to encourage forces to publish footage more regularly.\n\nA spokesperson said: \"Police use of technology, including body-worn video cameras, must be lawful, proportionate and justified.\"\n\nThey added that officers should follow the NPCC's guidance on standards and rules when operating cameras.\n\nMeanwhile, Yufial, who spent two years trying to clear his name, says the use of cameras is further damaging trust in the police.\n\n\"It's labelled as protection for the public, but ultimately it protects the police,\" he says.\n\nYou can follow Noel on X, formerly Twitter\n\nDo you have more information about this story?

      "text": "Video shows police beating and kicking Tyre Nichols while he was restrained\n\nFootage of a traffic stop that has seen five ex-Memphis police officers charged with murder shows them kicking and punching a motorist for several minutes as he cries out for his mother.\n\nOfficers are seen beating Tyre Nichols, 29, in the videos from the 7 January arrest, with no signs of him resisting.\n\nUS President Joe Biden said he was \"deeply pained\" by the \"horrific\" clip.\n\nLawyers for Mr Nichols' family likened the assault to the 1991 police beating of Los Angeles motorist Rodney King.\n\nPeaceful protests took place in Memphis on Friday night after the video was released, with some demonstrators blocking a major highway in the city, while small-scale demonstrations were held elsewhere in the country.\n\nMany protesters held banners demanding justice for Mr Nichols and an end to \"police terror\".\n\nThis article contains descriptions of violence that some people may find distressing\n\nPolice initially said Mr Nichols had been stopped on suspicion of reckless driving, which has not been substantiated. He died in hospital three days later, on 10 January.\n\nMr Nichols was black, as are all five officers charged in the case.\n\nMemphis Police Department released four graphic videos of the traffic stop and its violent aftermath on Friday, totalling more than an hour of footage.\n\nThe first clip shows officers pulling Mr Nichols out of his vehicle and shouting at him to get on the ground.\n\n\"I didn't do anything!\" he says. Officers demand that he lie down flat.\n\n\"Get on the [expletive] ground!\" one officer shouts, as another is heard saying: \"Tase him!\"\n\nAn officer shouts: \"Put your hands behind your back before I break your [expletive].\"\n\n\"You guys are really doing a lot right now,\" Mr Nichols says to the officers. \"I'm just trying to go home.\"\n\nWithin seconds one of the officers fires a Taser at Mr Nichols, who leaps up and manages to run away.\n\nA separate video, from a CCTV camera mounted on a utility pole, shows officers beating Mr Nichols after catching up with him in a residential area.\n\nTwo officers are seen holding Mr Nichols down while others take turns kicking and punching him and striking him with an expandable baton.\n\nThey drag him across the ground and prop him sitting up against a squad car. More than 20 minutes elapse until an ambulance is seen arriving.\n\nThe third and fourth videos show police body camera footage of the beating, with Mr Nichols being held down, pepper-sprayed and assaulted as he repeatedly shouts: \"Mom!\"\n\nThe videos also show officers milling about recounting details of the incident as Mr Nichols lies slumped against the car.\n\nSome of them claim Mr Nichols \"swung\" at them or reached for their guns, though neither allegation is clear from the released video.\n\nOfficers can also be heard saying that nothing was found in his car.\n\nMr Nichols' mother, RowVaughn Wells, has said her son was only about 230ft (70m) from home when Memphis police officers \"murdered him\".\n\nRepresentatives of the family have described Mr Nichols as the father of a four-year-old son and a keen skateboarder who had recently enrolled in a photography class. He worked for the FedEx parcel delivery firm.\n\nOne of the lawyers, Antonio Romanucci, said: \"This young man, by definition of the law in this state, was terrorised.\"\n\nThe video is \"appalling\", Greg Donaldson, a professor at John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York, told the BBC.\n\nHe said the lack of training stands out, with the police officers' anger seeming to grow \"as their incompetence seems to be more revealed\".\n\n\"The worse part of it was the inhumanity after the incident,\" he added, as officers leave Mr Nichols \"laying there on the ground like a piece of garbage.\"\n\nThe five officers - Tadarrius Bean, Demetrius Haley, Desmond Mills Jr, Emmitt Martin III and Justin Smith - were fired last week.\n\nThey were taken into custody on Thursday and each faces charges of second-degree murder, aggravated assault, aggravated kidnapping, official misconduct and official oppression.\n\nFour of the five posted bail and were released from custody by Friday morning, according to jail records.\n\nLawyers for Mr Martin and Mr Mills have said their clients will plead not guilty.\n\nMemphis Police Director Cerelyn Davis described the five officers' actions as \"heinous, reckless and inhumane\".\n\nWith protests anticipated, she told US media that local officials had decided to release the video on Friday evening so that schoolchildren and commuters would have time to get home.\n\nReverend Al Sharpton, who will deliver the eulogy for Mr Nichols on Wednesday, asked protesters to \"remain non-violent\", saying unrest would only help the defendants.\n\nIn a tweet the civil rights leader said the \"sad reality\" was police brutality would be \"an ever-present threat for Black and Brown Americans unless cops continually see that those who use blunt force will go to jail\".\n\nThe protests around the country have so far been largely peaceful, which Mr Nichols' family had called for, saying they didn't \"want any type of disturbance\".\n\nOne protester at the Memphis rally, 21-year-old Kyrion, told the BBC he had dreamed as a child of joining the city's police force, but now that dream was shattered.\"It's just wicked, the system is forever going to be wicked,\" he said. \"Which is why I'm out here today, as of right now I can't count on [police] to protect me.\n\n\"How do I know the man is not going to put his knee into my neck, or hold me down and beat me into a pulp?\"\n\nAfter the videos were released, Shelby County Sheriff's Office said two of its deputies had also been relieved from duty pending an investigation into their conduct.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe US president says he fears the Russian leader is \"tapping me along\" given Moscow's strikes on Kyiv earlier this week.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "How 'Cops' shaped public opinion about police and people of color over the last 30 years\n\nIn this article\n\nWhen a writers' strike paralyzed the television industry in the late 1980s, networks were forced to find new, alternative programs to fill its air.\n\nThat's how \"Cops\" found a home on Fox Television. The low budget program, which had no union writers, was a welcome solution - and it ran for 32 seasons. That is until earlier this week.\n\nNow owned by ViacomCBS , \"Cops\" was canceled in the wake of of protests against police brutality and the death of George Floyd at the hands of a white police officer.\n\nThe show has long been criticized for its depiction of police interactions with criminal suspects, but high ratings kept the show running and even inspired other networks to create reality TV shows featuring cops. A&E's \"Live P.D.,\" one of the highest-rated shows on cable, has also been canceled.\n\n\"As an early reality program, it came across to people as raw documentary,\" said Jack Bratich, associate professor of journalism and media studies at Rutgers University. \"Nowadays audiences are more savvy about how reality programming is produced, edited and staged. Viewers are aware of how programs present perspectives and invite audiences to identify with those perspectives.\"\n\nThe appeal of \"Cops,\" and other shows like it, was the idea that it was an unfiltered look at what police face everyday while on the job. However, this lens was more filtered than most audiences were aware of at the time of its inception and, as the program gained popularity, it began to reinforce racial stereotypes about the Black community.\n\n\"One of the first reality TV shows, 'Cops' observational style seemed to show the police as the thin blue line holding back the violence and chaos of American inner cities,\" said Zoe Druick, a professor at Simon Fraser University, who teaches media studies and cultural theory.\n\nThe show didn't have a script or a narrator. Audiences were thrust into the action, watching as patrol cars sped toward violent incidents that were already in progress.\n\nAt the time of \"Cops\" inception, the U.S. was in the middle of its \"War on Drugs,\" which led to the militarization of police and higher incarceration rates.\n\n\"Their violent policing style was justified by the extreme situations they found themselves in,\" Druick said. \"In reality, the show was highly edited, with the majority of police work dealing with the outcomes of poverty, addiction and mental illness being left on the proverbial cutting room floor.\"\n\n\"Cops\" filmed in more than 140 cities over the course of its 30 years on television. Police departments granted permission to the program to film in their areas and had approval rights over the footage.\n\nIn many cases, police departments asked \"Cops\" to come and film in their town or city in order to assist with rebranding their reputation and as a means to recruit new officers.\n\n\"'Cops' was terrific PR for police departments,\" said Dan Simon, professor of law and psychology at The University of Southern California Gould School of Law.\n\nSimon noted that there is a sense of accountability that most people feel when they are being observed. The police officers knew they were going to be filmed for the series, were aware of the norms and expectations people have for officers of the law and were working to uphold that image.\n\n\"Some reality shows are games - participants are also contestants, creating personas for the audience as well as for other contestants,\" Bratich said. \"In the case of 'Cops,' this meant creating personas of amused, beleaguered and effective police officers. They constructed images of themselves as ordinary heroes just doing their jobs on the front lines. This peek into the backstage of patrol cops eclipsed the institutional and systemic problems of policing.\"\n\nWhile police officers were glorified, suspects, regardless of their eventual guilt, were criminalized.\n\n\"The show drew a line between police and criminals, using the observational format to suggest that we could simply see who was good and who was bad in the situation,\" Druick said. \"'Cops' therefore also implicitly suggested that courts were irrelevant. You could see with your own eyes who was guilty - the very ones police came for.\"\n\nSimon noted that studies have shown that over the course of the show's run it statistically skewed toward Black and Brown suspects, more so than the actual rate of crime in the U.S. Often, he said, these suspects were shown intoxicated, in poor neighborhoods and in poor physical condition.\n\n\"You catch people at the worst moments in their lives and that reinforces the stereotypes,\" Simon said.\n\nThe structure of \"Cops,\" which didn't provide background or context for incidences, pushed audiences to identify with the police, Druick said. Even the \"Bad Boys\" theme song assisted in criminalizing the suspects even before they were on camera.\n\n\"Over the years, ['Cops'] most likely contributed to the dehumanization of poor, desperate, drug-addicted African Americans and the justification of harsh, militarized policing,\" she said.\n\nViacomCBS and A&E, which is owned by Hearst Communications and Disney Media Networks , didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe representation of suspects on reality police shows is part of the reason that protesters have called for their cancellation over the years. Those calls were ultimately answered in the wake of nationwide rallies against police brutality and the bias against people of color.\n\n\"By focusing on ordinary situations, reality TV often normalizes certain behaviors,\"  Bratich said. \"The call to cancel 'Cops' was a refusal of police normalization.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "3 more cops charged in George Floyd death, other officer's murder charge upgraded\n\nThree former Minneapolis police officers were charged Wednesday with aiding and abetting murder in connection with the death of George Floyd in their custody, Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison announced Wednesday.\n\nDerek Chauvin, a fourth former officer who had already been charged with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter, will now also be charged with second-degree murder, Ellison said.\n\n\"We are here today because George Floyd is not here,\" Ellison, a Democrat, said at a news conference in St. Paul, Minnesota, announcing the charges. Ellison predicted that the prosecution of the officers could take months, and urged the public to be patient as his office builds cases.\n\n\"George Floyd mattered. He was loved. His family was important. His life had value. And we will seek justice for him and for you,\" Ellison said. He noted that winning the cases \"will not be an easy thing. Winning a conviction will be hard.\"\n\n\"In order to be thorough, this is going to take months, and I do not know how many,\" Ellison, a former U.S. representative who was deputy chair of the Democratic National Committee from 2017 to 2018, said. \"But it is better to make sure we have a solid case, fully investigated, researched, before we go to trial, than to rush it. It will take a while and I can't set a deadline on that.\"\n\nChauvin, who is white, was charged Friday with third-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter after video footage emerged showing him kneeling on Floyd's neck for nearly nine minutes as Floyd, a black man, lay handcuffed, crying out that he could not breathe.\n\nAt one point during the arrest Floyd also told the officers that \"I'm about to die,\" according to the charging documents filed Wednesday.\n\nThe three ex-cops who had not yet been charged, Tou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane, assisted Chauvin in arresting Floyd on Memorial Day on suspicion that Floyd passed a counterfeit bill. All four officers were fired last week.\n\nDrew Evans, superintendent of the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension, appeared alongside Ellison and said that one of the officers charged Wednesday was in custody, and the other two were expected to be taken into custody later in the day.\n\nHe did not specify which of the three was already in custody. Chauvin has been in custody since last week.\n\ncrump tweet\n\nThe video shows that Chauvin continued to keep his knee of Floyd's neck even after Floyd became unresponsive.\n\nFloyd's death has sparked widespread protests against police violence in dozens of cities across the country, with demonstrators and Floyd's family calling for charges to be brought against Thao, Kueng and Lane.\n\nThe family also has demanded that Chauvin, 44, face a first-degree murder charge.\n\nEllison said that he did not allow public pressure to influence his decision-making.\n\n\"We made these decisions based on the facts that we have gathered,\" he said.\n\nBen Crump, an attorney for the family, said in a statement earlier in the day that the family's reaction to the charges was that it was \"a bittersweet moment.\"\n\n\"We are deeply gratified that @AGEllison took decisive action, arresting & charging ALL the officers involved in #GeorgeFloyd's death & upgrading the charge against Derek Chauvin to felony second-degree murder,\" Crump wrote in a post on Twitter.\n\nQuincy Mason Floyd, George Floyd's son, said in an interview on CNN after news of the charges broke: \"We demand justice. My father shouldn't have been killed like this. We want justice.\"\n\nA second-degree murder charge carries a statutory maximum sentence of 40 years upon conviction, compared with 25 years for third-degree murder.\n\nThao, 34, Kueng, 26, and Lane, 37, are charged with aiding and abetting second-degree murder and second-degree manslaughter. The first count has a maximum possible sentence of 40 years in prison, while the manslaughter-related count has a 10-year maximum prison sentence.\n\nActual sentences are often short of the maximum.\n\nThe Hennepin County Attorney's Office was handling prosecutions stemming from George Floyd's death until Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz assigned Ellison the responsibility on Sunday. Minneapolis is located in Hennepin County.\n\nFloyd's memorial is scheduled for Thursday in Minneapolis and he will be buried in Houston next week. He was 46 years old.\n\nTwo separate autopsies, one commissioned by Floyd's family and another performed by the Hennepin County Medical Examiner's Office, both found that Floyd's death was a homicide, but differed in their determinations of its causes.\n\nThe Hennepin County medical examiner's autopsy found that Floyd died from \"cardiopulmonary arrest\" that was complicated by police subduing him with restraint and neck compression. The autopsy also cited underlying health conditions as contributing to his death.\n\nBut the independent autopsy, conducted by pathologists hired by Floyd's family, found that he died from asphyxiation, and that pressure on both his neck and back contributed. Dr. Michael Baden, one of the pathologists and a former chief medical examiner for New York City, said Monday that Floyd \"had no underlying medical problems that caused or contributed to his death.\"\n\nThe original criminal complaint against Chauvin details Kueng's and Lane's actions during Floyd's arrest. According to the complaint, Kueng held Floyd's back and Lane held his legs.\n\nAt one point, Kueng checked for a pulse, and said \"I couldn't find one,\" according to the complaint. But he and the other cops stayed in their positions for approximately two more minutes.\n\nFloyd repeatedly told the officers that he could not breathe, cried out for his deceased mother and asked the officers \"please,\" the complaint against Chauvin reads.\n\nIn all, Chauvin held his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes and 46 seconds, including for nearly three minutes after Floyd became unresponsive, according to the complaint.\n\nVideo tape of the encounter shows bystanders calling for the officers to get off of him.\n\nIn an emotional speech earlier on Wednesday, Crump, the Floyd family attorney, said Floyd \"cried out for anybody who would listen.\"\n\n\"It seemed like the lay people on the street were listening. The people who refused to listen were the people who were supposed to listen,\" Crump said, speaking from the site where Floyd was killed.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "3 ex-cops convicted of rights violations in George Floyd killing\n\nThree former Minneapolis police officers were convicted Thursday of violating George Floyd's civil rights, as a federal jury rejected their arguments that inexperience, improper training or the distraction of shouting bystanders excused them from failing to prevent Floyd's killing.\n\nTou Thao, J. Alexander Kueng and Thomas Lane were convicted of depriving Floyd of his right to medical care as the 46-year-old Black man was pinned under fellow Officer Derek Chauvin's knee for 9 1/2 minutes while handcuffed, facedown on the street on May 25, 2020. Kueng knelt on Floyd's back, Lane held his legs and Thao kept bystanders back.\n\nThao and Kueng were also convicted of failing to intervene to stop Chauvin in the videotaped killing that sparked protests in Minneapolis and around the globe as part of a reckoning over racial injustice.\n\nFloyd's brother Philonise Floyd called the verdicts \"accountability,\" but added: \"There can never be justice because I can never get George back.\"\n\nAnd Floyd's nephew Brandon Williams said he hoped the verdicts would change laws and policies to \"protect people from these situations.\" He also said the outcome \"sends a message that says, if you murder or use excessive or deadly force, there's consequences that follow.\"\n\nLane shook his head and looked at his attorney as his verdict was read. Thao and Kueng showed no visible emotion. Their attorneys declined to comment immediately afterward.\n\nCharles Kovats, acting U.S. attorney for Minnesota, called the convictions a reminder that all sworn law enforcement officers have a duty to intervene.\n\n\"These officers had a moral responsibility, a legal obligation and a duty to intervene, and by failing to do so, they committed a crime,\" Kovats said.\n\nChauvin and Thao went to the scene to help rookies Kueng and Lane after they responded to a call that Floyd used a counterfeit $20 bill at a corner store. Floyd struggled with officers as they tried to put him in a police SUV.\n\nDuring the monthlong federal trial, prosecutors sought to show that the officers violated their training, including when they failed to move Floyd or give him CPR. Prosecutors argued that Floyd's condition was so serious that even bystanders without basic medical training could see he needed help, but that the officers \"chose to do nothing.\"\n\nThe defense said their training was inadequate. Kueng and Lane both said they deferred to Chauvin as the senior officer at the scene. Thao testified that he relied on the other officers to care for Floyd's medical needs as his attention was elsewhere.\n\nA jury of eight women and four men that appeared to be all-white reached the verdicts after about two days of deliberations. The court did not release demographics such as race or age. Lane is white, Kueng is Black and Thao is Hmong American.\n\nThe former officers remain free on bond pending sentencing, which has not yet been scheduled. Conviction of a federal civil rights violation that results in death is punishable by life in prison or even death, but such sentences are extremely rare. Federal sentencing guidelines rely on complicated formulas that indicate the officers would get much less.\n\nChauvin, who is white, was convicted of murder last year in state court and pleaded guilty in December in the federal case. He was sentenced to 22 1/2 years in the state case. A sentencing date has not yet been set in the federal case, but both sides agreed Chauvin should face a sentence ranging from 20 to 25 years.\n\nPublic reaction to Thursday's verdicts was muted, with only a tiny handful of protesters visible outside the courthouse, which was surrounded by fencing throughout the trial. On the day Chauvin was convicted, many people listened live as his verdicts were read and crowded into the square where he died for a celebration afterward. That trial was livestreamed, while this one was not.\n\nLane, Kueng and Thao also face a separate trial in June on state charges alleging that they aided and abetted murder and manslaughter.\n\nThe verdicts come just days after the conviction of three white men on hate crimes charges in Georgia in the death of Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man who was chased and shot in February 2020.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

Marjorie Taylor Greene's home overnight after an alleged opponent of her stance on transgender rights made a false 911 call, authorities in Georgia said Wednesday.\n\nThe \"swatting\" call falsely claimed that a man had been shot multiple times in a bathtub at a residence in Rome, Georgia, the city's police department said in a report shared with CNBC.\n\nThe Rome Police Department at 1:04 a.m. ET dispatched five officers, who learned en route that they were headed to Greene's house, the report said. They rang the doorbell and were met by the Republican congresswoman, who \"assured us there was no issue,\" the report said.\n\nA spokeswoman for the department told CNBC that the officers checked Greene's home.\n\nAfterward, the department received a second call from a suspect using a computer-generated voice who claimed responsibility for the incident.\n\nThe suspect \"explained that they were upset about Ms. Greene's stance on 'trans-gender youth's rights', and stated that they were trying to 'SWAT' her,\" the police report said.\n\nThe department said it is working with the U.S. Capitol Police on the investigation, which remains active. The Capitol Police declined CNBC's request for comment.\n\nGreene, a far-right lawmaker backed by former President Donald Trump , had introduced a bill in Congress last week that would make it a felony to provide gender-affirming care to transgender minors.\n\nThe legislation came amid a growing right-wing movement against those treatments that recently targeted Boston Children's Hospital , which said last week that it is dealing with an influx of hostile calls and emails, including threats of violence.\n\n\"Right now, Congresswoman Greene's safety is our number one concern,\" Greene's spokesman, Nick Dyer, said in a statement to CNBC.\n\nDyer called Greene the \"victim of a political attack on her family and home\" and also described it as a \"violent crime,\" though no violence is alleged to have occurred.\n\nGreene first revealed being swatted in a tweet.\n\nIn an interview later Wednesday, Greene said she was startled by the police presence at her home, but decided not to carry a gun as she answered the door, \"which was very out of norm for me.\"\n\nThe swatter endangered both her and the officers, Greene said in the interview with \"Real America's Voice,\" a conservative outlet. \"Whoever this person is, they deserve to be locked up,\" she said.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Biden calls on states to 'fund the police,' mental health programs using federal money\n\nPresident Joe Biden on Friday urged states and cities to use federal funds to invest in more cops, crisis responders and mental-health and substance-abuse programs to curb crime.\n\nThe president asked local leaders to deploy leftover money from the American Rescue Plan, the Biden administration's $1.9 trillion Covid-19 stimulus law, to help communities fight crime during the summer months.\n\nBiden also took the opportunity in his Friday afternoon address to push back on demands from progressive Democrats who want to shrink police departments nationwide.\n\n\"We've all agreed, as I've said from the outset, that the answer is not to defund the police,\" Biden said, gesturing to the group of law enforcement officials assembled in the White House Rose Garden.\n\n\"The answer is to fund the police with the resources and training they need to protect our communities,\" he continued. \"Investing in crime prevention and accountable community police officers who walk the beat, who know the neighborhood, and who can restore trust and safety.\"\n\nLocal governments have already used some $10 billion from the federal pandemic aid package to strengthen law enforcement and fund programs that aim to keep neighborhoods safer, senior administration officials told reporters.\n\nThe push comes as Biden tries to show an effort to address concerns about crime during a critical election year for his Democratic Party. Fear about crime and violence in the U.S. touched its highest level since 2016 in April, according to a Gallup poll. Some 53% of Americans now say they worry a \"great deal\" about lawbreaking.\n\nConcerns among city residents have increased the most. More than half, or 58%, of urban respondents now say they worry a \"great deal\" about crime, up 9 percentage points from 2021.\n\nA dramatic rise in gun violence has likely contributed to those polling trends. The firearm homicide rate in 2020 rose to its highest level in a quarter-century, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported Tuesday.\n\nDemocrats are split on how best to ensure safer communities. Progressives have in recent years called to slash police department budgets across the country in the wake of a string of high-profile killings of Black people by white officers.\n\nMore moderate Democrats, including Biden, have said better trained police forces are the key to safer communities. The president wants \"more police officers on the beat for accountable community policing,\" the White House said Friday.\n\nBut Biden added in his afternoon address that he hopes state and local governments will use American Rescue Plan funds to develop programs that help people just released from prison land stable jobs and access drug-treatment and mental health care.\n\nStates and communities need to invest in \"housing, criminal justice reform, reentry support for people coming home after incarceration,\" he said. \"You should be entitled, if you've served your time, to everything from Pell grants to food stamps - the whole deal. To be able to take advantage and [change] your life.\"\n\nThe issue of how to reform police departments promises to play a key role in the 2022 midterm elections that will determine whether Democrats retain control of Congress. Many Republican candidates have found early success in polls through attacks on certain Democrats' plans to gut police funding - which they view as dangerous.\n\n\"President Biden believes that Americans deserve to feel safe no matter where they live,\" the administration said. \"He is committed to using every tool at his disposal to fight violent crime.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

Liz Cheney, R-Wyo., stressed at the start of the hearing that the problems that led to the invasion have not been solved.\n\n\"This threat hasn't gone away. It looms over our democracy like a dark cloud,\" Thompson said.\n\nEarlier Tuesday, Cheney suggested that the investigation might subpoena Trump and House GOP Leader Kevin McCarthy. \"It could,\" Cheney told ABC News. \"The committee will go wherever we need to go to get to the facts.\"\n\nSome of the officers also expressed incredulity at the continuing efforts, including from lawmakers who were present on Jan. 6, to downplay the attack.\n\n\"We were all fighting for our lives to give you guys a chance to go home to your families and escape,\" Capitol Police Sgt. Aquilino Gonell told the lawmakers, \"and now the same people who we helped, the same people who we gave them the borrowed time to get to safety, now they are attacking us, they are attacking our characters.\"\n\nGonell also described being crushed by a group of rioters pushing their way into the building.\n\n\"I could feel myself losing oxygen and recall thinking to myself, 'This is how I'm going to die, defending this entrance,'\" he said.\n\nThe officers spoke after lawmakers on the panel called for more facts and accountability, including from the Trump White House.\n\nInvestigators must figure out \"what happened every minute of that day in the White House - every phone call, every conversation, every meeting leading up to, during and after the attack,\" said Cheney, one of two Republicans on the nine-member panel.\n\n\"Honorable men and women have an obligation to step forward. If those responsible are not held accountable, and if Congress does not act responsibly, this will remain a cancer on our constitutional republic, undermining the peaceful transfer of power at the heart of our democratic system,\" Cheney said.\n\nBefore the mob broke into the Capitol, Trump held a rally outside the White House and heaped pressure on Republicans, including Vice President Mike Pence, to challenge key states' Electoral College results. He exhorted the crowd to march to the Capitol, telling them, \"If you don't fight like hell you're not going to have a country anymore.\"\n\nAs throngs of rioters broke through lines of law enforcement officers and streamed into the Capitol, Trump initially lashed out at Pence on Twitter for refusing to reject electoral votes. Pence \"didn't have the courage to do what should have been done,\" Trump tweeted.\n\nHe later posted a video urging the attempted insurrectionists to go home, adding, \"We love you. You're very special.\"\n\nThe House committee, whose members were all appointed by Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, was created after Senate Republicans voted down an independent, \"9/11-style\" commission to study the invasion.\n\nCheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, both vocal critics of Trump in the wake of Jan. 6, are the only Republicans on the panel. House Republicans voted to strip Cheney of her House leadership role after she refused to stop criticizing Trump for spreading the lie that the 2020 election was rigged to favor President Joe Biden .\n\nMcCarthy submitted five Republicans to be added to the select committee, but withdrew all their names after Pelosi rejected two of his picks. One of those rejects, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, may be a material witness in the probe, Cheney said last week.\n\nIn opening minutes of the hearing, Thompson played a video that spliced together footage from in and around the Capitol during the siege. The video showed rioters attacking police, shooting sprays and throwing objects, breaking windows and other property, threatening lawmakers by name and calling for the election results to be reversed.\n\nSome of the officers looked away from the video as it played.\n\nIn his closing remarks, Dunn likened the insurrectionists to hired killers.\n\n\"If a hitman is hired and he kills somebody, the hitman goes to jail. But not only does the hitman go to jail, but the person who hired them does. It was an attack carried out on Jan. 6 and a hitman sent them. I want you to get to the bottom of that.\"\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Why You Want Cops to Have a Warrior's Mindset\n\nOver the past several years, the term \"warrior\" has been used, labeled, demonized, idolized, and applied to all kinds of professions. These days when someone mentions the word \"warrior,\" typically, it is synonymous with members of the military, sports figures, MMA, UFC, and others. The term \"warrior\" in the law enforcement community has been a taboo title. It went as far as removing the word completely from the culture and replaced with words like \"guardian\" and \"sheepdog.\"\n\nIn the law enforcement community, when the word \"warrior\" was used, it was referred to as a mindset. The warrior mindset. Political correctness demonized it in the profession and associated it as part of the \"militarization\" of police. Across the country, that word was wiped out from any curriculum at police academies. It meant that police officers were too aggressive for modern society, it meant police officers will only use lethal force, it meant police officers will think of themselves as above their fellow man.\n\nThe warrior mindset is far from that. The core beliefs of someone adopting the warrior mindset are discipline, respect, selfless service, honor, courage, and integrity.\n\nA warrior mindset, at a deeper level, helps individuals realize the true enemy is not external forces but the internal. Weakness, fear, jealousy, greed, ego, laziness, and many other negative traits are recognized as the enemy of the warrior mindset. Japanese warrior philosopher Miyamoto Musashi once said: \"If you wish to control others you must control yourself.\" Think about it, Musashi did not mean literally \"control\" people, he was referring to the idea of the \"self.\" To have a warrior mindset is to look inward and defeat those negative traits in our hearts to be an effective officer in the community.\n\nI labeled fear as part of the negative trait. Let me clarify something: To be afraid is only natural. The greatest instinct in any animal, including humans, is self-preservation. Fear of death is an overwhelmingly powerful instinct that causes an enormous amount of panic and fear. To have a warrior mindset means to fight against that fear for the betterment of your fellow man. The warrior fights that impulse to run away from an active shooter, a terrorist, a mass murderer, etc.\n\nA person with a warrior mindset has two extremely powerful traits: Honor and Love. Honor in their profession and love for their fellow man. To have honor in your profession means you dedicate your life to it. Let's be realistic for a moment. Whether being a member of the military or a first responder is a way of life. These professions are not a job. It is a way of life. A military member who dedicates his or her life to their profession demonstrates this in the way they present themselves. This is expressed in the way they shoot, fight, and care for their fellow military members.\n\nLeaders who have that type of mentality are some of the best and strongest leaders in the military. The same goes for first responders. A police officer who looks sharp, acts sharp, and takes their profession seriously is an officer I want responding to emergencies. Not because they \"look good\" in a uniform but because he or she is confident in their abilities to perform the job at hand. I'm not saying they need to be perfect, but they must be there for their fellow American in times of crisis. In the end, that's why we all raised our hands and swore the oath.\n\nThe trait of love has to do with the love of their fellow man. It is the fear of failing their fellow man. I remember responding to a \"man down\" call and when I got there it was a guy who suffered a heart attack. I performed CPR, used an AED, the ambulance arrived, and I did not stop until the paramedics were ready to take over. Love turns to courage, courage, to me, is when you are afraid but push on. When the Boston Marathon bombings happened, what did we all witness on TV? We saw police officers, paramedics, and civilians getting the wounded out of harm's way. Fear was there but courage took over. That instinct to run was pushed aside for their fellow man. That is love.\n\nInevitably, at times, a police officer has to fight. A military member has to go to war. Fighting, to the warrior, is the last resort and everything must be tried in their power to avoid it. When someone with a warrior mindset is put in a spot where they have to act with violence, it will be done with effectiveness, ferociousness, and the fight will end quickly. Ninety-nine percent of police out there do not want to fight or even pull their firearm out of their holsters. They would rather end things peacefully. In the end, everyone gets their day in court. Unlike some other countries where the citizens of that country do not have any rights.\n\nTo have a warrior mindset is to achieve a mental strength that allows someone to take on life's challenges through perseverance and sheer will. Is that so bad? Is that what the fear is? To have police officers have that warrior mindset? To be capable, confident, and disciplined? The officer who adopts a warrior's mindset is not one to fear but one to be admired. That officer has compassion for their fellow man. The officer has traits like honor and love. The officer, when afraid, pushes past that to help their fellow man.\n\nThe word \"warrior\" should not be taboo in the law enforcement community. It should be adopted as a mindset, not as a ruthless fighter. It should be a way of life."

      "text": "Illegal Immigrants Suspected of Beating NYPD Cops Arrested in Arizona\n\nSeveral of the illegal immigrants believed to be involved in the beating of two police officers in New York have been arrested in Phoenix, Arizona, according to an official.\n\nA spokesperson for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sources told The Epoch Times in an emailed statement that, on Feb. 5, special agents from multiple law enforcement agencies arrested four individuals on a bus from El Paso, Texas, on its way to the Greyhound bus station in Phoenix.\n\nMs. O'Keefe added that the four individuals were transferred to the custody of ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) to be processed for immigration violations.\n\nThe identities of the arrested suspects are unclear.\n\nSix individuals were arrested and charged in connection with the Jan. 27 cop-beating near Times Square, but most were released without bail: Yorman Reveron (24), Darwin Andres Gomez-Izquiel (19), Wilson Juarez (21), Kelvin Servita Arocha (19), Jhoan Boada (22), and Yohenry Brito (24).\n\nIt was rumored that four of the suspects skipped town on a bus headed to California: Mr. Gomez-Izquiel, Mr. Arocha, Mr. Juarez, and Mr. Reveron.\n\nThe two officers suffered minor injuries, including facial cuts and body bruises, and were treated at the scene.\n\nInitially, police arrested five men in connection with the incident. Later, two more were taken into custody but the Manhattan District Attorney's Office decided not to charge one of them.\n\nOnly one suspect was ordered held on bail.\n\nNYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell criticized the decision to release four of the suspects without bail, calling it \"reprehensible,\" and saying the \"cowards\" should be in jail.\n\nThose who \"were arrested should be sitting in Rikers right now on bail. They should be indicted this week and taken off our streets.\n\n\"Do you want to know why our cops are getting assaulted? There are no consequences,\" Mr. Chell told reporters during a news conference.\n\nShe said, \"All I know is that an assault on a police officer means that you be sitting in jail.\"\n\nPolice said that they will continue to search for at least eight other people involved in the attack.\n\nNYPD Assistant Commissioner Kaz Daughtry vowed to find the remaining suspects.\n\nThe Manhattan District Attorney's Office said that it didn't request bail for most of the suspects, saying prosecutors were in the process of gathering additional video evidence of the attack.\n\n\"The Police Department has a job to do apprehensions, the prosecutor has a job to prosecute, and the federal government has a job to determine, if a person is here as a migrant and asylum seeker, should determine if they're found guilty and they do their time they should be deported,\" Mr. Adams said during a press conference.\n\n\"You should not be allowed to walk the streets of the City of New York if you are committing any form of criminal behavior that's impacting the quality of life of New Yorkers,\" he added.\n\nMs. Hochul took a similar position during her Feb. 2 press conference, noting that assault on a police officer is among over 100 crimes that can \"lead to deportation,\" adding that she plans on speaking with the Manhattan District Attorney to discuss \"options.\"\n\nIt comes amid a massive influx of illegal immigrants to New York City."

      "text": "Cops, Protesters, and Weeding Out Bad Apples\n\nTo the extent that police work is done rightly, cops are a blessing to society. They often risk their lives to defend the lives and property of citizens who are total strangers to them, and ride to the rescue after a wide variety of natural disasters and accidents.\n\nTheir work exposes them to some of the grimmest aspects of human life-child abuse and neglect, domestic violence, human beings wasted and families destroyed by drug abuse, the tragic carnage of crime, and badly mangled bodies after vehicular crashes and other types of accidents.\n\nIn the course of their work, they sometimes get cursed at, spat upon, attacked, and shot at.\n\nAs for protesters, many of them are as All-American as the best cops are. What could be more American than exercising the First Amendment right \"peaceably to assemble\" and \"to petition the government for a redress of grievances\"? And what could be a greater grievance than the very agency that exists to defend us-government-doing the opposite and stripping citizens of their fundamental rights? Like our country's founders, brave Americans resist the oppression of officialdom and rightly protest encroachments against their unalienable rights.\n\nRegarding bigotry: To argue that all police should be banished because some bad apples have acted with excessive force is just as prejudiced as racist whites who despise all blacks because some blacks have done nasty things. As for being stupid, looters, thieves, arsonists, and other criminals and revolutionaries would like nothing better than to operate in cop-free zones. Is that what peaceful, law-abiding people really want?\n\nThat being said, there definitely are police reforms that should be considered.\n\n1. Screen applicants more thoroughly before hiring them and evaluate them more frequently after they are hired. Beyond the obvious need to weed out those with racist tendencies, beware of loners who couldn't get along with others in school or the alpha male bullies who like to dominate others. Such individuals should never be turned loose on the public with guns and badges.\n\n2. Have more counselors available. The horrors that many police officers see can traumatize and damage them psychologically, causing even basically good and decent cops to lash out in anger and pain.\n\n3. Police unions need to stop protecting bad cops. Protecting the jobs of bad apples is the moral rot at the heart of too many American unions. I saw this decades ago as a janitor for Chrysler. One fellow regularly showed up so drunk or stoned that he slept through his entire shift, yet the company didn't move to fire him because the union would fight it tooth and nail.\n\nWhat unions need to realize is that they're hurting their own members by defending bad apples. The union policy of solidarity without standards led to many of the good men I worked with eventually losing their jobs to more efficient foreign car manufacturers. Unions will best serve their members by adopting a policy of, \"You employers must pay us the highest wages and in return, we will supply the best workers.\" This holds true whether the union represents autoworkers or cops. Stop defending abusive cops and you'll see a marked improvement in police/community relations.\n\n4. End the obnoxious harassment of stopping motorists for \"driving while black.\" For cops to assume the arrogant attitude that they're lords over local fiefs, and they're constantly going to remind black citizens who's boss, is both un-American and immensely counterproductive. Cops exist to serve, not to bully, oppress, or harass. If it looks as though a law has been violated, then police are empowered to act. Since it's not illegal for blacks to drive fine automobiles, cops shouldn't pull over black drivers without just cause-i.e., for a traffic violation or in response to a report from headquarters that a vehicle matching a certain description has been stolen.\n\nTo ensure that cops only detain motorists (black or white) for legitimate reasons, cops should record all their interactions with the public, so that there's clear evidence whether they're being respectful or obnoxious toward civilians. It should be standard operating procedure that a cop who stops a car immediately inform the driver why he/she has been stopped (e.g., illegal turn, speeding, headquarters has reported a similar model as having been stolen, etc.) rather than stopping vehicles because a cop is bored or feeling ornery.\n\nLet's go back to Square One: What's the raison d'être for police? Under the American concept of governance as articulated in the Declaration of Independence and the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution, the sacred rights of individuals-to life, liberty, and property-are primary. The sole legitimate purpose of government is to act as an agent deputed by the principals (the citizens) to assist them in maintaining and protecting those rights.\n\nTwo classes of criminals-common thieves and warped, know-nothing thugs in the thrall of various revolutionary ideologies-piggyback on legitimate protests and use them as a cover for rioting, looting, and destruction. These bad apples make a mockery of protesters' calls for justice by trampling the rights of innocent people, destroying or stealing their property, and sometimes physically attacking people who get in their way.\n\nSo, is there anything that those exercising their First Amendment right to assemble peaceably can do to keep their public protests from providing a pretext and enabling criminal conduct? This is a more difficult problem than police reform, since police forces are relatively small and much is known about each officer, whereas, in large protest crowds, there may be many thousands of protesters, most of whom are total strangers to each other.\n\nOne potential solution might be to organize protest meetings at their city's largest sports stadium. Stadiums have the obvious advantage of keeping potential looters from exploiting the cover of peaceful marchers to prey on innocent businesses in a city's downtown area.\n\nOther advantages of rallying in a stadium include a large capacity so that more protesters could mass together to see each other in larger numbers and to feel the emotional power of their cheers and applause (there's nothing quite like a stadium to amplify the roar of the crowd); a built-in public address system with which speakers could address the crowd; greater ease of media coverage; less stuff for looters to steal; and an improved ability to keep anyone who started behaving destructively from escaping.\n\nOther possible sites less conducive to trashing business districts would be the athletic fields of schools or public parks. Protesters definitely need to find alternatives to the current, crime-ridden format of their protests. That would make the sincerity of their appeals for justice far more credible.\n\nBoth cops and protesters need to find ways to keep their ideals and goals from being spoiled by bad apples in their midst-not only for their own benefit, but for the benefit of us all."

      "text": "Illegal Immigrant Cops Equals Lawbreakers With Guns\n\nAnd, given the broad discretion that police officers are permitted to exercise, \"citizenship bears a rational relationship to the special demands of the particular position, and a State may therefore confine the performance of this important public responsibility to those who are citizens.\"\n\nEver since, the vast majority of states have required that applicants who aspire to become cops possess U.S. citizenship. Those states that didn't mandate citizenship typically limited eligibility to green card holders who intended to apply for naturalization as soon as they became eligible.\n\nUltimately, even lawful permanent residents (the official title for individuals with a green card) are subject to removal from the United States if they violate the terms of the Immigration and Nationality Act. Most Americans aren't comfortable with giving people who aren't full members of our society the authority to arrest citizens-possibly by means of force.\n\nThe Colorado, California, and Illinois laws are particularly troubling because, in all three states, individuals accepted into the Obama administration's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program will be eligible to become police officers. Indeed, the so-called DACA kids seem to be the primary target of these pieces of legislation.\n\nMost of the anti-borders lobby would have the public believe that DACA recipients are \"protected from deportation\" and possess \"lawful work authorization,\" in essence making them the equivalent of green card holders, only steps away from naturalization. In reality, nothing could be further from the truth.\n\nThat has two dire implications. First, any DACA recipients hired as police officers would be committing a felony merely by possessing a firearm. Secondly, the police departments that are employing them would become participants in unlawfully disposing of a firearm to an illegal immigrant.\n\nNow, a casual observer may say, \"Well, those are violations of federal law, but if the federal government doesn't prosecute them, no harm, no foul.\" But the criminal defense bar isn't going to take that stance. Rather, it's likely that any time defense attorneys find that an arrest was effectuated by an illegal immigrant cop, they're going to-quite justifiably-claim that their client was the victim of an assault committed by an illegal immigrant unlawfully in possession of a firearm.\n\nYou can't enforce the laws of the United States when you have no legal right to be here. And you can't engage in the protection of others through the lawful use of deadly force if you have no legal right to possess a firearm. Which is why illegal immigrant cops simply don't make any sense."

      "text": "Victoria's Drug Epidemic Won't Get Better While Cops Negotiate for Higher Pay: Minister\n\nVictoria's Shadow Minister for Police, Brad Battin, believes the state's drug epidemic will not get any better while its policing pay dispute continues to drag on.\n\nThe number of overdose deaths is a critical issue, almost double the state's road toll in 2023, with over 1,000 people dying over the past two years, according to a report released by the Coroners Court last month.\n\nLast year, 547 Victorians lost their lives to drug overdoses, just three less deaths than in 2022.\n\n\"People dying from drug overdoses is a horrific thing, and if we intervene and get in earlier, you'll have better outcomes,\" Battin told The Epoch Times.\n\nOn Nov. 14, more than 400 Victorian police officers walked off the job at the police academy in Glen Waverley due to a mounting dispute with the Allan Labor government.\n\nIn the first strike action in over 20 years, officers held up a large banner that read \"breaking point\" and signs reading \"overworked, undervalued.\"\n\nPolice Association of Victoria Chief Executive Wayne Gatt said the disruption would continue without a satisfactory pay deal from the state government.\n\nThe dispute between the union and the government has been referred to the Fair Work Commission, with Gatt going on the record saying his members felt disrespected.\n\nOn Nov. 14, Gatt led a march down View Mount Rd in Glen Waverley.\n\nIf this stand-off continues, the state's drug crisis will only get worse due to a lack of key police personnel enforcing the law, according to Minister Battin.\n\n\"Specifically around the drug crisis, the biggest thing is the policing of it,\" he said.\n\n\"And at the moment we're struggling with coppers. They're just tied up-they can't get out with stations closed.\n\nIn May, an in-principle agreement was reached with officers for a nine-day fortnight and 16 percent pay rise over four years, but police union members voted against the deal. The force then asked the Fair Work Commission to step in.\n\nTreasurer and Industrial Relations Minister Tim Pallas said the government would try to back up their \"fair and generous\" offer before the commission, which is expected to make a ruling by the end of the year.\n\nIt will be a $95.1 million (US$61 million) investment, with initiatives to reduce drug-induced damage, save lives, and give more people the care they need.\n\nAs part of this package, the government is expanding access to pharmacotherapy in up to 30 locations across Victoria through a $8.4 million grants program. It believes this will allow up to 1,500 more Victorians to access life-changing treatment.\n\nThe government is also trialling 20 Naloxone vending machines alongside existing needle and syringe programs, so this medication can be accessed in life-or-death emergencies. This drug can quickly, but temporarily, reverse an opioid overdose, giving extra time to call an ambulance.\n\nIt is also establishing a new helpline offering anonymous care and advice to those at risk of overdosing.\n\nFurther, its pill testing trial will commence at the start of the 2024-25 festival season, running for 18 months.\n\nA mobile service will begin during this summer's music festival season and will attend up to 10 festivals and events throughout the trial.\n\nPill testing has divided opinion across Victoria, with Shadow Minister for Mental Health Emma Kealy saying it would not stop people from overdosing, or deaths from fatal overdoses.\n\nTim Richardson, parliamentary secretary for mental health and suicide prevention, said pursuing a harm minimisation policy was about safely managing those who wanted to continue taking drugs, despite knowing they would be putting their lives at risk.\n\n\"We hope that children and our kids in the future will not use illicit drugs, but just in the last 12 months one million people have taken cocaine. That is the reality that we are confronting, and one in six Australians have taken illicit drugs,\" he said.\n\nHowever, Battin said more time, money, and resources needed to be set aside for drug prevention and rehabilitation.\n\nHe also added that pill testing would only offer a band-aid solution to a complex and long-term issue.\n\n\"I'm not a big fan of pill testing. I actually think we should be putting money into prevention and rehabilitation,\" he said.\n\n\"That's been stripped from it. There should be more beds available, more in-patient and mental health support.\n\n\"That would make a massive difference.\""

Mam is contracted to Brisbane until the end of 2029.\n\nIn a statement, the Broncos also said Mam would have to complete a safe-driving program, work or study placement, and commit to ongoing wellbeing support.\n\nMam was also fined $850 and had his license suspended for nine months in Brisbane's Magistrate's Court last week, in a punishment that has widely been criticised as too lenient.\n\n\"Whilst we are extremely disappointed that we have been placed in this position, we believe both the NRL and club-imposed penalties adequately reflect the gravity of what's transpired and should act as a deterrent from this type of risky and anti-social behaviour,\" Broncos CEO Dave Donaghy said in a statement.\n\n\"Ezra clearly did the wrong thing, but he has taken responsibility for his actions and shown genuine remorse towards those involved.\n\n\"He understands the impact this has had on everyone around him, and the game.\n\n\"Ezra has taken steps to get his life back on track since this incident and that must continue. We have been very clear about that.\n\n\"We believe the additional measures in place are important and will go hand in hand with integrating Ezra back into the work underway at the Broncos.\"\n\nAAP has also been told Mam will not be able to include the Indigenous All-Stars fixture to his ban, meaning he will not be able to return until Brisbane plays South Sydney in round 10 of 2025.\n\nMam's suspension will likely mean Ben Hunt will partner Adam Reynolds for the first two months of the season at Brisbane, after his move from St George Illawarra.\n\nIt is then possible Hunt could shift to hooker if Mam and Reynolds are fit, allowing him to share dummy-half duties with Billy Walters."

      "text": "New Incentives Look to Attract Cops to Regional Australia\n\nIncentives for police officers to go bush will jump as high as $36,000 (US$24,563) to address recruitment and retention issues in New South Wales (NSW).\n\nWhile police can already receive a one-off payment of $5000 for heading to a remote community, a new model from July will be similar to annual payment allowances for teachers.\n\nPolice in Broken Hill and other remote locations will receive $8000 in their first year and a total of $36,000 over five years.\n\nAdditional incentives will also apply for special remote locations and remote off-shore locations, such as Lord Howe Island and stations with only one or two officers.\n\nThe payments would be beneficial in addressing ongoing issues around recruitment and retention in these important communities, Police Association of NSW president Kevin Morton said.\n\n\"This is about getting police in the right place at the right time,\" he said.\n\n\"Our members operate at the heart of these remote communities and go above and beyond to protect and serve.\n\n\"For too long, police stations in remote areas have struggled to attract police officers. These improved incentives will go a long way to attract officers to serve these rural communities.\"\n\nDeputy Premier and Police Minister Paul Toole and Police Commissioner Karen Webb travelled to Broken Hill to announce the package on Friday.\n\nIt also includes rental housing at some locations, tied to three-per-cent of an officer's annual salary, and reduced mandatory tenure periods at identified locations to allow greater mobility opportunities for officers.\n\n\"We acknowledge that it is currently a very competitive labour market and the NSW Police Force will continue to strive towards providing the best benefits and working conditions possible to nurture and develop our officers,\" Webb said.\n\nToole said the scheme rewarded relocation and retention and gave officers the flexibility to \"invest these incentive payments in what matters to them and their families\"."

      "text": "Last year, Brian Lande, an officer in the Richmond, California police department, had to draw his gun to stop two drunk men from clobbering each other to death with metal rods.\n\nIn 2015, he threatened deadly force to stop a fight between two more drunk men. One was armed with a hatchet. Another, with a wrench.\n\nOn another occasion, he drew his firearm to arrest a man hopping a backyard fence, fleeing the scene of a burglary.\n\nNone of these was remarkable in Richmond, a working-class city just east of San Francisco that's notorious for its drive-by shootings, break-ins, carjackings, and countless petty crimes.\n\nWhen I asked Lande if he often had to unholster his gun-a standard-issue Glock 17-he told me he'd done it so many times that \"they all bleed into each other.\"\n\nLuckily, he's never had to pull the trigger.\n\nBut things could easily have gone south. If a suspect had made a suspicious move or pulled something out of his pocket that looked like a gun-it happens more than you'd think-he would have had less than a quarter of a second to make the most awful decision of his life: whether to kill another human being.\n\n\"You're in an incredibly inauspicious situation,\" Lande told me. \"The chance of making a good faith mistake is high.\"\n\nWhat that means is that if you're a cop, you've got to be confident that if a tragedy occurs-if a life is taken that should not have been taken-your chief, your city council, the powers that be will at least treat you fairly, hear you out, and ensure that justice is served.\n\nBut these days, a growing number of cops aren't so sure of that. Making the wrong decision is now a lot more likely to land you in prison, Lande explained. \"It's not tenable for my family,\" he said. So in early 2022, he started thinking about quitting his dream job.\n\nHe was hardly alone.\n\nA 2021 survey showed that police departments nationwide saw resignations jump by 18 percent-and retirements by 45 percent-over the previous year, with hiring decreasing by five percent. The Los Angeles Police Department has been losing 50 officers a month to retirement, more than the city can replace with recruits. Oakland lost about seven per month in 2021, with the number of officers sinking below the city's legally mandated minimum.\n\nThe list goes on: Chicago has lost more cops than it has in two decades. New Orleans is backfilling its shortfall of officers with civilians. New York is losing more police officers than it has since such figures started being recorded. Minneapolis and Baltimore have similar stories. St. Louis-one of the most dangerous cities in America-has lost so many cops that there's a seven-foot-tall, 10-foot-wide pile of uniforms from outgoing officers at police headquarters called \" Mount Exodus .\"\n\nAnd in San Francisco, just across the bay from Richmond, the police department has seen 50 officers out of a force of fewer than 2,000 take off for smaller, suburban departments, according to Lieutenant Tracy McCray, the head of the city's police union.\n\n\"That was a lot of talent for us,\" McCray said. \"They were great, bright new cops. A couple of them were born and raised in the city.\" These were the kind of officers that advocates for reform say they want more of: cops from the communities they police, black cops, Latino cops. \"All of their roots they had here,\" she said. \"They just up and left.\"\n\nA big part of what's prompting police to leave America's big cities is the perception the public has turned against them. A 2020 poll showed that only seven percent of police officers would advise their kids to go into law enforcement. Eighty-three percent of those who wouldn't recommend it cited \"lack of respect for the profession.\"\n\n\"Suddenly, everyone is telling us how to do our jobs. They're saying we're biased, racist, only want to hurt black and brown communities,\" said McCray, who is black. \"These officers worked in these communities, were invested in these communities. Suddenly, people who don't know us are saying you're this, you're that.\"\n\nIf you appreciate our in-depth reporting on the most important stories in America, become a subscriber:\n\nThe shift in police officers' perception of how they're viewed by the public happened gradually-starting with the first Black Lives Matter protests of 2013, after the shooting death of Travyon Martin and the acquittal of the man who killed him, George Zimmerman. There were more BLM demonstrations: in 2014, following the deaths of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, and Eric Garner in New York. Then came the 2015-2016 Democratic presidential primaries, in which BLM played a prominent role.\n\nAnd then, in late May 2020, George Floyd, a black man, was killed by a white police officer, Derek Chauvin, and it was caught on video. The incident ignited protests across the country -a \"racial reckoning\"-and soon after, reform.\n\nIn some cities, including Portland, Oregon and Columbus, Ohio, local governments set up police review boards with the power to subpoena police records and oversee day-to-day policing. States including Illinois , Minnesota , and Oregon tightened use-of-force standards. New Mexico and Minnesota required officers to intervene if another officer was using what might be deemed unreasonable physical force.\n\nIt became popular-even fashionable-for politicians in progressive circles to flaunt their anti-police credentials. In Minneapolis, where George Floyd was killed, the city council resolved to \"begin the process of ending the Minneapolis Police Department.\" (They reversed course after crime surged.) In New York, after winning the Democratic congressional primary, now-Rep. Jamaal Bowman tweeted : \"Police officers have sworn to protect and serve the institution of white supremacy.\"\n\nA month later, the ACLU tweeted that \"policing is rotten to its core\" and \"has always been a racist institution in the United States.\"\n\nIn Portland, Kristina Narayan-the legislative director for Tina Kotek, who was then Oregon's Speaker of the House and is now the governor-was arrested while participating in anti-police protests at which Molotov cocktails were thrown at the cops.\n\nAll of this revealed a disconnect between progressives and much of the rest of the country, including many Democrats: A 2020 New York Times poll showed that 63 percent of registered voters opposed cutting police budgets while 55 percent of Biden supporters favored it.\n\n\"When I was a cop, we were afraid we might mess up and get in trouble,\" said Peter Moskos, a former Baltimore police officer who teaches at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in New York. \"But you had to do something wrong. Now cops are getting in trouble for doing exactly what they're supposed to do.\"\n\n\"The rules of the game changed,\" said Brian Lande, the Richmond police officer. He was referring to a 2019 California law that further limits when cops can use force-and more broadly, to the shift in thinking among Democratic elites.\n\nLande went on: \"Let's say you see a guy, he's just robbed a bank, he's got a gun, he's running now into the preschool.\" Once upon a time, that would have been enough to justify using force. Now you've got to be confident that a crime is \"imminent\"-and sometimes you have only milliseconds to figure that out.\n\nIf you get it wrong, and if the skin color of the cop and the victim suit the narrative that cops are propping up the institution of white supremacy and wantonly snuffing out black bodies, you could be prosecuted as a murderer.\n\n\"Other people who don't live in your community, but who are speaking on behalf of your community, don't know what the fuck they're talking about,\" McCray told me. \"Black Lives Matter was talking about putting ambassadors on the street-where they at?\" Referring to one of San Francisco's most violent neighborhoods, she added: \"Haven't seen one damn member of Black Lives Matter patrolling the Bayview making sure police aren't 'hunting and killing black people.' \"\n\nLande added: \"If you're a cop, you're like, 'Okay, well, I guess I'm not going to put myself in situations where that's likely to occur.' So I'm not going to go make traffic stops in places and of people that I think might likely be carrying firearms, because I don't want to have to get that decision right. That's too hard.\"\n\nIn Richmond, the politicians were signaling loud and clear: we don't like cops.\n\nAfter the riots in Ferguson, and especially after the murder of George Floyd, the Richmond City Council cut the police budget, forcing hiring freezes. Council members also threatened to slash officers' salaries by 20 percent.\n\nBy last spring, the Richmond Police Department had lost so many officers that those who remained were forced to work overtime 40 to 60 hours per month. That requirement came on top of being forced to work back-to-back shifts when unexpected vacancies opened up. Investigations and traffic enforcement more or less stopped. Burnt-out officers were just doing patrols-driving around passively, waiting for something to happen.\n\nWhen Lande tried to recruit new officers, cops told him they preferred to go somewhere with a friendlier local government, where they wouldn't have to fear getting laid off or having their salaries and benefits reduced. Many went to Napa and Sonoma Counties-wine country.\n\nLast September, Lande followed suit and left Richmond. \"I felt very conflicted about it,\" Lande told me. \"Residents of Richmond are disproportionately poorer, disproportionately victims of violent crimes.\"\n\nLande and I had known each other since our graduate school days, studying sociology at Berkeley. He's one of the most thoughtful and educated-and experienced-cops in the Bay Area. He has published academic papers on how to train the police to interact more effectively with the public. He had studied this question-police-community relations-while on a stint at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which is part of the Pentagon.\n\nBut research hadn't been enough for Lande. \"As an academic sociologist, I learned quickly that my ability to make a difference was pretty limited,\" he said. As a police officer, he went on, \"I could make a difference in people's lives-and I wasn't bad at it.\"\n\nHe loved his job in Richmond. But the calculus of policing had changed.\n\nIn August, as Lande was preparing to leave, Richmond saw four murders in the span of a week. In the same time period, Oakland, to the south, experienced five murders in three days-and the following month, three homicides in a single hour.\n\nLande transferred to Kensington, a 15-minute drive away.\n\nKensington is filled with California craftsman-style bungalows, mid-century ranch houses and Spanish-style villas with Priuses and Teslas out front, and decks with gorgeous views of the San Francisco Bay out back. Black Lives Matters signs are everywhere, reflecting Kensington residents' solidarity with working-class black people in cities like Richmond-even as Richmond has become less safe as a result of the changes that movement has ushered in.\n\nLife is good: Officer Lande is now Sergeant Lande. His job involves far fewer risks. Much of his day is filled with administrative work at the station. When he goes out on patrol, he mostly writes parking tickets.\n\nBut he is not optimistic. \"An enormous amount of damage has been done,\" he told me. \"Instead of seeing real investment in policing, like what we see in Europe, we've seen a massive disinvestment.\"\n\nIn August 2022, President Biden announced his Safer America Plan in response to rising crime . Among other things, it includes plans to hire 100,000 more police officers. That upset the ACLU, which disparaged the plan as \"more criminalization and incarceration,\" and the NAACP Legal Defense Fund, which asserted -without providing evidence-that adding police officers would only victimize black people.\n\nPeter Moskos, the former Baltimore police officer now teaching at John Jay College, was mystified by progressives who insist that the single greatest threat faced by black Americans is systemic racism. \"Congratulations!\" said Moskos, who has called for legalizing drugs in response to the drug war's ineffectiveness and its disproportionate impact on young black men. \"You've increased the black murder rate. You're giving blacks worse policing through this transfer of cops-and doing it smugly in the name of racial justice.\"\n\nLeighton Woodhouse is a journalist and documentary filmmaker in Oakland. His last piece for The Free Press was about the mythical origins of Santa Claus.\n\nwherever progressives pollute an area with their idiotic and unproven 'progress', woe is sure to follow. that is 100% accurate in the united states.\n\nThere are DOJ investigations into departments like Chicago and Baltimore that found routine civil rights violations.  These departments had major issues for years and years but the police omerta blocked any efforts to self correct.  Things came to a head and now the scales have tipped the other way and the police are on their back foot with people questioning every single move they make, no matter how reasonable.\n\nWhat's the lesson?  The lesson is that credible oversight over state power is needed.  That's not some wackadoo liberal agenda, it's a fundamental requirement for just government.  If you don't have that oversight abuses *will* happen and there *will* be a backlash that goes too far.\n\nYou're also seeing innovation in cities like Newark moving back towards community policing.  We're seeing that cracking down hard on crime isn't always the right thing to do - not because it hurts people's feelings but because it doesn't actually work.  That urban departments are losing officers that are amenable to reform is probably the most concerning thing in this story because that is the reasonable solution to the actual issue we're having, rather than some political football everyone likes to toss around.\n\nThere is also the issue that the power of the police is given to them by the citizens they police.  If the community isn't OK with killing someone for selling loosies, then the police can't kill someone for selling loosies.  There is no \"right\" for the police to just do whatever they want.\n\n10 or 15 years ago it was easy to find conservatives concerned about no knock warrants and other questionable police tactics.  Now that the left has taken on this cause (ironic since it is liberal cities which have the biggest problems with police abuse) all the conservatives have decided that the police are paragons of virtue, beyond reproach, and that anything they do is in the best interest of society.  It is no more or less idiotic than the left questioning obviously legitimate uses of force.\n\nLike every issue the truth is in the middle.  Most officers are great people.  Some of them are not.  Where you have people abusing their power that needs to be corrected.  When you have police legitimately using force in the face of wild and dangerous criminals crucifying them is not productive.  Policing strategies which are not having the desired effect need to be reexamined.\n\nIt's all common sense, but America doesn't care about common sense anymore.  They care about being right and creating well defined enemies.\n\nNo posts"

We're seeing that cracking down hard on crime isn't always the right thing to do - not because it hurts people's feelings but because it doesn't actually work.  That urban departments are losing officers that are amenable to reform is probably the most concerning thing in this story because that is the reasonable solution to the actual issue we're having, rather than some political football everyone likes to toss around.\n\nThere is also the issue that the power of the police is given to them by the citizens they police.  If the community isn't OK with killing someone for selling loosies, then the police can't kill someone for selling loosies.  There is no \"right\" for the police to just do whatever they want.\n\n10 or 15 years ago it was easy to find conservatives concerned about no knock warrants and other questionable police tactics.  Now that the left has taken on this cause (ironic since it is liberal cities which have the biggest problems with police abuse) all the conservatives have decided that the police are paragons of virtue, beyond reproach, and that anything they do is in the best interest of society.  It is no more or less idiotic than the left questioning obviously legitimate uses of force.\n\nLike every issue the truth is in the middle.  Most officers are great people.  Some of them are not.  Where you have people abusing their power that needs to be corrected.  When you have police legitimately using force in the face of wild and dangerous criminals crucifying them is not productive.  Policing strategies which are not having the desired effect need to be reexamined.\n\nIt's all common sense, but America doesn't care about common sense anymore.  They care about being right and creating well defined enemies.\n\nAs a former law enforcement officer (I left to further pursue my education), I can confirm that moral is very, very low in the LE community right now. No one feels like anybody has their back, anyone who can retire is retiring, and there are so few new hires that those staying within the profession are being overworked while still being underpaid.\n\nMy dad used to say that if someone is in trouble with the police, they probably did something to deserve the police's attention. In other words, don't break the law and you have nothing to worry about.\n\nI called this years ago. BLM extorts money, funds it's executives, and is NOWHERE in the inner cites. It is just a long line of business cashing in on the white progressive guilt complex while promoting policies that actually make black and brown neighborhoods less safe. My son in-law dreamed of being a police officer  He is young and wanted to have a career in law enforcement.  He served was hired as a sheriffs deputy around 2018.  After only 3 years he quit and left law enforcement due to many of the same policies cited in this article. He stated to me \" I can't risk going to prison for doing my job.  It's just not worth it.\"   And he's right.  As anyone with a modicum of common sense  predicted, Defund the Police was a massive failure. I find it infuriating that mostly white progressives, as well as some black progressives who have sold out their communities,  continue to drive policy that puts black and brown communities at higher risk. Politics today sickens me. There are far too many people in power who play with the lives of others like toys all for their own personal agendas.\n\nYep, the RACE-GRIFTER-INDUSTRIAL-COMPLEX is big business. Christian Parenti, PhD, science historian (an old school socialist that hates identity-politics and \"race essentialism\"), estimated that the \"diversity\" grifter business is worth about $1 billion.\n\nFair to conclude that within the universe of 10 million arrests a year, you will find much that goes the way it should and times when things go really badly... The benefit of being a spectator looking over things from hindsight.  We are quite fond of twisting ourselves into a Gordian knot as a matter of a public debate.  Gnashing our teeth and emotional wailing day after day while the situation continues to deteriorate because a bunch of agenda-driven \"reformers\" are anchored to the idea that the entire system of policing is morally bankrupt and irredeemable.  Maybe we reach the \"enough is enough\" and calmer voices prevail but something inside of me says \"this time it's different.\"   I'm trying to imagine what person would willingly decide to be a sacrificial lamb for the sake of those loud mouths whose agenda is \"defund the police\" and who are supported by corporate media parrots and virtue signaling suburbanites eager to metaphorically \"stand with\" the ones on the receiving end of the violence because \"they care so much... hugs everyone.\"\n\nAs much as want to agree with the article 100% I cannot. How the narrative of split-second decision explains shooting the man which passed out being tazed 7 times or shooting in the back of the man sitting on his back. How this narrative explains the 2 years long review of the 15 sec incident (Chicago). How this narrative explains that body cameras were suddenly not working or even not worn? We know-every profession attracts certain types of people. We realize the police is as it should attract certain type, more aggressive than average. But more aggressive does not mean more violent or dismissive. I witnessed officer hitting man in the face broking his nose because officer in the traffic directing event showed him the exit, which would take him on the 30 minutes loop and man sked his permission to go to another exit (NY). The problem with police is not that they make mistakes, but they provide cover for wrongdoing and hence the public reaction to their questionable actions. The ideology involvement, which is reprehensible, uses the loss of public trust to advance ideologists personal interests. Some courages and honest police officers admitted this much: excesses and cover up\n\nSo, your assertion is that police professionals can never be bad a small percentage of the time?\n\nGet rid of the cops and let crime explode?\n\nDo you want to ban airlines because a few planes crash due to pilot error every once in a while???\n\nI do not know what to attribute your response to: insufficient comprehension, bias, demagogical twisting of the meaning I expressed in my comment or regular left/right narcissistic habit of dismissive attitude? yea left and right are the same i this posturing.\n\nIn Philadelphia the gand of about 10 detectives and street cops was robbing small shops, arresting people on the false accusations and fabricated evidence for years until they run into the son of Illinois senator, which triggered the real investigation. Will you tell me this was bad a small percentage of time? Do you believe that district officers, which were honest people and good cops in their own capacity did not suspect or even new about this? Did not hear store owners complaining? It is absolutely impossible. But, as many honest cops and some others, which quite because could not condone this code and live with it themselves confirmed the existence of the code which permeated police force-blue cover for blue.\n\nwhat you \"expressed\" was mental sewage. incoherent blather.\n\ndo you get drunk before posting comments on social media?\n\nIt should go without saying that we need a professional police force that operates as a dispassionate agent of our just (as much as possible) court, to enforce our laws.\n\nRabbi Chanina, deputy of the High Priests (1st Century, Galilee, Israel), said: Pray for the welfare of the kingdom, for were it not for the fear of it [the government and its agents], a man would swallow his fellow alive.  (Perkei Avos 3:2)\n\nWhile civil order depends up on just courts and competent agents of the court, such as police and municipal authorities, the most foundation civilizing prerequisite rests with citizens themselves -- we valid, truthful witnesses in court.\n\nI'll assume here that you are talking about someone on television. I can't watch. It makes me feel like I've spent all weekend feeding my brain a combination of cocaine, vodka, mdma and just smoked two joints and bong so I can sleep. I only read.\n\nQuestion: What are the rates of private firearms ownership, for personal and home defense, in the areas mentioned in this article? Another question: What are the numbers of dgu (defensive gun usage) in these areas? In general, another: Do these areas' representatives, up to the state level, trust their constituents to rightfully defend themselves?\n\nThank you for this thoughtful reflection, The FP.\n\nI'm a tenth grade drop out with more ability to recognize patterns, notice inconsistencies, determine if arguments makes logical sense and put forward intellectually consistent arguments than most folks who do journalism these days. I did spend half a decade in production management at a huge newspaper company. Fortunately I didn't catch whatever the people in the newsroom are infected with.\n\nPlease send Officer Lande to North Carolina!\n\nThis is such a great article. As a former cop, now military, I started writing on this topic last year and it's great to see how people with larger reach are starting to tackle this and talk about it with data. I wrote this article in early December, and it amazes me how not only is the data on who is being impacted by the crime wave so disturbing, but also the lack of knowledge of the tools police have to try to stop it. If you're interested from a former cop's point of view, backed with data, please take a look. I am working on another on why so many shootings are occurring in certain areas as well.\n\nhttps://longtermtraining.substack.com/p/violent-crime-is-still-rising-why\n\nIf you don't already know about it, you might find this interesting:\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jay_Wright_Forrester#Counterintuitive_Behavior_of_Social_Systems\n\nCounterintuitive Behavior of Social Systems is a 1971 paper by Jay Wright Forrester.\n\nexcerpt:\n\n...\n\nForrester characterizes normal debate and discussion as being dominated by inexact mental models ...\n\nThe paper summarizes the results of a previous study on the system dynamics governing economic dynamics in urban centers, which showed \"how industry, housing, and people interact with each other as a city grows and decays.\" The study's findings, presented more fully in Forrester's 1969 book Urban Dynamics, suggest that the root cause of depressed economic conditions is a significant shortage of job opportunities relative to the population level, and that the most popular solutions proposed at the time (e.g. an increase in the amount of low-income housing available, or a reduction in real estate taxes) counter-intuitively serve to make the situation worse by increasing the population but not the availability of jobs, so that the relative shortage increases. The paper further suggests that measures to reduce the shortage -- such as the conversion of land use from housing to industry, or an increase in real estate taxes to spur redevelopment of property -- would counter-intuitively create the result desired when enacting the failed policies.\n\n...\n\nI did not know about this and thank you.  Looks very interesting.\n\nWeird. Cops who worry they'll get jammed up on a criminal charge for doing their jobs are leaving the force in droves.\n\nBiggest loser; low end of the economic spectrum neighborhoods.\n\nWe get the government we deserve.\n\nWhen relevant, the media also doesn't talk about the number of victims of police shootings who are NOT black and how these incidents actually outnumber the others, it's not \"newsworthy.\" More importantly, it doesn't support the national \"racism\" narrative that many people, groups, institutions, the government (?) feed on to further victimize the communities that actually do need policing.\n\nTell a police officer you appreciate their service when you see one, I mean, only if you feel that way. I've seen some faces truly light up.\n\nSo grateful I live in VA and not NY or CA or Oregon or Washington etc.\n\nI feel for all those poor black families. BLM really screwed them.\n\nWhat is funny is I remember back in the day when black activists were fighting to get cops into their neighborhoods and fighting to increase incarceration for drug and violent offenders. They had to fight tooth and nail to get those resources and commitments.\n\nWell, eventually the crime will spread and it will start permeating the upper middle class, liberal bubbles. Violent crime will start hurting the very people that have been pushing for vilifying cops and no bail etc. When that happens, they will first blame the remaining cops. Then, when the cops keep leaving and the crime keeps happening and they no longer feel safe, they will start screaming for more enforcement and more police resources because they are now afraid. Then, it will take decades to rebuild what they destroyed in just a couple of years.\n\nHence the reason, that even though I live in a relatively small town with a good police department that responds pretty quickly, I keep a gun by my bed and two more in the closet.\n\nNever wanted to carry a pistol, just seemed uncomfortable and largely unnecessary and risky. Now? I am applying for my permit and looking for a carry gun. Thank GOD I live in a \"shall issue\" state."

      "text": "'We were hated. We were literally hated overnight.'\n\nThe level of disrespectful behavior that the Mayor, City Attornies and the press displayed in Seattle is unbelievable. Since when is it ok to let one person throw bricks at another's head in the middle of a City Street. It's not. Left or right it doesn't matter, bad behavior is bad behavior and it should have consequences.\n\nexcellent piece of reporting         cuts throuigh the Seattle miasma\n\nIn Philly, we had newly installed Police Commissioner Outlaw (a black women recruited from Seattle)  who allowed rioters to march and burn one of our most important commercial blocks ( recently revived) Walnut St off Rittenhouse Square. The cubby \"Etsy Bomber\" who attacked police cars with petro bombs was sadly made a hero in The Philadelphia Inquirer ( failing rag supported by NGO's) while working class people protecting Kensington and The Columbus Statue (south Philly) with bats were derided as KKK and Nazis.  I have no love for Philly Cops who are rude, profane, and corrupt but the violence had nothing to do with cops but more to do with West Philly Anarchists (with a small A... remember Move? ) who blame their plight on \"The System\" or Racism ....... the city has been run by Blacks since Mayor Street was elected many many decades ago. FAIL\n\n👍🏻Yip got you now!\n\nYou know, I have to say that my sympathy for the plight of Seattle's residents is tempered by the thought that they elected the people who destroyed their city. The price of progressive governance is high but they volunteered with their votes to pay it.\n\nIt's typical of the corrupt lefties who run so many American cities that they crap all over the people who do the dirty work for them, and I don't blame all those Seattle police officers who got fed up and quit.\n\nA note on Seattle's mayor, Jenny Durkan...\n\nDurkan was elected the 56th mayor of Seattle in 2017, becoming the city's first female mayor since the 1920s and its second openly LGBT elected mayor. She and her partner, Dana Garvey, have two sons. Garvey is the daughter of a Louisiana telecom magnate who sold his wireless telecommunications firm for $400 million.\n\nCarmen Best and Christopher Young were destroyed by the very ideology they promoted.\n\nI hope they learn from it, but I doubt any progressive will learn from what they have done to our cities.\n\nGod bless you Robert and God Bless America you only have to watch our southern border to realize everybody wants to be in America and I was thinking after I offered the ticket if Detective Young actually existed or he perhaps was a bot just out there to rile The BW community\n\nThis has been a long time coming and the police themselves are to blame. I am a 48yo white male. I am a veteran. I live in North East Ohio. I am skilled labor tradesman and have worked my whole life. I have NEVER in my life had a positive interaction with the police. Zero. And I'm not some drinking and driving misbehavor either. I've had my car broken into, had my car hit in a parking lot, you name it. Every time I have called the police it's always \"sorry, we can't help you\". Try and travel during a major holiday and they are out in full force pulling you over for going 5 over the limit just to extort money out of you. Pulling you over claiming you \"rolled a stop sign\" just to ask if they can search your car. I could go on and on and on. I do feel bad for the business owners who have suffered because of the violence directed towards them but if it were me I would stand guard at my own store with a shotgun. This still is America and we have the right to protect what's ours.\n\nAs far as there being a difference between how \"the East coast and West coast\" LEO is trained...Eric Garner would disagree.\n\nWe left Seattle for Georgia in 2015. In-laws left Seattle for Dallas in 2018. My SIL and her family left Seattle for Nashville in 2021. She witnessed so much of this BS. And I used to work at that Nordstrom that got destroyed one summer during college. All of it makes me so mad. A beautiful city being run by insane people and insane policies.\n\nIs anyone seriously working on 2024? I'd love to be a part of getting a Murkowski or Manchin (yes, they both have baggage-I'm just throwing out names) or somebody with broad popular appeal AND some political seriousness...AND a chance to win. And, no, it can't be Elion Musk (that's kind of a joke since he's not native-born) or some other out-of-the-blue non-politician (had enough of last one).\n\nThanks for this.  The media and the Democrat party united in unison to promote this insanity in the summer of 2020.  It was far more deadly and destructive nation wide than anything that happened on January 6th.\n\nI think it's important to point out that none of the Scandinavian states are socialist anymore.\n\nThank you. Instead of a Utopia, Seattle became a Dystopia.\n\nWe have the worst of both worlds now: A Democratic Party under the thumb of woke progressives, and a Republican Party under the spell of Trump crazies. Third party, anyone?\n\nGod yes.  BTW little 'ol perpetually blue Oregon has an independent candidate for governor that might actually, possibly, succeed against the progressive machine and do so without tying her wagon to the crazies.  We shall see...\n\nYeah, I'm hoping for third party, or one party (or both) coming to their senses.  Granted, latter may not be likely.\n\nEvan McMullin is an independent running for Senate in Utah.  It's uphill, but he just got backing of Democratic party on account-a they knew they'd never win on their own.  WSS...\n\nSocialism/Communism/Marxism always heads for the Big Stupid, like a cruise missile. And like the missile leaves destruction in its wake."

      "text": "This February, Bruce Harrell, newly installed as mayor of Seattle, made it official: His city is in decline. \"The truth is the status quo is unacceptable,\" Harrell said in his first state of the city address. \"It seems like every day I hear stories of longtime small businesses closing their doors for good or leaving our city.\"\n\nBut it's not just small businesses.\n\nMuch of Seattle's core looks like a pockmarked ghost town. Storefronts on both sides of Third Avenue, a major thoroughfare, are boarded up. Blocks from the Four Seasons hotel and the Fairmont Hotel, tents crowd the sidewalks, and drug users sit under awnings holding pieces of foil over lighter flames. Traffic enforcement is minimal to nonexistent. In mid-March, Amazon announced that it was abandoning a 312,000-square-foot office space in downtown, citing concerns over crime.\n\nThat such woes should afflict one of the richest cities in the country-Seattle has a median household income of over $100,000-cannot be blamed on economic decline.  The year 2020 saw a 68% spike in homicides, the highest number in 26 years, and the year 2021 saw a 40% surge in 911 calls for shots fired and a 100% surge in drive-by shootings. Petty crime plagues every neighborhood of the city, and downtown businesses have paid hundreds of thousands of dollars to fund their own security.\n\nWhat happened to Seattle? The answer, of course, depends on your politics.\n\nIn the news section of the Seattle Times , for instance, a reader is unlikely to see any consideration of a link between policing and public safety. \"No single cause for 2021's surge in gunfire in Seattle,\" declared a typical recent headline over an article that points only to possibilities such as the pandemic or an unlucky cycle of \"retaliatory violence.\" But the majority view in Seattle appears to have shifted away from sympathy to ideas like \"defund the police\" and toward a recognition that hostility to law enforcement has been a major factor in the deterioration of the city.\n\nWhat follows is a cop's-eye view of Seattle's undoing.\n\nOn Monday, May 25, 2020, in Minneapolis, George Floyd died after police officer Derek Chauvin pinned Floyd face-down on the pavement with a knee to Floyd's neck for over eight minutes. Video footage of the incident circulated around the world in the days that followed. One of those to watch it was T.J. San Miguel, a canine handler who had moved from the Big Island of Hawaii to join the Seattle police in 2008. \"I thought it was disgusting,\" she says of Chauvin's actions. \"You don't do that to somebody. That's just basic fucking stuff that we knew and learned and had trained on for years and years. It became pretty apparent that there's a big difference in training and tactics and procedures in the West Coast versus East Coast and other places.\"\n\nThe knee to the neck also surprised J.D. Smith, a Marine veteran of the first Gulf War and a Seattle police officer since 1998. Smith had spent years pursuing drug dealers, killers, and pimps and had subdued a lot of people. \"That's not even a proper technique,\" says Smith. \"We put a knee in between the shoulder blades, and it never chokes anybody out.\"\n\nMatthew Kruse, a young patrol officer who had joined the force in 2018, was struck that a handcuffed man would fail to get immediate medical care. \"Especially in Seattle, we really emphasize once they're in handcuffs and they're under control you turn to the medical attention,\" he says. \"It's kind of ingrained, but it's also just doing the right thing. Do you need something? Do you want to get checked out by medical? If I have water on me, 'Do you want some water?'\"\n\nBut any potential differences between the police in Seattle and those in other places mattered little to the mood of the city in the late spring of 2020. Protests spread from Minneapolis across the country, and the first large-scale demonstrations took shape on Friday night, May 29, in Seattle's Chinatown district. Kruse was among the cops standing guard. \"For the first three hours, I was just having a conversation with people.\" After 10 o'clock, though, he says the mood shifted. \"People were throwing stuff,\" Kruse says. \"They were starting to shine flashlights in our face.\"\n\nOn Saturday, the crowds grew destructive. Groups of protesters shattered windows up and down the retail corridors of downtown and emptied many of the stores of their merchandise. Some torched police cruisers parked outside of Nordstrom's flagship store at Pine Street and 6th Avenue. Protesters also pulled firearms, including M4 rifles, out of the abandoned vehicles. Mike Magan, a robbery detective who had been on the force for over three decades, was home that evening, watching the mayhem on the news. \"I was beside myself,\" he says. He recognized the abandoned van of a co-worker, whom he phoned. The colleague, a forensics video specialist, answered in a whisper and said that he and other colleagues were taking shelter in the Nordstrom's and videotaping what they could of the violence outside.\n\nThe following morning, Magan got called into the office to start investigations of 30 to 40 people who'd been arrested for crimes such as trespass, burglary and property destruction. Five or six hours in, he began to suspect they'd given the police false names. But there was no point looking into it further. \"We found out they'd all been released from custody prior to even being questioned,\" he says.\n\nThe bedlam in Seattle caused police leaders to institute a so-called \"blue/gold\" schedule, meaning that officers had to work 12-hour shifts up to seven days a week. Christopher Young, a detective in the investigative support unit (previously named the criminal intelligence unit), who has been on the force since 1994 and never experienced such a schedule, calls June 2020 \"the most stressful month of my life.\" Young found himself working 16-hour days for weeks straight. \"Even our homicide detectives were sitting at their desks working their cases in battle dress uniforms with their helmets ready to run outside to protect their own office building,\" he says.\n\nOf the hundreds of businesses that reported being damaged or looted over that weekend, Nordstrom was the most prominent. There had been an attempt by someone to set it aflame. On June 1, Mike Magan and a colleague from the Seattle bomb unit entered the site to look for possible video footage. The first floor, he says, was destroyed. \"All the jewelry cases had been smashed,\" he says. \"All the cosmetics were gone. All the makeup was gone. Shoes were gone-bags. Everything.\" As for tracking down the looters, that wasn't on the agenda. \"We were told: you will not investigate any of those things,\" Magan says. \"The city attorney wouldn't file charges on them.\"\n\nThat night, Magan, who had been out of uniform for decades, had to don riot gear to guard the East Precinct on Capitol Hill. Demonstrations began peacefully but changed after dark. \"We were getting pelted with bricks, rocks, frozen water bottles,\" says Magan. \"There were shots fired. Here I am, 33 or 34 years on the department, and I'm like, 'Why am I on the front line here?'\"\n\nThe long shifts exhausted everyone, including the younger officers. Matthew Kruse was working from 7 PM to 7 AM, mostly on his feet, and if he was out on patrol he had to have riot gear with him in the car in case he was needed for crowd control. Once a week or every two weeks, he'd get a day off and spend it all sleeping. \"Some nights I slept at the police station,\" he says. \"And I remember at least a couple of times I just slept in my car, because I was like, if I try to drive home I'm going to kill myself or someone else.\"\n\nJ.D. Smith, stationed at the West Precinct near the turmoil, was spared a direct confrontation with the violence that May and June. His job at the time was to process online crime reports, which were now rolling in faster than ever. But he could see the toll being taken on his coworkers when they returned to the station from the protest sites day after day. \"The looks on their faces-it just reminded me of the Gulf War,\" he says.\n\nWhen the protests grew violent, police officers began to use various non-lethal weapons to control the crowd, including pepper spray and tear gas. This led to complaints, lawsuits, and stinging condemnation in the local press. On June 5, Seattle's mayor, Jenny Durkan, declared that officers \"do not need to be using tear gas at protests as a crowd management tool\" and banned the use of it for 30 days. Many officers felt they were being asked to maintain order in violent crowds while surrendering all of their crowd-control tools. \"People were throwing bottles and rocks, and we had to split this thing up. God forbid after multiple, multiple, multiple warnings that we're gonna throw gas, guys, you better disperse, we throw gas,\" says J.D. Smith. \"So then what? Oh, Seattle PD, look how heavy-handed they are.\"\n\nPrior to the summer of 2020, the department had been receiving encouraging communications from the mayor's office, and, in the spring, city officials had filed a motion asking the federal government to lift a consent decree that had been imposed on the Seattle police in 2012 over concerns about use of force and biased policing. In 2016, Barack Obama had even invited the department's then-chief, Kathleen O'Toole, to the State of the Union, and a federal judge had ruled in 2018 that the city was in \"full and effective compliance\" with the decree.\n\nBut Mayor Jenny Durkan announced on June 3 that the city would no longer seek to lift the consent decree, and she offered no encouragement to a police force that was being stretched to the brink.  Seattle City Council member Teresa Mosqueda vowed to lead an \"inquest\" into the budget of the Seattle police and said she wanted to cut funding by half, a view echoed by fellow council members Tammy Morales and Kshama Sawant. City Council president Lorena Gonzáles blamed the police response to the protests for turning \"our densest neighborhoods\" into a \"complete war zone\".\n\n\"In May of 2020, our political leadership considered us a necessary evil,\" says Young, the detective. \"In June of 2020, they started to think that we were an unnecessary evil. Every cultural institution in the city turned on the police.\"\n\nThat included educational institutions. In early June, Young, as a parent of children in Seattle Public Schools, was one of thousands of recipients of an email from school superintendent Denise Juneau announcing that cooperation with the police would be suspended in light of \"the perpetuation of systemic racism, the murders of Black people by police officers across our country, [and] the violence displayed by some law enforcement officers here in Seattle.\"\n\nThat perspective was palpable on the streets, too. T.J. San Miguel would hear jeers out of open windows on Capitol Hill. \"You have people in an apartment several stories high just yelling and screaming at you as you're out there walking down the block,\" she says. In one case, a crime victim had called for police help, only to start showering the responding officers with anti-cop abuse when they arrived. \"It was very shocking,\" she says. \"And it's just like, 'Okay, bye, have a nice night.'\"\n\n\"We were hated,\" says J.D. Smith. \"We were literally hated overnight.\"\n\nOn Sunday,  June 8, Matthew Kruse and coworkers from the North Precinct got an order to go down and help back up their colleagues in the East Precinct on Capitol Hill. A large protest was expected that day, and the plan, he says, was to let crowds march past the precinct unimpeded, unless there was criminal activity, and Kruse and his colleagues were stationed a couple of blocks away, watching the area on camera. No one was trying to break into the precinct, says Kruse, but people started to pitch tents near it. At that point, according to Kruse, a police captain went over to talk to the protesters. \"He started talking to protesters and telling them, hey, you guys have got to move along, and they got in a verbal altercation,\" says Kruse. \"Then they [senior officers] came back to us and said we're just going to let them stay there and do their thing.\" The East Precinct, already boarded up, was now abandoned.\n\nNews of the surrender of the East Precinct hit cops hard. \"I just felt sick,\" says Young. \"It was humiliating.\" Kruse found the about-face on holding the fort versus leaving it insulting. \"At first they had said: no, we're not going to let them take the precinct,\" says Kruse. \"The next day it's being cleared out.\" J.D. Smith was incredulous. \"I'm still embarrassed,\" Smith says. \"We gave away a precinct.\"\n\nWhat followed for the next few weeks was an impromptu test site for improvised maintenance of public order in what came to be called the Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone, or CHAZ. The New York Times described it as \"an experiment in life without the police-part street festival, part commune.\" Donald Trump weighed in from the Oval Office to condemn it. \"Domestic Terrorists have taken over Seattle,\" he tweeted. Seattle's mayor, Jenny Durkan, responded, \"It's not terrorism. It's patriotism.\" Asked by CNN's Chris Cuomo how long the CHAZ would last, Durkan quipped, \"I don't know. We could have the summer of love.\"\n\nThat is not what the Seattle police saw. \"All these businesses are failing and they're asking for help,\" recalls J.D. Smith of the stores and cafés in the CHAZ. \"There is nothing, and I mean zero, we can do because the mayor is saying summer of love.\" Christopher Young says that officers received an email instructing them not to enter the six-block zone of the CHAZ, although he made his way into the off-limits area after some unsuccessful arson attempts against the precinct building. \"I was sent with a fancy camera to take pictures of the crime scene of where they tried to burn it down,\" says Young. \"You had to go by a checkpoint with guards, and God knows what they'd do with me if they found out I was a cop. I had to basically go undercover to sneak in and look at my own precinct.\"\n\nCHAZ lasted until Wednesday, July 1, when officers reclaimed the precinct. During those 23 days, a 17-year-old was shot in the arm on June 21; a 30-year-old male was shot and wounded on June 23; and two black teenagers, 14 and 16, were shot and wounded on June 29 as they drove into the zone. The older of the two, Antonio Mays Jr., died of his wounds. Witnesses have stated that members of CHAZ security were the ones who opened fire on them, but police have never tracked down the responsible parties.The damage to the area was so great that small businesses in the area filed a class-action lawsuit against the City of Seattle for its neglect.\n\nDespite it all, the city continued to be racked by protest and strife throughout July, with further vandalism and looting on Capitol Hill by a subset of the protesters, few of whom ever faced charges. City officials continued to direct their ire toward the police department instead, and on August 10 the Seattle City Council voted to cut the pay of senior police staff, including Chief Carmen Best, who enjoyed widespread respect from officers on the force, including all of those interviewed for this article. \"It was demoralizing,\" says Christopher Young. \"She was a great chief and a very progressive leader who happens to be black. But she still got run out of town on a rail because she wouldn't agree that her department needed to be abolished.\"\n\nCarmen Best immediately announced her resignation. At that time, T.J. San Miguel, who calls Best \"excellent, just excellent,\" was already looking for an exit. \"I realized I could do everything completely right, and if the optics aren't good, then they're going to hang me out to dry,\" she says. \"Once I came to that realization, it was like a bad breakup where you just shut somebody off.\" San Miguel left the force when Best did.\n\nA change in public safety began to be noticeable across the city, not just in protest zones. Seattle's city attorney, Pete Holmes, and King County's prosecuting attorney, Dan Satterberg, had always taken a lenient approach to so-called quality-of-life crimes, but after June 2020 they began to ease up across the board toward a range of other offenses. Matthew Kruse said that storeowners would call the police about shoplifters, not realizing that prosecutions of that offense had effectively ceased. On one occasion Kruse and his partner watched a man walk into a store, shoplift about $20 in goods, and walk out. \"He was like, 'What are you guys going to do-arrest me?'\" says Kruse. \"And we knew we weren't going to arrest him, because with any misdemeanor stuff, we had to go through the prosecutor, and stuff like that wasn't going to get prosecuted. You could I.D. the suspect and could get a full confession, and they were going be like, 'We're not gonna take it.'\"\n\nWith an incentive structure that made officers feel they had little to gain and much to lose from taking the initiative on crime prevention, cops began a dramatic-and some would say resentful-pullback in enforcement. Patrol officers no longer drove or walked about looking for suspicious behavior like someone climbing a fence, but stayed put and responded after the fact. Mike Magan said that one of his colleagues got investigated and punished for responding to a call of shots fired without logging into his computer first. \"It was like we were biting our own necks, and you began to see that a lot of these officers would go park their cars at certain locations and not go out and patrol,\" he says. \"You could track the cars and you could see that these officers were parking in parking garages.\"\n\nKruse wanted to keep patrolling, even if it was in a more low-key way, but one day his supervisor advised him to avoid it. \"I was told straight to my face: don't leave the precinct unless you're going to a call,\" Kruse recalls. \"He says: I'm looking out for you, still fresh in your career. I don't want you to get in trouble for doing the right thing.\" Kruse quit in October of 2020, later taking a police job in Lynnwood, a suburb about 16 miles north of Seattle. The following month, the city council voted to cut the budget of the department by 20%.\n\nFor Mike Magan, the pullback in enforcement spread even to his fellow detectives, causing him to hit breaking point. \"One of the robbery squads just decided they weren't going to work anymore,\" he says. \"They wouldn't leave the office, they wouldn't help you on search warrants, they wouldn't come out and conduct interviews with you. They wouldn't come out and track video. It was heartbreaking.\" Magan couldn't stand it and decided to retire early.\n\nAn exodus of officers led to a manpower shortage that prompted J.D. Smith to quit as well. As someone whose interactions with the public were mostly online at this point in his career, Smith was relatively cushioned from classic hazards of the job. The severe shortage of officers, however, made him certain that he'd be put back into uniform and on street patrol, which he believed spelled trouble for someone out of practice. \"It's tough even when you're out there every day,\" he says. \"But you take somebody who has been off the streets for 10 years-they're rusty.\" Returning to the work of chasing down violent criminals in a time of hostile public scrutiny seemed untenable. Smith picked April Fool's Day of 2021 as his date of retirement.\n\nThe departing officers left a severely diminished department. Even before the unrest of 2020, the number of officers in the Seattle Police Department was low by the standard of other cities. With about 1,400 police officers in 2019, or 18.5 officers for every 10,000 residents, policing in Seattle could never be as comprehensive as in New York City, where the ratio is 43.6 officers for every 10,000 residents, or Washington, D.C. where it is 54 per 10,000. But with 186 departures in 2020, nearly three times the annual average, and another 150 or so in 2021, Seattle started 2022 with well under 1,000 deployable officers department-wide.\n\n\"I loved going to work every day, and I had a fantastic career,\" says Mike Magan. \"It's a beautiful city, but I watched it go from really good to really bad.\"\n\n\"The mayor and the city council were telling us, basically, that we're the bad guy,\" says J.D. Smith. \"The truth is 99% plus of us are amazing people that are only there for the reason that I was there: I don't like people in fear, and I don't like people in pain.\"\n\n\"I'm actually a left-wing guy on just about every issue,\" says Christopher Young. \"I want the United States to be a Scandinavian-style welfare state. So I'm very sympathetic to people's concerns.\" Forming a complementary department of 100 people comprising community service officers, social workers and others who could do the sort of enforcement that doesn't require a gun would have been a worthy experiment, Young feels. \"But they didn't do that,\" he says. \"They just demonized the police and chased good people out of town.\"\n\nA version of this piece originally appeared in UnHerd . You can follow T.A. Frank on Twitter @TAFrank .\n\nThe level of disrespectful behavior that the Mayor, City Attornies and the press displayed in Seattle is unbelievable. Since when is it ok to let one person throw bricks at another's head in the middle of a City Street. It's not. Left or right it doesn't matter, bad behavior is bad behavior and it should have consequences.\n\nexcellent piece of reporting         cuts throuigh the Seattle miasma\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "Critics say cops aren't enforcing the law fairly. Cops say they are scared to.\n\nMaybe this is mostly just in London? There's a lot more to the U.K. than London. I lived in rural Leicestershire for a while, and got to know a lot of indigenous English people. You know, the original Anglos.  Everyone respected the police - despite the fact that they're mostly all unarmed - and more importantly, most people bought into the big social contract idea.  Example: one week there was a highly unusual snowfall, which closed schools and stalled traffic everyone.  The police issued a bulletin reminding everyone that \"snowballing is an anti-social behavior which can result in injury.\"  And another big difference in the U.K. - poor whites are at the bottom of the social hierarchy, and have always borne the brunt of police scrutiny.\n\nI am an Anglophile they gave us C. S. Lewis, George Orwell, J.R.R. Tolkien and now this??\n\nWe are always talking about China as the biggest \"threat\", or alternatively \"Russia\". To me, by far the biggest threat is Islam, which in its current form is not a religion but a hostile totalitarian political system bent on taking over the West, including America.\n\nHow difficult is it to identify the protest leaders, wait a couple of days, and then knock on their doors? Aren't there closed-circuit television cameras on every street corner in London?\n\nBritish leadership (like American leadership) is in the toilet. Time to flush.  That the coppers can arrest people for making understandably annoyed commentary about Islamic hate mobs and ignore the true villains shows that the woke rot infecting U.S. universities and other institutions has captured the British police.  Stand up, lads and lassies, and take back your country!\n\nWalk down the streets of London. The populace and the police force ARE  Muslim, why do you expect them to act contrary to the religion?\n\nThis how it starts , grassroots radicalisms , get the local police on board ,then it starts to get easier to put your agenda forward\n\nThe intense focus on the pro Palestinian protests while completely ignoring the 6000! people killed by Israel in retaliation does not give  the TPF the right to claim unbiased reporting. Utterly shameful.\n\nIn general, I love the police, as an entity, but I have to conclude, the current crop of police, in America and Europe, are becoming p-----s.\n\nThis reminds me of a book I read years ago called America Alone by Mark Steyn. If I remember correctly he basically foretold all this happening due to Muslim birth rates and having them spread themselves across the globe.\n\nWestern countries need \"Muslim bans\". Many of these people (not all, etc.) are just too horrible to assimilate in large quantities. It's so sad to see the things they can ruin.\n\nAnd.....they fired Suella Braverman.\n\nBritain is truly f**ked. And given that on Saturday, there were more people at the \"Death to the Jews\" rally than there are Jews in Britain, it is time for the Jews of the UK to give Britain another 1290 - Judenrein UK - this time, of the Jews' own decision making.\n\nThe Brits will no doubt enjoy Sharia Law...because, hey....the evil Jews will be gone.\n\nIt is pretty clear now that one of the differences between Canada and the US and Britain and the US is our right to free speech. Although it gets shaky here, it is embodied in our Constitutional rights...the same cannot be said for England and Canada.\n\nReading about what happened to the man taking pictures of Palestinian flags makes me want to get on my knees and thank God for blessing us with James Madison. None of the British laws described meant to \"keep order\" would seem to apply to his situation. In the U.S. we've managed to outlaw child pornography, trafficking, depiction of animal cruelty, and blocking traffic without punishing thought. This article is chilling. I spent a good amount of time in London 12 years ago and thought it a wonderful country. But reading and seeing the things I am now makes me hesitant to return, and very sad.\n\nI realized a long time ago that most of my left of center friends had great advice on nurturing close personal relationships. Their massive dangerous error is to apply the same mental model to large groups or nations.\n\nFor instance, if I show you patience, forgiveness or grace, you will likely respond by granting me the same. In large group, dynamics or international dynamics, this is lost. It is seen as lack of will or weakness. They err in anthropomorphizing large groups of people or nations. A very dangerous error.\n\nGreat article"

      "text": "The congresswoman can afford private security. Those who live in Oakland, California, don't have that luxury.\n\nI have to say I am learning much from this newsletter..thank you.  Defunding police isn't an answer...adding more support services makes sense. Gun law changes would also help\n\nShe can afford private security? Could she if she weren't using other people's money? This whole thing is a travesty. I don't understand how people can see the statistics of unarmed shootings and think it's worse than the rising murder rates in these suffering communities. Why such an arrogant commitment to lies? You put up the political signs and yet ignore the real problems. Such cowardice. The only angry passion these types have is when another white person calls them out for it. Then they act as if they want you dead.\n\nAs usual - the Marxist /intersectional / critical theory crowd are antisemitic.\n\nhttps://www.antipoliceterrorproject.org/blog-entire/cat-brooks-statement-palestine-052021\n\n\"Gun Violence\"\n\nI live in a very sparsely populated county in Michigan. It's also very poor. I'd wager that most every household has at least one firearm, or many more. It's a way of life.\n\nYet, shootings and homicides are extremely rare here.\n\nI'm tired of people blaming inanimate objects or hard knocks for murder. There is no excuse.\n\nand houses that boast \"In This House We Believe In Science\" lawn signs out front\n\n------------------\n\nThis type of signage is a must if you run a meth lab in your basement and enjoy humor\n\nWhat about Cori Bush's own constituents in St. Louis? We don't need to travel to Oakland to see the hypocrisy at play here.\n\nSt. Louis has the highest per capita murder rate in the U.S.\n\nSo who needs the security?\n\nI grew up and have lived in high crime neighborhoods... thankfully the police responded quickly and swiftly whenever I needed them. I cannot imagine this defunded police living. What is worse, I cannot believe the folks calling for this care at all about their communities, if they did care, wouldnt they listen? Politics is a dirty game.\n\nWhy do cities like Oakland and Philly (where I Live) allow open air 24/7 drug markets ? Are the police compromised by internal corruption and fear of retribution ? Dirty Cops are not turned in (Remember what happened to Serpico). Realistically The Gun Violence is The Drug Gangs (like the Mob did) fighting over money and corners. And the cops look the other way.....day after day.\n\nBari you should dig into this \"unsolvable\" problem......\n\nThis essay just has it wrong: the research supports crime prevention, not policing. As I wrote on my own Substack in response, \"Opponents of police defunding want you to believe that criminals have been emboldened, both by Black Lives Matter rhetoric and politicians speaking out against police funding. The research argues that this is a lie. As Beckett and Clayton write, \"Community groups say that the pandemic forced them to shutter prevention programs and created huge challenges for the work of violence interrupters, who rely on close relationships and in-person interventions with people at risk of shooting or being shot.\" You can read the rest of it here:\n\nhttps://clairepotter.substack.com/p/cori-bushs-private-security-detail\n\nA couple of things come to mind after reading this piece again.\n\nFirst, if you were reading news from any sources in this country from any source - MSM, Fox, even Substacks - of the the last month at least if not more, you would think that there are maybe only a handful of politicians in this country. The leading one of course is the one from the Bronx, and virtually every media outlet, every politician, every Twitter account, every pundit seems to be dancing to her tune. Then there are her minions, including the one mentioned here, and maybe Cuomo, for a bit at least (who was perhaps swept out of the way to make room for her gubernatorial run?). I can't think of any example in history of someone with less substance who was elevated to such extent.\n\nSecondly, if someone is to come up with a proposal to redirect some money from the police budgets, or even better from the vast foreign aid spending directed at \"nation building\", or from our outrageous military spending to do the following:\n\n- provide no interest loans to everyone in need and especially to people of color in need for things like home building, home renovations, home purchase\n\n- no interest business loans supporting entrepreneurs of color and others in need\n\n- scholarships so that students in need and in particular students of color can have access to any educational program - private, religious, Waldrof, Montessory, whatever is out there that fits their needs and gifts\n\n- funds to bring the best available teachers to any public schools serving these populations\n\n- to ensure that no public housing is built in areas of schools with more than 40% of poverty rate\n\n- to ensure that no area of any large city has a poverty rate more than 10% of the city average\n\n-  free and quality child care for all\n\n- free quality childcare\n\n- encourage tech companies to come up with \"pipeline\" programs staring in kindergarten to boardroom as a way to hire local talent and phase out H1B visa programs\n\n- incentives to restaurant, bars, coffee shops to open locations in less served/currently unserved neighborhoods\n\n- increase walkability - want to stop drive-bys in certain areas? get rid of cars\n\nThat is something I would stand for.\n\nThis article just tore at my heart. Particularly the last sentence \" \" He just wants to figure out how to keep his family and his friends alive.\".\n\nSounds like \"Common Sense\".  Thank you for writing an honest article on this issue.  It seems like we are more and more being asked to not believe things we see with our own eyes.  People need safe neighborhoods and kids need excellent schools.  Democratic leaders in cities like Oakland exploit their residents and offer no solutions, just exploitation.  Sad.\n\nWhy are so many of the defund the police protestors shown in video and photos young white people?  Most, if not all of whom, I'd wager have never had a police encounter.  Lenin called these types useful idiots.\n\nThey are the shock troops of the left marinated in the cesspools of woke universities.\n\nShock troops of the left marinated in cesspools of woke universities. Some people can say more with less. Brilliant and succinct!\n\nTwo comments: 1) there are few things more vile than a white person referring to a black person as a token or an Uncle Tom ( especially when they grew up with privileges that the vast majority of black and white Americans could only dream of) , and 2) activists who seek to defund police departments  never seem to find the time to focus on the utter failure of inner city schools to educate poor kids ( education arguably being the best way to improve the lives of those children).\n\nWhen I saw videos of the Lake Merritt rally and the white antifa-lite counter-protesters, my immediate thought was of the Westboro Baptist Church.\n\nAs the song goes \"There's no business like community activist business!\" Bet there are talent agents in LA who tell their clients \"I got no work for you, but you can run for a mayor of Oakland or SF, or start your won activist gig. Here are some lines you can practice!\"\n\nI will keep quoting Lester Freamon until I'm blue in the face - if you want to see the big picture, follow the freakin' money! For example, recent U of Colorado study showed that Denver spends between 40k-100k per year per homeless person, twice the cost of a one bedroom apartment. Recent levy in Seattle, approved by less that 40% of the turnout, will have all homeowners pay for, among other things, a group that spends 2 million paying guys to walk around a mall and \"prevent young kids of color from shoplifting\". There was a recent story in NYT on how this works globally, looking into Obama's program to prevent migration from Guatemala that spent 2 billion paying community groups from suburban Maryland to make apps and do things like that.\n\nInfiltrate a group, or start a new one, get on the trough and see how the money flows: who is it coming from, who is it going to.\n\nAlso, if you look into the money, you'll see the bigger picture. For example, an opposition leader i Serbia has recently presented \"Green New Deal for Serbia\". His funding mostly comes from Soros and from Friedrich Ebert Foundation (recently renamed something Green something). In other words, we can talk about the trees, but I'd rather discuss the forest.\n\nThis is a global thing, with global repercussions.\n\nLastly, a fun piece of news\" Finnish archeologists have recently uncovered a 1,000 years old remains of a person they believe was a non-binary individual and was a revered member of the society, which proves that ancient civilizations had high respect for non-binary people."

Misogyny much?\n\nLEOs wonder why they are disliked.\n\nI looked it up and some states do have laws on the books as to minimum age to leave a kid on their own or let them go off on their own. But Georgia just has a \"guideline,\" and it's 9. I hope she Karens the fuck out of those cops and gets some shit changed for this. Sounds like we now have Gen Z cops fighting to make sure the next generation is as coddled and useless as they (generally) are.\n\nA parent can get arrested and charged for \"crime\" of her 10-year-old going for a walk in a small town. Meanwhile, children can be shown pornographic books in school and encouraged to participate in genital mutilation by a non-parental adult with impunity. How does one square that circle?\n\nSomething is very wrong here.  Why all this fear?  When I was a child, in 2nd & 3rd grades, I occasionally walked to school and regularly walked home.  That trek from Charlotte's Midwood Elementary to 2826 Belvedere Ave just over a mile.  No one thought that unusual and certainly not hazardous.  What has changed since 1954?\n\n> What has changed since 1954?\n\nIn my opinion, I will offer you two specific things pertinent to this that have changed:\n\n1) True Crime is an incredibly prolific genre of media. It is wildly popular among women. This breeds an obsession with danger and a culture of 'safetyism.'\n\n2) We do not have communities anywhere in America that resemble 1954. On average, towns were far smaller and people regularly interacted with one another (instead of using the internet or watching TV alone at home like today), and even in large cities people largely lived among their ethnic communities on streets where you know many of the inhabitants. The fact is, people do not want to get to know their neighbors. And the problem only got worse after covid. I hate it.\n\nI wonder if the police would go to a black womans home and arrest her if her 10 year old child walked over to a friends house a half mile away? Bet at most, they would just have a chat with her.\n\nDoes anyone really think that it was \"Biden's recent decision to lift restrictions on firing long-range missiles into Russian territory.\" By what indication can anyone conclude that Biden made that decision, or was even aware that this decision was being made?\n\nMSNBC is part of Spinco. We've long known they were offering spin, not news.\n\nInstinctively, I support the police and would like to see a hard line taken on crime. I don't support the \"defund\" movement even a tiny bit. I respect and honor those who put themselves in harm's way.\n\nAnd yet I look at this video and read this story and realize that the police do not always serve and protect. I've never been arrested or close to arrest, and yet many times when I've seen the police in person, they haven't behaved well. Too many enjoy intimidating those who have too much to lose by objecting.\n\nAnd I see that smug cop, out of shape, ridiculous cartoons tattooed on his or her arms, arresting a mom for doing absolutely nothing. Handcuffing and humiliating someone who poses no threat whatsoever. Taking her away from her children. When I grew up, kids wandered around neighborhoods without supervision. I walked a mile, often alone, to school every day from kindergarten on. Her only alleged crime is not being willing to install an app on a phone that would serve absolutely no purpose whatsoever if her child was actually in danger (kidnappers are not always idiots).\n\nIt makes me dislike and distrust the police. That shouldn't be the case.\n\nWouldn't a situation like this call for at most a warning?  What about emotional trauma to the child from having his mother arrested ?\n\n\"Dr. Mehmet Oz, a former television star\"\n\nIsn't he also a doctor-specifically a cardiologist?  Hence, the \"Dr\" in front of his name.  C'mon FP.  Do better.\n\nMy thoughts exactly when I read this....truly your BIAS is out there for all to see....if you are going to be a good journalist keep your personal hatred toward the right out of your writing....getting so sick of this BIAS here\n\nCan someone explain to me why an illegal alien found guilty of murder is going spend life in our prison on our dime rather than being deported? Is it to ensure justice is served and so he doesn't reoffend?\n\nHang the bugger and save the fare\n\nBetter he is in prison here than returned home only to pay a smuggler to come back.\n\nAt age 8 in the 1950s, I walked to a bus stop and took a public bus to school. It wasn't that far and the bus fare was a dime, so I walked home without using the bus. This was on the westside of Manhattan. I was not the only kid doing it; others from my school - the then-newly built PS 75 - did the same.\n\nGo to the North Beach neighborhood of San Francisco and you'll see kids walking all over the place by themselves - to/from school, Salesians after school club, DiMaggio playground, home, friends' houses etc. just as it's always been. Hopefully someone who is local to the story will read it and be inspired to change the law there so kids in that area will be as free as they are here in SF.\n\nSame.\n\nWhen I was five, I walked almost that far to school without a parent. I was fine. When I was six, I went home to an empty house and locked the door until Mom got home an hour later. I was fine. When I was 10, I rode my horse alone through open country for miles. I was fine. Kids aren't stupid or incapable; they're just short. This is bullshit."

      "text": "While Americans enjoyed a long holiday weekend of barbecue and backyard parties, France has endured a week of riots. The violence began on June 27-the day that 17-year-old Nahel Merzouk was killed by a policeman in the Parisian suburb of Nanterre during a traffic stop. Since then, more than 45,000 policemen have been deployed across the country.\n\nThe damage is staggering. According to the Ministry of the Interior, the rioters have burned more than 5,000 cars; more than 1,000 buildings have been looted or destroyed ; roughly 250 police stations were attacked; and more than 750 cops were wounded . Businesses across the country have reported $1.1 billion in losses.\n\nWhat has driven so many to the streets? What explains this violence?\n\nThe easy thing for Americans to do is to look at the sequence of events that have played out over the past few days-a person of color killed by the cops; an outcry against \"police brutality\" and \"systemic racism\"; violent riots-and to draw the analogy to George Floyd's murder and America in the summer of 2020. Indeed, that is what many are doing .\n\nIs this a fair read of the situation? We reached out to French writer Marc Weitzmann, who has covered everything from globalization to identity politics to antisemitism for Le Monde and Tablet, among other outlets. He said: no, it is not.\n\n\"This is politically convenient thinking that erases the differences between these two specific countries, their specific histories, and their specific problems. To draw this parallel is to replace reality with clichés,\" he told us.\n\nInstead, Weitzmann urged anyone trying to understand the situation to look at a few factors.\n\nPoverty and alienation:\n\nFirst, he says, look to the world-or what he calls the \"anti-world\"-of the housing projects known as les cités , which are clustered around big cities like Paris, Marseille, and Lyon, and include large numbers of migrants from North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, the former Yugoslavia, Pakistan, and the Middle East. In these places, Weitzmann points out, \"the poverty rate reaches 43 percent, and the unemployment rate almost 19 percent. The annual income per household does not exceed 14,000 euros.\"\n\nIt's not simply the lack of opportunity, he argues. \"The cités exude, even in their brutalist architecture, a feeling of despair.\"\n\nWe don't know much about the world in which Nahel Merzouk grew up-at least not yet. But this is the world that the rioters-some of them as young as 12-come from. It could not be further from the France most Americans see when they visit Paris.\n\nSocial media:\n\nThe one thing that nearly all the kids of les cités have is Telegram or Snapchat, which boasts 20 million daily French users. \"It's much easier to organize a riot these days-as in 'let's do the Vuitton store tomorrow at 3 p.m.,' \" says Weitzmann.\n\nThe other thing is that these platforms \"also offer everyone else outside les cités a window into this world, which they sort of know about but rarely glimpse for themselves-including the bizarrely cheerful attitude of the protesters. Anyone who has been watching cannot help but notice the strange, festive atmosphere of these riots-an aimless, almost orgiastic violence.\"\n\nThe post-colonial paradox:\n\nOf course, Weitzmann says, France could have done more to assimilate émigrés from Morocco and Algeria. But it didn't. Partly that was because of racism. But it was also because of economics and geopolitics.\n\nIn the early eighties, France relied heavily on oil and gas from Morocco and Algeria-both of which were run by nationalist regimes that did not like the fact that hundreds of thousands of Moroccans and Algerians were moving to the country that had, until recently, colonized them. In fact, it was understood in Paris, Weitzmann argues, that \"absorbing Algerians and Moroccans into France would be viewed as a casus belli by the nationalist regimes in Algiers and Rabat.\"\n\nAt the same time, Moroccan and Algerian officials did not want their countrymen who had emigrated to come back-they were assumed to be infected with Western ideas. \"So, countless immigrants pouring into the cités found themselves in a liminal place-they were not at home, but they had no home to return to,\" Weitzmann says. \"They were stuck. And this bred a fury and resentment that have steadily, dangerously grown over the decades.\"\n\nSo that's one sharp view from Paris. Abe Greenwald, the author of today's essay and the executive editor of Commentary magazine, saw a different meaning-or perhaps simply a broader one-in the flames.\n\nHe makes the case below that the protests, paradoxically, are a sign of our enormous progress. It's a provocative argument and we'd love to know what you think in the comments. -BW\n\nThe most recent riots in France are winding down. It took the deployment of 45,000 police officers nationwide to quell the violence and arson that erupted in response to the June 27 police shooting of Nahel M., a teenager of Algerian and Moroccan descent. Between that day and this one, rioters destroyed hundreds of buildings, set thousands of cars on fire, and attacked the home of a suburban mayor, injuring his wife and one of his children before they fled.\n\nAccording to reports, the rioters were mostly young, and many of them seemed to be ethnic minorities. Such details, along with the event that sparked the violence, make it easy to place the riots neatly in one of several categories depending on your ideological framework. This was either about failing Muslim assimilation, police brutality, systemic racism, or some combination of the bunch. And since we are so often made to understand that racism is the defining issue of the West, you can explain what just happened as another spasm on the way to our long-overdue reckoning.\n\nThis is true as far as it goes: Immigrants to France from North Africa and the Middle East do face discrimination. Many Muslims who reside in housing projects live in a country far removed from the France of the American imagination. Their lives in the banlieues are marked by a chronic lack of social services, from childcare to medicine to education.\n\nBut none of this goes anywhere near far enough to explain the orgy of violence we've just witnessed. The latest riots are only a piece of a larger mass fever sweeping not just Paris or France or Europe but all of the West.\n\nIt was only in May, two months ago, when hundreds of thousands of rioters flooded through France to protest Emmanuel Macron's move to raise the national retirement age from 62 to 64. Two months before that, more than a million French came out for the same cause. France has seen so many protests in recent years that we barely remember being captivated by the 300,000 Yellow Vest demonstrators who called for populist reforms to the French economy and government in 2018.\n\nMassive protests have been rising in the West for years. In the United Kingdom, Spain, Canada, the United States, New Zealand, the Netherlands, Germany, Israel-you name it-activist armies have been taking to the streets in greater numbers and frequency. And the nominal causes are all over the place: anti-coal protests, cost-of-living protests, farmer protests, trucker protests, anti-immigration protests, anti-capitalist protests, and, of course, Covid-lockdown and police-brutality protests.\n\nIt's tempting to point to the seismic events of 2020-the pandemic and the murder of George Floyd-as the catalyst for this increased instability. But the rise goes back further. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), \"Mass protests increased annually by an average of 11.5 percent from 2009 to 2019 across all regions of the world.\" The upheavals of 2020 only exacerbated a growing trend. In the U.S., recall that Occupy Wall Street, Black Lives Matter, and the Women's March all managed to seize our attention before we ever heard the word Covid .\n\nAs the CSIS report notes, we are in an \"age of global mass protests.\" But what sets this wave of tumult apart from, say, the rash of protests in autocratic countries at the end of the Cold War, is that Western democracies have been swept up in the action.\n\nSo what's going on? Why are Western populations now so primed to explode? If you're exercised over a given political or social cause, you'll see that cause as the explanation. But are all these causes coincidentally coming to a head at the same time? Are Western countries staring at once into the multiple abysses of racism, state-sanctioned brutality, and economic adversity?\n\nI'd argue just the opposite. The West has made such extraordinary-indeed, historically unique-progress in reducing suffering on a large scale that we're now left grasping for new ideals and new aspirations to fulfill. This is not to say that everything is perfect. But the current penchant for protests and riots is profoundly out of proportion with the relatively small-scale challenges we still face.\n\nOur accomplishments on human rights, freedoms, and the alleviation of hardship are so gargantuan that statistical comparisons with previous ages are made absurd. In the twentieth century, industrial-scale racism emanating from Western Europe killed millions of Jews and brought the world to war. In the U.S., Jim Crow segregation was the law of the land in the South while de facto segregation reigned elsewhere. In the twenty-first century, we seize on statistically rare police shootings as evidence of an ongoing genocide. You want to know what French barbarity looks like? The guillotine was still in use in the late 1970s. In the previous century, countries in Western Europe saw genuine famines. Today, Western Europe (and America) is fighting an obesity crisis, with the United Kingdom leading the pack.\n\nThe widespread poverty known to previous ages now seems science-fictional compared to life in today's West. Between 1960 and 2023, the French GDP per capita went from $1,334 to $43,659, with other Western European nations showing similar growth trends in income and consumption. In the U.S. over the same time period, per capita GDP rose from $3,007 to $70,249. It's not noted nearly enough that the life of an average citizen of a modern Western country makes the existence of an old-world aristocrat look pauperized by comparison. And the reduction in global poverty driven by Western trade, industry, aid, and debt forgiveness over the past decades has been even more astounding. Between 1990 to 2017 alone, the global poverty rate fell from 36 percent to 9 percent.\n\nWe've stuffed ourselves to the gills with the good things that we've created. But we are still human beings-the one species on the planet that yearns for meaning. And we don't know where to turn next. In a different age, many would turn to their faith. But in the West, religion has been on a steep decline that crosses the rising rate of mass protests in an X pattern. So aimless activists protest and riot and embrace causes that they hope will bring needed shape to their moral lives.\n\nIt's worth noting that the symptoms of our cultural overabundance go beyond the political. What is the sudden surge of interest in virtual reality but an unapologetic declaration that we've grown bored with the world as it is? The AI hype, too, heralds a kind of surrender. As if we've decided to let the gadgets take it from here.\n\nIn 1929, the Spanish philosopher José Ortega y Gasset wrote a very flawed (and very anti-democratic) book titled The Revolt of the Masses . In it, however, Ortega y Gasset offers this one gem: \"When what was before an ideal becomes a component part of reality, it inevitably ceases to be an ideal.\" That's the dilemma facing the stuffed and starved citizens of the West.\n\nHow do we see ourselves out of this? The way out surely begins with gratitude. Some appreciation for how far we've come would go a long way toward getting our progress back on track. But gratitude is antithetical to the false promise of mass protest. And so, we may have to wait for the new ideals and new tactics to fail before reclaiming the aspirations on which our civilization was built.\n\nIf you believe in our work, become a paid subscriber today:\n\nIs democratic chaos the opposite of organized repression?  If we agree that the French Revolution was the beginning of modern history with the first popular revolution against rigid totalitarianism, then we can see that popular unrest is unavoidable in large and diverse societies.  The Revolutions of 1848 in Europe led to uprisings throughout Europe, and they initially failed, but they did bring about the ascent of labor movements and a merchant and factory worker middle class.  These uprisings were the cost of progress.  But even in Revolutions, just causes can mutate into a beehive of destructive and mindless frenzy.  Civil protest is good for a society, but what about uncivil protest?  The black inner city riots of large American cities in the 1960's resulted in white flight and the decay of many great cities.  Did such destruction serve the needs of any group except for the fringe left that believed in destroying society before rebuilding it? As historical Monday morning quarterback, I think city and state governments should have called out the National Guard and calmed things down with water cannon once the fires and destruction began.  Too many politicians are afraid of their legacy and there desire to be reelected.   The French in the current riots should have brought out the water cannon.  The governors of Washington state and Minnesota should have called out the guard and water cannon for the BLM vandalism and breakdown in social order in city centers.  It is abominable that a police station was surrendered to communards in Seattle and set afire.   France, like the US, is a polarized society with political extremes. Jean-Marie Le Pen must be pondering a return to the fray.\n\nInteresting piece. I think the author is correct that today's mass protesters are essentially spoiled brats & ingrates (Though he's too polite to put it that way). The irony of all their self-congratulation (they are the \"resistance,\" authorities are \"fascists,\" etc., is that if Western governments were really committing genocide, smashing skulls, etc., most of them would scram and hide--as most victims of history's worst have tried to do. Don't underestimate the role of Islamist fanaticism and general dysfunction here--these are the same people who spawned the murderers of 9-11; who tortured Ilan Halimim may he rest in peace; who have not allowed Israelis one day of peace since modern Israel was reborn and who, given a chance, will wreck civilization. It isn't every Arab Muslim and there are good people in every society, but on the whole, let's get real, France made a giant error in letting masses of them in. That's the obvious and sad truth--their way of life is simply not congruent with Western democracy. Time for the West to batten down the hatches, wish the Third world well, and finally get it that these people's problems are not our responsibility.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "While Americans enjoyed a long holiday weekend of barbecue and backyard parties, France has endured a week of riots. The violence began on June 27-the day that 17-year-old Nahel Merzouk was killed by a policeman in the Parisian suburb of Nanterre during a traffic stop. Since then, more than 45,000 policemen have been deployed across the country.\n\nThe damage is staggering. According to the Ministry of the Interior, the rioters have burned more than 5,000 cars; more than 1,000 buildings have been looted or destroyed ; roughly 250 police stations were attacked; and more than 750 cops were wounded . Businesses across the country have reported $1.1 billion in losses.\n\nWhat has driven so many to the streets? What explains this violence?\n\nThe easy thing for Americans to do is to look at the sequence of events that have played out over the past few days-a person of color killed by the cops; an outcry against \"police brutality\" and \"systemic racism\"; violent riots-and to draw the analogy to George Floyd's murder and America in the summer of 2020. Indeed, that is what many are doing .\n\nIs this a fair read of the situation? We reached out to French writer Marc Weitzmann, who has covered everything from globalization to identity politics to antisemitism for Le Monde and Tablet, among other outlets. He said: no, it is not.\n\n\"This is politically convenient thinking that erases the differences between these two specific countries, their specific histories, and their specific problems. To draw this parallel is to replace reality with clichés,\" he told us.\n\nInstead, Weitzmann urged anyone trying to understand the situation to look at a few factors.\n\nPoverty and alienation:\n\nFirst, he says, look to the world-or what he calls the \"anti-world\"-of the housing projects known as les cités , which are clustered around big cities like Paris, Marseille, and Lyon, and include large numbers of migrants from North Africa, sub-Saharan Africa, the former Yugoslavia, Pakistan, and the Middle East. In these places, Weitzmann points out, \"the poverty rate reaches 43 percent, and the unemployment rate almost 19 percent. The annual income per household does not exceed 14,000 euros.\"\n\nIt's not simply the lack of opportunity, he argues. \"The cités exude, even in their brutalist architecture, a feeling of despair.\"\n\nWe don't know much about the world in which Nahel Merzouk grew up-at least not yet. But this is the world that the rioters-some of them as young as 12-come from. It could not be further from the France most Americans see when they visit Paris.\n\nSocial media:\n\nThe one thing that nearly all the kids of les cités have is Telegram or Snapchat, which boasts 20 million daily French users. \"It's much easier to organize a riot these days-as in 'let's do the Vuitton store tomorrow at 3 p.m.,' \" says Weitzmann.\n\nThe other thing is that these platforms \"also offer everyone else outside les cités a window into this world, which they sort of know about but rarely glimpse for themselves-including the bizarrely cheerful attitude of the protesters. Anyone who has been watching cannot help but notice the strange, festive atmosphere of these riots-an aimless, almost orgiastic violence.\"\n\nThe post-colonial paradox:\n\nOf course, Weitzmann says, France could have done more to assimilate émigrés from Morocco and Algeria. But it didn't. Partly that was because of racism. But it was also because of economics and geopolitics.\n\nIn the early eighties, France relied heavily on oil and gas from Morocco and Algeria-both of which were run by nationalist regimes that did not like the fact that hundreds of thousands of Moroccans and Algerians were moving to the country that had, until recently, colonized them.

      "text": "The death of a police officer in the line of duty affects every other officer-and everyone else who has ever been one. Cops do not allow their brothers and sisters to die in vain; we honor them by learning from their deaths, by ensuring that others may live through their ultimate sacrifice.\n\nThank God the two Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies ambushed on Sept. 12 survived their attack. And two police officers shot in Louisville, Kentucky on Sept. 23 will recover .\n\nYet there are still lessons to be learned from these horrific encounters. The lessons aren't just for our police officers-they apply to all of us.\n\nThe deputies were in their car when they were ambushed, and each was struck by multiple gunshots. As the gunman ran away, the female deputy got out of her patrol car, radioed for help, and then applied a tourniquet to her wounded partner to save his life. Did I mention she had been shot through the jaw? Her radio transmission was remarkably clear for someone with a mouth full of blood and searing pain. She is the definition a hero. Even among cops, her story represents a special kind of \"unbreakable.\"\n\nBut there are a lot of cops who fit that description, and a lot of heroic police work happens every day in communities large and small throughout our nation. On the other hand, the perpetrator is clearly the opposite-a coward. That's the lesson here, a lesson in contrasts.\n\nWe see another contrast in this incident-a contrast in values. By now, many of us have seen the footage of protesters showing up at the hospital where the deputies were transported to block the exits and entrances and to express their hope for the officers' deaths. They threatened more violence.\n\nWhat that says is there's no longer any middle ground. The contrasts are too stark. We can side with a working mother, someone's daughter and neighbor, who is willing to risk her life for her community and her partner. Or we can side with those who laugh at her being shot and choking on her own blood, her only sin being the badge she wears. The choice is ours, and the distinction has been made crystal clear for us.\n\nIf your first impulse is to burn down the city after any use of force by the police, before any information comes out on the justification (or lack thereof), then you have chosen your side. Those who have chosen this side are unlikely to be dissuaded from their views, because running on pure emotion leaves little room for logic or facts. Sadly, we know that those who choose rage over reason will have a compliant media ready to reaffirm their rejection of this country, its values, and those guardians of the peace who enforce its laws and maintain its order.\n\nOur other choice is to choose the rule of law and to accept the responsibilities required for a civil society. We can remain vigilant in our requirement that government be held accountable for its actions while still supporting law enforcement as a core function of that government. We can reject calls to defund and even abolish the police, and instead seek to improve policing through better training and hiring, through bringing the best and brightest into the profession.\n\nChoosing this side requires that we exercise our responsibilities to our fellow citizen as often as we exercise our own rights. And finally, it requires that we always clearly identify the hero from the coward. We must choose wisely, but we all must choose.\n\nRandy Petersen is a senior researcher for the policing initiative at the Texas Public Policy Foundation. He spent 21 years as a police officer working in the patrol, investigations, training, and administrative divisions before retiring in 2014 and becoming a director of a police academy in Texas.\n\nThis is not a paywall!\n\nYour support helps us continue our mission of providing thoughtful, independent journalism.

      "text": "The brutal Minneapolis police killing of George Floyd has sparked violent protests, looting, and arson attacks in Minneapolis and St. Paul. A police precinct building was torched and destroyed and the Minnesota National Guard has been called out to restore order. But the killing in Minnesota is the latest reminder that politicians and judges-through federal law and judicial interpretation-have turned police into a privileged class that is most often unaccountable, if not entitled to oppress other Americans.\n\nAlmost everyone agrees that Floyd's death was a horrendous injustice. President Trump, who urged police officers in 2017 to not \"be too nice\" to suspects they arrested, condemned what the police did to Floyd as \"a very bad thing .\" Former Minneapolis police chief Janeé Harteau said that the video of Floyd's killing was \"the most horrific thing I've seen in my career and in my lifetime.\" Washington, D.C. Police Chief Peter Newsham declared that the officers' actions were \"nothing short of murder.\" Derick Chauvin, the police officer who killed Floyd was arrested today and charged with murder ; he and three other police involved in Floyd's death were fired earlier this week\n\nFloyd was killed by Chauvin pressing his knee on Floyd's neck for eight minutes after he was handcuffed and laying face down in the street. Floyd repeatedly declared, \"I can't breathe.\" It didn't matter. ACLU attorney Carl Takei told the New York Times that police departments that permit \"chokeholds try to differentiate between cutting off the flow of blood, which renders someone unconscious, and cutting off the flow of oxygen, which is deadly.\" This dicey distinction often goes amiss, as in 2014 when Eric Garner was killed by a New York City policeman's chokehold. But how did government officials ever acquire a right to strangle people who fail to instantly submit to their commands?\n\nSuch killings would likely not occur without the sense of impunity conferred on police in much of this nation. Sen. Amy Klobuchar, a top contender for Vice President candidacy for Joe Biden, was the chief prosecutor for Hennepin County (including Minneapolis) from 1998 to 2006. Klobuchar, who was nicknamed \" KloboCop \" by detractors,  \" declined to bring charges in more than two dozen cases in which people were killed in encounters with police\" while she \"aggressively prosecuted smaller offenses\" by private citizens, the Washington Post noted. Her record was aptly summarized by a headline early this year from the Twin Cities Pioneer Press : \"Klobuchar ramped up prosecutions, except in cases against police.\"\n\nMinnesota cops also benefit from their state's so-called \"police officer's bill of rights,\" which impede investigations into killings by police and other misconduct.\n\nOutrage over police abuses have become a regular occurrence in modern American life. In 1994, the ACLU and the National Rifle Association  jointly called for President Bill Clinton to appoint a national commission to investigate \" lawlessness in law enforcement .\"  In 2014, after violent protests over a police shooting in Ferguson, Missouri, Attorney General Eric Holder declared that \" we must seek to rebuild trust between law enforcement and the local community.\" But unjustified police shootings usually spark brief uproars and promises of reform- but no fundamental rollback of law enforcement's lethal power and prerogatives.\n\nMuch of the media coverage quickly framed the Minneapolis killing as another example of systemic racism by police. There are many bigoted cops who have unjustifiably shot or otherwise abused innocent black citizens but people of all races, creeds, and colors are at risk from lawless lawmen. As the Washington Post noted, \"In 2017, a Minneapolis police officer shot and killed Justine Damond , an Australian woman who had called police about what she believed was a possible sexual assault near her home.\" The Montgomery County, Maryland Police Department continues to refuse to provide camcom videos or any other evidence on its predawn no-knock raid in Potomac, Maryland, in which police reportedly shot 21-year-old Duncan Lemp as he lay sleeping in bed in his parents' house. The Lemp case has been largely ignored by the nation's media (except for my American Conservative articles here , here, and here ).\n\nFocusing on racial bias also risks obscuring the fundamental problem: the Supreme Court has effectively given police a license to shoot, pummel, or falsely arrest ill-fated citizens across the nation.\n\nIn the wake of the Civil War, freed southern blacks were terrorized by lynch mobs and other attackers. Congress responded to Ku Klux Klan violence against freed southern blacks by enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1871 to authorize lawsuits against any person acting \"under color of\" law who causes a \"deprivation of any rights... secured by the Constitution and laws.\" But in a series of decisions beginning in 1967 , the Supreme Court gutted that law by permitting police and other government agents to claim they acted in \"good faith\" when violating citizens' rights. In 1982, the Supreme Court granted government officials immunity unless they violated \"clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known.\"\n\nRegardless of centuries of court rulings that clearly demarcated citizens' constitutional rights, the Supreme Court decided government officials deserved \"qualified immunity\" unless a prior court case had condemned almost exactly the same abusive behavior. Federal judge Don Willett declared in 2018 that \" qualified immunity smacks of unqualified impunity , letting public officials duck consequences for bad behavior-no matter how palpably unreasonable-as long as they were the first to behave badly.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court effectively added an asterisk to the Constitution that expunged much of the Bill of Rights. In a 2018 case absolving a reckless shooting that killed a motorist, Justice Sonia Sotomayor angrily dissented that the court's decision \"tells [police] officers that they can shoot first and think later , and it tells the public that palpably unreasonable conduct will go unpunished.\"\n\nHow does the Supreme Court's idealism on \"good faith\" G-men play out in the real world?  Courts have \"approved qualified immunity for cops who allegedly shot people without cause, sicced a dog on a man who was surrendering, tased a driver who was stopped for failing to buckle his seat belt, and ordered a 17-year-old boy to disrobe and masturbate so they could take pictures of his erect penis ,\" Reason columnist Jacob Sullum reported in 2019 . That year, a federal appeals court bizarrely granted qualified immunity to Fresno, California, police officers who stole $225,000 during a search of two businessmen.\n\nSen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, said yesterday that his committee would hold a hearing on police violence to analyze \"why does this happen, how often is it, is it an aberration .\" Graham said the video of Floyd's killing is \"hard to watch, and I just imagine how many people died without videos.\"\n\nBut Congress has, as usual, been asleep on the job. As Dan Alban, an Institute for Justice attorney and  the nation's most effective litigator against asset forfeiture abuses, observed, Congress could pass legislation \"clarifying that there is no qualified immunity\" for civil rights lawsuits against state and federal officials.\n\nBut the problem goes far beyond qualified immunity. Politicians criminalize practically everything in daily life and then tell police \"be nice\"-or maybe mandate that cops attend  sensitivity training. The COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in a blizzard of new mandates and prohibitions that further empower police. A video went viral earlier this month of a New York Police Department officer tackling and pummeling a young black man who was suspected of violating new dictates on social distancing. One wonders if there are a hundred such instances of idiotic brutality for each one that trends on Twitter today\n\nMinneapolis City Council Vice President Andrea Jenkins announced yesterday that city officials will \"create a healing space at the site of the [burnt-down] 3rd Precinct so that people can grieve, express their concerns, their anger, in a safe and humane way.\"  It remains to be seen whether a  \"healing space\" will deter the unjustified looting and violence that has proliferated in Minnesota. But rather than pillaging Family Dollar, Aldi's, and Target, folks infuriated by Floyd's killing should focus their wrath on the legislators and judges who have effectively given police a right to kill.\n\nJames Bovard is the author of Lost Rights , Attention Deficit Democracy , and Public Policy Hooligan .

      "text": "It's been a staple of television for decades: a dramatic or comedic show following the work of a pair of police officers as they go about their sworn duty to protect and serve.\n\nFrom Dragnet to Police Squad (in color!) to NYPD Blue to The Wire to Brooklyn 99 , the cop show has taken many forms. Some have merely used police as a more or less incidental backdrop to comedy (in the way that Irish cult classic sitcom Father Ted wasn't really about religion or priests). Others have shown the darker and grittier side of police work, not altogether sympathetically. And some have managed to deal with serious issues, including critiques of police misconduct, with humor. In the wake of George Floyd's murder, there's been a lot of talk about canceling or reimagining cop shows . There's also one worth watching anew: Dragnet 's late-60s, full-color cousin Adam-12 .\n\nThe police procedural follows a pair of LAPD officers, veteran Pete Malloy and rookie Jim Reed, as they drive around late-60s Los Angeles responding to various, often humorous incidents, with a criminal encounter for the denouement. Like most midcentury television dramas, it was a fairly serious show that was also free of explicit content of any kind. Like Dragnet , its encounters and crimes were purportedly pulled from real police reports. And like most cop shows of its era, it casts the police in an almost entirely positive light (though the idealized LAPD of the show employs a mostly white force).\n\nWhen a young officer with children is gravely injured and dies in the hospital, we are invited to mourn and to empathize with his family. Characters of all races and walks of life populate the show, from zany counterculture druggies to jumpy, inexperienced criminals to a group of young Mexican children who mob a passerby, mistaking him for the U.S. president. One would think some liberty has been taken with the incidents the officers respond to, and it probably has, though police, like priests, have seen almost everything.\n\nReed and Malloy never become angry, overreact, or shoot first and ask questions later. Routine stops never devolve into extrajudicial execution. They are skilled at deescalation, negotiation, and conflict resolution, and evince no hint of a militaristic mindset towards police work. When brutality or corruption occur-rarely-they are never tolerated or treated lightly-and never committed by the protagonists. When our officers do make a mistake, it prompts discussions on how to do better next time. The officers drive ordinary cars, not souped-up black Chargers, they carry ordinary service handguns rather than black rifles, and, of course, they wear blue, the origin of all the pro-police slogans riffing off that color. (Why, then, do the police prefer menacing black equipment today?)\n\nReed and Malloy are unswervingly patient, professional, and courteous, even to the criminals they arrest; in one episode, for example, a Latino boy turns himself in for an unsolved arson, and the officers thank him for being honest as they cuff him.\n\nWikipedia describes Adam-12 as a \"realistic police drama.\" Given what we've seen from the police only in the last month, that is rather like calling Pravda a disinterested journal of Soviet affairs. Those who know the full extent of police brutality and misconduct over the decades can hardly watch these midcentury procedurals without rolling their eyes. Such shows did not portray the police as they are, and not even necessarily as they would like to be. Rather, they portray the police as they would like to be portrayed .\n\nAnd it's not as if the producers simply happened to like cops. Real police departments have had formal and informal influence over their depictions on television. Dragnet , like Adam-12 , was advised by the LAPD itself, and featured real LAPD buildings and cars. Adam-12 's end credits even include a brief frame that reads: \"Technical advice for the filming of Adam-12 came from the office of Chief Thomas Reddin, Los Angeles Police Department.\" What, exactly, \"technical advice\" consisted of is uncertain, but it would be naive to think that it referred only to portraying the proper make and model of a squad car or service pistol. Kent McCord, who played Jim Reed, gave an interview in 2016 that revealed some of these details. Most of the police involvement was overtly technical, but the relationship between the producers and the department was close enough to allow for informal influence. A t The Atlantic , Conor Friedersdorf wrote at length about the LAPD's essentially propagandistic role in Dragnet 's police portrayals , taking exemplary police work and presenting it as the norm to the producers. The murky but very real influence of police departments on police-themed TV shows is not unlike the pervasive and longstanding influence of the military-industrial complex on movies and video games , and their largely positive or at best uncritical portrayals of war and weaponry. In his interview, McCord adds that Adam-12 episodes were actually used as training videos for police departments around the country. It would seem there was sincerity and idealism mixed with self-promotion.\n\nThough it's worth noting that the LAPD is the same department that inspired N.W.A.'s \"Fuck Tha Police.\"\n\nAuthor Douglas Rushkoff wrote, in his 1994 book Media Virus! Hidden Agendas in Popular Culture , that Adam-12 \"marked the last gasp of this righteous style of cop TV.\" Yet \"it was as if the world was laughing at the 'straight' roles these cops had to play in an increasingly un-straight world....'to protect and serve' meant to acknowledge and permit a certain amount of bizarre activity in early seventies Los Angeles.\"\n\nIt is easy to assume, if you don't know very much history, that this all changed with the crack epidemic or when the Bush-era Middle East wars blew back in the form of desert-tan military equipment in the hands of cops. But the police needed to be forced to give Miranda warnings all the way back in 1966-two years before Adam-12 's first episode. The police beat civil rights protestors, and throughout the late 19th and 20th century, they permitted and in some cases participated in lynchings of black men. Bull Connor's brutal officers didn't deploy tanks and carry M-16s. Dressing the police like Reed and Malloy, although it would be a good start, will not turn copaganda into documentary. That requires a reckoning with racism and institutional culture, and a much more substantial set of reforms.\n\nShows like Adam-12 were produced with good intentions, and they made it easier for young people-certain young people, anyway-to admire the police and perhaps to seek a career in the force. In 2015, following the death of Martin Milner, who portrayed Malloy, LAPD Chief Charlie Beck put it this way : \"As you watch any of the 'Adam-12' episodes, you see professional, compassionate, internally driven, hardworking, clean-cut, impeccably tailored, fit Los Angeles police officers-those police officers that have no dark side, that do the right things for the right reasons every time. And that is the image that drew us all to this place.\"\n\nIt's no surprise cops like Adam-12 . It's a good show, and it certainly portrays two ideal officers and a clean, professional department. Real-life police departments could do worse than supplementing their training videos, once again, with a few episodes.\n\nAddison Del Mastro is assistant editor and social media manager of The American Conservative.

      "text": "Half a century ago this summer, the Voting Rights Act was passed, propelled by Bloody Sunday at Selma Bridge. The previous summer, the Civil Rights Act became law on July 2. We are in the seventh year of the presidency of a black American who has named the first two black U.S. attorneys general. Yet race relations seem more poisonous now than then, when the good will of America's majority was driving legislation.\n\nToday's issue, however, is not voting rights, open housing, or school busing. It is black vs. blue: African-Americans inflamed at what they see as chronic police brutality and police forces feeling besieged in a demagogic \"war on cops.\" And the media are obsessed with it, and determined to make us equally so.\n\nConsider. On June 9, America's \"newspaper of record\" ran four stories in the first section about police violence against blacks.\n\nPage one of the New York Times told of black leaders in Cleveland, \"distrustful of the criminal justice system,\" invoking a \"seldom-used Ohio law,\" by going \"directly to a judge to request murder charges\" against the cops involved in the death of Tamir Rice.\n\nResponding to reports of a man with a gun, a cop, two seconds out of his car, shot Tamir, 12. The gun was a toy. Yet, though this happened six months ago, the Times went into loving detail again on how Tamir died. It then regurgitated the deaths, also last year, of Michael Brown in Ferguson and Eric Garner on Staten Island.\n\nOn page A11 was a story with three color photos, covering almost the whole page, about a cop who, called to a raucous pool party in McKinney, Texas, drew his gun and wrestled to the ground a 14-year-old black girl in a bathing suit. \"A Party at a Pool, a Jarring Image of Police Force\" was the banner over the Times' tale of \"powerful and disturbing\" images, from video showing \"a police officer pointing a gun at teenagers in bathing suits and shoving a young black girl's face into the ground.\" Had the girl been white, would the Times have splashed it?\n\nPage A12 was given over entirely to cops vs. blacks, with two fresh stories, plus continuations of the Tamir Rice and pool stories. The story across the top of A12 told of how a North Charleston, South Carolina, cop, held since April on murder charges, has now been indicted by a grand jury for murder.\n\nOfficer Michael Slager shot fleeing suspect Walter Scott in the back repeatedly, a killing caught on video, apparently after a fight over Slager's Taser. There was also a fresh story on terrorism suspect Usaamah Rahim, shot dead after being confronted by FBI and a Boston cop. Rahim was allegedly wielding a large knife. Blurry video from a Burger King camera shows the cops backing away from Rahim, but not the knife.\n\nSeven Times reporters got bylines for these four stories. What does the Times ' investment of all this journalistic talent and news space tell us? The Times does not want this issue to die. The Times editors and writers see \"blacks being victimized by white racist cops\" as a representative truth about America 2015 that we all must address.\n\nBut what is the larger reality? First, the vast majority of black males killed violently are killed by black males, and interracial crime in America is overwhelmingly black-on-white, not the reverse. While not the media truth, that is the statistical truth.\n\nThis is reality. Indeed, if the ugliest expressions of racism are interracial assaults, rapes and murders, the heaviest concentrations of racism in America are in the black communities themselves. But the preferred story of the Times and mainstream media, of most cable channels and social media, is white cops victimizing black folks.\n\nThus we have all heard about Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, and Freddie Gray, but few know even the number of black folks gunned down annually in their own black communities.\n\nThe press is not interested in ferreting out those statistics. Why? Such stats would muddy the message the media seek to send and reinforce: i.e., America must confront the crisis of rogue cops. What is coming is not difficult to predict.\n\nAs, invariably, white cops clash with black suspects, the media will seize upon and pump up every episode that fits and advances their scripted narrative. Angry and violent protests will occur. There will be judicial proceedings and trials, like that of the West Baltimore cops coming up.\n\nAmerica will divide and take sides. And the rival \"war on cops\" and \"Black lives matter!\" claims will be adjudicated in the election of 2016.\n\nIn 1968, Richard Nixon rode the law-and-order issue into the White House. Hillary Clinton seems to be moving to capture the \"Black-Lives-Matter!\" constituencies. As for the Republicans, they seem to be acting more like the John Lindsays and Bill Scrantons of yesteryear than the Nixons and Ronald Reagans. But someone is going to pick up this issue.\n\nPatrick J. Buchanan is the author of The Greatest Comeback: How Richard Nixon Rose From Defeat to Create the New Majority.

      "text": "[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O3OX5xUJQag&w=525&h=300]\n\nAbove, the body cam video from Baton Rouge police officer Blane Salamoni (who was fired yesterday), recording the confrontation he and his partner had with Alton Sterling. It ended with Sterling dead. The video has extremely raw language, so don't watch it at work or with children around. But do watch it with the sound up. You need to listen to how Salamoni treated Sterling.\n\nThe Baton Rouge Advocate writes:\n\nOn his body camera video, Salamoni can be heard shouting profanities at Sterling from the beginning of the encounter, threatening to shoot Sterling in the head if he fails to place his hands on the hood of a vehicle. Sterling seems confused at times throughout the encounter - asking the officers, \"What I did, sir?\" and, seconds later, telling them they are hurting his arm.\n\nSurveillance at Triple S Food Mart shows an overhead angle of where Sterling was selling homemade CDs before he was approached by Baton Rouge officers, as well as Salamoni quickly becoming physical with Sterling - placing him in a headlock within seconds of arriving on the scene and drawing his service weapon almost immediately after.\n\nAnd:\n\n\"Don't f****** move or I'll shoot your f****** ass, bitch!\" Salamoni screams. \"Put your f****** hands on the car! Put your hands on the car or I'll shoot you in your f****** head, you understand me? Don't you f****** move, you hear me?\"\n\nAfter the shooting, a breathless Salamoni curses at Sterling, repeatedly calling him a \"stupid motherf*****\" and several other profanities as Sterling lies motionless on the ground.\n\nWatching the Salamoni body cam video, it's not hard to see how Sterling could have been very confused by what the police officers were ordering him to do. There was a long federal investigation of this case, which resulted in no charges, as well as a state investigation, which also produced no charges.\n\nBlane Salamoni may or may not deserve jail, but he does not have the temper to carry a gun and be authorized to use deadly force. With officers like that on the force, no wonder black people are afraid of cops. I'd be afraid if I were confronted by a police officer that threatened to blow my head off only seconds after engaging me - and with me not doing anything threatening to him.\n\nIf you don't think we have a problem with violent police, watch the video above. At the beginning of the Alton Sterling affair, a former police officer who has strong feelings about police brutality took me through the available video, and told me that the police would likely not be charged, because their actions were legally justifiable, but that they were guilty of terrible police practice - not a crime, maybe, but still, Alton Sterling is dead, and he didn't have to be.\n\nNow, to be fair, Sterling had a rap sheet a mile long, and was armed with a pistol even though he was forbidden by law from owning a gun. The pistol was in his front right pocket, and it emerged when the two officers were wrestling him to the ground. Other video shows Sterling's right hand was free in the seconds before he was shot, and that he appeared to be reaching for the gun in his pocket. This fact is probably why neither the feds nor the state charged the officers in the case.\n\nStill. Still. It should never have escalated to that point. I had in the past assumed the fault was entirely Sterling's, for not complying with the officers' lawful orders. The Salamoni body cam video shows that Salamoni's extremely hostile approach could have confused Sterling. Watch the video. Can you guarantee that you would have been able to do what those police ordered you to do, given the way they rushed him?\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "The more I see of Dallas Police Chief David Brown, the more respect and affection I have for him. Here's a clip from his press briefing today:\n\n[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3RtnQ2GqBeg]\n\nHe said:\n\nWe're asking cops to do too much in this country. We are. We just ask of us to do too much. Every societal failure, we put it off on the cops to solve. Not enough mental-health funding. Let the cop handle it. Not enough drug-addiction funding. Let's give it to the cops. Here in Dallas, we got a loose-dog problem. Let's have the cops chase loose dogs. Schools fail, give it to the cops. Seventy percent of the African American community is being raised by single women. Let's give it to the cops to solve that as well. That's too much to ask. Policing was never meant to solve all those problems, and I just ask for other parts of our democracy, along with the free press, to help us. . . .\n\nServe your communities. Don't be a part of the problem. We're hiring. We're hiring. Get off that protest line and put an application in. And we'll put you in your neighborhood, and we will help you resolve some of the problems you're protesting about.\n\nChief Brown tells it straight. But it's not just cops. It's teachers too. This line from J.D. Vance's new book Hillbilly Elegy :\n\nAs a teacher at my old high school told me recently, 'They want us to be shepherds to these kids. But no one wants to talk about the fact that many of them are raised by wolves.'\n\nI know there are bad, lazy teachers in this world, but I get tired of the way so many people are quick to blame the problems of our schools on teachers in general. I don't know how many of you readers are teachers, or know teachers, but they are on the front lines of America's social unraveling. We expect them to be both parents and social workers, because so many parents are functionally AWOL. No politician is ever going to blame lousy parents for the fact that their kids are doing badly in school. No politician is ever going to tell a parent that they don't have a right to expect society's institutions to make up for their own laziness and selfishness. Just blame the teachers.\n\nI'm thinking tonight of something I heard a friend's mom say a few years back when I was having dinner at their place. \"The churches don't teach these young people anything about the Bible anymore,\" she said. \"They don't even teach the Ten Commandments.\"\n\nMy friend, who is a practicing Christian, said, \"Hey Mom, what are the Ten Commandments?\" His mother managed two or three of them, but that was it. He said to her, \"I'm not sure how you would know what the churches do or don't teach kids, because you hardly ever go to church.\" Oh, the old lady was mad !\n\nLater, my friend and I were talking about that exchange. I said that his mother had a point. The research on Moralistic Therapeutic Deism proves it.\n\n\"I know that,\" he said. \"I just get tired of hearing my mother blame pastors for everything. You think she ever taught me anything about the Bible growing up?\"\n\nAnd you know, I had to reflect on how a Catholic priest friend put Catholic me and my best Catholic friend in our places back around the year 2000. We just loved to complain about all the church's failings, especially of catechesis. Our priest friend was often murder on the church's shortcomings, but he had had enough of our griping. He said that we had no reason to sit around waiting for the clergy and the institution to get its act together. Read! he said. Educate yourselves in the faith! What are you waiting for?\n\nThat advice has stayed with me all these years. Come to think of it, it's part of the spirit of this Benedict Option book I'm not far from finishing. It's about how Christians cannot outsource the religious and moral formation of our children to churches and religious schools that are in some cases overwhelmed, and in other cases too weak or unbelieving to do the job. And even if the church or school is really good at it, it's still our job to teach our kids , and to help those religious instructors complete their mission. Just like it's our job to raise our kids right, and discipline them, rather than let them run wild and expect the police to handle it.\n\nOne of the big lessons of J.D. Vance's book is that so many of those poor white people - Vance's people - were the authors of their own misery, and visited all that misery on their children, who fell into the same cycle of despair, including drug abuse. Vance speaks bluntly and persuasively about how people condemn themselves and their children to mental slavery through mind-forg'd manacles of self-pity and fatalism. His point is not that people have not suffered from injustice, economic and otherwise. He does not say that they are to blame entirely for their condition. Rather, his point is that despite the rotten hand these people have been dealt, the only way to break the cycle, if it can be broken, is to take responsibility for oneself, and to believe that one's life can change through the decisions one makes - or it can remain the same, depending on the decisions one makes.\n\nThis is true of every single one of us, rich, poor, and otherwise. I'm not talking \"think and grow rich\" nonsense. I'm talking about self-control. Thank God my priest Father Matthew did not pity me when I came to him full of anger at my dad for his hard-headedness, and the way he kept hurting me. My father really was guilty of these things, and for all I knew, Father Matthew felt sorry for me having to struggle with them. But he never once let me feel sorry for myself, or settle for one second into the role of victim - this, even though I was being treated unjustly, with serious physical and emotional effects. Rather, he insisted firmly on my Christian duty to love my dad, period. That didn't mean put up with his mistreating me, but it did mean not allowing anger at injustice rule my heart. In fact, Father Matthew told me that I'm not responsible before God for my dad's sins, but for my own. What am I doing about them? Am I rooting them out in my heart and repenting of them? If not, why not? What's my excuse?\n\nI knew he was right, even though I didn't want to hear it, and I did what he said, though I hated doing it. Because I did, six or seven months later, I was there the day that my dad said he was sorry for the way he had treated me - a day of grace I never thought would come. And I was able to be there at my dad's bedside on his final days, even holding his hand as he drew his last breath. It was a gift - a priceless gift - I could not have imagined receiving in this lifetime. It would never have been mine had I stood on anger at personal injustice, and had I not been told by my spiritual father to turn on that anger in my own heart and root it out. What a severe mercy that all was. And what liberation. I'm serious: liberation. To have learned that if I allowed Him to do so, God would give me the strength not to succumb to my passions, and to realize my own moral agency.\n\nLet me be clear here: my priest was not saying that we have to call what is unjust just, and what is a lie the truth. Nor was he blaming me for the pain I felt over the way my dad treated me. What he was saying is this: we cannot allow sin - sloth, wrathfulness, lust, gluttony, or any other sin - to conquer our hearts. All sin is disordered love, and to love justice more than love and mercy is, at least for a Christian, a sin. This is a battle we have to fight until the day we die: against the disorder in our souls and lives (and all sin is disordered love). There's no other way to avoid defeat at the hands of the world.\n\nNobody wants to hear that. I sure as hell didn't want to hear it when my priest spoke those hard words to me. But they were words of truth, and life. Not a soul on this earth could have fixed the problems I was struggling with then (or the ones I'm struggling with now). Only me, by God's grace, and with the help of those dear ones willing to assist me. God was willing to help me, and so were the people who loved me, but without my firm and sustained assent, they would and could have done nothing. Because free will.\n\nIn J.D. Vance's case, it took losing his free will as a US Marine to gain the gift of self-control that served him well when he got out, and still does. A people and a nation that lacks inner discipline will be the kind of people who need more cops and authority figures to tell it what to do, or at least expect to be taken care of by agents of the state and other institutions. That is not a healthy nation. It's the difference between a nation of citizens, and a nation of consumers.\n\nUPDATE: David Brooks has a column today , datelined San Antonio, in which he says that we came close last week to unleashing some national demons. The country is going to be led by a cynical, unethical president, but at the local level, there are leaders doing good work (like, I would say, Chief Brown). Excerpt:\n\nAmerica still has great resources at the local and social level. Here in San Antonio, there are cops who know how to de-escalate conflicts by showing dignity and respect. Everywhere I go there are mayors thinking practically and non-dogmatically. Can these local leaders move upward and redeem the national system, or will the national politics become so deranged that it will outweigh and corrupt all the good that is done block by block?\n\nI'm betting the local is more powerful, that the healthy growth on the forest floor is more important than the rot in the canopy. But last week was a confidence shaker. There's a cavity beneath what we thought was the floor of national life, and there are demons there.\n\nBaton Rouge sure could use some effective local leadership right about now. Except for a brief appearance at a press conference, the city's African-American mayor-president, Kip Holden, has been absent since the Alton Sterling shooting. It is shocking, really. He's a black politician who has - or had - the confidence of whites and blacks. But the one moment when his city-parish needed him more than anything, he choked. Stayed at home while protesters and police clashed on the streets of his own city. This is what he will be remembered for.\n\nRod Dreher is a contributing editor at The American Conservative and was senior editor at TAC for twelve years.

      "text": "After the massacre of five Dallas cops, during a protest of police shootings of black men in Louisiana and Minnesota, President Obama said, \"America is not as divided as some have suggested.\"\n\nFormer D.C. Police Chief Charles Ramsey, an African-American, says we are \"sitting on a powder keg.\"\n\nPut me down as agreeing with the president. For when a real powder keg blew in the '60s, I was there. And this is not it.\n\nIn 1965, the Watts area of Los Angeles exploded in the worst racial violence since the New York draft riot of 1863 when Lincoln had to send in veterans of Gettysburg. After six days of looting, shooting, and arson in LA, there were 34 dead, 1,000 injured, 4,000 arrested.\n\nIn 1967, Newark, New Jersey, and Detroit exploded, bringing out not only the Guard but the 82nd Airborne. After Dr. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968, a hundred American cities burst into flame.\n\nTroops defended the White House. Marines mounted machine guns on the Capitol steps. Thousands of soldiers patrolled the city. The 7th and 14th street corridors of my hometown, D.C., were gutted and would not be rebuilt for years. That was a powder keg-that went off.\n\nBut only crazed cop-haters applaud that Dallas atrocity by the delusional anti-white racist Micah X. Johnson. As for the shootings of Philando Castile in Minnesota and Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, almost all agree they must be investigated, and justice done.\n\nChief Ramsey says he expects trouble at the conventions. But if Black Lives Matter shows up to raise hell in Cleveland, then that is going to be a problem for Hillary Clinton.\n\nThis writer was on the 19th floor of the \"Comrade Hilton\" in August 1968, looking down as Mayor Daley's finest marched up Balbo to Michigan Avenue, then stormed into Grant Park to deliver street justice to the radicals calling them \"pigs.\"\n\n\"A police riot\" liberals raged. The cops beat \"our children\" up.\n\nRichard Nixon came down on the side of the cops, carried Illinois and won the election. Liberals were still calling \"law and order\" code words for racism. Most Americans had come to recognize they were the indispensable elements of a decent and civilized society.\n\n\"Richard Nixon,\" lamented Hunter S. Thompson, \"is living in the White House today because of what happened that night in Chicago.\"\n\nThis weekend, Rudy Giuliani called Black Lives Matter \"inherently racist.\" Does he not have a point?\n\nAfter the death of Eric Garner in a police takedown, Black Lives Matter led mobs onto the streets and highways of Manhattan chanting, \"What do we Want? Dead Cops! When do we want them? Now!\"\n\nIn anti-police demonstrations since, another chant has been, \"Pigs in a blanket, fry 'em like bacon.\"\n\nThis is pure hatred, and as it is directed against white cops, racist.\n\nObama should tell Black Lives Matter to stop the hate. But though he has shown no reluctance to lecture white America, he has rarely shown the same stern judgment with black America.\n\nNow there is no denying that urban black communities are among the most heavily policed. Why? As Heather Mac Donald, author of The War on Cops , writes of a city she knows well:\n\nBlack people make up 23 percent of New York's population, but they commit 75 percent of all shootings. ... Whites are 33 percent of the city's population, but they commit fewer than 2 percent of all shootings. ...\n\nThese disparities mean that virtually every time that police in New York are called out after a shooting, they are being summoned into minority neighborhoods looking for minority suspects.\n\nAs these percentages are unlikely to change, we are going to have more collisions between black males and white cops. Some will end in the shooting of black criminals and suspects and, on occasion, innocent black men. Some are going to result in the death of cops.\n\nMistakes are going to be made, and tragedies occur, as with the shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice, killed in Cleveland while waving a toy pistol.\n\nBut if there is to be a social explosion every time an incident occurs, like the deaths of Trayvon Martin, shot while beating a neighborhood watch coordinator, and Michael Brown, shot in Ferguson after trying to grab a cop's gun, America is going to be permanently polarized.\n\nAnd there is no doubt where the majority will come down, and who will be the near-term beneficiary.\n\nMonday, Donald Trump declared himself \"the law and order candidate,\" and added: \"America's police ... are what separates civilization from total chaos and destruction of our country as we know it.\"\n\nAnd Clinton? On Friday, she said, \"I'm going to be talking to white people. I think we're the ones who have to start listening.\"\n\nPrediction: If Black Lives Matter does not clean up its act, Obama and Clinton will have to throw this crowd over the side, or the BLM will take her down.\n\nPatrick J.

      "text": "Males - ages 11, 13, and 15 - took video of themselves in car purposely hitting 63-year-old bike rider who was killed: Cops\n\nPolice said the 11-year-old last year shot at a person and was part of a group that rammed a convenience store with a car and stole cigarettes and alcohol from it.\n\nPolice in Albuquerque, New Mexico, said three males - ages 11, 13, and 15 - while riding in a car last year took video of themselves intentionally hitting a 63-year-old bike rider who was killed. The victim was on his way to work.\n\nDetectives on Monday arrested the 13-year-old, police said , adding that they're still looking for the 15-year-old. KRQE-TV reported late Tuesday that the 11-year-old also was caught. Blaze News is not naming the suspects due to their ages.\n\n'Just bump him, brah. ... Yeah, just bump him. Go like ... 15 ... 20.'\n\nPolice said Scott Dwight Habermehl was riding his bike to work at Sandia National Laboratories around 4:40 a.m. on May 29, 2024, when he was struck by the car.\n\nThe males recorded video of themselves hitting the victim, police said, adding that the car's driver - believed to be the 13-year-old - swerved from the southbound lane on Moon Street onto a dedicated bike lane and struck Habermehl.\n\nPolice said the males in the car saw the flashing light on the bicycle, and audio from the recorded video indicates they planned to hit the bicyclist.\n\nThe video captured conversation between the males, police said, adding that the driver said he was about to hit the bike rider, and the vehicle appears to accelerate. The backseat passenger - who police said appears to be the 15-year-old - said not to hit the bike rider going too fast: \"Just bump him, brah.\" Police said the driver replied, \"Like bump him?\" The backseat passenger replied, \"Yeah, just bump him. Go like ... 15 ... 20.\"\n\nPolice said the front passenger - believed to be the 11-year-old - was waving a handgun and ducked and laughed as the vehicle struck Habermehl. Police said the impact produced loud noises, including metal flexing, and Habermehl and his bicycle were sent over the top of the vehicle.\n\nYou can view a video report here about the crime; it includes cellphone clips of three males in the vehicle.\n\nMore from police:\n\nDetectives secured warrants for social media accounts and a search of phones that were previously seized from the 11-year-old and the 13-year-old during a separate investigation in June 2024, police said.\n\nThe police department's Digital Intelligence Team identified several video clips showing all three of the suspects, including the original video of the crash, police said.\n\nDetectives arrested the 13-year-old Monday \"based on several charges, including an open count of murder, conspiracy to commit murder, leaving the scene of an accident involving great bodily harm or death, and unlawful possession of a handgun by a person.\"\n\nHomicide detectives also charged the 15-year-old with the same crimes, police said, adding that the 11-year-old is too young to be charged with murder. Police said detectives are working with the district attorney's office and New Mexico Children, Youth, and Families Department to determine what charges he may face and if he can be held on those charges.\n\nPolice said the 13-year-old will be booked into the Juvenile Detention Center. KRQE said the 11-year-old was turned over to the state CYFD.\n\nKRQE said it didn't have the 11-year-old's date of birth, so it isn't yet clear if he was 10 years old in May 2024 or if he had just turned 11.\n\nPolice said they \"had contact\" with the 11-year-old last year, and KRQE said it covered at least one of those instances.\n\nJust 12 days before the hit-and-run that took Habermehl's life in May 2024, police said the 11-year-old and three teenagers crashed a stolen car into the Daily Needs Convenience store on Indian School Road, the station reported. After ramming the store twice, they jumped over the counters and grabbed cigarettes and alcohol, KRQE added.\n\nThe single mother who owned the car told the station she was \"heartbroken because, again, this is my only mode of transportation, and to see how my car was used ... was heartbreaking because I work so hard for what I have.\"\n\nKRQE said it didn't have the 11-year-old's date of birth, so it isn't yet clear if he was 10 years old in May 2024 or if he had just turned 11. Police added to the station that he also was involved in a 2024 incident in which he shot at a person.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "How cops lured a pastor to city hall to arrest him on charges of unnatural intercourse, statutory rape, and child pornography\n\n'The evidence we have against him is pretty substantial.'\n\nA Mississippi pastor has been arrested on accusations of several child sex crimes , according to police.\n\nChristopher Willett, a pastor at the First Presbyterian Church in Crystal Springs, was arrested Tuesday.\n\nFollowing an investigation, police reportedly executed search warrants on Willett's vehicles, laptops, cell phones, and house.\n\nCrystal Springs Police Chief Robert Thomas revealed how and why law enforcement thought it was necessary to lure the pastor to city hall as a safety precaution.\n\nThe Clarion-Ledger reported, \"Thomas said police arrested Willett on Tuesday by asking him to come to City Hall under the pretense of discussing other matters. This approach was deemed necessary for safety precautions due to Willett's known possession of firearms in his home.\"\n\nThomas said of the arrest of Willett, \"There was no fight, no refusal ... no struggle. We put the handcuffs on him, brought him to the police department, and put him in the interrogation room, where he refused to talk.\"\n\nWillett, an ordained minister of the Presbyterian Church in America, is being held in the Copiah County Jail with no bond.\n\nAccording to WAPT-TV , Willett was charged with statutory rape, sexual battery, unnatural intercourse, computer luring of a person, and child pornography .\n\nOn March 7, the alleged female victim went to the Crystal Springs Police Station with a psychologist - a friend of the victim's family.\n\nChief Thomas said the victim told investigators that Willet had molested her.\n\nThomas told the Clarion-Ledger that the alleged child sex abuse began when the victim was 15 years old; the victim is now 19 years old.\n\nFollowing an investigation, police reportedly executed search warrants on Willett's vehicles, laptops, cell phones, and house.\n\nLaw enforcement interviewed the alleged victim a second time for approximately 90 minutes, in which she detailed additional child sex abuse accusations against the pastor. Soon after the interview, police filed child sex crime charges against Willett.\n\nWhile Thomas noted that the charges are \"only accusations,\" he also stressed that \"the evidence we have against him is pretty substantial.\"\n\nThe Clarion-Ledger said it reached out to determine if Willett still is employed at the church but that there wasn't a timely response.\n\nWillett is still featured on the First Presbyterian Church website as a pastor and teaching elder. His bio on the website of First Presbyterian Church in Crystal Springs reads : \"Before moving to Crystal Springs to become the Senior Pastor in October of 2020, he held the offices of Pastoral Intern and Assistant Pastor at Pinewood Presbyterian Church in Middleburg, Florida, for 5 years. He then served as the Senior/Solo Pastor of Columbia Presbyterian Church in Columbia, Mississippi, for 3 years.\"\n\nThe church site adds that \"Chris served in the U.S. Air Force as a Weather Forecaster, and earned a B.S. in Interdisciplinary Studies (Humanities, Communication, and Business Management) from New York Institute of Technology , and obtained his Master's of Divinity at Reformed Theological Seminary, Orlando.\"\n\nThe bio also says Willett married his wife, Jennifer, in 2000. They have a daughter together.\n\n\"When he is not studying for and writing sermons, planning ministries, or working around the church and home, he enjoys watching shows with his wife, playing board games and video games with his daughter, reading (fiction, comics, and non-fiction), all things 'Star Wars,' and being a Stormtrooper,\" the church page says of Willett.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Rochester mayor criticizes cops for violating 'sanctuary city' policies by helping Border Patrol on traffic stop\n\nOne city council member said there was a lot of 'disdain' for Latinos.\n\nThe Democrat mayor of Rochester, New York, is facing backlash after he criticized police who answered a call to help Border Patrol on a traffic stop on Monday.\n\nRochester Mayor Malik Evans held a press conference Wednesday with Rochester Police Chief David Smith to chastise the two officers for violating their \"sanctuary city\" policies.\n\n'The reality is, there's a lot more profiling, there's a lot more disdain for being Latino right now in this country.'\n\nBorder Patrol stopped the van at about 5:30 p.m. near the intersection of Lyell Avenue and Whitney Street and called for backup about a half-hour later. Smith said that officers acted on their own out of the view of the RPD supervisor who first responded to the call.\n\n\"The officers on the scene verbally directed the occupants to get out of the vehicle, and this is against our policy,\" said the mayor.\n\n\"What is also very concerning is that RPD officers went out of view of the supervisor who was on scene to initiate contact with occupants of the vehicle while Border Patrol stands by,\" Smith added, \"when in reality, they [Border Patrol] should be initiating contact and we should be there ensuring their safety.\"\n\nEvans said police will receive more instruction about the sanctuary city order.\n\n\"Our policy is crystal clear. City police officers do not help or participate in federal immigration activities,\" he added.\n\nThe Locust Club, a Rochester Police union, released a statement defending the officers.\n\n\"RPD did not initiate this traffic stop and had no information about the occupants whatsoever. The agents asked the officers to assist in having the occupants exit the vehicle, which ultimately the occupants did without resistance,\" read the statement.\n\n\"The officers placed the occupants in handcuffs for officer safety without incident and left them with the HSI agents on scene,\" the statement continued. \"The officers on scene asked no questions of the occupants about their immigration status or relevant documents. No force was used.\"\n\nThe union accused the mayor of overreacting to the incident and said the officers involved did nothing wrong.\n\nCity Council President Miguel Melendez suggested that the policies were needed in order to oppose racism against Latinos.\n\n\"The reality is, there's a lot more profiling, there's a lot more disdain for being Latino right now in this country,\" he said. \"With that being said, we have a policy. It is the responsibility of the council to ensure that we are following these policies.\"\n\nAnother city council member said she viewed video from the incident and that officers were threatening immigrant construction workers in the van.\n\nThe city first adopted \"sanctuary city\" polices in 1986 and reaffirmed those policies 21 years later in 2017.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Ferguson Through The Eyes of an Officer\n\nOn July 30, 2014, a husband and father of two was shot at point blank range in a relatively quiet residential area of Mendota Heights, Minnesota.\n\nThe man's name was Officer Scott Patrick , and he was performing a traffic stop on a driver who-it was later discovered-was a wanted fugitive. Patrick didn't even have a chance to grab his gun.\n\nIn the midst of the chaos in Ferguson, Missouri, there have been several debates jockeying for position. Last week I spoke to what is perhaps the biggest one- that this tragedy is indicative that racism is alive and well in our country. This is second only to the narrative that there is an extensive problem with police nation-wide.\n\nLet's step back for a second. Do we really understand what it means to be a cop? And does one altercation between an officer and a now-deceased teen really define it all?\n\nAP Photo\n\nMeet Túlio Tourinho, a Brazilian immigrant, Iraq War veteran and police officer in a large Kentucky metro area. (Tourinho appeared on TheBlaze Radio's Chris Salcedo Show two weeks ago - listen here at minute 20:27 for the interview).\n\nOfficer Tourinho is a rare breed in today's society. When it comes to the truth, it's no holds barred with Tourinho-and he's graciously agreed to help debunk some of the widespread myths that surround law enforcement today:\n\nMyth #1: Cops have no feelings; we can't think of them as human.\n\nEveryone's been there. You're blatantly speeding to work, and before you know it, you're pulled on the side of the road. The officer isn't exactly Mr./Ms. Congeniality and you're miffed. \"Geez,\" you think, \"it's not like I'm some kind of deviant.\"\n\nHow precisely does the officer know what you are?\n\n\"People mistake kindness for weakness and criminals will always be 'reading' the officer to see if they can 'take' the officer,\" Tourinho noted. \"And because the officer conducting routine traffic stops or answering to routine runs for service has no idea who the person/people are, or what they're capable of, it's imperative that the officer not be complacent and treat all events as a possible threat to his safety.\"\n\nPolice guard the front of the Buzz Westfall Justice Center where a grand jury will begin looking at the circumstances surrounding the fatal police shooting of an unarmed teenager Michael Brown on August 20, 2014 in Clayton, Missouri. Brown was shot and killed by a Ferguson, Missouri police officer on August 9. Despite the Brown family's continued call for peaceful demonstrations, violent protests have erupted nearly every night in Ferguson since his death. (Credit: Scott Olson/Getty Images)\n\nTourinho went on to describe that officers have been killed by the unlikeliest of perpetrators-from the elderly to the disabled and beyond.\n\n\"Unarmed\" doesn't always equal \"un-dangerous.\"\n\nMyth #2: Police should just \"shoot to wound.\"\n\nUnlike the movies and television we're all used to seeing, in which a single bullet (wherever it lands) brings a perpetrator to his knees, it's a little more complicated in real life.\n\n[sharequote align=\"center\"]\"Unarmed\" doesn't always equal \"un-dangerous.\"[/sharequote]\n\n\"Because most deadly encounters with deadly weapons occur within 6 feet of the perpetrator,\" Tourinho said, \"officers are always taught to aim at center mass because it is the largest part of the body. Stopping the threat is always the number one priority. Always. And the threat is stopped when he or she stops moving.\"\n\nApply this principal to your own life. If faced with a deadly threat, your survival is top of mind.\n\n\"Back up might be minutes away, and, during a deadly confrontation, minutes are an eternity,\" Tourinho said.\n\nMyth #3: Deadly force has no ramifications for the cop, so he/she isn't likely to think twice.\n\nThere is a persistent idea that an officer-related shooting event is commonplace, and that there are no consequences.\n\n\"In most cases, months go by before the officer is allowed to return to work,\" Tourinho said, \"The officer is immediately placed on administrative leave with pay, given right to counsel, and offered an array of services such as chaplain or peer support or FOP [Fraternal Order of Police] legal services.\"\n\nIn other words, it's a big deal.\n\n(AP Photo/Manuel Balce Ceneta)\n\nMyth #4: Police just shouldn't use their guns.\n\nIf you've got a suspect who has crossed the line and is willing to attack an armed officer, there's absolutely no telling what could unfold. Not only is deadly force authorized once an attack ensues, but it is often the lesser of two evils in the situation.\n\n\"The officer cannot take any chances,\" said Tourinho, who also points out that if \"an individual is willing to do that to a police officer, how much more is that person capable of inflicting on innocent civilian lives?\"\n\nMyth #5: Race always plays a role in who gets arrested.\n\nIt's simply mathematics. Just as there are probably more white arrestees in a northern Minnesota mining town, there are probably more black arrestees in south Chicago. This is pure demographics.\n\n\"The victim mentality will always suggest that ANY and EVERY encounter between an officer and a black person is a racist encounter,\" lamented Tourinho, \"that's the default presumption.\"\n\nTourinho continues, \"Now, are blacks arrested more than whites [overall]? Yes. Why? Because blacks are committing more crimes. That's a fact. The sociology and economics of it are another matter.\"\n\nNow, take Tourinho's insight and apply it to Ferguson.\n\nWe now have facts ( and 12 witnesses ) that seem to corroborate the officer's story.\n\nWe're now privy to information that suggests Brown was no \"gentle giant,\" but rather that he had roughed up a clerk at the store he robbed (the footage of which Eric Holder himself tried to have suppressed), and that his altercation with Officer Darren Wilson involved a \"bum-rush\" and a blowout fracture to one of Wilson's eye sockets-all while he attempted to grab Wilson's firearm.\n\nDon't get me wrong-all of these facts form part of a growing understanding of what happened in Ferguson-and we still have to wait for the final verdict.\n\nPolice officers man their positions in front of Ferguson businesses just after 10 p.m. on West Florissant Avenue on Saturday, Aug. 16, 2014. A curfew was to go into effect at midnight. (AP Photo/St. Louis Post-Dispatch, Robert Cohen)\n\nBut . . . assuming Wilson's story is true, and with Tourinho's points taken into consideration-what would we have had Wilson do? Allow himself to be killed simply because it would prevent Al Sharpton, Jesse Jackson, and the Department of Justice from turning this into a media circus and a national race issue?\n\nTourinho puts it well: \"What does it say about us, as humans, when we are unwilling to give a police officer, someone who places their life on the line for the sake of innocents, the benefit of the doubt; when we are so hell-bent on judging, crucifying and burying a police officer without any due process or before all the facts are made evident? If we are willing to give a civilian the benefit of the discovery and fact-finding, why are we so unwilling to give cops the same?\"\n\nEven if Wilson is everything the Ferguson protestors say he is, we've got a justice system to fix that. Let's not throw the baby out with the bath water by making this about all cops.\n\nThe reality is that the average cop is no different than the average salesman, accountant, or writer . . . they just want to do their job, and go home alive at the end of the day. How many of us have the luxury of waking up without the relentless reality that today might be your last watch, just because somebody didn't want to go to jail, or because someone took issue with your profession?\n\nWhether people like it or not, every officer walks a thin blue line for society. There's very little between the people they protect, and the danger on the other side.\n\nDo a little soul-searching. Would you really walk that line by yourself?\n\nMary Ramirez is a full time writer, creator of www.afuturefree.com - a political commentary blog, and contributor to The Chris Salcedo Show.

You people are next,\" the station said.\n\nThose words reportedly were among those engraved on bullet casings found at the scene of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson's targeted, fatal shooting last week and apparently refer to health insurance claim denial tactics. The words are similar to the main title of a 2010 book \"Delay, Deny, Defend: Why Insurance Companies Don't Pay Claims and What You Can Do About It.\"\n\nAccording to an arrest affidavit, police said the FBI contacted them about the alleged threat issued during the phone call - the entirety of which was recorded, WFLA said.\n\nInvestigators said Boston could be heard stating near the end of the call, \"Delay, deny, depose. You people are next,\" the station reported, adding that the affidavit noted the three words have become nationally recognized as a phrase \"directed against insurance companies.\"\n\nPolice spoke to Boston at her home in Lakeland, WLFA said, adding that she reportedly admitted to using those words during the call and told detectives that \"health care companies played games and deserved karma from the world because they are evil.\"\n\nBoston reportedly added to detectives that she used the phrase \"because it's what is in the news right now\" and learned of it because of the UnitedHealthcare CEO's fatal shooting, the station said.\n\nWFLA, citing police, said Boston also noted that she doesn't own any firearms and \"was not a danger to anyone.\"\n\nInvestigators said they believed Boston meant to threaten the insurance company \"by using the UnitedHealthcare CEO's homicide to her advantage,\" the station said, adding that the affidavit says Boston was charged with threats to conduct a mass shooting or an act of terrorism.\n\nWFLA said a judge set her bond at $100,000 and stated that \"I do find that the bond of $100,000 is appropriate considering the status of our country at this point.\"\n\nBlaze News on Wednesday reported that law enforcement is sounding the alarm over graffiti, flyers, and online posts that not only support Thompson's death but also threaten other CEOs.\n\nLike Blaze News?

What's more, court documents indicate that some discovered images show the wife nude with children who also are unclothed, NJ.com reported .\n\nThe suspects reportedly have been released from jail.\n\n'These actions are not only abhorrent but have also shaken our community's sense of security and trust in those who are sworn to protect us.'\n\nNew Jersey State Police arrested Brian DiBiasi, 39, and his wife, 42-year-old Elizabeth DiBiasi, on Jan. 29.\n\nMore from NJ.com:\n\nAfter appearing in Burlington County Superior Court last week, the couple were released from Monmouth County Jail, according to NJ.com.\n\nBlaze News on Thursday reached out to the office of state Attorney General Matthew J. Platkin and asked if the children in question are the couple's children; officials there told Blaze News they \"do not provide defendants' identifying information when doing so could compromise the anonymity of the children victimized\" and would neither confirm nor deny if the victims were their children.\n\nElizabeth DiBiasi's attorney - Jerry Ballarotto - told NJ.com that both suspects have stipulations connected to their release, including restricted travel and not being able to see their children without approval from child protective services.\n\nThe state attorney general said authorities in New Jersey received a tip regarding child sex crimes from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children on Jan. 28.\n\n'Sexual offenses against children are among the most serious crimes we charge. It's especially disturbing when, as in this case, the accused are members of law enforcement.'\n\nA suspect had allegedly \"uploaded and distributed unidentified, possibly newly produced or homemade content, specifically, image and video files of suspected child sexual exploitation/abuse material\" to a mobile messaging platform, the state attorney general said.\n\n\"The user allegedly distributed multiple media files containing nude images of his wife in the presence of children. In the chat logs, the suspect allegedly mentioned children being present while he and his wife had sex. The cyber tip line reported a total of 36 files allegedly uploaded from an account belonging to the user,\" according to the state attorney general.\n\nThe files appeared on the social media app Kik on an account that led to the couple's home, authorities told NJ.com.\n\nPolice reportedly tracked the Kik account to the couple's home in Hamilton Township. Law enforcement conducted an early-morning raid at their house on Jan. 29.\n\nCiting officials, NJ.com reported that Brian DiBiasi admitted to investigators that he was the owner of the Kik account and confessed to distributing the files.\n\nElizabeth DiBiasi has served 18 years with the Mercer County Sheriff's Office. She has been suspended without pay from her $134,000-a-year job, a police spokesperson told NJ.com .\n\nBrian DiBiasi served 21 years with the Hamilton police with a salary of $136,000 a year.\n\nHamilton Mayor Jeff Martin stated in a press release , \"These actions are not only abhorrent but have also shaken our community's sense of security and trust in those who are sworn to protect us.\"\n\nState Attorney General Platkin said in a statement , \"Sexual offenses against children are among the most serious crimes we charge. It's especially disturbing when, as in this case, the accused are members of law enforcement.\"\n\nLike Blaze News?

Police spotted one of the vehicles and tried to pull over the driver who instead fled, which led to a police pursuit that ended in a crash westbound on I-94 near Cedar Avenue, the station said.\n\nKMSP, citing the release, said the vehicle's occupants fled on foot - but police \"quickly apprehended\" four individuals.\n\nA second vehicle - which police said was stolen - was nearby and also crashed, police told the station. With that, two occupants from that vehicle fled on foot and were caught, KMSP said.\n\nThe station said three other vehicles were involved in the crashes, but none of the occupants in those vehicles were injured.\n\nKMSP said six juveniles - three males ages 11, 12, and 13 years old, and three females ages 12 and 14 years old - were arrested after the crashes. They were taken to hospitals for evaluations concerning non-life-threatening injuries, the station said.\n\nPolice told KMSP the suspects were to be booked into the Juvenile Detention Center.\n\nThe arrested 12-year-old male had \"multiple prior contacts\" with Minneapolis police while the others had \"no or limited prior contact\" with police and were to be \"referred to juvenile diversion programs,\" the station said, citing the release.\n\nKMSP said police were still investigating each child's involvement in the three robberies and if they were involved in any other criminal activity.\n\n\"The fact that I see this activity continuing with children so young - despite all our efforts - is incredibly frustrating and highlights the urgent need for action,\" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian O'Hara said, according to the station. \"I am grateful for the immediate response of law enforcement in finding and arresting these juveniles before they could cause more harm to members than of our community or themselves.\"\n\nCheck out this surveillance video showing one suspect cross the interstate - nearly getting hit - before getting arrested.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "Big Brother Ford awarded patent to snitch to cops when you speed\n\nTech by Blaze Media\n\nCompanies can now use technology to inform on you while driving.\n\nFord, once an icon of American innovation, now wants to take the lead on another emerging and upcoming trend - mass surveillance.\n\nIn January 2023, Ford filed a patent application for a new technology that would allow it to track the driving behavior of vehicles on the road and report speeding violations to law enforcement. Vehicles would have cameras that activate if they detect speeding vehicles nearby and capture high-quality images of the offending vehicle and its identifying features, such as license plates or accessories attached to the offending car. Then, those images and GPS data would be shared with local law enforcement to decide whether to initiate a chase.\n\nMany believe that these cameras violate drivers' privacy. But it shouldn't come as a surprise that corporations and governments worldwide already have methods to spy on their citizens. Governments have been found to hack into private individuals' phones through software provided by corporations, and the NSA admits to purchasing Americans' sensitive data.\n\nLocal law enforcement has always partnered with corporations to surveil the public by installing cameras to detect speeding and running red lights. These cameras have come under fire for their questionable legality and efficacy, spurring some states to ban them.\n\nCar makers already have a habit of violating drivers' privacy. A New York Times reporter found that General Motors 'tricked millions of drivers into being spied on' by tracking detailed driving data and adjusting insurance rates accordingly; those with supposedly poor driving behavior would see their rates increase.\n\nIn Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott signed a bill to ban red-light cameras in 2019, two years after KXAN , an Austin-based NBC affiliate, reported that almost all cities with red-light cameras had illegally issued traffic tickets. Their investigation also found that drivers paid the city of Austin over $7 million in fines since the cameras were installed, and cities in Texas made over $500 million from the cameras since 2007.\n\nFor now, Ford's new camera idea remains a patent application, so it's not certain whether we'll see F-150s snitching on you for going five mph over the limit, even if Ford is granted the patent. But if it does become reality, we'll probably see F-150s snitching on you for no reason at all. After all, if red-light cameras are faulty, why won't Ford's camera be?\n\nCar makers already have a habit of violating drivers' privacy. A New York Times reporter found that General Motors \"tricked millions of drivers into being spied on\" by tracking detailed driving data and adjusting insurance rates accordingly; those with supposedly poor driving behavior would see their rates increase.\n\nAs a result, lawmakers urged the Federal Trade Commission to crack down on car makers' privacy violations. In a letter to the FTC, Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) and Sen. Ed Markey (D-Mass.) accused GM, Honda, and Hyundai of spying on drivers and selling data for pennies. In the letter , they claim that Honda sold data from 97,000 cars, at a rate of 26 cents per car, to Verisk, a data analytics provider for insurance companies, between 2020 and 2024. Between 2019 and 2024, Hyundai sold data from 1.7 million vehicles, at a rate of 61 cents per car, to Verisk.\n\n\"The FTC should hold accountable the automakers, which shared their customers' data with data brokers without obtaining informed consent, as well as the data brokers, which resold data that had not been obtained in a lawful manner,\" the two senators urged.\n\nCar makers aren't the only ones scheming to snitch on drivers, though. Popular apps like Life360, a location-sharing app popular for families with teens, are accused of selling families' data to insurance companies. Despite being advertised as an app that helps improve families' safety, it violates families' privacy. In 2021, one former X-mode employee claimed, \"Life360 had the 'most valuable offerings due to the sheer volume and precision' compared to other sources of data,\" according to the Verge.\n\nMyRadar, a weather forecast app, and GasBuddy, which finds the cheapest gas stations, are also accused of violating privacy for profit.\n\nSome insurance companies are finding ways to gather driving data without buying it from someone else. Progressive, for example, has a product called the Progressive Snapshot . Drivers voluntarily attach the device to their vehicles, allowing Progressive to track their driving behavior. Each time the device detects a hard brake, it will beep, encouraging drivers to alter their behavior on the road.\n\nProgressive claims that safe drivers will be rewarded with discounts, but it's uncertain whether it will benefit most drivers. People who work in big cities must deal with bumper-to-bumper traffic during rush hour, causing them to brake harder or unexpectedly. Even though frequent hard braking is out of their control, they may see their insurance rates increase.\n\nFortunately, Progressive Snapshot is a voluntary program. However, insurance companies already have ways to track driving behavior without alerting their customers. In an era that feels eerily similar to Orwell's \"1984,\" it's only a matter of time until all Americans realize they're being spied on.\n\n- YouTube youtu.be\n\nEthan Xu"

McAlpin's attorneys say witnesses reported a white attacker, and charges against him were dropped\n\nMcAlpin, who is deaf and suffers from cerebral palsy, subsequently filed a $3.5 million lawsuit against the arresting officers and the Phoenix Police Department after he spent three weeks in custody following the arrest\n\nSurveillance footage from the Dollar Tree store showed the officers leapt on McAlpin within seconds of their arrival on the scene.\n\nAs McAlpin flailed his arms around, one of the officers took him to the floor before a second officer took out their taser.\n\nMcAlpin's attorneys say he was hit with the stun gun several times while being restrained on the floor.\n\nHe was subsequently charged with resisting arrest and aggravated assault, and was held in custody for three weeks before the charges were eventually dropped.\n\nMcAlpin subsequently filed a $3.5 million lawsuit against the arresting officers and the Phoenix Police Department, claiming they 'falsified charges' against him after he was 'attacked, beat and tased.'\n\nAlthough footage of McAlpine's arrest sparked outrage on social media, the Phoenix Law Enforcement Association has defended the officers and accused the media of 'biased reporting' and an 'ugly smear campaign' against the officers.\n\nOfficers maintained that they were so aggressive with McAlpin because he resisted, but he claimed he was trying to tell them he was deaf and couldn't understand their instructions\n\nThe footage was released this week as the Phoenix Police Department suspended the three officers, named as Officers Kyle Sue (pictured), Benjamin Harris, and Jorge Acosta, for 24 hours without pay as punishment\n\nThe Phoenix Law Enforcement Association has defended the officers (pictured is officer Benjamin Harris) and accused the media of 'biased reporting' and an 'ugly smear campaign' against the officers\n\nIn a statement after they were suspended this week, the association slammed Phoenix law enforcement leadership and maintained that McAlpin resisted arrest.\n\n'We are appalled by the determination made by Interim Chief Sullivan to suspend the three officers involved in the McAlpin case,' the union's president, Darrell Kriplean, said.\n\n'A situation that was previously reviewed internally by subject matter experts of the Force Evaluation and Review Unit and deemed to be within policy has suddenly been reversed due to public pressure, based on biased media reporting.'\n\nKriplean said that the officers 'were met with an immediate assault by Mr. McAlpin', adding: 'Our officers have a right to defend themselves against attack. After a significant altercation, our officers were able to take Mr. McAlpine into custody, but not before suffering significant injuries of their own.\n\n'We support accountability when there is actual wrongdoing, but disciplining officers solely because it aligns with public opinion, rather than fact, is wrong and morally corrupt.\n\n'Our officers deserve better than the current leadership at Phoenix PD. Interim Chief Sullivan's inability to defend his officers is shameful and pathetic. We stand behind our officers and thank the men and women of the Phoenix Police Department for their service to our community.'\n\nOfficers claimed McAlpin was aggressive and resisted arrest, while his attorneys say he attempted to raise his hands to his ears to signal that he was deaf, but an officer grabbed his arms before he could do so\n\nInterim Phoenix Police Chief Michael Sullivan defended his decision to suspend the officers, which he said 'reflects our commitment to accountability and maintaining public trust'\n\nIn his own statement, Interim Police Chief Michael Sullivan said: 'The decision to suspend the officers reflects our commitment to accountability and maintaining public trust.\n\n'At the same time, we stand by the men and women of this department who are placed in difficult situations every day.

Please help me,' the worker repeatedly cried out while the officers approached the bathroom door.\n\nThe hostage screamed for help as the officers contemplated how to navigate the situation.\n\n'It's in that door on the left, but the hallway is narrow, bro. It's a setup, you feel me?' one cop said.\n\nBody camera footage showed the officers decided to wait for backup to arrive before rescuing a gas station worker being held hostage\n\nAt least five minutes after the first cops arrived, the officers open the door and find the barefoot attacker holding the worker down on the toilet with a knife\n\n'What you wanna do? You wanna wait?' replied the other.\n\n'I mean, I say we wait for more units, cause I mean, is there another way to get through that door, cause I only hear her,' the officer said.\n\nInstead of busting down the door, the cops asked the assailant to come out of the bathroom on his own.\n\n'Sir, can you come out with your hands up?,' one officer said.\n\nOnce backup arrived, the additional officers started asking the other employee for key to the bathroom. A customer told the cops the bathroom should be unlocked.\n\nFinally, at least five minutes after the first cops arrived, the officers open the door and find the barefoot attacker holding the worker down on the toilet with a knife.\n\nThe victim suffered severe injuries, including cuts to her throat and hands, and had some teeth pulled out by the suspect, reported Fox 35 .\n\nAccording to an arrest report obtained by WKMG , the assailant, Randal Lawton, 63, told police that he had encountered a 'demon' at the gas station.\n\nThe hostage screamed for help as the officers contemplated how to navigate the situation\n\nInstead of busting down the door, the cops asked the assailant to come out of the bathroom on his own\n\nRandal Lawton, 63, was charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, resisting officers without violence and kidnapping\n\n'Randal stated that due to the demon bothering him, he believed that it needed to be punished,' the report stated.

I agree that the videos prompt a need for a thorough review of the incident and the officer's response,' he said.\n\n'I was made aware that after the incident, a debrief was held by the immediate supervisors, in which the response was analyzed and discussed; however, a formal internal notification to my office regarding the incident did not occur, leaving myself unaware of the incident and any concerns surrounding it.\n\n'At this time, an Administrative Investigation has been opened to review the officers' response on scene, and the first two responding officers have been removed from patrol duties and placed on Administrative assignment pending the outcome of the investigation.'\n\nLawton was charged with aggravated battery with a deadly weapon, resisting officers without violence and kidnapping.

Three further officers deny that they had sexual relationships with members of the groups they were targeting.\n\nThe officers spent an average of four years as undercover members of the political groups while mining extensive information about protests, members' identities and even sexualities.\n\nThe Mail previously reported on the case of undercover officer Mark Kennedy, who had sexual relationships with at least 11  women he targeted.\n\nMark Kennedy was part of the Met's National Public Order Intelligence Unit (NPIOU) which along with the SDS employed undercover officers\n\nEleanor Fairbraida is one of 11 known victims of Mark Kennedy - she entered into a sexual relationship with him unaware that he had been sent to spy on her\n\nVictim Eleanor Fairbraida became friends with Kennedy after he attended the Sumac Centre, a community hub in Nottingham from 2003.\n\nHe is known to have had sexual relationships with Fairbraida and as many as 10 other women during his deployment between 2003 and 2010 - in one of the biggest policing scandals in modern times.\n\nFairbraida, 46, who now lives in Bristol, said she and Kennedy were friends for seven years after meeting at the centre and at one point their relationship progressed to become lovers.\n\nBut the whole time he had been sent to spy on the work the activists were doing and was secretly married with two children.\n\nKennedy, 55, had a passport in his undercover name and attended gatherings at power stations like Drax in North Yorkshire and the G8 Summit in Gleneagles in 2005, even travelling around Europe to 'take part in' protests.\n\nHe was so convincing in his role as an environmental activist fighting against climate change that he was even willing to be beaten up by the police while attending the protests.\n\nFairbraida continued: 'He moved into our house. I lived with him and three other people and I stayed with him in his house afterwards.\n\n'We were very close friends. I knew him for seven years. In 2008 our relationship developed and we were lovers for a while.\n\n'At the time we had no idea that this sort of thing happened.'\n\nKate Wilson, an environmental activist, was also duped into a long-term relationship with Kennedy (pictured together)\n\nThe Special Demonstration Squad was operational between 1968 and 2008 while the National Public Order Intelligence Unit worked between 1999 and 2010\n\nFairbraida said Kennedy also formed a long-term relationship with her friend Kate Wilson, as he pretended that they supported the same football team, liked the same music and had the same 'trailer' lifestyle.\n\nIn 2021, Wilson won a landmark tribunal case against the Metropolitan Police for breaches of her human rights.\n\nThe tribunal - in which Fairbraida was a witness - heard he had 'police-issued phones, laptops, passport and bank cards', all in his false identity, and 'had a police-issued van and a flat paid for by the police'.\n\nIt also heard he was told to develop personal relationships in order to gather pre-emptive intelligence' on activists at the centre, with the help of 'an extensive support system for the purpose of this long-term infiltration'.\n\nKennedy's relationships are just one example of the kind of activities being looked into by the national inquiry.\n\nMethods employed by the police spies included using the names of dead children as cover identities without their families' consent.\n\nThe families of 20 children born between 1938 and 1975 have been told that their relatives' details were used, 19 of whom had died young and the other where an officer used a living child's identity.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

'The justice system just works a lot better here.'\n\nRay Bottenfield, a former Santa Monica College Police Captain who retired to Hewitt, Texas, says it has become increasingly difficult to retain or recruit officers in California due to lack of support from the state. Pictured here receiving the Medal of Valor from Barack Obama in 2016\n\nGina Miller, a former deputy at San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, says California's legal system had left officers feeling 'like whatever they did was pointless'. Pictured here at her swearing in ceremony at Lewisville Police Department, Texas\n\nOfficer Miller, 37, moved to her new home in Corinth, Texas, (pictured above) in 2021\n\nLeona said the majority of those who leave headed to Texas, with others finding work in states such as Montana and Arizona.\n\nIt comes as the Golden State is hemorrhaging thousands of police every year, with numbers down by more than 5,000 since 2019.\n\nThere are now fears that high-crime Californian cities are suffering a brain drain in law enforcement, leaving the public unprotected as criminals run riot.\n\nRay Bottenfield, a former Santa Monica College Police Captain who retired to Hewitt, Texas, admitted it had become increasingly difficult to retain or recruit officers due to the lack of support from the state.\n\n'When you're getting beaten up constantly, your cost of living is getting worse and you're dealing with all this political stuff, it is overwhelming,' he told DailyMail.com.\n\nMany in law enforcement blame controversial legislation including Proposition 47 and 57 for turning prisons into 'revolving doors' and putting their lives at risk.\n\nLiberal politicians have staunchly defended their policies, arguing they have been misinterpreted and blamed unfairly for rising crime.\n\nThey say the aim of the reforms was to alleviate pressure on the state's overcrowded prisons and refocus policing efforts on more serious crimes.\n\nRegardless, their efforts appear deeply unpopular among many who patrol the streets.\n\nGina Miller, a former deputy at San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, told DailyMail.com that California's legal system had left officers feeling 'like whatever they did was pointless'.\n\nThe 37-year-old moved to Texas in 2021 and now works for Lewisville Police Department, around 25 miles north of Dallas.\n\nShe said her work now had a purpose again, adding: 'If I take someone to jail they're actually going to stay in jail until they see a judge.'\n\nThe number of law enforcement officers in California has fallen by more than 5,000 since 2019\n\nOfficer Miller said some of her former California colleagues had quit to take up desk jobs tackling welfare fraud because they no longer felt safe patrolling the streets.\n\nIn particular, she hit out at Proposition 57, which she claims has let violent offenders onto the streets.\n\nPut forward by then-Governor Jerry Brown and passed by voters in 2016, the law was designed to reduce prison overcrowding by offering the possibility of early parole for non-violent offenders.\n\nBut critics highlighted a loophole that meant offenses such as domestic violence and assault with a deadly weapon were not included under a list of violent offenses.\n\nIt came under the spotlight after it was revealed that Smiley Martin, a suspect in a  2022 mass shooting in Sacramento that left six dead, was released early from a ten-year sentence for domestic violence and assault under provisions set out in Proposition 57.\n\nMiller claims the law has also put officers' lives at risk by opening the door for violent criminals.\n\nThe officer, whose last assignment during her 11-year stint at San Bernadino was in the relatively safe and affluent city of Rancho Cucamonga, said four of her colleagues at the Sheriff's Department were shot during her final six months.\n\nOne of them, Sergeant Dominic Vaca, 43, was killed after he was shot pursuing a motorcycle without a license plate in 2021.\n\nThere is no indication that the suspect, Bilal Winston Shabazz, had been released early under Proposition 57.\n\nBut Miller said such policies had created a general lawlessness within the state, leaving officers and the public feeling unsafe.\n\nShe recalled a time she took a man to jail for putting a loaded gun to his wife's head, only for him to be released the same day.\n\n'I got into this job to try to help people and make a difference,' she said. 'It was heartbreaking to be telling this victim, \"I know your husband just tried to kill you, but he's already out of jail, so just call us if he comes back\".\n\n'To see their faces, it wears you down. You're like: \"This is stupid, because I can't do anything for anybody\".'\n\nSgt. Dominic Vaca died after being shot in the line of duty in San Bernardino County in 2021\n\nSmiley Martin, a suspect in a 2022 mass shooting in Sacramento that left six dead, was released early from a ten-year sentence for domestic violence and assault under provisions set out under a controversial California law, Proposition 57\n\nThe clash came to a head in the town's mayoral election, when City Council President Brad Pike (left) won a resounding victory in a heated runoff over incumbent Mayor Jason Pierce (right)\n\nOfficer Leona, 38, who spent five years in Tulare County before serving in Fresno County Sheriff's Office for a decade, said he was hospitalized following an assault by a violent criminal.\n\nHe said the suspect, who was 'presumably high on narcotics', had been chasing school children before running into a stranger's garden.\n\nA standoff with police ensued.\n\n'At one point, he hit me over the head with a board,' he recounted. 'I hit him with my baton. He picked me up and threw me through a sliding glass window into the kitchen of this lady's house.\n\n'I was bleeding all over the place. He was bleeding. We're rolling around in the kitchen.\n\n'It took eight officers to finally subdue him. I broke my hand. I had to get sutures on my face.\n\n'Another officer broke his wrist and a third officer had to get sutures or stitches with it.\n\n'He was only in custody for a couple months. And then he got released.'\n\nMiller also claimed Proposition 47 had turned California's prisons into 'revolving doors'.\n\nThe measure, passed by voters in 2014, reclassified some nonviolent offenses as misdemeanors, including shoplifting where the value of the stolen property does not exceed $950.\n\nIt has been blamed by some, including Riverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco and California retail head Rachel Michelin for a rise in thefts after scores of stores in the state suffered brazen heists.\n\nWhether California's legal reforms are directly to blame for such incidents remains the subject of fierce debate.\n\nBut there is little doubt that the 'overwhelming workload' facing officers in high-crime areas are pushing many out.\n\nPolice chiefs across the state have sounded the alarm about their depleted ranks.\n\nThis week, Merced County Sheriff Vern Warnke again warned of a lack of deputies in his department, having previously warned the 'dire' staffing crisis was 'getting kind of scary'.\n\nSacramento Chief of Police Kathy Lester said in June that her department was 'woefully understaffed', while the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, the region's largest law enforcement agency, is suffering from a 20 percent shortfall of deputies.\n\nIn 2022, more than 230 San Diego police officers left the department - the highest separation rate in more than a decade.\n\nThe department lost patrol officers and detectives, seasoned homicide investigators, collision reconstruction experts, SWAT officers, canine handlers, training officers and police helicopter pilots.\n\nTwo thirds of those losses were resignations, not retirements. Nearly half those resignations were by officers who went to other law enforcement agencies.\n\nThe Public Policy Institute of California found that the ratio of patrol officers to residents in the state is at its lowest point since 1991, the furthest back its data goes.\n\nLeona doesn't see the tide being stemmed any time soon.\n\n'They would have to completely change the legislation in California,' he said. 'But that's not going to happen.'\n\nSacramento Chief of Police Kathy Lester has said her department is 'woefully understaffed'\n\nMerced County Sheriff Vern Warnke said the lack of deputies was 'getting kind of scary'\n\nRiverside County Sheriff Chad Bianco has blamed 'soft-on-crime' policies such as Proposition 47 for a spate of brazen heists in the Golden State\n\nFor now, the grass still appears to be greener on the other side.\n\nLeona now lives in Fort Worth with his wife, who is expecting their first child in August.\n\n'There's substantially less crime here, fewer gangs,' he said. 'I had my house broken into in Fresno. I was nervous for my wife to go to the store. I just don't have those fears anymore.'\n\nMiller, who now lives in Corinth, said she took a pay cut to move to Texas, but she is still financially better off as her take home pay is the same because there is no income tax in The Lone Star State and her 'money goes further'.\n\nFor Bottenfield, 61, who was awarded the Medal of Valor by Barack Obama in 2016 for his role in subduing an active shooter in Santa Monica in 2013, he has finally managed to live out the move he had been planning years before he retired in June 2018.\n\nIn November that year, he waved goodbye to his $1,800-a-month two-bed apartment in Fountain Valley to build their home in Texas.\n\nHe and his wife sold that and have now bought a $360,000 three-bedroom home with a garage in Hewitt, about halfway between Austin and Dallas.\n\nNot all former West Coast cops have been welcomed with open arms in their red state retirement communities, however.\n\nA recent LA Times article exposed a backlash from locals in Eagle, a small town in Idaho, who said hundreds of ex California law enforcement officers were bringing 'liberal baggage' to their community.\n\nBut Bottenfield has found no such disdain down South.\n\n'They understood that my politics was a lot like theirs,' he said. 'There's a saying here in Texas: \"I wasn't born here, but I got her as soon as I could\".'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

And that's just wrong, that's not how it works,' Harris said.\n\nIn an interview with Power 106 Los Angeles host Nick Cannon, Harris indicated she supported idea of completely reimagining the duties of a police officer.\n\nCalifornia State Attorney General Kamala Harris speaks to California Democrats, May 16, 2015, in Anaheim, Calif.\n\nSen. Kamala Harris, D-Calif., appears for a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing on Capitol Hill\n\n'We have to reimagine public safety in America,' Harris said. 'It's been upside down, for too long, people have confused achieving public safety with putting more cops on the street.'\n\nHarris also praised Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti for his decision to reduce police funding by $150 million.\n\n\"I applaud Mayor Garcetti for doing what he's done,\" she said during an interview with ABC's Good Morning America.\n\nShe called for governments to reevaluate their funding for police departments, suggesting it was a poor use of public funds.\n\n\"We've got to reexamine what we're doing with American taxpayer dollars and ask the question, are we getting the right return on our investment? Are we actually creating healthy and safe communities?\" Harris asked.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Pictured: Orlando lies motionless on the floor after being handcuffed\n\nDiaz was pulled over for driving without a license. Cops claim he 'faked a medical emergency' during the stop\n\nThe officer continues trying to rouse him and confirms that he is breathing and has a pulse.\n\nOne of the men watching states that he came around the corner to see police slamming Diaz to the ground.\n\n'He might have hit his head,' the man says. 'They put him in cuffs and then started pointing the taser at everyone else.\n\n'I said, \"I've got eyes on you officer\". I mean if he had of ran at the officer I would have got involved. It was only one officer at the time, I would have jumped in but I also don't agree with what happened here from what I seen.'\n\nHe also states that if the 'big dude', referencing Francisco, 'would have gone after the cop, I would have stepped in.'\n\nAs the video ends an ambulance arrives and the man speculates why it wasn't called sooner.\n\nA cop approaches the man filming and states he wants to seize the phone as evidence but he declines, stating it belongs to his colleague.\n\nIn the background, EMS workers can be seen treating Diaz on the floor.\n\nDuring the altercation, Francisco approached police and ended up being tasered on the ground as seen here\n\nPamela Diaz Burgos (bottom right) says her husband and son were targeted by 'aggressive' officers however Holme Beach Police Department hit back at their claims and stated that Francisco attacked them\n\nBoth men were booked into Manatee County Jail. Diaz was charged with a driving offense and resisting arrest without violence. He was released on September 11 after making $3,000 bail.\n\nHis son remains in jail on a $50,000 bond, charged with battery of an officer and resisting arrest with violence.\n\n'The cop automatically started to get aggressive verbally,' his wife said in a GoFundMe. 'Me as a mother I kept yelling my son has autism. They didn't care. I just want justice for my son.'\n\nShe said her husband has since returned home and is 'recovering from his injuries'.\n\nBut Chief Tokajer hit back at the family's narrative and stood by his officers' actions.\n\n'I watched the police bodycam footage,' he said. 'They were not brutal, they didn't strike him, they did not kneel on him. My guys were professional.'\n\nHe explained that Diaz's vehicle was picked up by ALPR technology which flagged past driving offenses.\n\nTokajer added that the officer decided to arrest Diaz after noting that he has three citations from 2023 and 2024 which have gone ignored.\n\n'The dad started to struggle, the officer got hold of him and then the son came around, he is 220lbs - 240lbs for sure,' he said.  'At the time there was just one officer so he called for backup, back up arrived.'\n\nDiaz was charged with driving without a license and resisting an officer without violence. He was bailed out of Manatee County Jail the next day, while Francisco remains in custody on a $50,000 bond charged with battery of an officer and resisting an arrest with violence\n\nFrancisco's booking information states that he is 250lbs.\n\nTokajer claimed Diaz then 'faked a medical episode' and Francisco began to lash out.\n\n'My guys go to arrest the son, he swings at an officer. He kicked and punched an officer, he was fighting.\n\n'We understand that autism, but it does not negate him hitting an officer. That is for a court to deal with if there are any mitigating circumstances.\n\n'The NAACP actually came in and reviewed our use of force and were shocked by how few incidents we have.'\n\nBut his comments were slammed by Henry Urrunaga Diaz, is Francisco's cousin and Diaz's nephew: 'This entire situation has been distressing for my family.\n\n'It was just a regular night for them, stopping by Dollar Tree then heading to dinner, and then a routine traffic stop escalated into all of this.\n\n'My uncle Orlando is still complaining of headaches and says he is forgetting things, and it has been weeks since the incident. He had bruises on his wrists, which he says still hurt.

      "text": "Shock police bodycam footage shows Tyreek Hill pleading with cops as they wrestle him to the ground during his detainment and tell him to 'stop crying'\n\nBy DANIEL MATTHEWS\n\nPublished: 19:05 EDT, 9 September 2024 | Updated: 11:33 EDT, 10 September 2024\n\n1.5k\n\nView comments\n\nDramatic bodycam footage has emerged of the moment Dolphins star Tyreek Hill was detained by cops and pinned to the ground near Hard Rock Stadium.\n\nThe wide receiver was placed in handcuffs while driving to the Dolphins' season opener against the Jacksonville Jaguars . 'Take me to jail, brother. Do what you have to do,' Hill told the officers.\n\nCops could then be heard telling Hill to 'stop crying' after dragging him out of his car and forcing him face down on to the road.\n\n'When we tell you to do something, you do it. You understand? Not what you want, what we tell you. You're a little f****** confused,' an officer told him.\n\nA Florida police union claimed that Hill was driving dangerously when he was pulled over in Miami on Sunday and that he was cuffed after refusing to cooperate. Hill said he has 'no idea' what sparked his detainment.\n\nDramatic bodycam footage has emerged of the moment Dolphins star Tyreek Hill was detained\n\nThe Miami wide receiver was dragged out of his luxury car by an officer after being pulled over\n\nHill's agent, Drew Rosenhaus, claims the receiver was cited for reckless driving and driving without a license.\n\nOn Monday, a remarkable three-minute clip of the scene appeared, with Hill claiming 'it went from 0 to 60 immediately'. He told NBC Nightly News: 'If I wasn't Tyreek Hill, Lord knows... worst-case scenario, I would have been shot or would have been locked up'.\n\nThe Dolphins described the video as 'both maddening and heartbreaking'. The team vowed to stand with Hill and called for 'swift and strong action' against the officers guilty of 'overly aggressive', 'violent' and 'despicable' behavior.\n\nAt the start of the bodycam footage, police approached Hill's car. The receiver appeared to hand over his license before telling the cop to 'do what you got to do.'\n\nThe 30-year-old then put his window up, prompting officers to tap on the car and tell Hill: 'Hey, keep that window down!'\n\n'Keep your window down or I'm going to get you out of the car. As a matter of fact, get out of the car,' one officer told Hill before another warned the receiver: 'We'll break that freaking window.'\n\nA few seconds later, Hill was told: 'We're not playing this car, get out!' An officer then opened the driver-side door and grabbed Hill.\n\nHill was soon pinned to the floor and warned: 'When we tell you to do something, you do it'\n\nThe officers led the Miami wide receiver to the sidewalk as his teammates showed up\n\n'I'm getting out!' the football star pleaded before a cop put his hand towards Hill's neck and dragged him out of the car. 'Get out, GET OUT. What part of that do you not understand?'\n\nAs Hill lay on the road, a cop put his knee on the receiver's back and then grabbed the NFL star's hands as a fellow officer put on handcuffs. 'Too late! Too late!' they shouted as Hill tried to claim he was getting out of the car.\n\nThe wide receiver told NBC that he called Dolphins officials from his vehicle and he could later be heard speaking on the phone to Drew Brooks, director of team security.\n\n'Hey Drew I'm getting arrested, I'm getting arrested!' the wide receiver shouted as officers detained him.\n\nWhen Hill then told cops to take him to jail, they responded: 'We are. We will. It is good. Don't worry brother, I'm going to hang up the phone. Stop crying.'\n\nThe 30-year-old questioned the officers' conduct, claiming they were 'beating on my window like you crazy'.\n\nMoments later, a car - carrying one of Hill's teammates - pulled up. 'What's going on, bro?' the receiver was asked. 'The dude was beating on my window like he crazy. I ain't do nothing to him,' he responded.\n\n'The dude was beating on my window like he crazy. I ain't do nothing to him,' Hill insisted\n\nHill celebrated his 80-yard touchdown on Sunday by reenacting being put in handcuffs\n\nThe 30-year-old was soon led to the sidewalk and forced to sit on the ground by two cops. 'I just had surgery on my knee!' Hill screamed. 'Chill bro! Chill bro!'\n\nAn officer then responded sarcastically: 'Really? What a coincidence... you could have surgery on your ears when we told you to put your window down.'\n\nMeanwhile the other car stopped nearby. 'Back up!' they were warmed while a man - believed to be Dolphins tackle Calais Campbell - could be seen with his hands up. 'Call Drew!' Hill shouted repeatedly as sirens sounded.\n\nAnother man - believed to be Miami tight end Jonnu Smith - pleaded his innocence when confronted by cops: 'I'm not doing anything! I'm not doing nothing.'\n\nSmith was on the phone, apparently telling Brooks: 'They got Tyreek, the cops are over here beating on him.' Cops then warned him to move his car or he would be issued a ticket, too.\n\nHill was released a few minutes later. Remarkably, he went on to play for the Dolphins and score an 80-yard touchdown that helped Miami rally for a 20-17 win. The wideout celebrated the score by mimicking being handcuffed.\n\nCa mpbell later revealed that he was also put in handcuffs. 'I was like \"What is going on?\" I didn't understand what the issue was, for him to put handcuffs on me.'\n\nThe Dolphins receiver pictured with wife Keeta, whom he married in November of last year\n\nHe added: 'That was a first, 17 years in this game. I saw Tyreek getting apprehended. I just wanted to make sure everything was ok, try to deescalate the situation. Officer felt a certain kind of way and put handcuffs on me.'\n\nHill paid tribute to his teammates who came to his side, telling NBC: 'I didn't feel alone anymore... they ended up handcuffing Calais for just being 6ft 8in I think.\n\n'But it was crazy. It was crazy how that same officer who took me down handcuffed Calais for just standing on the side.'\n\nThe 30-year-old accused one cop of being on a 'power trip'. 'He felt like he just needed to... do something that day. I'm glad nobody was hurt.'\n\nAnother shocking clip even appeared to show an officer striking Hill on the sidewalk after he was detained, which led to accusations of racism from appalled fans on social media.\n\nAmid the outrage, Miami-Dade Police revealed that an officer has been placed on administrative duties pending an internal investigation.\n\nAfter facing the Jaguars, Hill broke his silence on the ordeal. 'I don't want to bring race into it, but sometimes it gets kind of iffy when you do,' Hill said, via ESPN, following the game. 'What if I wasn't Tyreek Hill? Lord knows what that guy or guys would have done.\n\n'I was just making sure that I was doing what my uncle always told me to do whenever you're in a situation like that: \"Just listen, put your hands on the steering wheel and just listen.\"'\n\nAccording to the president of the South Florida Police Benevolent Association, police only pulled over the NFL star because he was endangering other drivers on the road, while he was cuffed after refusing to comply with instructions.\n\nDefensive lineman Calais Campbell said he was also detained outside Hard Rock Stadium\n\nIn a statement to TMZ Sports , the SFLPBA alleges that Hill put 'himself and others in great risk of danger' by driving recklessly on his way to Miami's stadium.\n\nThe statement then continues: 'Mr. Hill was not immediately cooperative with the officers on scene who, pursuant to policy and for their immediate safety, placed Mr. Hill in handcuffs.\n\n'Mr. Hill, still uncooperative, refused to sit on the ground and was therefore redirected to the ground. Once the situation was sorted out within a few minutes. Mr. Hill was issued two traffic citations and was free to leave.'\n\nThe SFLPBA concluded its statement by adding that it stands 'with the actions of our officers' but 'looks forward to further open communication moving forward.'\n\nOn Monday night, shortly after the bodycam footage was emerged, the Dolphins released their own statement which read: 'We are saddened by the overly aggressive and violent conduct directed towards Tyreek Hill, Calais Campbell and Jonnu Smith by police officers before yesterday's game.\n\n'It is both maddening and heartbreaking to watch the very people we trust to protect our community use such unnecessary force and hostility towards these players, yet it is also a reminder that not every situation like this ends in peace, as we are grateful this one did. \"What if I wasn't Tyreek Hill?' is a question that will carry with resounding impact.\n\n'We are proud to have a strong and positive relationship with the Miami-Dade Police Department and other law enforcement agencies and recognize that the vast majority of officers do serve the community with the utmost character and desire to protect all citizens.\n\nThe 30-year-old was seen being pinned to the ground in one video of the incident\n\npic.twitter.com/Wz6mQt3Owc\n\n'However, as is on full display in the videos released tonight, there are some officers who mistake their responsibility and commitment to serve with misguided power. While we commend MDPD for taking the right and necessary action to quickly release this footage, we also urge them to take equally swift and strong action against the officers who engaged in such despicable behavior.\n\n'We are proud to have a strong and positive relationship with the Miami-Dade Police Department and other law enforcement agencies and recognize that the vast majority of officers do serve the community with the utmost character and desire to protect all citizens.\n\n'However, as is on full display in the videos released tonight, there are some officers who mistake their responsibility and commitment to serve with misguided power.

But when she sped off immediately after speaking with the officer, she was flagged down again and arrested.\n\nStewart's attorney told TMZ that the speeding charge has been dropped. She has to take a defensive driving course, complete 20 hours of community service and write a paper about the dangers of speeding.\n\nBut on Sunday, the glamorous Alpha Chi Omega sorority sister found herself in handcuffs once again.\n\nShe and a group of friends set off an intrusion alarm at a UGA student center, according to a police report obtained by DailyMail.com.\n\nStewart allegedly sprinted away from the responding UGA police officers and crouched behind a brick wall to hide as a cop questioned her peers.\n\nLily Stewart, 20, has garnered social media's attention twice this month after her glamorous mugshots circulated the internet\n\nStewart first went viral last week when people started to gush over her March 8 mugshot. The sorority girl was arrested for speeding after already being pulled over\n\nBut her hiding spot was quickly discovered and when cops asked why she ran away, she said she was scared of getting into trouble since she was already arrested on March 8.\n\n'I didn't want to get caught doing anything bad because I am out on bond right now,' the internet sensation admitted, according to the report\n\nStewart also said to police during the early Sunday morning encounter: 'Was it the trespassing? Truly that was actually my fault.'\n\nThe sorority girl, recently dubbed 'Miss America' for her looks, was booked on misdemeanor charges of obstruction of a law enforcement officer and loitering/prowling just before 5:30 am.\n\nShe was able to post her $4,000 bond just a few hours later and was out of jail by 11 am.\n\nHer accomplices faced charges related to underage drinking, loitering and possessing a fake ID, according to the report.\n\nBut police noted in their report that Stewart showed no signs of being intoxicated.\n\nStewart's latest mugshot shows her sporting a dark blue prison uniform with her blonde-highlighted hair blown out and parted down the middle.\n\nStewart was arrested for a second time this month on Sunday for obstruction of law enforcement and loitering/prowling\n\nStewart has spoken about the March 8 mugshot, claiming it is not that great of a picture of her\n\nOf course, she was brightly smiling in the image.\n\nHer second mugshot garnered the same reactions as the first shockingly flattering photo, with social media users gushing over Stewart once again.\n\n'She looks innocent,' one man wrote on X about Sunday's mugshot.\n\n'Her mugshots are cute tho,' an Instagram user commented. 'Just my type...' another agreed.\n\n'Her side profile is incredible. God has his favorites,' someone wrote, praising Stewart's facial features.\n\nOthers found humor in Stewart becoming a regular at the police station, with one user asking, 'are those cops bothering you queen?'\n\nOne woman wrote with a laughing emoji: 'Freshly curled hair + prowling is wild.'\n\n'Her hairstylist needs a raise! C'mon layers!!' someone added.\n\nStewart allegedly told police on Sunday she ran away from them because she was already 'out on bond' from the March 8 incident\n\nAll the charges from the March 8 speeding incident have been dropped, but Stewart must take a defensive driving course, complete 20 hours of community service and write a paper about the dangers of speeding\n\nStewart has not publicly spoken about her second arrest or the comments sparked by the new mugshot, but she has previously discussed the first photo.\n\n'I was smiling because I always smile for a photo,' she told TMZ.\n\nShe even told PEOPLE that she was not particularly thrilled with the March 8 mugshot, saying 'I actually think it's a bad photo of me. I don't really look the same as I do in that mugshot. I don't think it's a great photo of me.'\n\nDailyMail.com has reached out to Stewart for comment.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Now she says she hopes her three children choose not to follow her and her husband's footsteps and choose another profession - like fighting fires.\n\n\"I took a lot of pride in being a cop,\" she said. \"I love serving the community, and I just wish that law enforcement was able to get that pendulum swinging back for them.\"\n\nIt would be really hard for me to go and serve the institution of law enforcement, just because the politicians, the elected officials, our leaders do not have our backs.\n\nBut her career ended after a schizophrenic suspect nearly killed her with her own gun, and a California jury let him off.

And then it just did.\n\nNot only do law enforcement officers have to worry about their physical safety, she said, they also have to worry about their livelihoods.\n\n\"You have to worry about these leaders coming after you years down the road,\" she said. \"We're seeing all of these crazy woke district attorneys opening up cases years later. . . . Is my family going to be able to afford a mortgage if something happens to me later down the line?\"\n\nTaylor Marino, a former NYPD officer , said he traded in his uniform and badge to go business casual and work in IT - and he's not looking back.\n\n\"It all kind of fell through the floor,\" he told Fox News Digital. \"Every year, it was like, it can't get any worse than this. And then it just did.\"\n\nFormer NYPD Officer Taylor Marino retired early for a number of reasons, including low morale and a heavy workload in his understaffed department. Another issue, he said, was that officers he looked up to were also leaving in droves. So, he wore one of them on his T-shirt when he retired, too. (Courtesy of Taylor Marino )\n\nHe voiced similar concerns about progressive oversight agencies, which he said had no understanding of how policing works.\n\n\"Their power grew over time, it was almost like they were your boss,\" he told Fox News Digital.\n\nRetention problems also took a heavy toll on officers who remained on the job after their colleagues left for greener pastures, he said.\n\nFORMER OFFICER, COUNTRY MUSICIAN STEPS IN TO FIGHT PLAGUE OF POLICE SUICIDES, MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS\n\n\"The lack of manpower over the years ... slowly but surely, a lot of people were starting to leave,\" he said. \"There were less people to work with, and that's an increase in workload for you, an increase in liability. That was a huge concern.\"\n\nWhen he started in a busy Brooklyn precinct, he said, there were 12 cars on patrol. Two years later, there were just four.\n\nThe September attack left McCarthy with a broken thumb and black eye. She also developed post-traumatic stress disorder that eventually forced her to retire from law enforcement. (Meagan McCarthy)\n\nOfficers could often work 16-hour days, spend hours commuting home and then be expected to report back after barely five hours at home with their families, he said.\n\n\"It just wasn't worth it,\" he said.\n\nIt was especially rough, he said, when experienced officers he looked up to started leaving.\n\n\"I was like, 'Oh my God, where did everybody go?'\" he said. \"Everybody saw the writing on the wall, and I think it was time that I started seeing what everybody else was seeing.\"\n\nMURDERED LOS ANGELES SHERIFF'S DEPUTY'S FAMILY SLAPS COUNTY WITH $20M WRONGFUL DEATH LAWSUIT\n\nMarino, a first-generation officer, retired after just five years and said he would discourage his own children and anyone else's children from joining the force under the current climate.\n\nWorking in IT is much less stressful, he said.\n\n\"You still see on a national level how police officers are dragged through the mud for situations where people don't agree with your actions, even though they have no knowledge or have never experienced situations of their own like that,\" he said. \"I had the chance to get out of law enforcement and I took it.\"\n\nDerek Chauvin, who in 2021 was convicted of George Floyd's killing, was later stabbed in prison by an inmate who authorities said admitted to doing it for clout. (Court TV via AP, Pool, File)\n\nCurrent and former members of law enforcement from around the country have complained of progressive policies that allow repeat offenders to get out of custody on low or no bail and commit their next crime.\n\nSince nationwide anti-police riots erupted across the country in 2020 after Floyd's death, morale, recruitment and retention in departments have plummeted, experts say.\n\n\"From our boots-on-the-ground cops, we're seeing kind of a resignation to the new normal,\" said Betsy Brantner Smith, who spent almost 30 years on the job and is now a spokesperson for the National Police Association. \"I talked to some recruiters in the Midwest recently, and they just accepted that the days of 500 to 1,000 applications for four to five jobs, those days are gone.\"\n\nSome departments in small towns and suburbs, especially in parts of the South and the West, are finding success in attracting good candidates, she said, but staffing shortages are plaguing much of the country.\n\nDEREK CHAUVIN PRISON STABBIBG: EX-FBI INFORMANT INMATE CHARGED WITH ATTEMPTED MURDER OF EX-MINNEAPOLIS COP\n\n\"Cops are learning to do more with less, but who actually gets ripped off are the citizens.\" she said.\n\nFireworks land on federal police facing protesters after a riot was declared near the Justice Center on New Year's Eve in downtown Portland, Oregon, U.S. December 31, 2020. (REUTERS/Mathieu Lewis-Rolland)\n\nPension changes over the years have also made it easier for officers to leave their departments without completely disrupting their retirement plans, she said.\n\n\"My pension was very much tied to my police department,\" she said. \"I couldn't have left. Now they've changed the pension system in so many areas that you can pick up your pension and go. It's just like your 401K.\"\n\nThat frees officers to pack up and move around the country in search of a better quality of life, better school systems or better pay, she said.\n\nNEW YORK SENIOR CITIZEN CHARGED IN MUGGER'S SHOOTING DEATH HAD WARNED LOCAL NEWSPAPER OF RISING CRIME\n\nAnother problem, especially for large cities like New York and Chicago, is that families that have spent generations seeking jobs in the same departments are no longer encouraging their children to continue the legacy.\n\n\"My dad was NYPD. My grandpa was NYPD, and those legacy cops are bailing out,\" she said. \"We're not having the legacies themselves encourage their kids to come to those agencies. So now what are we doing? Now we're gonna have DACA recipients .\"\n\nOregon State Troopers and Portland police advance through tear gas while dispersing a protest against police brutality and racial injustice on September 5, 2020, in Portland, Oregon. (Nathan Howard/Getty Images)\n\nSeveral cities, including Seattle and Los Angeles , have encouraged DACA recipients - whose immigration status is not clear and who may not even legally be allowed to own firearms on U.S. soil - to apply as they struggle to fill their depleted ranks.\n\n\"Wait until a DACA recipient uses force on an American,\" Brantner Smith said. \"There's a certain naïveté to this whole situation.\"\n\nAs a whole, the quality of applicants decreases as fewer people take an interest in joining law enforcement, she said.\n\n\"With a recruiting crisis and a retention crisis always comes lowered standards, and the public needs to know about that and understand it,\" he warned. \"Better officers are better educated, more professional, [and require] more training. . . . We're gonna lower our standards, so we have warm bodies in patrol cars. That should be concerning to every American.\"\n\nPolice in riot gear stand outside the Kenosha County Court House on Monday, August 24, 2020, in Kenosha, Wis.

But others are more concerning for experts, including lowered education requirements.\n\nDACA RECIPIENTS ELIGIBLE TO JOIN SEATTLE POLICE AS LIBERAL POLICIES BLAMED FOR 'DIRE' STAFF SHORTAGE\n\nAnother problem in some areas is departments with deep pockets trying to lure good officers away from their current jobs, she said.\n\n\"You go to Chicago, and you'll see billboards for Dallas PD, LAPD,\" she said. Some police departments in the San Francisco Bay Area are offering hiring bonuses between $5,000 and $15,000, she added.\n\nAn advertisement from Washington's Metropolitan Police Department appears on a New York City subway car announcing a $25,000 hiring bonus plus $6,000 in monthly rental assistance. (Michael Ruiz/Fox News Digital)\n\nWhile some big city departments pay high salaries, the average hourly wage for police and sheriff's officers increased by less than $2 between 2019 and 2022, according to the most recent available data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nPrior to the coronavirus pandemic and 2020's summer of anti-police rioting, officers made an average of $33.04 an hour across the country. By 2022, that had climbed to $34.79, an increase of 5.2% that was below inflation.\n\n\"That goes back to the morale and retention,\" she said.\n\nOn the upside, The Associated Press reported earlier this year that police hiring ticked upward in 2023 for the first time in five years, citing a survey from PERF, a nonprofit policing think tank based in Washington, D.C.\n\nThose gains came mainly in small- and medium-sized departments. Big cities were still below staffing levels they maintained prior to the 2020 riots.\n\nEarly resignations also declined, although they remained above 2020 levels as well.\n\nFox News' Peter Petroff and The Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nThe hottest stories ripped from the headlines, from crime to courts, legal and scandal.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking the Subscribe button, you agree to the Fox News Privacy Policy and Terms of Use , and\n        agree to receive content and promotional communications from Fox News.

(Eddie Barrett/@50callabz)\n\nBut before Barrett punches in, the 6'1\" detective hits the gym to pump iron and pound the treadmill.\n\nHe then works his regular police shift - from around 3:30 a.m. to 3 p.m. - before driving home, spending quality time with his family and typically getting to sleep no later than 8 p.m.\n\n\"Getting my training in is of utmost priority - I've been doing this for 21 years.\"\n\nOn weekends, Barrett gets up at around 3 a.m. and hits the ice bath before working out at his purpose-built home gym so he can free up the rest of the day for time with his family.\n\nAnd if he's on vacation , as he was recently in the Cayman Islands, Barrett will pound the sandy beaches in the dead of night with a torchlight strapped to his head - and that's before his gym session.\n\nDetective Barrett works out in the early morning hours before his police shift.

He noted that some police agencies are lowering fitness standards to help plug recruitment gaps.\n\n\"You want to have an appearance and a level of confidence in your fitness that demands respect and that always plays in your favor,\" Barrett added.\n\nNYPD detective Barrett, also known as 50 Cal, is pictured with wife Sierra and son Henry.

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper .\n\nRetired Riverside, Illinois, Police Chief Tom Weitzel spoke to Fox News Digital about how the 2024 election is one that pits lawlessness against law and order on the presidential ticket.\n\nThe votes of the law enforcement professionals and their families will help determine the election as police officers weigh the prospect of heightened lawlessness on American streets under a potential Vice President Harris administration, a retired Illinois police chief predicted.\n\n\"It's my personal belief that no police officer or family member should vote for [Harris'] agenda, because it's anti-police,\" retired Riverside Police Chief Tom Weitzel told Fox News Digital in a Zoom interview.\n\n\"All you have to do is look at her record. I mean, you can go back to when she helped the Minneapolis Freedom Fund. I don't know of any evidence that she donated money, but I do know evidence that she publicized it and that attracted more money to that freedom fund, which is basically a bond fund to bond out prisoners. And many of those prisoners that were bonded out had attacked police officers during the riot, especially the George Floyd rioting.\"\n\nWeitzel said his comments on Harris , the 2024 Democrat presidential nominee, and her Republican opponent, former President Trump, are made through a public safety lens, stripping away typical Republican-vs.-Democrat politics in favor of weighing the two candidates based on their track record of curbing crime and supporting law enforcement.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS' RECORD AS PROSECUTOR IN CALIFORNIA SPELLS 'TROUBLE' FOR PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN: LAWYER\n\nTom Weitzel is shown when he was police chief of Riverside, Illinois. (Tom Weitzel)\n\nWeitzel argued that the police vote could sway the election, noting that when considering family members and loved ones, the police vote sits at about 1.5 million people.\n\n\"I read a story the other day that there's over 710,000 police officers, full-time police officers in the United States, over [840,000] if you take in federal law enforcement and specialized agencies, such as colleges and universities. Those are votes and most of those law enforcement officers you know, their spouses, their children, their friends, that there could be 1.5 million votes there, easily, if not more,\" Weitzel explained.\n\nDNC PAINTS HARRIS AS 'LAW AND ORDER' STANDARD-BEARER AS PAST COMMENTS ON 'MILITARIZATION OF POLICE' RESURFACE\n\nWeitzel retired from the Riverside Police Department, which is located about 12 miles from downtown Chicago , in 2021 after serving as the department's chief for 13 years. He served in law enforcement for a total of 37 years, which included him being ambushed and shot in the line of duty in 1987 by Chicago criminals.\n\nVice President Harris greets President Biden at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Aug. 19, 2024. (Andrew Harnik/Getty Images)\n\nFox News Digital spoke to Weitzel just days after high-profile Democrats flooded Chicago for the Democratic National Convention, where Harris officially accepted her party's nomination for president. Harris touted the military and her law enforcement background as San Francisco's district attorney and California attorney general, but she did not offer full-throated support to police or first responders.\n\nHarris said \"law enforcement\" three times in her speech on Thursday evening, including two references to Jan. 6, 2021, when supporters of Trump breached the U.S. Capitol.\n\nKAMALA WAS A ROGUE SOROS-LIKE PROSECUTOR BEFORE IT WAS POPULAR AMONG WOKE ELITES\n\n\"And let me be clear ... after decades in law enforcement, I know the importance of safety and security, especially at our border. Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades. The border patrol endorsed it. But Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign, so he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal,\" Harris said when mentioning law enforcement for the third and final time in her speech.\n\nRepublican presidential nominee former President Trump touches the turnout coat of former Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Department Chief Corey Comperatore during the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee on July 18, 2024. (Reuters/Jeenah Moon)\n\nWeitzel said Harris made a \"huge mistake\" by not trying to build a bridge with police during her speech, pointing to how Trump conversely made further inroads with law enforcement and first responders during his Republican National Convention (RNC) speech in July, when he paid an emotional tribute to retired fire chief Corey Comperatore.\n\nHARRIS CAMPAIGN SIGNALS CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR ENDING CASH BAIL\n\nComperatore was killed last month in Butler, Pennsylvania, during a Trump rally when shooter Thomas Crooks attempted to assassinate the 45th president. Trump was wounded when a bullet grazed his ear.\n\n\"Corey, a highly respected former fire chief ... was accompanied by his wife, Helen ... and two precious daughters,\" Trump said during his convention speech. \"He lost his life selflessly acting as a human shield to protect them from flying bullets ... what a fine man he was.\"\n\nTrump also walked over to Comperatore's firefighting jacket and helmet, which were sent to the convention by his family, and held a moment of silence for the Pennsylvania dad .\n\nWeitzel said Harris not honoring first responders in her speech was a mistake while arguing Trump's \"human touch\" of honoring Comperatore spoke volumes to those who work in public safety.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS' LEGAL, POLITICAL CAREER KICKED OFF WITH FAILED BAR EXAM\n\nFormer President Trump famously raised his fist and yelled \"fight\" to the crowd after surviving an assassination attempt in July. (Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\n\"Trump honored the firefighter that was killed during his assassination attempt. Did you see the part when he walked over to where they put a mannequin up with his fire gear on? That type of respect for the fire service is the same type of respect it is given to law enforcement. That's a public safety realm. That's the public safety realm of fire and police, and that's why police officers support him also. ... That type of human touch and that type of support that was shown during the RNC for that fire chief that was killed is the same reason police are supporting him and have been since his presidency,\" Weitzel said.\n\nRETIRED ILLINOIS POLICE CHIEF RELIVES LATE-NIGHT 'AMBUSH' BY CHICAGO GANGSTER WHO LEFT HIM FOR DEAD: AUDIO\n\nWeitzel said the election comes down to \"lawlessness vs. law and order\" and that police support of Trump's run will only increase as the election cycle spills into the fall.\n\nThe retired police chief said the cops who he speaks to are \"concerned\" about a potential Harris administration after Democrats nationwide turned their backs on officers in 2020, rallying support to defund police amid widespread riots following the death of George Floyd by police in Minneapolis.\n\nTom Weitzel (Tom Weitzel)\n\n\"They're very concerned. And make no mistake, you know, Trump isn't perfect. Nobody's saying everything he does is fantastic. ... I'm just talking from a public safety perspective. And yes, they are concerned that if Kamala Harris was to become president and her administration would not be supportive of police, and that would be a huge deal.

(Paul Chinn/San Francisco Chronicle via Getty Images)\n\nShe launched her legal career in the Alameda County District Attorney's Office as a deputy DA in 1990. In the late 1990s, she moved over to the San Francisco District Attorney's Office as assistant DA, then to the San Francisco city attorney's office before running in 2004 to become San Francisco's top cop. She was elected as San Francisco DA and served in the role for about seven years, in that time building a friendship with then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama and rubbing elbows with fellow Californian, Rep. Nancy Pelosi.\n\nHarris sympathized with rioters during the 2020 protests that swept the nation at a time when the coronavirus pandemic was at a fever pitch and upended day-to-day life for Americans.\n\n\"If you're able to, chip in now to the @MNFreedomFund to help post bail for those protesting on the ground in Minnesota,\" Harris posted on X, then Twitter, in 2020, urging people to donate to the fund during the 2020 campaign.\n\nHarris promoted the bail fund in June 2020 to help bail Black Lives Matter rioters out of jail, but only a fraction of the more than $41 million actually went to freeing rioters, subsequent reporting found.\n\nWeitzel pointed to Harris' promotion of the bail fund, as well as her failure to prosecute some criminals when she served as San Francisco DA and California attorney general.\n\nPresidential nominee Vice President Harris is shown at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Aug. 22, 2024.

Harris turned down seeking the death penalty against the perpetrator, arguing it would \" send the wrong message ,\" sparking fellow Democrats at the time to criticize the decision.\n\n\"This is clearly a case where local politics took precedence over the facts of the case and a deliberative review of the circumstances,\" a Democrat California assemblyman said at the time of Harris' decision.\n\nEspinoza's family members have since said they will not support Harris in her 2024 presidential run , the New York Post reported.\n\nKamala Harris is shown when she was San Francisco's district attorney on Oct. 29, 2008.

(KTTV)\n\nA progressive-backed bill to mandate cultural and sensitivity training for police recruits is being panned by House Republican lawmakers who are former officers themselves.\n\n\"It is imperative that law enforcement officers are well-trained on agency policy and procedures and held to the highest standards that keep both officers and the public safe,\" Rep. John Rutherford, R-Fla., a former sheriff and 40-year veteran of the Jacksonville Sheriff's Office, told Fox News Digital.\n\n\"However, it is not the role of Congress, nor should it be, to tell local agencies what that training should look like.\"\n\nThe legislation would require people enrolled at police-training academies \"to receive sensitivity training on ethics and racial bias, cultural diversity, and police interaction with . . . people with disabilities, those in a mental health crisis, and new immigrants,\" according to the press release.\n\nNEW POLL SHOWS TRUMP, HARRIS TIED IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE: 'CLOSE AS CLOSE CAN BE'\n\nFormer sheriffs and current GOP Reps.

Steve Cohen, D-Tenn., earlier this month, on the heels of the police killing of Sonya Massey in Illinois, a Black woman who was shot by a police deputy in her home after calling 911 about a suspected prowler.

      "text": "Joy Behar Asks Why Cops Cannot Shoot Attackers in the Leg - Gets Instant Answer From Co-Host\n\n(@NickFondacaro/Twitter screen shot)\n\n\"The View\" co-host Joy Behar was quickly informed on-air why police cannot just shoot an attacker's leg instead of their torso.\n\nDuring a segment on Tuesday, Behar questioned why people seeking to fend off attackers use lethal force.\n\n\"It's like police sometimes, when they shoot somebody. It's like can't you shoot them in the leg? Why do you have to shoot them in the head?\" she asked.\n\nIt did not take long for Behar to get an answer.\n\nCo-host Sara Haines responded, \"That's a false... Having dated a homicide detective, he used to tell me when he hears that on TV his eyes roll.\"\n\n\"Because you have to shoot, when you're trained with a weapon, for the mass of the body. So to shoot a leg or a wrist happens in a James Bond film, but in real life that's actually not something that they can do,\" she continued.\n\nShe added, \"It's hard enough to hit a target. So when you target practice on a mass, which is the main part of your body - your torso.\"\n\nJoy thinks we live in a movie where shots to the extremities stop attackers. Seemingly ignorant that ranges exist she whines: \"If it's hard to hit a target, why do these gun toters want us to constantly have guns when we're not trained to even shoot as well as a police officer?\" pic.twitter.com/6yNFYgg3zQ\n\n- Nicholas Fondacaro (@NickFondacaro) May 9, 2023\n\nOne reason law enforcement and gun owners train to shoot at the torso, or center mass, is because there is a smaller chance of them missing their target.\n\nBetween the adrenaline and the target probably moving, it is more difficult to get a smaller target like a hand or leg lined up in time to stop a threat than aiming for a larger target like the torso.\n\nThe other reason is that even if an officer or gun owner manages to hit an attacker in the leg or hand, it likely will not stop them.\n\nTo answer Behar's latter question, if you stop by a gun range or gun store and talk to the staff, you would hear the staff talk about how important it is for firearm owners to learn about safety and train with their gun.\n\nIf you asked most \"gun toters,\" as Behar called them, they would probably express horror and dismay at the idea of someone thinking they can carry a gun around and shoot like James Bond without any training.\n\nYou do not need to go to a police academy or be an expert marksman to be able to hit your target. You can practice at a range and take lessons to gain at least enough proficiency to protect yourself.\n\nBut it is unrealistic to think police and civilians should be able to just aim for the legs or hands.\n\nIJR, Senior Writer\r\nHe's written for Independent Journal Review since 2019.\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

      "text": "Commentary: New Jan. 6 Video Shows Cops Reasoning with Protesters in Capitol: 'No Attacking, No Assault, Remain Calm'\n\nA stunning video came to light on Sunday that shatters the Democrats' narrative that supporters of then-President Donald Trump staged an insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6.\n\nJulie Kelly of American Greatness published the video, which shows protesters speaking with U.S. Capitol Police officers inside the building.\n\nOne officer can be heard telling them, \"We're not against ... you need to show. You understand? Then show us. No attacking, no assault, remain calm.\"\n\nThe officer has been identified and \"confirmed by charging documents\" as Officer Keith Robishaw, according to Kelly.\n\nOne member of the group - identified as William Watson of Auburn, Alabama - responded, \"We're not going to assault. We're going to be heard. Everybody, this must be peaceful.\"\n\nJacob Chansley , the Phoenix man seen wearing a fur hat with horns who was nicknamed the \"QAnon Shaman,\" followed up by shouting to the others, \"This has to be peaceful. We have the right to peacefully assemble.\"\n\n[firefly_embed] [/firefly_embed]\n\nThis blows a rather large hole in the Democrats' Capitol insurrection story and directly challenges the official version of events.\n\nChansley's Jan. 8 arrest warrant states: \"Robishaw and other officers calmed the protestors somewhat and directed them to leave the area from the same way they had entered. Chansley approached Officer Robishaw and screamed, among other things, that this was their house, and that they were there to take the Capitol, and to get Congressional leaders.\"\n\nHe faces trespassing and disorderly conduct charges. He has been denied bail and awaits his trial in jail, according to The Washington Post .\n\nChansley's attorney filed a motion for release in March. The Post reported that U.S. District Judge Royce C. Lamberth denied the motion, stating that his attorney's arguments were \"meritless,\" \"mistaken\" and \"so frivolous as to insult the Court's intelligence.\" The judge declared that \"Chansley was too dangerous to release and continues to pose a threat to the public.\"\n\nIn a separate video below, Chansley was seen walking into the Senate chamber followed by an officer. Kelly reported he later \"led several protesters in prayer and sat in Vice President Mike Pence's chair.\"\n\nKelly's article noted that Chansley has no prior criminal history, a fact that The Post and numerous other media outlets conveniently and repeatedly omit from their coverage.\n\nMedia outlet Al.com reported that Watson, 23, was arrested last July on drug trafficking charges and had been out on a $103,000 bond. His bond precluded him from leaving the state.\n\nIn the video, Watson took the microphone and told protestors, \"Listen up. The police here are willing to work with us and cooperate peacefully like our First Amendment allows. Gather more Americans under the condition that they will come and gather peacefully to discuss what needs to be done to save our country.\"\n\nKelly said she obtained the video from RMG News and it only a portion \"of a much longer video that has yet to be released.\"\n\nThere is no doubt that conservatives have been overly targeted for what happened on Jan. 6. The protesters have been hunted by the FBI , and the president of the United States was impeached for supposedly inciting an \"insurrection.\"\n\nThis stands in stark contrast to the treatment of Black Lives Matter and antifa rioters, whose destruction, looting and violence, which included the takeover of a federal court building in Portland, Oregon, following the death of George Floyd one year ago, spread across the country.\n\nFollowing the Capitol riot, it took about a nanosecond for the Democrats, with the aid of a complicit media, to establish the \"insurrection\" narrative.\n\nIn the brief clips below, Capitol Police officers can be seen allowing protesters into the building.\n\nCapitol police open doors for the protestors.

Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, and the ranking member, Rep. John Katko of New York.\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal .\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

(Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images)\n\nDemocratic Mayor Eric Adams of New York City announced Thursday cops and schools would be subjected to budget cuts to pay for the city's migrant crisis.\n\nAdams announced that libraries would be closed on Sundays and the New York Police Department would freeze police hiring as part of the efforts to address the costs of housing migrants arriving in the city, according to The New York Times. The city is offering migrants free travel to any location as the number exceeded 130,000, but many say they will not leave the city.\n\n\"No city should be left to handle a national humanitarian crisis largely on its own, and without the significant and timely support we need from Washington, D.C., today's budget will be only the beginning,\" Adams said Thursday. The police force is expected to drop below 30,000 as a result of the cuts, The New York Times reported.\n\nRepublican Govs. Greg Abbott of Texas and Doug Ducey of Arizona began busing migrants to New York City and other so-called \"sanctuary\" cities in 2022.\n\nAdams previously announced that a class of 250 school safety agents would not be hired Tuesday, asking parents to volunteer to fill the gaps created by the cancelled hiring.\n\n\"In all my time in government, this is probably one of the most painful exercises I've gone through,\" Adams said.\n\nThe Education Department's budget will be by $1 billion over a two year period, according to Adams.\n\nOver two million illegal immigrants have been encountered at the U.S.-Mexico border during fiscal year 2023, according to data released by United States Customs and Border Protection, following 2,206,436 encounters in fiscal year 2022 and 1,659,206 in fiscal year 2021.\n\nCrime in New York City has climbed, leading to Target closing a store in Harlem due to concerns about employee safety in September.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

His attackers left him with an open head wound.\n\nThe wound required 28 staples to close.\n\nThe man was leaving the bar using the front door when he \"accidentally\" bumped into the customer, witnesses told police, according to the post.\n\nThe customer the man bumped into was wearing the colors of the Iron Coffins motorcycle club, witnesses noted.\n\nOther bikers in the bar began shouting at the man after he had bumped into the customer, prompting the victim to exit the place using a side door.\n\nAs the man began to move away from the Iron Coffins motorcycle club members, many members ran after him and began assaulting him.\n\nAccording to the police department, witnesses said that the victim was able to hold off one attacker.\n\nThe others joined the fray when he tried to defend himself against the second. The assailants gave the man a head wound.\n\nThe incident had gone from the bar to the sidewalk nearby, WJBK-TV reported. The police station was next door.\n\nHowever, according to the police department, cops were out on patrol when the incident occurred, WJBK-TV reported.\n\nTherefore, there were no officers at the station during the attack.\n\nAuthorities released an image of the persons of interest on April 4.

      "text": "'One Of The Top Three': Feds Nab MS-13 Kingpin Roughly One Hour Away From Nation's Capital\n\nA top MS-13 leader was arrested early Thursday morning just outside of Washington, D.C., in the northern Virginia area, law enforcement leaders announced shortly afterward.\n\nThe individual, who law enforcement has yet to identify, was described as one of the top three leaders of MS-13 in the entire United States, according to a joint press conference given by U.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi, Virginia GOP Governor Glenn Youngkin and FBI Director Kash Patel. They hailed the arrest as a major victory in the Trump administration's war against organized crime.\n\n\"He was the leader for the East Coast, one of the top three in the entire country, right here in Virginia, living half an hour outside of Washington, D.C.,\" Bondi said Thursday. \"He is an illegal alien from El Salvador and he will not be living in our country much longer.\"\n\n\"America is safer today because one of the top domestic terrorists in MS-13 is off the streets,\" Bondi continued, and gave credit to President Donald Trump for allowing law enforcement to better apprehend criminals across the country.\n\nMS-13 in an international criminal syndicate tied to countless murders, rapes and other heinous crimes across the U.S. over the years. Although its origins began in Los Angeles, the gang is largely associated with Salvadoran nationals - and El Salvador President Nayib Bukele has taken great strides in incarcerating many MS-13 gang members in his mega-prison.\n\nMS-13 was among the gangs and cartels that President Donald Trump designated as foreign terrorist organizations, enabling federal officials to better take enforcement actions against them.\n\n\"This is what happens when you let good cops be cops, and we're going to continue to be cops across this country,\" Patel said Thursday. \"And if you are here illegally, you will not be here any longer, and if you are going to continue to commit acts of violent crime, you will meet the same fate that this individual did this morning.\"\n\nYoungkin, who was involved in the task force behind the major bust, stressed the importance of state and federal law enforcement partners working together to dismantle organized crime. He specifically encouraged other leaders to adopt 287(g) agreements , which deputize local police with immigration authorities, streamlining the arrest and deportation of criminal illegal migrants.\n\nFBI PRESS CONFERENCE\n\n. @ambermarieduke : \"How long was this individual living in the United States illegally and operating as a leader of MS-13?\"\n\nFBI DIRECTOR PATEL: \"The bottom line is-for FAR too long.... If you're here for a minute, a day, a month, or a year you've been... pic.twitter.com/ZQ1VO3told\n\n- Daily Caller (@DailyCaller) March 27, 2025\n\n\"Listen, it's time for us to recognize that Virginia is not a sanctuary state,\" Youngkin said. \"We are working to get the bad guys out of here, and if you are a local jurisdiction and not helping us and not cooperating with us, you are working against the safety of all of those men and women that call your jurisdiction home.\"\n\nOfficials confirmed that the Thursday arrest took place in Dale City, Virginia, roughly a one-hour drive south from Washington, D.C. They also noted that law enforcement actions have dramatically ticked up since Trump returned to the White House -  arrests in Virginia have increased 468% in the last four weeks compared to the same period last year, according to Bondi.\n\nIn less than a month, law enforcement officials in Virginia have arrested 342 individuals, many of them being illegal migrants, U.S. Attorney of Virginia's Eastern District Erik Siebert said. Of those 342 arrested, 81 were identified as individuals with gang or transnational crime affiliation.\n\n\"MS -13 - they are organized, they are violent, they are committing homicides throughout our country,\" Bondi said. \"They are one of the most dangerous gangs in our country and we are going to fight until they are completely dismantled.\"\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "Student Found Dead Clutching Grass in Horrific Way, Cops Say Staff's Decision Caused It\n\nEditor's Note: Our readers responded strongly to this story when it originally ran; we're reposting it here in case you missed it.\n\nTwo years ago, 20-year-old Grant Brace died following the first day of conditioning for the wrestling team at the University of the Cumberlands in Williamsburg, Kentucky. An ongoing investigation from a local news station has uncovered disturbing new details about the incident.\n\nAccording to WKRC-TV , Brace died from heatstroke on Aug. 31, 2020, but his death might have been preventable.\n\nAround 3 p.m. on that day, the wrestling team moved its practice outside from the gym, police told the outlet. Coaches reportedly instructed team members to \"throw their water bottles on the fence and not touch them.\"\n\nWith this demand, the coaches allegedly ignored a special exemption Brace had been granted, the report said. He was diagnosed with narcolepsy, and the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics allowed him to take Adderall, which is usually banned for athletes competing in NAIA events.\n\nAdderall is a stimulant, which means it increases a person's heart rate and body temperature, longtime college athletic trainer Aaron Himmler told WKRC. For that reason, dehydration can be a common side effect.\n\nBrace's parents said the doctor's exemption approved by the NAIA was supposed to grant him unlimited access to water because he was taking the drug.\n\nOn the day of his death, the coaches had athletes running sprints up a 200-foot hill with a 35 percent incline - nicknamed \"punishment hill\" - because one of them didn't meet a fundraising goal, WKRC reported, citing court documents.\n\nBrace fell behind during the drills, and coaches eventually told him to \"leave the hill and clean out his locker.\" He briefly returned to the locker room before going back to the hill and telling coaches he wanted to prove himself.\n\nAccording to WKRC, Williamsburg Police Chief Wayne Bird wrote in a report that witnesses had described the ensuing moments to him.\n\n\"Some witnesses describe a lot of verbal abuse by the coaches and even teammates as Grant continued to attempt sprints up the hill,\" Bird wrote. \"Witnesses describe a short team meeting on the hill after the sprints when Grant was holding on to a small tree limb, swaying back and forth, saying, 'I can't stand.'\"\n\nBrace continually asked for water after the conclusion of the practice and eventually laid down on a mat in exhaustion , according to WKRC. The coaches reportedly had no mercy on him.\n\n\"At one point witnesses state Grant opened a cooler full of ice that was provided by the trainer and began to immerse himself in the ice and began splashing ice on his body,\" Bird wrote. \"Witnesses state at times Grant would say, 'Guys, I need water. Get me some water.' And at one point some witnesses hear Grant state his pupils were twitching and he couldn't see.\n\n\"One witness attempted to wrap ice in a towel and place it on Grant when he was stopped by the coach because Grant didn't perform well on the hill.\"\n\nBrace's condition deteriorated to the point that he began speaking gibberish and tackled a teammate before running out of the gym, WKRC said. In the report, Bird wrote that Brace was seen on security footage from another building in the area.\n\n\"He ran to a nearby building and attempted to pull open a locked door. When he could not get the door open, he kicked the door [and] ran off out the view of the camera,\" Bird wrote. \"In the video, Grant appeared to be in panic or what I would describe as fight or flight.\"\n\nBrace was not seen again until about two hours later, the police report said, according to WKRC. A passer-by called 911 and said he found Brace unconscious outside the school's Grace Crum Rollins Fine Arts Center.\n\nAccording to WKRC, the center is one of three buildings facing the only fountain on the University of the Cumberlands campus. Brace was found clutching the grass just a few yards away from that fountain, which had no water in it at the time.\n\nBy the time the person called 911, it was too late. The Kentucky Medical Examiner's office ruled that Brace died of exertional heat stroke.\n\nWhat is the cost of creating a champion? #athletesATrisk\n\nhttps://t.co/AFjmnpbnVb\n\n- Stephanie Kuzydym (@stephkuzy) June 2, 2022\n\nBrian Gossett, who was Brace's high school wrestling coach, told WKRC he struggled to come to terms with Brace's tragic death .\n\n\"It's almost unimaginable to me,\" he said. \"For him to die alone is the part that - is the part that I just can't come to grips with, that he struggled in the last minutes of his life for just somebody to help him.\n\n\"That's the part that I just can't get over. It's just unimaginable to me that somebody would just let him die without helping him.\"\n\nJordan Countryman was serving as the University of the Cumberlands' head wrestling coach at the time of Brace's death, but he resigned in April 2021, WKRC reported.\n\nHe was named in a wrongful death lawsuit relating to the incident. According to the Lexington Herald-Leader , the family's lawsuit also names the university, the Cumberland Foundation, University President Larry Cockrum, Cumberland Athletic Properties, Athletics Director Chris Kraftick and assistant coach Jake Sinkovics.\n\nThe Williamsburg Police Department said the investigation into Brace's death remains open and active.\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal .\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

      "text": "Busted: Man Hit With 40 Theft Charges After Cops Find 1,200 Stolen Car Parts in Storage Unit\n\nCrooks have ramped up theft of catalytic converters from cars in recent years.\n\nThe auto part contains three rare earth metals - platinum, palladium and rhodium. The device cleans vehicle exhaust before it's released into the air, making modern automobiles more environmentally friendly.\n\nPhoenix police on Thursday discovered a mother lode of the car parts in an inconspicuous storage unit. A suspect was charged with 40 counts of unlawful purchase or sale of a used catalytic converter in connection to the parts, which police said were stolen.\n\nShelton Ford was accused of buying and selling the stolen parts. He reportedly operated the storage unit near Phoenix's Sky Harbor Airport.\n\nAccording to KSAZ-TV , Ford had an extensive criminal history , including an aggravated DUI conviction that landed him 10 years in prison.\n\nPhoenix police indicated that the bust came after an investigation into the stolen catalytic converter trade that had lasted for months.\n\n#PHXPD recovers more than 1,000 used and detached catalytic converters from a storage unit while serving a search warrant. This concludes a months long investigation into a suspect accused of buying and selling them. pic.twitter.com/OwKUYbIBsF\n\n- Phoenix Police (@PhoenixPolice) May 26, 2022\n\n\"We were very surprised at the amount in there,\" said Det. Adam Popelier of the bust. \"I would say at least half had the typical markings of being stolen: the cut ends, the damaged pipes.\"\n\n\"Others looked like they had been unbolted, so they could have come from other places.\"\n\nAccording to The Associated Press , reports of catalytic converter thefts have skyrocketed in recent years.\n\nVictims reported 3,969 thefts in 2019, compared to 17,000 in 2020, and a whopping 52,000 last year.\n\nReplacing a stolen catalytic converter can cost as much as $3,000, according to the National Insurance Crime Bureau. It's a price sometimes high enough to make repairing the car nonviable.\n\nEarlier this month, Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey signed a new law into effect to fight the theft of catalytic converters, which appears even more commonplace in the state.\n\nThe new law makes possession of the devices a crime in some circumstances when they've been separated from a vehicle and mandates new regulations on the trade of the parts, such as requiring scrapyards to keep them in their original condition for a week.\n\nFederally, lawmakers such as Rep. Jim Baird of Indiana are pushing legislation that would require catalytic converters to be serialized for tracking and accountability.\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal .\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

New York City police said that the evidence clearly suggests that the attack was planned.\n\nFollowing the shooting, the suspect abandoned a burner phone in an alley, according to police sources who spoke to FOX . Police are now investigating fingerprints left on a water bottle, a burner phone, and data that was on the phone.\n\nAccording to two law enforcement sources who reached out to the press on Thursday, the masked shooter who followed and killed the chairman of one of the biggest health insurers in the United States, had the words \"delay,\" \"deny,\" and \"depose\" written on his ammunition, mirroring a phrase used by industry critics.\n\nOne of the officials, who spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity since he was not permitted to publicly disclose specifics of the probe, said that the phrases were scribbled in permanent marker.\n\nThe expression \"delay, deny, depose\" is frequently used by attorneys and critics of the insurance industry to describe strategies aimed at avoiding payment on claims. It describes how insurance companies postpone payments, reject claims, and then defend their positions. Physicians and patients have increasingly criticized health insurers such as UnitedHealthcare for rejecting claims or making it more difficult to acquire care, which is life-saving in many cases.\n\nLaw enforcement officials verified to the press on Thursday night that t he masked shooter wanted for stalking and fatally shooting UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, reportedly took a bus from Atlanta, Georgia, to New York in order to commit the murder.\n\nThe authorities believe that the suspect is now back in Atlanta.\n\nStay informed!

The agency went on to reiterate that they were only assigned to guard the grounds where Trump's rally was held.\n\nHowever, neighbors close to Butler Farm Show Grounds told reporters that neither local nor federal law enforcement ever paid them a visit in the days preceding or following the rally.\n\n\"Nobody contacted me.

Nobody called me, nobody stopped here,\" said Valerie Fennell, a nearby resident whose house comes close to the fairgrounds, just beyond a line of trees.\n\n\"I kinda was thinking that as close as my house is, that I honestly thought this might be part of a command station at some point,\" she added.\n\nNot only did Fennell claim that no one from law enforcement had gotten in touch with her, but she also said that, despite living so close to the rally, her entire neighborhood had been mysteriously abandoned in receiving any sort of communication.\n\n\"I was talking to my neighbors yesterday, and none of them had gotten a call. Or anything,\" she continued, while her sister nodded in agreement.\n\n\"I guess it's kind of the same question that everybody has. I guess, as far as like, why that area wasn't secure.\"\n\nCNN reported that attendees saw 20-year-old Thomas Crooks acting strangely close to the rally metal detectors. Local police enforcement was alerted and they purportedly warned the Secret Service to be on the lookout for him over their radios.\n\nIn addition, he was said to have been observed entering the rally with a rifle outside of a security checkpoint. Later, he was allegedly seen jumping \"roof to roof\" before arriving at the AGR facility.\n\nPrior to eventually reacting to reports of an armed man on the AGR roof, it appears that police were unable to locate him during the period those alerts were sent out.\n\nAccording to law enforcement officials who spoke with the Associated Press , at approximately 6:10 p.m., a local police officer ascended a ladder onto the roof and confronted Crooks, who was  already aiming his gun at him.\n\nCrooks took aim and fired around eight shots at the rally as the officer retreated down the ladder. He struck Trump in the ear, critically injured two more people in the crowd, and killed bystander Corey Comperatore in the audience. Crooks was then shot dead by Secret Service counter snipers who were positioned on a barn rooftop behind the stage in a matter of moments. It is unclear if the shooters had noticed Crooks prior to the rounds being fired, but they seemed to have their sights focused on him before starting to shoot.\n\nThe Secret Service acknowledged that it mostly relied on local law enforcement to assist with event security, stating to the Washington Post that this is \"standard procedure\" when seeking assistance from local organizations.\n\nThe heavily armed agents covering Trump's evacuation, known as the Secret Service's counter assault team, consisted of at least six officers from Butler County tactical units in addition to leaving the areas outside the rally perimeter under the jurisdiction of local police. The team consisted of only two members of the Secret Service.\n\nTwo local sniper teams supported the two teams of snipers from the Secret Service.\n\nAlthough Pennsylvania police acknowledged that they often assist the Secret Service when important government figures visit the state, they doubled down and stressed that the federal agency is ultimately in charge.\n\n\"Secret Service always has the lead on securing something like this,\" stated Lt. Col. George Bivens of the Pennsylvania State Police.\n\n\"We work with them to provide whatever is requested by the Secret Service, but they're the lead in that security,\" he added.\n\nHouse Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer (R-Ky.) announced plans to call agency director Kimberly Cheatle for a hearing on July 22 nd in response to calls for an inquiry of the Secret Service and the circumstances that led Crooks to come within millimeters of almost killing Trump.\n\nStay informed!

      "text": "Biden-Harris Equity Commission Wants To Spend $20 Million To Disarm Traffic Cops\n\nCriminals opened fire on at least 134 police officers during routine traffic stops from 2021 through 2023, federal data show. Now, an equity commission convened by the Biden-Harris administration wants to spend $20 million on a pilot program that would deploy unarmed cops to conduct traffic enforcement.\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Transportation Equity, an Obama-era body revived by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg last year, said in a report released this month that cops don't need to carry guns or tasers with them when out on the streets enforcing traffic laws. The commission, whose membership includes an activist who once said cars perpetuate \"systemic racism,\" urged the federal government to spend $20 million developing a pilot program to \"test the use of non-lethal, perhaps non-police traffic enforcement.\"\n\n\"Citing a driver for having a broken taillight, forgetting to use a turn signal, or even failing to stop at a stop sign, does not require the use of a gun, taser, or similar tool,\" the commission said.\n\nThe data suggest otherwise. In fact, traffic stops are one of the most dangerous aspects of a police officer's job, according to Justice Department statistics.\n\nRoutine traffic stops have been the third-deadliest out of 11 commonly performed police activities since the start of the Biden-Harris administration in January 2021, according to annual reports compiled by the Justice Department. At least 134 police officers have been shot at during traffic stops during the Biden-Harris administration, 23 of whom lost their lives.\n\nThe commission's recommendation to the Biden-Harris administration to disarm traffic cops could cause headaches for Vice President Kamala Harris, who in 2020 praised the \"defund the police\" movement but is now presenting herself to voters as a tough-on-crime former prosecutor. The Transportation Department did not return a request for comment.\n\nThe Justice Department reports detail how attacks on police officers during traffic stops can come out of nowhere. In one 2023 incident, for example, officers came under fire after stopping to assist a disabled motorist.\n\n\"The driver then opened fire, striking an officer,\" the Justice Department report stated . \"Officers returned fire, striking the suspect. The suspect fled the scene in the officer's vehicle but eventually crashed and died because of their injuries.\"\n\nSimilar stories abound. On July 3, a DUI suspect opened fire on two officers with the Los Angeles Police Department with a fully automatic rifle before fleeing the scene. The officers survived, with one suffering graze wounds to his head. The suspect was arrested less than two weeks later.\n\nFlorida police officer Joseph Bullock wasn't so lucky. A 19-year veteran trooper, Bullock pulled over to help someone who he thought was having car troubles in February 2020 when that person \"shot him, resulting in fatal injuries.\" Another police officer who was passing by the scene later killed the suspect, Tribune Media reported.\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Transportation Equity did not mention the inherent danger posed to police officers during traffic stops in its report. Instead, the commission highlighted a 2021 New York Times report that found police officers killed over 400 individuals during a five-year period. The Times report noted most of those killings were found to be legally justified.\n\n\"Considering the violence police have committed at traffic stops, especially on Black and Brown individuals, it is clear alternatives to this approach are necessary to ensure the safety of our streets,\" the commission's report said.\n\nThe Advisory Committee on Transportation Equity was first activated during the Obama administration but was shuttered during the Trump administration. Buttigieg revived the commission in August 2023 at the behest of 15 Democratic senators, including vulnerable swing state Sen. Bob Casey (D., Pa.) in November 2021.\n\n\"We believe that permanently reinstating the Committee would align with the Biden Administration's commitment to integrating equity throughout the President's Build Back Better agenda,\" Casey and his fellow senators wrote in a letter to Buttigieg. \"We also believe that the Committee would help recognize and address the impact of our transportation infrastructure on climate change, health, housing, disability rights, environmental justice, safety, and other issues through meaningful collaboration.\"\n\nPublished under: Bob Casey , Crime , Defund the Police , DEI , Joe Biden , Kamala Harris , Pete Buttigieg\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Meet the Arizona DA Candidate Who Wants To Prosecute Cops, Not Criminals\n\nA Democratic district attorney candidate in Arizona has an interesting pitch for voters: Elect me and I'll prosecute cops, not criminals.\n\nJulie Gunnigle, who is running in a special election for Maricopa County attorney this November, has pledged to form a special division within her office to prosecute police shootings and use of force . The move would put the county attorney at odds with members of local law enforcement, with whom the prosecutor's office must regularly cooperate on cases. Gunnigle will take an easier tack with criminals. She has pledged not to prosecute drug-related offenses, reduce incarceration, and push to release offenders before trial.\n\nGunnigle's anti-cop pledge comes as crime rises in Arizona and across the country. In Phoenix, Maricopa County's largest municipality, crime was up more than 40 percent in 2020 and stayed nearly as high the following year. Amid rising crime, voters have soured on progressive prosecutors like San Francisco's Chesa Boudin, whom voters ousted in June. Like Boudin and other progressive prosecutors, Gunnigle has taken money from the left-wing billionaire George Soros. She received $6,550 from Way to Lead PAC last quarter, to which Soros's Democracy PAC has contributed hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nGunnigle opposes police unions and told Axios she turned down their campaign funding in order to win Planned Parenthood's support in Arizona. She says if elected she will not prosecute abortion cases under a 15-week abortion ban Arizona governor Doug Ducey (R.) signed into law in March.\n\nA spokeswoman for Gunnigle's campaign said the prosecutor believes that \"Arizona residents deserve a County Attorney who can multitask-holding bad actors in the government accountable while using data and evidence to actually improve safety for regular people.\"\n\nRunning on a similar platform in 2020, Gunnigle lost her first race for county attorney to Republican incumbent Allister Adel. She promised during the campaign to reopen past cases of police officer-involved deaths, among other reform efforts. After losing her race, Gunnigle in 2021 served on the board of a marijuana-legalization advocacy group.\n\nAdel, whose tenure as Maricopa County attorney was marked by alcoholism, resigned in March, prompting a special election this year.\n\nGunnigle's opponent is Rachel Mitchell (R.), who has served as acting county attorney since Adel's resignation. Mitchell is best known for her role in the 2018 Senate confirmation hearings for Justice Brett Kavanaugh. An expert on sex crimes, she noted inconsistencies in Dr. Christine Blasey Ford's testimony against Kavanaugh and said \"a reasonable prosecutor\" would never have taken up the case. Mitchell has served for decades as a prosecutor in Maricopa County.\n\nGunnigle has criticized Mitchell for her role in the hearings, saying her opponent \"fought tooth and nail to install Kavanaugh.\"\n\nGunnigle's campaign manager, Bruce Franks, has advocated for defunding police departments . Gunnigle has not answered questions about defunding police and said the issue is a \"distraction.\"\n\nFranks, a self-described \" battle rapper ,\" rose to prominence as a member of the Black Lives Matter movement in Ferguson, Mo., following the police shooting of Michael Brown. He served as a Democrat in the state legislature from 2016 to 2019 before resigning to focus on his \"mental health.\" Months later, an ethics probe found Franks spent thousands from campaign funds on his personal expenses. He was fined $14,000.\n\nPublished under: Arizona , Chesa Boudin , Crime , George Soros\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Revealed: House Candidate Will Rollins Uses Actors To Portray Cop and Judge in Campaign Ad in Latest Exaggeration of 'Tough on Crime' Chops\n\nWill Rollins, the Democratic challenger in a hotly contested Southern California congressional race, is leaning heavily on his prosecutorial record on the campaign trail. He is even using professional actors to play law enforcement officials in a campaign ad, the Washington Free Beacon found. The ad shows Rollins, a former prosecutor, hard at work in various law enforcement settings, chatting with a detective at a roadside crime scene, arguing before a judge in a courtroom, and conferring with officers in what appears to be a police workroom.\n\nRollins is running on his record as an assistant U.S. attorney in the Central District of California, where he claims he fought the Sinaloa cartel, MS-13, and ISIS. A series of recent Free Beacon reports found no evidence to back up many of his claims-and evidence that he exaggerated or embellished others.\n\n\"Will Rollins, a counterterrorism prosecutor, took on ISIS terrorists and went after the Sinaloa cartel to stop illegal drugs from crossing our border,\" a Rollins ad released in February states. It shows the candidate speaking in front of a judge and conversing with a cop.\n\nThe spot is intended to showcase Rollins's deep connection to law enforcement. But the cop and judge aren't real-they're C-list actors with long lists of cameos and credits, including on popular shows such as Grey's Anatomy and lesser-known flicks like the Chinese-produced teacher-student romance Ms. Swan, Show Me Love .\n\nThe revelation is the latest example of how Rollins is using misrepresentation, showmanship, and exaggeration to burnish his law enforcement record as he seeks to unseat longtime GOP incumbent Ken Calvert, whom Rollins has attacked for \"failing to respect law enforcement.\"\n\nThe judge shown in Rollins's ad is the actor, dancer, and choreographer Jayson Wright . Following stints as a backup dancer for the likes of Pink and Justin Timberlake , Wright turned to acting. He played a \"bar patron\" in a 2022 episode of Grey's Anatomy , sipping whiskey by himself as the camera panned to Ellen Pompeo. Wright made a brief, nonspeaking appearance as a detective in Netflix's The Vince Staples Show , where he appeared emerging silently from his office in the background as main character Vince talked with two (also fake) cops.\n\nWright did secure a speaking role in Ms. Swan, Show Me Love , an online \"micro-series\" produced by Chinese-owned video streaming app ReelShort that depicts a forbidden romance between a new teacher, Ms. Swan, and a student at a prestigious private high school.\n\nWright plays a patron at a local bar where a scantily clad Ms. Swan works nights. When Ms. Swan delivers Wright's character a beer and asks if there's \"anything else\" she can get him, he responds, creepily, \"It's possible...\"\n\nThe cop Rollins huddles with in his ad, meanwhile, is Jeff Deglow , a 40-year-old Calgary, Alberta, native who moved to the United States as a college student \"to pursue acting as a career.\"\n\nDeglow got his start performing in a \"Shakespearean show\" in Arizona. He touts his \"incredible handle on Shakespearean text,\" though he has lamented that he \"always seem[s] to play the Fools.\"\n\nIn 2022, he played \"Gus\" in the online film Billie the Kid: Vampires of the Wild West , a Western-vampire crossover in which the \"gun-slinging 'Miss Billie'\" partners with the local sheriff to take down scores of the bloodsucking undead. A review of the movie on a vampire media blog gave it a \"4 out of 10.\"\n\n\"This wasn't that bad,\" the review states. It did not mention Deglow's \"Gus.\"\n\nDeglow has had more success booking commercials, which can provide a lifeline to working actors. He has appeared in TV and digital ads for companies such as Samsung, T-Mobile, U-Haul, and Lenovo, according to his website . In a 2022 spot for do-it-yourself pest control company Self Control Pest, he plays a nerdy husband working to keep his wife away from a chiseled contractor who steals her attention while working outside.\n\nAway from his commercial work, Deglow is best known for his acting in online videos produced by Dhar Mann Studios, a \"content creation company\" that releases straight-to-YouTube short films.\n\nFounded by Dhar Mann, a former \" ganjapreneur \" who in 2013 pleaded no contest to five felony counts for defrauding the city of Oakland, the company is known , according to the New York Times , for its \"openly click bait\" titles and no-frills dialogue meant to cater to children and non-native English speakers. It boasts more than 23 million YouTube subscribers.\n\nDeglow has appeared in at least four of the company's videos over the last year. His initial roles were underwhelming. In a 2023 video titled \"BAKER's Life CHANGED In 24 Hours, What Happens Is Shocking,\" Deglow plays \"Customer 7,\" one of many extras who stand in line at a pop-up bakery for a young girl with a chronic illness. In another video, titled \"Woman CALLS COPS On POOR HOMELESS BOY, What Happens Next Is Shocking,\" Deglow plays a journalist who attends a mayoral candidate's press conference. He does not speak in either video.\n\nThat changed for Deglow earlier this month, when he landed a speaking role in the Dhar Mann Studios hit, \"2 MEAN GIRLS Backstab BEST FRIEND.\" The video , which has more than 3.6 million views in less than a week, depicts a pair of high school girls who film their friend having a schizophrenic episode. Deglow plays the schizophrenic student's drama teacher, delivering riveting lines such as \"Actors and thespians, lend me your ears: We have found our two leads.\"\n\nCampaigns do often use actors in their ads, but it's typically to provide voiceover skills, or they're used for just their hands. Rollins's use of actors, showing their faces in specific roles, is unusual, even more so in that his ads don't contain disclosures.\n\nIndeed, there appears to be no acknowledgment anywhere of the actors' roles. Wright and Deglow have not disclosed their work in the Rollins ad publicly-despite showcasing much of their output online, as is customary for working actors. Wright did not respond to a request for comment, while Deglow confirmed his participation in the ad but declined to comment further. Rollins's campaign did not respond to a request for comment, nor did Mvar Media, the Democratic advertising firm that Rollins has paid more than $180,000 for \"ad production\" and other services since May 2023.\n\nRollins lost narrowly to Calvert in 2022, and the pair's rematch is expected to be tight, particularly given that recent redistricting swapped red areas in California's Inland Empire for overwhelmingly liberal Palm Springs.\n\nLiberal media outlet Slate has cited Rollins as proof that Democrats \"are just fine running as cops,\" comparing the congressional hopeful to Vice President Kamala Harris, who is also running on her record as a former prosecutor.\n\nPublished under: 2024 Elections , California , Campaign , Hollywood , Will Rollins\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Pete Buttigieg, Whose Mayoral Admin Held Diversity Trainings Lecturing Cops on 'Sizeism,' Now Takes Aim at 'Portlandia' Diversity Trainings\n\nAs a prospective Senate candidate, Pete Buttigieg is denouncing the diversity trainings that have become synonymous with the Democratic Party's liberal wing, saying they look \"like something straight out of Portlandia .\" As mayor of South Bend, Ind., he championed such training, with his administration implementing a series of diversity sessions that lectured cops on \"sizeism\" and \"languageism\" amid a surge in violent crime.\n\nButtigieg, speaking Tuesday at a University of Chicago Institute of Politics panel on the \"Future of the Democratic Party,\" addressed the party's focus on \"diversity.\" He said he would \"always fight\" to care \"for people's different experiences.\" He also took aim at diversity training, saying Americans shouldn't be made to \"sit through a training that looks like something out of Portlandia , which I have also experienced, and it is how Trump Republicans are made.\"\n\nCops in South Bend had a similar experience when Buttigieg served as mayor.\n\nIn 2017, with Buttigieg a year into his second term, South Bend's police department instituted diversity and anti-discrimination training sessions aimed at \"Bridging Relationships and Strengthening Community Through Inclusion,\" the Washington Free Beacon reported in 2020. Slides from the sessions lamented \"Implicit Bias\" and presented cops with a list called \"The 'Ism' Trail,\" which denounced nefarious \"isms\" that perpetuate prejudice and power dynamics, including \"racism,\" \"sexism,\" \"ageism,\" \"languageism,\" \"materialism,\" \"classism,\" \"colorism,\" and \"sizeism.\"\n\nA similar list of \"Key Terms & Definitions\" urged officers to refrain from using the term \"hearing-impaired,\" calling it \"offensive\" to deaf people as it implies \"that their hearing is broken, and needs to be fixed.\" One year after the training sessions took place, in 2018, violent crime in South Bend reached its highest level in 20 years . Buttigieg, in 2019, apologized for the police department's lack of diversity, saying, \"I couldn't get it done.\"\n\nButtigieg's Tuesday comments came as the Indiana native turned Michigan resident takes a \"serious look\" at a 2026 Senate run in the Great Lakes State, where he and his husband moved in 2022 \"because of family.\" As Buttigieg eyes that run, he's worked to distance himself from the left-wing policies that defined his failed 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nAt that time, Buttigieg completed an American Civil Liberties Union survey sent to all presidential candidates. In it, he supported taxpayer-funded gender transition surgeries for federal inmates and illegal immigrants-a position that helped derail Kamala Harris's failed presidential campaign-and pledged to reduce the size of the \"immigration detention system by at least 75%,\" including by \"cutting ICE's detention budget.\"\n\n\"I would direct my HHS Office of Civil Rights and Department of Justice to vigorously enforce all federal laws against discrimination based on gender identity, including ensuring the provision of all medically necessary care for transgender Americans,\" Buttigieg wrote at the time. \"This includes medical care for transgender individuals incarcerated in federal prisons and under immigration detention.\"\n\nButtigieg walked back his answers last week, with his spokesman telling the Free Beacon that he \"does not support slashing ICE's detention budget\" and merely pledged to \"faithfully enforce all federal laws against discrimination.\" His husband, Chasten, has a long history of voicing similar opinions, having argued in 2023 that minors should be permitted to undergo sex change surgeries and hormone therapy treatments.\n\n\"I believe those types of conversations and decisions should be left to a transgender person or the parents,\" Chasten Buttigieg said during a C-SPAN appearance after a caller asked him about those treatments. \"I know that every major medical-reputable medical-association in this country supports gender-affirming care, so I'm going to follow experts in the field and listen to them because I value those trans lives.\"\n\nPublicly, top Michigan Democrats like Sen. Gary Peters, whose decision to forgo reelection provided the opening for Buttigieg, have praised the former mayor's potential candidacy. Privately, however, some politicos have argued that Buttigieg's carpetbagger status could prove difficult to overcome.\n\nPublished under: Crime , Critical Race Theory , DEI , Diversity Training , Michigan , Pete Buttigieg , Portlandia , Transgenderism , Violent Crime\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

And so if you could just let everybody know who was hurt by that, that I'm just incredibly sorry,\" she said. \"I know it wasn't me, but I'm really sorry. ... I saw it, and I'm really sorry.\"\n\nArmstrong took over as Columbia's interim president following Minouche Shafik's abrupt resignation in August, which came following mounting pressure from both Jewish students angered by the encampment chaos and anti-Israel activists who opposed Shafik's decision to use police to restore order. Shafik spent days during the height of the encampment negotiating with student protest leaders , but the effort proved fruitless.\n\nArmstrong's interview with the student newspaper, her first since taking over for Shafik, suggests she is poised to side with the activists as Columbia encounters a fresh wave of protests during the new school year.\n\nOn the first day of classes , pro-Hamas students, using keffiyehs to cover their faces, blocked an entrance to campus, praised Hamas, vandalized a statue, and clashed with police. One day later, they gathered outside former Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton's \"sham class\" to protest her \"war crimes.\"\n\nIn addition to her role as interim president, Armstrong serves as CEO of Columbia's Irving Medical Center. Asked by the Daily Spectator whether she would discuss divestment from Israel with student protesters, Armstrong pledge to develop \"models for 'meaningful engagement' to 'really bring us together and think about what we want to be.'\"\n\n\"There's kind of a moment that our community may need to come together and wrap our arms around our community here on Columbia, to rebuild those connections with each other, to kind of understand, 'How do we create the community that we believe in, that also is trustworthy with our outside neighbors?'\" she said.\n\n\"From my perspective,\" she concluded, \"I have decided that my role is to ask the best possible questions that can lead us forward.\"\n\nPublished under: Activists , anti-Israel , Anti-Semitism , Columbia University , Protests , Riots\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "America Has Fewest Cops in a Quarter Century, Data Find\n\nThere are now fewer police officers per person in the United States than at any point in the last 25 years, recently released federal data show, after over a decade of decline.\n\nThere were roughly 214 police officers per 100,000 Americans in 2019, according to the latest figures from the Census Bureau's Annual Survey of Public Employment and Payroll, which tracks employment across state and local governments. That represents a 1.5 percent decline from 2018 and a 9 percent drop from 2007, when police numbers last peaked.\n\nSince that year, the number of sworn officers has declined precipitously, thanks in part to the Great Recession's effects on police budgets and in part to growing hostility to law enforcement in the years since mass protests in Ferguson, Mo. Recent events, including a wave of retirements and the cancellations of recruitment classes amid public outcry and COVID-driven budget crunches, suggest that the trend will persist through 2020.\n\nThat trend bodes ill for violent crime in America-which has plateaued in recent years-given the large body of evidence finding that cops have a substantial impact on crime rates. The continued erosion of America's police force, in other words, could mean a resurgence of the high crime rates that plagued the country throughout the 1980s and '90s-a deadly consequence of this creeping trend.\n\nThe number of sworn police officers rose steadily throughout the 1990s, in part due to expanded federal funding under the 1994 crime bill. That increase has been associated with significant reductions in crime and is considered to be a major driver of the \"great crime decline\" of the late '90s and early 2000s.\n\nBut, after remaining elevated throughout the middle of that decade, police employment rates began to crater amid the Great Recession, as state and local austerity kicked in. They took another nosedive beginning in 2016, the year after the first round of police protests drove public confidence in cops to its lowest level to date.\n\nThese two events have contributed to deeper demographic and labor market shifts, with many departments seeing a wave of retirements, according to a 2018 report from the Police Executive Research Forum, a nonpartisan organization of police chiefs. At the same time, the relatively meager wages of policing and increasing legal and social threats to the job are pushing away young people who might otherwise take up the badge.\n\n\"A lot of forces have converged over the last decade or so to make policing a much less attractive line of work,\" Rafael Mangual, deputy director of legal policy at the Manhattan Institute, told the Washington Free Beacon .\n\nMangual noted that in addition to low pay, police are seeing an uptick in violent deaths as well as an increase in \"legal risk\": \"We've seen a new push for 'accountability' that often comes in the form of officers being laid off or prosecuted or sued, and a very robust public discussion of how to expand the scope of legal liability for police officers.\"\n\nThose trends are likely to only grow more pronounced in the next several years. Nationwide protests against the police have prompted a wave of retirements among both chiefs and the rank and file, with NYPD retirements up 75 percent compared with 2019. A number of large cities across the country- including New York, Austin, Portland, Baltimore, and Washington, D.C.-have responded to these protests by slashing police budgets by up to a third, meaning fewer resources for hiring and training.\n\nThe public fixation on police has, in fact, come at a time of general belt-tightening, driven by the coronavirus. Census Bureau data show that police account for roughly 7 percent of all payroll spending, while national data suggest they consistently account for between 4 and 5 percent of all state and local spending. But while a small share of budget burden, major city police forces now are likely to face a disproportionate share of the coming austerity, as the political controversy around them benefits other public sector workers.\n\nThe major effect of that reduction, Mangual predicted, \"is a reduced capacity to fight crime and keep violent crime at bay.\"\n\n\"If you limit police departments' ability to put cops on dots, as it were, that's going to translate to an increase in crime,\" he said.\n\nOverwhelming empirical evidence supports the idea that cops have a deterrent effect on day-to-day crime and that therefore their reduced manpower could lead to a spike in crime. In New York, where Mayor Bill de Blasio has overseen the slashing of the force, shootings in the city have nearly doubled 2019 figures. That increase in shootings may be linked to the manpower demands of ongoing mass protests-a troubling sign for a world that will soon see fewer cops on the beat.\n\nPublished under: Police\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "George Soros Funds Groups Behind DNC Riot Where Protesters Assaulted Cops\n\nProgressive megadonor George Soros funds the anti-Israel groups behind a demonstration outside Democratic National Committee headquarters where six police officers were assaulted Wednesday night.\n\nProtesters with IfNotNow, Jewish Voice for Peace, and the Democratic Socialists of America gathered outside the Democratic headquarters to pressure lawmakers to support a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas war. According to U.S. Capitol Police, six officers were assaulted, including some who were pepper-sprayed, when they tried to prevent demonstrators from blocking an exit from the building with a dumpster. Officers arrested one man, 24-year-old Ruben Camacho, who punched a female officer in the face.\n\n\"We have handled hundreds of peaceful protests, but last night's group was not peaceful,\" Capitol Police said in a statement .\n\nWednesday's violence could draw scrutiny for supporters of the left-wing groups, especially given the focus in recent years on assaults of Capitol Police officers on Jan. 6, 2021. Soros's philanthropy, Open Society Foundations, has given $650,000 to Jewish Voice for Peace since 2017 to fund the group's \"human rights\" work in the Middle East. Open Society awarded $400,000 to IfNotNow in 2019 and 2021, the Washington Free Beacon reported .\n\nSoros, the Democratic Party's most prolific donor, has contributed $1,036,500 to the DNC since 2020, according to campaign finance records .\n\nThe Democratic Socialists of America counts five House Democrats as members, all of whom have been critical of Israel over its response to last month's Hamas terrorist attack, in which 1,200 Jews were slaughtered. The Israeli military has responded with targeted strikes against Hamas strongholds in Gaza.\n\nOpen Society recently called for a \"humanitarian ceasefire\" in Gaza, asserting that Israel was engaged in an \"indiscriminate\" retaliatory response. \"There is a growing chorus of credible voices warning of violations of international humanitarian law; alleged war crimes, including forced displacement; and the risk of mass atrocities, including ethnic cleansing,\" Open Society said .\n\nThat echoes some of the sentiments of the left-wing groups engaged in Wednesday's violence.\n\n\"We refuse to standby as the Israeli government commits genocide against Palestinians in Gaza,\" Jewish Voice for Peace said at a protest it organized in the U.S. Capitol last month. \"Inevitably, oppressed people everywhere will seek-and gain-their freedom,\" the group said .\n\nOpen Society Foundations did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nPublished under: Anti-Semitism , Democratic Donors , Democratic Party , DNC , DSA , George Soros , Hamas , Israel , Open Society Foundations , Police , Protests , Riots , The Squad , U.S. Capitol , war\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "The Media Agree: Black Cops Beating Black Victim Is White Supremacy\n\nOn Friday, authorities released video footage of the killing of 29-year-old Tyre Nichols by five Memphis police officers. CNN's Van Jones authored an opinion article claiming that racism was the driving force in Nichols's death despite the victim and accused officers all being black men. Media pundits echoed that sentiment, pointing to \"systemic racism\" and calling it irrelevant \"whether the police officers are black.\"\n\nWhen violent riots erupted across the country in 2020 after the death of George Floyd, however, many of the same media pundits were quick to identify the race of the white officer who murdered Floyd as the most important detail of the case.\n\nPublished under: George Floyd , Media , Media Bias , Murder , Police , Racism , Tennessee , Van Jones , White Supremacy\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "State Dept Spox: 'Largest Threat to U.S. National Security are U.S. Cops'\n\nThe State Department's newly installed deputy spokesperson, Jalina Porter, said in a 2016 Facebook post that the \"largest threat to U.S. national security are U.S cops,\" according to a screenshot of the post obtained by the Washington Free Beacon .\n\n\"The largest threat to U.S. national security are U.S. cops,\" wrote Porter, who was recently tapped by the Biden administration to serve as State Department spokesman Ned Price's deputy. \"Not ISIS, not Russian hackers, not anyone or anything else.\"\n\nPorter's comments were made on Sept. 20, 2016, and appear to be in reference to video footage released that day of an unarmed black man being shot by police officers in Tulsa, Oklahoma. \"An unarmed Black man takes a knee for justice, bigots riot,\" she wrote in the post. \"An unarmed black man (with his hands raised) takes a bullet and dies, these same bigots are silent. Explain this to me, please.\"\n\nPorter, a former top aide in the congressional office of now-top Biden White House adviser Cedric Richmond, added, \"If y'all don't wake up and rise up to this truth, the genocide against Blacks in America will continue until we are near extinct.\" At the time of the post, Porter was working as a communications official for the Truman National Security Project, a left-leaning foreign policy think-tank that previously employed Hunter Biden . Porter is also a former dancer for the NFL's Oakland Raiders and the NBA's Washington Wizards.\n\nThe State Department did not respond to multiple Free Beacon requests for comment on the posting. Emails sent to Porter via her website and to an address provided on it were not returned by press time.\n\nThe resurfaced comments could complicate the State Department's messaging as it seeks to challenge Iran's nuclear buildup, continue the fight against ISIS, and shape its response to the many ongoing national security threats posed by China, Russia, and the Islamic Republic. Tony Blinken, the department's new secretary, was confirmed on Tuesday.\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"
