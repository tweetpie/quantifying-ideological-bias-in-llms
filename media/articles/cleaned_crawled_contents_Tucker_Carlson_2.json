      "text": "How both Tucker Carlson and JD Vance have 'chosen to play dumb for power': columnist\n\nDuring a recent event in Hershey, Pennsylvania, both Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) and far-right media personality Tucker Carlson conducted an interview that one columnist described as \"cordial.\" Though she elaborated that the relationship between the two is illuminating in how willing both men are to sacrifice their principles in their efforts to climb the career ladder.\n\nOn Tuesday, the Atlantic's Helen Lewis took a closer look at the Vance-Carlson event to illustrate how the political journey of both men means they've \"chosen to play dumb for power.\" She noted that for Carlson, he made a particularly sharp turn from Fox News primetime host to \"lone wolf\" social media personality.\n\nLewis wrote that Carlson's makeover as a right-wing renegade eschewing corporate media glosses over the fact he was not only fired from the network in 2023, but that emails released as part of the discovery process in the Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit found that he frequently expressed contempt for both former President Donald Trump and his most prominent supporters.\n\n\"Every news outlet I've ever worked at, which is a lot of them, they're all controlled, obviously,\" Carlson said in Hershey, before heaping praise on billionaire Elon Musk's social media platform where the word \"cisgender\" is banned . \"X is the place that free speech lives.\"\n\nHowever, Lewis argued that Vance's pivot from Never Trump conservative to an unabashedly MAGA U.S. senator is the most jarring. She pointed out that in 2017, the Hillbilly Elegy author said \"race definitely played a role in the 2016 election,\" and further argued that there are \"definitely some people who voted for Trump [who] are racist, and they voted for him for racist reasons.\" Now, the Ohio Republican says accusations of racism are being weaponized against Trump supporters to \"silence them and shut them up.\"\n\nShe also reminded readers that while Vance is the running mate for a former president who is running on mass deportations of millions of undocumented immigrants, he said in 2012 that the proposal to round up, detain and deport immigrants was a \"notion that fails to pass the laugh test.\"\n\nIn her column, Lewis remarked that the GOP as a whole had undergone a massive ideological makeover over the last two decades. She pointed out that both Carlson and Vance - the latter of whom is a U.S. Marine Corps veteran who served in Iraq - have expressed opposition to the U.S. engaging in foreign conflicts. Vance even called former President George W. Bush's invasion of Iraq a \"stupid war.\" This observed that this was a sharp one-eighty from the Republican Party of the early aughts.\n\n\"Anyone younger than Vance, who has just turned 40, might struggle to understand what an incredible statement this is from a would-be Republican vice president,\" she wrote. \"In the 2000s, the GOP clamor for war was so great that anyone who opposed it was painted as a pinko and probably a terrorist sympathizer.\"\n\nLewis added that while the Ohio senator \"seems to feel very little loyalty to the Republican Party as an institution, or to its long history and traditions,\" he has nonetheless risen to become \"MAGA's leading in-house intellectual.\" To that end, the columnist wryly observed that Vance's next campaign event was alongside far-right conspiracy theorists Jack Posobiec and Alex Jones."

      "text": "JD Vance still standing by Tucker Carlson despite his praise of Holocaust denier\n\nFormer Fox News host Tucker Carlson recently heaped praise on far-right Holocaust-denying historian Darryl Cooper, who appeared for a friendly interview on his podcast. And Sen. JD Vance (R-Ohio) is still standing by Carlson despite the controversy.\n\nThe Daily Beast reported that Vance - who sat down for a pre-taped interview with Carlson on Thursday after Cooper's interview aired - is still not condemning Carlson. He then attacked \"guilt-by-association cancel culture\" in a statement to Jewish Insider. The Beast's William Vaillancourt noted that Vance has been following Cooper on X (formerly Twitter) since at least Wednesday .\n\n\"[Vance] obviously does not share the views of the guest interviewed by Tucker Carlson,\" a spokesperson for the Ohio senator told the publication, adding: \"There are no stronger supporters of our allies in Israel or the Jewish community in America than Senator Vance and President Trump .\"\n\nCooper is known for his assertion that rather than Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler, the \"chief villain of the Second World War\" was actually British Prime Minister Winston Churchill. He referred to Jewish people interred in Nazi concentration camps simply as people who simply \"ended up dead.\" X owner Elon Musk initially promoted the interview between Cooper and Carlson in a tweet from his own account, but ultimately deleted it after backlash from both the left and the right.\n\nCarlson referred to Cooper \"the best and most honest popular historian in the United States.\" But Dani Dayan, who leads the Yad Vashem (the world Holocaust remembrance center), called him a \" repugnant Holocaust denier .\" Rep. Mike Lawler (R-New York), who represents a contested swing district, condemned the decision to give a \"known Holocaust revisionist\" like Cooper a large platform to spout his views.\n\n\"[D]uring my time in the [New York] State Assembly, I worked with Democrats and Republicans to help pass legislation aimed at ensuring all students in New York received proper education on the Holocaust - something Mr. Cooper clearly never had,\" Lawler said earlier this week.\n\nVance made it clear he disagrees with that sentiment, likening the criticism of platforming Cooper to censorship.\n\n\"[Republicans] believe in free speech and debate,\" Vance said when a reporter asked him about the controversy during a campaign stop. \"This whole idea that has taken hold in the far left of this country, that if you see a bad idea, the way to solve it is to censor it-I think it's ridiculous.\"\n\nThe Beast reported that Vance is scheduled to appear alongside Carlson - who got a warm reception at the Republican National Convention - at an upcoming campaign rally in Pennsylvania. A Trump campaign official remarked that the interview with Carlson was  \"not ideal timing,\" but added \"it is what it is.\""

      "text": "Did a demon attack Tucker Carlson or was it his ...\n\n- Don't despair! I've been saying for months that I believe this election is going to be a blowout for both Harris and Democrats generally, although the $6 billion or so and efforts in kind that rightwing billionaires, Israel , Putin, and Musk have thrown in on behalf of Trump and the GOP will make it a challenge. Particularly in the Senate. Yesterday's stats from Pennsylvania's early voting , however, are encouraging: Of the 1.62 million ballots returned, roughly 918,000 came from registered Democrats, 530,000 from registered Republicans, and 178,000 came from independents. Those numbers - realizing this is initial data and Republicans are more likely to show up on or closer to election day - are pretty impressive! And they don't begin to measure the Republican-registered women who are crossing over to vote for Harris and other Democrats. After surveys showed that many women didn't realize their vote is secret and can never be revealed to their husbands, the Harris campaign has released an ad pointing just that out; it's infuriating Republican men and the male commentators at Fox \"News,\" including Jesse Watters who says that if his current wife did this it would be \"disloyal,\" (like when she and he had an affair while he was married to his first wife). None of this positive news should cause any of us to take a breath and slow down: we need to get every voter out there to the polls and keep up the pressure. But I continue to be very optimistic that I won't be entering one of Trump's concentration camps this next year...\n\n- Last year Trump wanted General Milley put in front of a firing squad; now he's saying that should happen to Liz Cheney. Do you still think he's joking? At an event moderated by frozen fish heir Tucker Swanson Carlson, Trump said of former Congresswoman Liz Cheney: \"Let's put her with a rifle standing there with 9 barrels shooting at her. Let's see how she feels about it. You know, when the guns are trained on her face.\" This is an explicit death threat, a violation of federal law 18 U.S. Code § 373 : Solicitation to commit a crime of violence. Where's Merrick Garland when you need him? Hiding in the White House bunker?\n\n- Crazy alert! Tucker says a demon attacked him while he was in bed with his wife and four dogs. While skeptical Republicans are trying to blame one of the dogs in the bed for the bloody claw marks Tuckums is telling us all about, I'm far more inclined to believe it was his wife, who's probably voting for Kamala and knows her vote is secret...\n\n- Europe's Greens ask professional grifter Jill Stein to pull out of US election to prevent a Trump victory. Noting that the American Green Party is not affiliated with the rest of the world's Greens (but instead has become a giant scam), the Green Parties of Germany, France, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, Ireland, Estonia, Belgium, Spain, Poland and Ukraine issued a joint statement saying: \"We are clear that Kamala Harris is the only candidate who can block Donald Trump and his anti-democratic, authoritarian policies from the White House. Right now, the race for the White House is too close for comfort. We call on Jill Stein to withdraw from the race, and endorse Kamala Harris for the presidency of the United States.\" Stein, of course, will do no such thing, even though she's polling around 1 to 1.4 percent across all the battleground states. Instead, she's happy to continue benefiting from rightwing billionaire money promoting her candidacy in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Arizona. America really needs to get rid of the damn Electoral College and bring in instant runoff voting so a real Green Party can emerge here.\n\n- Texas Republicans Ted Cruz, Ken Paxton, and Greg Abbott just put another notch in their manly-man belts: An 18-year-old Texas woman died after being turned away from two hospitals for her miscarriage complications. This is the second Texas woman we know these men (and the six rightwing Catholics on the Supreme Court) murdered. As ProPublica wrote : \"Nevaeh Crain was crying in pain, too weak to walk, blood staining her thighs. Feverish and vomiting the day of her baby shower, the 18-year-old had gone to two different emergency rooms within 12 hours, returning home each time worse than before. The first hospital diagnosed her with strep throat without investigating her sharp abdominal cramps. At the second, she screened positive for sepsis, a life-threatening and fast-moving reaction to an infection, medical records show. But doctors said her six-month fetus had a heartbeat and that Crain was fine to leave. Now on Crain's third hospital visit, an obstetrician insisted on two ultrasounds to 'confirm fetal demise,' a nurse wrote, before moving her to intensive care. By then, more than two hours after her arrival, Crain's blood pressure had plummeted and a nurse had noted that her lips were 'blue and dusky.' Her organs began failing. Hours later, she was dead.\" Cruz, Paxton, and Abbott appear quite proud of themselves; this is the second dead Texas woman we know about, not to mention the 30,000-plus rape victims they've forced to carry their rapists' babies to term and the thousands of women who'll be scarred for life by their high-risk pregnancies. Meanwhile, in South Carolina Republicans are cheering the 22-day imprisonment of Amari Marsh, 23, a Black woman who miscarried before she even realized she was pregnant. Police arrested her and charged her with homicide, claiming that she didn't do enough to prevent her miscarriage - which, again, happened before she even realized she was pregnant. When she got out of jail after more than three weeks, Marsh said , \"When I was initially arrested, I thought it was a joke. I genuinely thought it was a joke because I had never been in trouble in my life. As I was sitting there, I couldn't do nothing but cry.\" John Roberts, Sam Alito, Clarence Thomas, Amy Coney Barrett, Brett Kavanaugh, Neil Gorsuch, and Donald Trump are all so very, very proud of themselves. Just ask them.\n\n- WTF? Our National Archives are removing displays and information about MLK, Native Americans, the Holocaust, the Civil Rights movement, unions, birth control, and the American internment of Japanese during WWII because it may upset Republican legislators. When US Archivist Colleen Shogan was grilled by the Senate during her confirmation, neofascist Josh Hawley called her a Democratic \"extremist\" and warned her that he and other Republicans \"would be watching closely for signs that she was pulling the independent agency to the left.\" Looks like this effort to \"work the refs\" is succeeding . Most recently, a photo of Martin Luther King Jr. was replaced by a picture of Richard Nixon meeting Elvis Presley, pictures of the camps where we interred Japanese-ancestry US citizens were taken down, references to the coal industry causing environmental hazards were removed, and Shogan \"also ordered the removal of labor-union pioneer Dolores Huerta and Minnie Spotted-Wolf, the first Native American woman to join the Marine Corps, from the photo booth, according to current and former employees and agency documents.\" They even removed a picture of Republican President Jerry Ford's wife Betty because she was wearing an Equal Rights Amendment button, and in the display of \"patents that changed the world\" the birth control pill was replaced with the bump stock that turns semi-automatic weapons into functionally fully-automatic machine guns. This \"obeying fascists in advance\" is beyond the pale, and hopefully now that it's getting some publicity Shogan will reconsider bowing to the GOP's white supremacist base.\n\n- Georgia official warns of Russian interference in this year's election. Over on Elon Musk's cesspool Xitter, a Russian-produced phony video purports to show Black Haitian immigrants showing off multiple fake IDs and claiming they voted in multiple Georgia counties on multiple occasions. It's gone completely viral among rightwingers with a apparent big push from Xitter's secret algorithm. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger (pronounced \"Raff-ens-purger,\" and he's purged over a million voters from Georgia's rolls so far) called a press conference to say : \"Earlier today, our office became aware of a video purporting to show a Haitian immigrant with multiple Georgia ID's claiming to have voted multiple times. This is false, and is an example of targeted disinformation we've seen this election. It is likely foreign interference attempting to sow discord and chaos on the eve of the election.\" The feds have since confirmed it is from Russia. Meanwhile, Rudy Giuliani is saying the quiet part out loud , echoing the sentiments of the racists who make up the base of the GOP. Speaking of the Black Haitian immigrants working legally in Springfield, Ohio, the former senior Trump aide said: \"It's not their fault. They live back 200 years ago. They just shouldn't have been taken out of the jungle and placed in the middle of small town America. That's ridiculous. Or big town America, for that matter.\" Meanwhile, Rudy's refusing to cooperate with efforts to transfer his assets to the two Black Georgia poll workers he defamed, even though he's been ordered to do so by a court. This isn't going to end well for New York's former mayor.\n\nNOW READ: A stupefying poll shows Harris breathing down Trump's neck in Kansas. Here's what that means."

      "text": "'Quickly falling apart': Conservatives are turning against 'click-chaser' Tucker Carlson\n\nTucker Carlson was once the most-watched primetime host on the most conservative cable news network. But after a recent interview he conducted on his new X/Twitter show, more conservatives are abandoning him.\n\nThe Daily Beast reported that following Carlson's interview with the Rev. Munther Isaac, pro-Israel conservatives have lost patience with the far-right pundit. Like his interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin, Carlson gave a soft, lengthy interview to Isaac - an Lutheran pastor in Bethlehem, which is in the Israeli-occupied West Bank - and lent him a platform to repeatedly attack the Netanyahu regime in Israel while Carlson agreed with him.\n\n\"It would be pretty easy for Republicans in the US Congress to say we support the government of Israel. But if you touch a single Christian, harm a single church, prevent any Christian from practicing his religion, you're done. Not a single dollar will come from the US Congress for you,\" Carlson said. \"If you wake up in the morning and decide that your Christian faith requires you to support a foreign government, blowing up churches and killing Christians. I think you've lost the thread.\"\n\nCarlson's remarks angered prominent conservative Christians who back Israel, including Rep. Dan Crenshaw (R-Texas), who declared: \"This is who Tucker is: a click-chaser.\"\n\n\"Tucker's MO is simple: defend America's enemies and attack America's allies. There isn't an objective bone left in that washed up news host's body,\" he tweeted. \"Tucker will eventually fade into nothingness, because his veneer of faux intellectualism is quickly falling apart and revealing who he truly is: a cowardly, know-nothing elitist who is full of s-.\"\n\nX influencer AG Hamilton - a pseudonym for an attorney who writes for the conservative National Review - had similar thoughts in a lengthy post to the platform. He suggested that Carlson's concern about Christians under attack was hollow given that he didn't \"have a word to say\" about the oppression of Christians in other countries. He added that Tucker's \"whole shtick\" was feeding his audience a pre-conceived narrative and presenting it as an objective interview.\n\n\"He presents a question then suggests an implied answer using dishonest or partial facts, then insists he's selling his audience a truth instead of feeding them obvious BS,\" Hamilton tweeted.\n\nCarlson's decision to interview Munther Isaac also attracted criticism from one of his former Fox News colleagues. After Hamas' October 7 terror attack that killed approximately 1,200 Israelis and resulted in hundreds of hostages being taken, Isaac suggested that the Natanyahu regime owned responsibility for the attack, attributing it to the Nakba (the Arabic word for the establishment of the Israeli state and displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians). NewsNation host Leland Vittert - a former Fox host - slammed Carlson's interview as irresponsible journalism.\n\n\"Joseph Goebbels, the Nazi propaganda chief, would be proud,\" Vittert said after showing Carlson's remarks. \"Again, Tucker's a smart guy, yet he's taking the side of terrorists. There's no other explanation than his unabashed hatred of Jews.\"\n\nRead the Beast's report in full by clicking here (subscription required)."

      "text": "New analysis offers prediction of Fox News' future without Tucker Carlson\n\nWith Tucker Carlson out of the door at Fox News, there are now questions about the network's future given his large following.\n\nIn a new analysis, Yahoo! News' Mike Bebernes is highlighting political experts' opinions of what's to come for the right-leaning news network. He began with an overview of all that has transpired this week.\n\n\"News reports suggest [Carlson]  may have been let go for fostering a toxic work environment, vulgar criticisms of Fox management, the way he talked about religion, or yet-to-be-seen allegations included in a discrimination lawsuit filed by a former producer on his show,\" Bebernes wrote.\n\nHe added, \"In a video posted to Twitter on Wednesday, Carlson lamented the 'inherently ridiculous' nature of today's political debate, but did not discuss his departure from Fox.\"\n\nNoting Carlson's influence on the network, Bebernes wrote:\n\nCarlson's massive ratings and ability to both follow and shape the GOP's ideological direction made him one of the most influential conservatives in the country, as well as the target of intense criticism. The New York Times described him as promoting an \"apocalyptic worldview\" centered around '\"white panic\" and \"catastrophic views of immigration and the country's shifting demographics.\"\n\nHe was also viewed, by both critics and far-right supporters , as serving as a kind of pipeline for extremist conspiracies - like the \" great replacement \" theory that white Americans are being systematically replaced by people of color for political purposes - to move from fringe online forums into the mainstream political discourse.\n\nGiven the impact of Carlson's influence on Fox News' viewership, Bebernes laid out a theory about the possibilities that could lie ahead as the network embarks on a new path without the popular conservative news host. A number of political experts weighed in with their take.\n\nAccording to The New Republic's Michael Tomasky, things will likely \"get worse\" for the network. He also explained why.\n\n\"Fox will get worse because Fox is the unchained id of the American right, and there exists no superego (the self-critical conscience) on the right to check it,\" Tomasky said. \"This is very important for non-righties to understand. ... Fox doesn't have to care about mainstream credibility. It despises mainstream credibility. All it has to care about is its viewers, and to its viewers, mainstream credibility is right up there on the desirability meter with syphilis.\"\n\nAlthough viewers will likely miss Carlson's presence, CNN's David Zurawik explained why the network may be more interested in replacing him with a less dominant voice.\n\n\"Given the price tag of getting out of the Dominion lawsuit and the defamation actions pending, it is hard to imagine Fox going for someone even more transgressive than Carlson in his time slot,\" Zurawik said. \"Here's hoping Carlson's departure will come to mark a pivot point toward less divisive, outrageous and polarizing primetime programming on Fox in this coming election year.\""

      "text": "Fox News' ratings plummet after firing Tucker Carlson\n\nIt remains to be seen where Tucker Carlson will resurface now that Fox News has fired its biggest star. According to The Lincoln Project's Rick Wilson - a Never Trump conservative and former GOP strategist - it is entirely possible that Carlson will run for president in 2024, or perhaps be seriously considered as Donald Trump's running mate if Trump is the nominee.\n\nThere has been much speculation among pundits that Carlson could end up at Newsmax TV or One America News (OAN) if either of those right-wing Fox News competitors can afford him. According to National Public Radio (NPR), Fox News' ratings have taken a nosedive since Carlson's departure.\n\nDuring an April 28 broadcast , NPR reporter David Folkenflik explained, \"You've seen ratings (at Fox News) basically fall off a cliff this week for those who have been substituting for (Carlson).... It's down almost 50 percent in the days since his departure. And you've seen the rise concomitantly of this much smaller right-wing rival Newsmax. They are playing up the idea that Fox has fired Tucker Carlson because it's gone lib, it's gone woke, it's gone Democrat.\"\n\nFolkenflik added , \"You've seen former Fox host Eric Bolling on Newsmax, and seen his ratings go up almost fivefold. All of this is, in a way, weirdly ironic because that dynamic is what led to the panic at Fox News after the 2020 elections that led to Fox being sued for defamation.\"\n\nOn April 27, the New York Times' Michael M. Grynbaum reported that Newsmax was quick to play up Carlson's firing.\n\nAccording to Grynbaum , \"Newsmax, the niche conservative news channel that has long played David to Fox News' Goliath, has seized on Tucker Carlson's shock dismissal from its rival network and declared itself the true TV home for right-wing Americans. So far, the strategy is showing some promise.\"\n\nGrynbaum adds , \"Viewership of Newsmax remains far below that of Fox News. But its audience at certain hours has doubled, and in some time slots tripled, in the immediate aftermath of Mr. Carlson's exit - an abrupt spike that has turned heads in conservative circles and the cable news industry.\"\n\nThe New York Times reporter notes that Bolling's show on Newsmax, according to Neilsen, had 562,000 viewers on April 25 compared to 146,000 the previous week.\n\n\"Newsmax's other prime-time shows also experienced big jumps,\" Grynbaum observes . \"The sharp rise in viewership can be timed almost to the minute of Fox News' announcement on Monday, (April 24) that it was parting ways with Mr. Carlson, in part because of private messages sent by the anchor that included offensive and crude remarks.\"\n\nListen to NPR's report at this link ; read the New York Times' report at this link (subscription required)."

But his decision to host a self-proclaimed podcast historian, Darryl Cooper - who has praised Adolf Hitler and believes Winston Churchill was the 'chief villain' of World War II - has drawn unusually fierce criticism from top [Republican Party] members.\"\n\nKassel adds , \"In the interview, Cooper diminished the Holocaust by claiming that 'millions of prisoners of war' had 'ended up dead' in concentration camps, suggesting the Nazis did not have genocidal aims against Jews but were simply 'unprepared' for the war, among other false assertions.\"\n\nSome of the criticism has come from Dani Dayan, who heads Yad Vashem and slammed the interview as \"repugnant Holocaust denial.\"\n\nBecause Carlson is such a prominent figure in right-wing media, Kassel notes , many Republicans serving in Congress \"have been reluctant to publicly criticize\" him.\n\nBut Rep. Mike Lawler (R-New York) told Jewish Insider , \"Platforming known Holocaust revisionists is deeply disturbing - during my time in the State Assembly, I worked with Democrats and Republicans to help pass legislation aimed at ensuring all students in New York received proper education on the Holocaust - something Mr. Cooper clearly never had.\"\n\nGOP fundraiser Eric Levine described Carlson as a \"very troubling person\" whose views are not helpful to 2024 GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump .\n\nLevine told Jewish Insider , \"I continue to believe that Donald Trump is best served by appealing to the center of the party.

He rode the subway and marveled at its clean cars, the fancy tilework in Kievskaya Station, and the lack of booze-drenched hobos. He went to a grocery store and was astonished by what ordinary people could apparently buy. He even managed to meet a local history buff and sit down for tea and conversation. Carlson, who had never previously visited Moscow, declared himself \"radicalized\" against America's leaders by the experience. He didn't want to live in Moscow, but he did want to know why we in America have to put up with street crime and crappy food when the supposedly bankrupt Russia provided such a nice life for its people, or at least those people not named Alexei Navalny .\n\nMy former Atlantic colleague Ralph Waldo Emerson called travel a \"fool's paradise,\" but not all forms of foolishness are equal. Many commentators have guffawed at Carlson's Russophilia and pointed out that Russia's murder rate is roughly that of the United States, and that its citizens are dirt poor, about a fifth as wealthy per capita as the citizens of the United States overall. \"I don't care what some flagship supermarket in an imperial city looks like,\" The Dispatch 's Jonah Goldberg tweeted. \"Russia is far, far poorer than our poorest state, Mississippi.\" Bloomberg 's Joe Weisenthal suggested that Carlson instead visit the grocery stores of the \"10th or 50th\" richest Russian cities, and see how they compare with America's.\n\nIn 2019, I visited several large and small Russian cities, and I went grocery shopping at least once in each. Would you believe that Tucker Carlson is on to something? In Moscow (the largest) and St. Petersburg (No. 2), the flagship supermarkets are indeed spectacular. The Azbuka Vkusa branch next to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Moscow is more luxurious than any grocery store within 100 miles of Washington, D.C. Other branches in Moscow vary in quality, and they are usually smaller than American supermarkets. But to some extent that's just a matter of culture: The U.S. has fewer supermarkets, but each one is big enough to feed the 82nd Airborne Division for a month; in Europe, supermarkets are more numerous but tiny.\n\nAnne Applebaum: The false romance of Russia\n\nMakhachkala (22), the capital of Dagestan, followed a similar pattern to Moscow. One supermarket downtown was amazing, the equal of an upscale supermarket in Washington or Dallas. On the outskirts the quality varied, but not drastically. Local residents were not eating soups made from grass clippings. In Murmansk (71), the cramped bodega near my rented flat had a good wine selection and enough fresh staple foods to prepare a different meal your mom would approve of every day of the week. Only in Derbent (134) did I start to wonder whether the bad old days of the Soviet Union were still in effect. But even that would be an exaggeration. In Derbent, for $15, you could get champagne and caviar with blini and velvety sour cream. If you want to flash back to Cold War communism, go to Havana. There the grocery stores stock only dust and mildew.\n\nWith apologies to Emerson, travel can disabuse you of foolish notions just as often as it plants them in your head. An idea ripe for dispelling among Americans at this particular moment is that life in Russia must suck because the frigid depression of the Cold War never ended. In those days ordinary citizens were spied upon and tortured and killed, and the shops were empty, save for substandard goods at prices few could afford. Now Russia is different. The state repression is much more limited, though no less brutal toward those who attract its attention. Until the Ukraine war added a huge category of forbidden topics, the main ones that you could get locked up for discussing were war in the Caucasus and the personal life and finances of President Vladimir Putin and his inner circle. Most other topics were broachable, and you could whine all you liked about them.\n\nEqually in need of updating are American expectations about Russian economic misery. Those whose visits to Russia stopped 20 years ago tend to have outdated views of the best the country has to offer. My visits started 24 years ago. Back then, I spent days at a time on the Trans-Siberian, crammed into railway cabins with little to do but talk with Russians and see how they lived. Life was not beautiful. The men busied themselves with crosswords and sullenly browsed pornography. When not in motion, I stayed with Russian friends in single-room flats that looked straight out of a New York tenement building 100 years ago. No one I met was starving, but women sometimes approached me in train stations hoping to rent out their homes or bodies, or to sell me family heirlooms. That type of desperation seems to have subsided, although I would be shocked if any of those people are able to buy the jamón ibérico at the Smolenskaya branch of Azbuka Vkusa yet. On the roads between the big cities, there are still villages so ramshackle that they look like sets from The Little Rascals . Evidence suggests that the Russian military's frontline troops tend to come from these depressed and benighted lands, the places that really are stuck in the 20th century.\n\nCertain aspects of life remain dismal even in the cities. My flat in Murmansk had surly drunks tottering outside its entrance, and its stairwell smelled like every cat, dog, and human resident had marked its territory there regularly since the Brezhnev era. But the playgrounds were decent, and you could get a delicious smoked-reindeer pizza at a cozy restaurant for $7. Remember, this is in a small, depressed Russian city-not somewhere stocked with goodies just in case an American wanders out of the lobby of the Radisson and needs to be impressed. The \"useful idiots\" of yesteryear were treated to fake Moscows, which evanesced as soon as the next Aeroflot flights took off. The luxuries of Moscow that Carlson sees, and that I saw, are not evanescent, and they are not (as they are in North Korea, say) a curated experience available only to those on controlled visits.\n\nThe stubborn belief that all good things in Russia must be illusory can in turn warp one's analysis of the country, and in particular of Putin's durability in power. After all, why would anyone remain loyal to an autocrat who delivered only hunger, penury, and the reek of cat piss? Putin rules by fear but not only by fear. Most Russians will tell you that Russia today is better than it was before Putin. They compare it not with the Soviet era but with the anarchy and decline of the 1990s. Life expectancy has risen, public parks are better maintained, and certain fruits of capitalism can be tasted by Russians of all classes. Who would risk these gains? Like every autocrat, Putin has ensured that his downfall just might destroy every good thing Russia has experienced in the past two decades. This risk is, from the perspective of regime continuity, a positive feature, because it keeps all but the most principled and brave opposition quiet, and content to shut up and enjoy their cheap caviar. Those like Navalny who object do not object for long.\n\nCarlson's videos never quite say what precisely he thinks Russia gets right. Moscow is in many ways superior to New York. But Paris has a good subway system too. Japan and Thailand have fine grocery stores, and I wonder, when I enter them, why entering my neighborhood Stop & Shop in America is such a depressing experience by comparison. Carlson's stated preference for Putin's leadership over Joe Biden's suggests that the affection is not for fine food or working public transit but for firm autocratic rule-which, as French, Thais, and Japanese will attest, is not a precondition for high-quality goods and services. And in an authoritarian state, those goods and services can serve to prolong the regime.\n\nI confess I still enjoy watching Carlson post videos of Moscow, wide-eyed and credulous as he slowly learns to love a country that I love too. I hope he posts more of them. One goes through stages of love for Russia, often starting with the literature and music, then moving to its dark humor and the personalities of its people, which are always cycling between thaw and frost. Inevitably one reflects on the irony that this civilization, whose achievement is almost without equal in some respects, is utterly cursed in others-consigned to literally centuries of misgovernment, incompetence, and tyranny. The final stage is realizing that the greatness of Russia is part of the curse, a heightening of the irony, as if no matter how much goes right, something is deeply wrong. Maybe when things go right, the more deeply wrong it is. Carlson seems to still be in one of the early stages of this journey."

      "text": "The American Face of Authoritarian Propaganda\n\nFor Viktor Orbán and Vladimir Putin, Tucker Carlson fulfills a need.\n\n\"Axis Sally\" was the generic name for women with husky voices and good English who read German and Italian propaganda on the radio during World War II. Like the Japanese women who became collectively known as \"Tokyo Rose,\" they were trying to reach American soldiers, hoping to demoralize them by telling them their casualties were high, their commanders were bad, and their cause was lost. \"A lousy night it sure is,\" Axis Sally said on one 1944 broadcast : \"You poor, silly, dumb lambs, well on your way to be slaughtered.\"\n\nTucker Carlson, who also repeats the propaganda of foreign dictators while speaking English, doesn't have anything like the historical significance of Axis Sally or Tokyo Rose, though his level of credibility is similar. This is a man who famously wrote texts about his loathing of Donald Trump, even while praising the then-president in public; recently, the former Fox News host kept a straight face while interviewing a convicted fraudster who claimed to have smoked crack and had sex with Barack Obama. But when Carlson speaks on behalf of Viktor Orbán or Vladimir Putin, his words are repeated in Hungary and Russia, where they do have resonance: Look, a prominent American journalist supports us . I don't know what Carlson's motivation is-he did not respond to a request for comment-but his words also circulate in the far-right American echo chamber, where they are sometimes repeated by Republican presidential candidates, so unfortunately they require some explanation.\n\nRead: Tucker Carlson's manufactured America\n\nCarlson's hatred of American institutions, and of many Americans, is the starting point for many of his diatribes. Recently, for instance, he appeared at an event in Budapest, organized by a Hungarian-government-funded organization, where he called the U.S. ambassador to that nation a \"creep,\" said he was \"embarrassed that I share a country of birth with a villain like this,\" and apologized for American foreign policy in Hungary.\n\nBut what is American foreign policy in Hungary? I asked the ambassador, David Pressman, to describe it to me. Pressman, who is gay, told me that when he first arrived in Budapest, his counterparts smirked at him during their meetings and asked if he wanted to talk about gay rights or other progressive causes. No, he told them. He wanted to talk about Russian and Chinese espionage and influence operations in Hungary, which are considerable.\n\nSome examples: The most important Russian investment in Hungary is a nuclear-power plant whose financing is kept secret by law, presumably because the ruling party doesn't want to reveal who is benefiting. Chinese interests are also financing a distinctly untransparent railway project in Hungary, have made an opaque investment in an environmentally unfriendly battery-manufacturing plant, and, a couple of years ago, with the help of the Hungarian government, tried to open a university in Budapest too. In 2019, Hungarian government officials also arranged for the Russian-controlled International Investment Bank, an institution set up in 1970 by the Soviet Union and its satellite states, to move its headquarters to Budapest, even throwing in a 10-million-euro subsidy as encouragement. The Hungarian government, which rejoined the bank in 2015 (having left it after the collapse of the U.S.S.R.), owned about a quarter of the shares of the IIB; the Hungarian deal with the \"Russian spy bank,\" as it is known in Budapest (it was once described by a group of U.S. senators as \"an arm of the Russian secret service\"), also freed the bank from Hungarian financial supervision, exempted it from taxes, and allowed bank employees to have diplomatic status and immunity in Hungary, an arrangement that could in theory help Russian spies enter the country and from there the rest of the European Union.\n\nThe bank was dodgy enough to raise American concerns even during the Trump administration, which was otherwise more indulgent of Hungary's autocratic ruling party. After Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine last year, the Biden administration told the Hungarians, who remain NATO allies, that the bank was a major problem for the alliance. Orbán resisted this pressure until April of this year, when Pressman announced sanctions against the bank and three of its executives, two Russians and one Hungarian. \"We are concerned about Hungarian leaders seeking ever-closer ties with Russia, despite its brutal aggression,\" he told Hungarian journalists. A few days later, Orbán caved, and withdrew Hungary's investment. The bank announced that it would leave Budapest.\n\nThis was unsurprising. Although Orbán likes to portray himself as a leader who cannot be influenced, a man tough and immovable, in fact he often gives in at the last minute-he is famous in the European Union for doing so. But he needs to tell a different story to his voters about what happened. The invitation to the disgraced former Fox News pundit does that: While in Budapest, Carlson channeled Orbán's anger and dislike of the United States and its ambassador, while studiously avoiding the real reasons for what is indeed an extremely poor moment for American-Hungarian relations.\n\nDuring his comments, and during his interview with Orbán, both broadcast on his social media, Carlson stayed well away from banks and Russian spies. He didn't mention Hungary's refusal to ratify Sweden's NATO membership , or Hungary's repeated vetoes of European sanctions against Russia . Instead, he denounced the United States for \"the imposition of boutique sexual politics\" on Hungary. Officials in the Biden administration, Carlson claimed, \"hate Hungary not because of what it's done but because of what it is. It's a Christian country, and they hate that.\" He made what sounded like several references to trans-rights activism, praised the Hungarians for their resistance to the degenerate West, and won applause.\n\nThis rant was based on a false premise, for there is no U.S. war on Christianity in Hungary. If American officials are angry at Hungary, that's not because of what it is, but because of what it's done. Once again: The conflict between Washington and Budapest over the past several years is about Hungarian corruption, especially corruption in the ruling Fidesz party, and Hungary's deep ties to other autocracies. (These are, of course, related issues : A major purpose of the deep ties with autocracies is for Fidesz to make money off them .) But Orbán doesn't want his voters to pay attention to his corrupt links or his autocratic friendships, and he doesn't want Americans or Europeans to know about them either. And so he hides them behind the veil of a culture war. Carlson is useful to Orbán because his words can help hide Orbán's agenda at home- look, a prominent American journalist supports us -and abroad. By pretending that this is a culture war rather than a conflict over money and espionage, Carlson helps Orbán escape the consequences of his actions.\n\nOrbán is hardly the first autocrat to use propaganda this way. Vladimir Putin has been directing his citizens away from reality and toward imaginary culture wars for more than a decade. In September 2022, when the Russian president held a ceremony to mark his illegal annexation of southern and eastern Ukraine, he did not speak of the people he is torturing or holding in concentration camps, the children he has kidnapped and deported to Russia, or even the tens of thousands of Russian soldiers who have died in his unnecessary war. Instead, he used the occasion to talk about the \"satanic\" West, claim he was defending Russia from \"perversions that lead to degradation and extinction,\" and again replace the real war, in which real people are killing and being killed, with a fictional culture war that exists in his head.\n\nCarlson frequently uses Russian propaganda lines too, promoting fake stories ( Ukrainian \"bio-labs\" ), repeating Russian justifications for the war , and calling the Ukrainian president a \"dictator.\" He began doing this when he was still at Fox News, and now he does it in the videos he promotes on social media. Clips of these performances are frequently shown on Russian television, both when he attacks the U.S. and when he amplifies Russian propaganda about Ukraine or about the war. But many of these stories are nevertheless told as part of a larger one: the fake battle between a weak, degenerate America and healthy autocracies with \"traditional values.\"\n\nNone of this might matter very much, except that, again, a large part of the American far right has learned this rhetorical trick from Putin, from Orbán, from Carlson, and from other propagandists. Ignoring the real world in order to fight the culture war is now common practice. Although Trump was wholly ignorant of economics and foreign policy, his supporters didn't care, because he got them excited about owning the libs. Ron DeSantis still seems to believe that a \"war on woke\" is more likely than a comprehensive health-care plan to help him get elected president, and he might be right. A wide range of senators who should know better-including Ted Cruz, J. D. Vance, and Josh Hawley, who used to talk a lot about real issues-have now abandoned policy debates in order to fight the culture wars and attack \"elites,\" despite their own Ivy League pedigrees.\n\nRead: What does Tucker Carlson believe?\n\nYou can see why. The real world is full of difficult, hard-to-explain problems; even the best solutions might require difficult trade-offs. Once, Americans did have at least a few politicians who nevertheless sought to find these solutions, and our political system seemed to allow us to have arguments about them. Authoritarians, by contrast, seek power in order to hide the problems, steal money, arrange favors for their friends, and manipulate the political system so that they can't ever lose power. That's what Putin did, and that's what Orbán does too. Carlson is simply the American face, and the English-speaking voice, of that confidence trick."

      "text": "Why Tucker Carlson Thinks Australia Is Being 'Taken Away'\n\nIn Melbourne, the commentator warned native Australians that immigrants would dispossess them.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nUpdated at 4:50 p.m. ET on July 9, 2024.\n\nO n Monday , Tucker Carlson wrapped up the seventh in a series of speeches to right-wing Australian audiences. To attend the event, I had to walk under a bright-pink sign acknowledging that the \"traditional owners\" of the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre are an Aboriginal people, the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung. Judging by the speech I heard, this sign was not put up at Carlson's request. \"Anyone who tells you this is not your country plans to take it away from you ,\" Carlson said, to approving Aussie yawps (\"Yeah! Tuck-ah! \"). He loved Australia, he said, and proved it by delivering a heartfelt description of how he had recently held a koala and inhaled its musk. Australians' biggest fault, he told them, was that \"you're too happy; you don't pause to think how bad it could get.\" Someone was plotting to take all of this away. \"The only way you could wreck a country like this is on purpose.\"\n\nThe whole evening was haunted by a question: Who, exactly, is wrecking Australia on purpose and planning to \"take it away\"? Probably not the Wurundjeri Wol Wurrung. The very fact that Carlson, an American, was there suggested that whoever it was had done some wrecking in America too. Carlson said, in a couple of carefully worded asides, that he was an emissary from the future, to warn native Australians of the coming dispossession. \"I'm here from a country that's further down the road,\" he said, in his role as Ghost of Nativism Future. \"It doesn't end well.\"\n\nGraeme Wood: What Tucker Carlson saw in Moscow\n\nCarlson was fired by Fox News last year but has not faded from public life, as many assumed he would. After his decades as a fixture of conservative media on CNN, PBS, and even MSNBC, Fox allegedly found his tendencies corrosive to its brand, as well as a possible legal liability. He has subsequently started his own show on X and scored an interview with Vladimir Putin -a journalistic coup that many Putin haters considered a wasted opportunity to give the Russian president a KGB-style interrogation, but that was, to me, a riveting and revelatory interview anyway. Almost any hours-long conversation with the tormentor of Ukraine and NATO would be. As Carlson speaks freely, it has become clear that his true views are even more Trumpian than they previously appeared, and that if any commentator reflects the Republican presidential nominee's view of the world-nationalist, antiglobalism, anti-immigration, opposed to wars even (or especially) in defense of America's allies-it is Carlson. So when he speaks, even (or especially?) to an obscure audience in Australia, what he says has relevance to the future of American politics as well.\n\nThe crowd seemed pretty sure of the identity of the soon-to-be-dispossessed. It was them. Their bleats of approval and occasional outbursts conveyed a vivid sense that their government had rewarded their past patriotism by encroaching on their freedoms and looting their patrimony. Most of all, they despised the politicians who had denied them jobs and roles in public after they refused COVID-19 vaccines. A mention of Professor John Skerritt, the Australian version of Anthony Fauci, aroused the crowd to hooting rage.\n\nTheir savior in this crusade against immunity was the evening's host, Clive Palmer, the mining billionaire and minor politician who arranged Carlson's tour. His introductory speech began with an audio malfunction, possibly due to placement of the clip-on mic too low, toward the southern hemisphere of his belly, far from his mouth. Once he got going, the speech was quite fun. He declared that he remained unvaccinated and told the story of how he'd caught COVID, nearly died, and threatened to beat doctors with a metal chair when they tried to save his life with the antiviral drug remdesivir. He ended his speech as only a billionaire can, with a baffling and irrelevant monologue that aides to a less powerful man would surely have prevailed on him to skip, in which he presented an illustrated plan to build a full-scale replica of the Titanic.\n\nFar more mortifying was the warm-up act from the American conservative commentator Dinesh D'Souza, who was piped in digitally to introduce 2000 Mules , his documentary film about alleged voter fraud in the 2020 election. It used crackpot statistical methods to show that several thousand people had been visiting ballot boxes in patterns unlikely to be random, and therefore surely the work of a paid Democratic conspiracy. The film is so batshit crazy that even its distributor dropped it and apologized for its errors. The audience seemed no more than polite during the screening. This lukewarm reaction came to me as a relief, because the people I spoke with seemed nice and reasonably intelligent, and to believe the conspiracy alleged in the documentary, one would have to have a brain the size of a peach pit. This stuff makes Michael Moore sound like Mycroft Holmes.\n\nAnd it made Tucker Carlson sound like a prodigy-which I suppose might have been the point of the juxtaposition. The night's Aussie emcee introduced him as \"Tuck-ah-a truth seek-ah and a truth speak-ah !\" When D'Souza doesn't come across as an imbecile, he resembles a reptilian sociopath, willing to utter any lie necessary to advance his claims. Carlson, to the relief of everyone around me, sounded like a precocious and excited child, pleased to come Down Under for the first time, to ogle and sniff the local fauna and learn to say wanker and other exotic slang. To a crowd of nationalists, few things are more titillating than the admiration of one's country by a foreign dignitary. This Tucker is Tucker the ingenue, the character who marveled at the greatness of Russian grocery stores. I do not think the marveling is scripted or a pose. It is an expression of an open-minded and charming man who knows that to persuade people to join your side, it helps to be funny and generous. Maybe he took a Dale Carnegie course. Whatever it is, it worked on this audience, which decided within the first minute that their $100 tickets were worth it.\n\nHis message began with an endorsement of Australian pride, or shamelessness. Britain, he said, had much to answer for in her management of the empire. But not Australia. \"What exactly were your sins?\" he asked. \"You have nothing to apologize for.\" (I would have liked to hear from any Wurundjeri Wol Wurrung on this point.) Australia's settlers had built beautiful and majestic cities, he said; his listeners deserved to feel pride in the fact that they lived in paradise and not in the slums of Birmingham or Manchester. Perth and Melbourne were \"like San Francisco, but without the drug addicts.\" Australians had learned to live in peace with weird and poisonous animals, he said, and neither feared them nor tried to hunt them to extinction. What a people! Carlson's pet cause is, well, pets, and he said that treatment of animals is \"a measure of character,\" so \"that should be the standard for who you bring into your country\"-whether they have enough humanity to treat even nonhumans with dignity.\n\nI understood these words as a dog whistle, if you will, summoning to his side anyone skittish about the influence of the dog-eating mainland Chinese, whose cynophagy he later singled out, along with \"murdering people for their organs,\" as \"deeply offensive\" behavior. Twice he suggested that he might get arrested if he said what he really thought. Australia has laws against racial incitement that punish speech in ways that would be unconstitutional in the United States. He said that if he were the leader of China, his first act would be to invade Australia and seize Clive Palmer's mineral wealth. Those who were currently selling Australian resources to China, he said, \"hate you.\"\n\nCarlson told the Australians that he, an outsider from 10,000 miles away, would never presume to lecture them about their country. \"When Bono comes to my country and starts lecturing, I think, Go back to Dublin .\" Carlson then proceeded, through his series of impressions of Australia, to lecture Australians on Australian politics, and the inferences to be drawn from his happy fortnight here. He said he thought that if he \"ever made any money,\" he might get a place in Sydney, so he browsed real-estate listings and saw prices so high that he wondered if they were denominated \"in lira or pesos or something.\" \"I was like, How does anybody live here? \" (He must have been relying on the audience's ignorance of the reports that he made more than $15 million a year at Fox, well above the median income in Sydney.)\n\nThe reason for the high costs, he said, was simple: There are more people than houses. If he were running things, he said, his \"main goal\" would be to create households for a new generation of Australians or Americans, because \"if it becomes too difficult or expensive for your children to buy a house in the country they were born in-you're going to be erased .\" Why does this happen? he asked. \"There's only one reason: immigration.\" He added that he rather liked immigrants themselves-what could be more relatable than the desire to move to a nice country?-but condemned those who let them in, and who lead this country with \"policies making it impossible for our children to live here.\" The contempt for these dispossessing policy makers should remain nonviolent, he affirmed at the end of his speech, with conviction. \"There is literally nothing you can do to make me\" hurt anybody, he said. The correct path is civil disobedience. \"You really have to decide that you're not just not going to harm anybody,\" Carlson said, \"but you are willing to be harmed.\"\n\nThe question for all of these populists is who the we is-whose children count as the ones who get to live here and afford a house in the Sydney or Melbourne suburbs, and who the they are who do not. At this point, I could not refrain from noticing that the crowd was pretty much entirely white. I felt not the slightest hostility, as a person with nonwhite ancestry that might suggest a taste for dog meat. But the whiteness of the audience was, shall we say, statistically unlikely to be random.\n\nAnne Applebaum: The American face of authoritarian propaganda\n\nMelbourne is the Australian city most marked by recent immigration, and improved by it. Carlson is new to Australia, but I've been coming here for 35 years-and I am proud to have distant Australian cousins going back to the early settler generations, including a sunburnt ethnographer who was among the first to study and describe the Wurundjeri Wol Wurrung. Australians are right to be enraged by housing costs, but immigration has been a blessing that, far from erasing Australia, has created and enriched it. When Carlson said that Australia is being \"taken away,\" I was truly confused about how he thinks the country that so enchanted him came to be what it is. Not by being pillaged by the Chinese, surely, or by letting in uncontrolled streams of people whose cherished values include torture of animals and people. But periodic, nutrient-rich infusions of immigration have changed Australia and prevented it from becoming a stagnant outpost of a crumbling empire, Norfolk with a high rate of melanoma.\n\nAt the Melbourne airport last weekend, I'd spoken with Uyghurs and Arabs; downtown, the block after block of clean prosperity (\"San Francisco without the addicts\") that Carlson rightly praised was filled with immigrants of all types, in no visible way burdening the Australians of longer standing. I asked the attendees of the speech what I should eat while in town, and most suggested Asian restaurants. Melbourne and Perth both have plenty of addicts, and if their residents could get rid of either them or the immigrants, I assume they would choose the former. (Perth, incidentally, is Australia's meth capital. Carlson's hotel must not have been in the areas where you find shirtless, sweaty white guys twitching angrily on street corners.) Varied international dining options are of course a cosmetic matter, the kind of thing a rootless cosmopolitan visitor like me might appreciate. But it is simply a fact that Australia, like it or not, is a result of many years of work by people with a range of origins not well represented by Monday's audience at the Melbourne Convention and Exhibition Centre.\n\nCarlson flew back to America the next morning, to a country in the acute crisis of having a president he considered \"demented\" and \"clearly incapable of making toast.\" He accused America's shadow rulers of having murdered John F. Kennedy. (Clive Palmer, who was interviewing him onstage at the time, did not request any elaboration on this accusation. It was that kind of night.) Carlson said he felt \"guilty\" for being away from his homeland while the country was falling apart. He did not, I noticed, say what he would do to end this catastrophe. I have long wondered whether he will enter politics himself. These speeches had stump elements to them, like practice for the big show back home. Were he to join the Trump ticket-and only seldom does a short list of possible running mates include him-he would at least increase the number of major-party candidates not in dire need of a neurological evaluation. In the present circumstances, that would count as an upgrade to the health of our political system. But that says more about our political system than it does about him.\n\nThis article originally misspelled the name of the Wurundjeri Woi Wurrung."

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSign up for The Decision , a newsletter featuring our 2024 election coverage.\n\nOne of my favorite things about America is its limitless tolerance for personal reinvention. In Britain, where I live, lingering, unspoken remnants of the class system define you from birth to death. But you can make a brand-new start of it in old New York. There is no better place to live unburdened by what has been .\n\nHowever, this same tendency also makes Americans easy prey for hucksters, mercenaries, and narcissists who cycle through identities to find the best version for their current situation. Which brings me to Tucker Carlson's interview this past weekend with his friend J. D. Vance, the Republican candidate for vice president.\n\nCarlson, who is appearing with right-wing luminaries on a coast-to-coast preelection tour, did not host the Vance event as a member of the media. You might have been confused about this, because he has a newsy podcast with guests and sponsors, but no. He is sui generis, a renegade, a lone wolf. He has been liberated from the shackles of the corporate media, he told his most recent audience, in Hershey, Pennsylvania, \"although no amount of sauna-cold plunge-hot bath combinations can scrape off the moral stain of all the time I spent there.\" Another way of putting this trajectory is that he was fired from Fox News in April 2023.\n\nRead: What Tucker Carlson's spin on World War II really says\n\n\"Every news outlet I've ever worked at, which is a lot of them, they're all controlled, obviously,\" Carlson said later in the evening. \"X is the place that free speech lives.\" By complete coincidence, X is now the best shop window still available for Carlson to promote his media empire, the Tucker Carlson Network. (He gave this publication a less enthusiastic endorsement: \"If you want to know the totalitarian impulses of your ruling class, read The Atlantic magazine, where they announce all of it, ahead of time.\")\n\nCarlson's lone-wolf rebrand is born of necessity, then. But it neatly aligns him with many guests on his tour-people who have also been, as they say, on a journey . Robert F. Kennedy Jr. began this electoral cycle as a Democrat and is now on Donald Trump's transition team. Nicole Shanahan was a member of the tech elite-she was married to the Google co-founder Sergey Brin for five years-before she became Kennedy's running mate. Tulsi Gabbard left the Democrats two years ago, saying the party was \"now under the complete control of an elitist cabal of warmongers driven by cowardly wokeness.\" (Yes, the cowardly warmongers are the ones you really have to look out for.) Another of his guests, Roseanne Barr, had a beloved sitcom, and then unfortunately went on Twitter .\n\nAs a Briton, though, I'm most transfixed by Russell Brand, who started his career here as a shock jock-he went to work at MTV UK the day after 9/11 dressed as Osama bin Laden-and more recently has been accused of multiple sexual assaults . (He has denied the allegations, which police are investigating.) Brand, who was baptized earlier this year in the River Thames by the TV survivalist Bear Grylls, spoke with Carlson in Phoenix about his acceptance of Christianity. At one point, he ostentatiously fell to his knees and led Carlson's audience through a verbose prayer about the \"demonic forces of the deep state.\" Perhaps his sudden fervor is sincere, but it's jarring in comparison with his previous public persona.\n\nCarlson's latest interviewee, however, has been through one of the most dramatic conversions of all. Vance used to be an insightful critic of the Republican Party's excesses and a formidable analyst of Trump's flaws. Now he has gone full MAGA, and I keep inspecting his eyes for signs of pain at the humbling contortions he is required to make. Twice, he mentioned the backlash to his and Trump's comments on Haitians in Springfield, Ohio-without ever mentioning the source of the complaints, which was that he helped spread the false rumor that Haitians were kidnapping and eating their neighbors' pets.\n\nVance is a smart guy who has chosen to play dumb for power-just like the man sitting opposite him on Saturday night.\n\nCarlson likes to begin his events with a short homily, hitting a few key themes. At the Vance event, Carlson warmed up with a light indictment of media bias, indicating the presence of Politico and New York Times journalists covering the event, and asking them \"to announce who they're voting for, if they would.\" (He didn't wait for an answer.) Another favored riff is that everyone thought Kamala Harris was a dud until she became the presidential nominee. At the Brand event, Carlson dismissively and incorrectly referred to her as \"Montel Williams's sidepiece,\" as if being associated with light entertainment were somehow discrediting to anyone with political ambitions. It obviously wasn't for Trump, a reality-television star.\n\nCarlson's speech template also includes an unparalleled bit of bull about the importance of unity. \"If you make people hate each other, I'm not sure there's a graver sin than that,\" he told his Phoenix audience. Various hits from Tucker Carlson Tonight , his former Fox News show, floated across my mind: We have to fight to preserve our nation and heritage , which appeared beneath a picture of Representative Ilhan Omar in 2020; This man is a danger to the country , a 2021 reference to General Mark Milley; and, not long before Carlson's ouster last year, Biden uses your tax dollars for \"Homosaurus .\"\n\nAt many points during Carlson's interview with Vance, my own brain provided similar split-screen comparisons of past and present. The Vance of 2024 says that accusations of racism are being used against working-class voters to \"silence them and shut them up,\" but the Vance of 2017 conceded that \"race definitely played a role in the 2016 election ... Definitely some people who voted for Trump are racist, and they voted for him for racist reasons.\" The Vance of 2024 is on a ticket that backs mass deportations; the Vance of 2012 didn't believe the policy was practical, never mind desirable, calling it a \"notion that fails to pass the laugh test.\"\n\nThe man sitting opposite Vance on Saturday, however, was in no position to call out hypocrisy. The Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit against Fox News revealed the contempt that Tucker Carlson has for Trump-and his own audience. In Hershey, he listened to Vance praise Trump's keen business mind, and the men shared an awestruck anecdote about the former president's interest in the difference between Quarter Pounders and Big Macs. In a text to his producer four years ago, however, Carlson suggested of Trump's business ventures that \"all of them fail. What he's good at is destroying things.\"\n\nThese turnabouts make one repeated theme of this year's Republican campaign all the more ironic. Trump and his allies are furious at the legacy media for failing to highlight Harris's own reversals, which have taken her from the über-progressive of 2019-she really did agree that America should do \"transgender operations on illegal aliens,\" as Trump put it-to the tough ex-prosecutor of 2024. I have limited sympathy with this complaint. The MAGA right gleefully smashed up the more fact-enthusiastic parts of conservative media, driving out actual reporters at right-leaning outlets, to be replaced with a galaxy of self-important talk-show hosts, podcasters, and propagandists. Is Tucker Carlson going to painstakingly hunt down every Harris utterance from 2019 to lay out how her positions have changed? He is not. He's going to do a whiffy one-liner about her having dated Montel Williams and wait for the audience to laugh.\n\nThe tone of Carlson's Vance interview was never anything less than cordial. The pair met, they said onstage, at a bankers' conference, and the conversation made several references to mutual friends. Carlson responded to Vance's points with phrases such as \"I couldn't agree more.\" The senator from Ohio came off as far more likable than he does in adversarial encounters, in which he has a tendency to become peevish and condescending. The most interesting section of the interview by far came when Vance described his political philosophy, a blend of populism, isolationism, and protectionism. His vision for America involves lower immigration, more house-building, fewer outsourced jobs, and far less military intervention around the world. Parts of that pitch are also attractive to the anti-capitalist left, which would frame similar policies as opposition to neoliberalism-as are other bipartisan concerns, such as the danger of food additives and the power of Big Pharma. (And as someone who has both eaten a gas-station hot dog and watched incessant cancer-drug ads in prime time, I understand the appeal of these last two positions.)\n\nTo Vance and Carlson, non-MAGA Republicans and Democrats are natural allies: Both want to keep \"flooding\" the United States with foreign workers, Vance claimed, because it's \"good for business.\" Added to that, both establishment parties are filled with military hawks. Vance dismissed recent announcements by two such Republicans-former Representative Liz Cheney and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney-that they will support Kamala Harris. \"Their entire politics for the past 30 years,\" he said of the Cheneys, \"has been using American power to inflame tensions in the world, to draw the United States deeper and deeper into foreign conflicts, which either shouldn't exist at all, or certainly the United States shouldn't have any business in.\"\n\nMegan Garber: Tucker Carlson's final moments on Fox were as dangerous as they were absurd\n\nVance dates his own skepticism about foreign intervention to Iraq. He signed up for the Marines in April 2003, he told Carlson, because he believed in the necessity of the invasion, but he came to realize it was a \"stupid war.\" Anyone younger than Vance, who has just turned 40, might struggle to understand what an incredible statement this is from a would-be Republican vice president. In the 2000s, the GOP clamor for war was so great that anyone who opposed it was painted as a pinko and probably a terrorist sympathizer.\n\nAnd that is a reflection of just how far the mainstream of the party has shifted in less than a decade. Vance is now MAGA's leading in-house intellectual, and Carlson-who turned against the Iraq War before most other Republicans did-is its unofficial minister of propaganda. After slipping the surly bonds of Fox News, Carlson no longer faces any real restraint on his crankiest tendencies. (Since leaving the network, he has interviewed both a Nazi apologist and a man who claims to have slept with Barack Obama.) Vance, meanwhile, has ascended through right-wing politics thanks to Trump's patronage, to which he owes his Senate seat. He seems to feel very little loyalty to the Republican Party as an institution, or to its long history and traditions. He appeared on a tour whose next stop, in Reading, Pennsylvania, was an event with the conspiracy theorists Alex Jones and Jack Posobiec.\n\n\"For 40 years, we haven't had a real political opposition in this country,\" Vance told Carlson at the end of their interview. \"And now we do.\""

      "text": "Tucker Carlson Was Wrong About the Media\n\nThe ousted Fox News host misrepresented the tenor of discussion.\n\nWelcome to Up for Debate. Each week, Conor Friedersdorf rounds up timely conversations and solicits reader responses to one thought-provoking question. Later, he publishes some thoughtful replies. Sign up for the newsletter here.\n\nQuestion of the Week\n\nToday I invite emails debating any of the following subjects: war, civil liberties, emerging science, demographic change, corporate power, or natural resources. Read on for more context.\n\nSend your responses to conor@theatlantic.com or simply reply to this email.\n\nConversations of Note\n\nAfter the television host Tucker Carlson was fired by Fox News, he posted a video message to Twitter that quickly went viral. In it, he noted that, in his newfound \"time off\" he has observed that \"most of the debates you see on television\" are so stupid and irrelevant that, in five years, we won't even remember we had them. \"Trust me, as someone who's participated,\" he added, which squares with my impression of his show--an assessment I feel comfortable making only because I have carefully documented its shoddy reasoning .\n\nBut then Carlson added: \"The undeniably big topics, the ones that will define our future, get virtually no discussion at all. War. Civil liberties. Emerging science. Demographic change. Corporate power. Natural resources. When was the last time you heard a legitimate debate about any of those issues? It's been a long time. Debates like that are not permitted in American media.\" I disagree, and not just because I intend to air your perspectives on those very subjects.\n\nLast March, this newsletter invited debate about the war in Ukraine and ran your responses . On the whole, The Atlantic --and most of the mainstream media--has published a lot more total articles from people who are supportive of Western aid for Ukraine, as I am, than contrary perspectives. But as you can see , this newsletter has made it a point to highlight the smartest writing I could find from different perspectives. If you look, you can find additional examples of contrasting perspectives from across the U.S. media: in The New York Times , The Washington Post , The Nation , National Review , Vox , and beyond. There are all sorts of plausible critiques of the way the American news media has covered Ukraine. But \"debate is not permitted\" is demonstrably false.\n\nOn civil liberties, which I've championed on scores of occasions in The Atlantic , the notion that debate isn't permitted is likewise preposterous. Few issues are debated more than the parameters of free speech, abortion rights, gun rights, transgender rights, pandemic rights and restrictions, and more. \"Emerging science\" is a bit vague, but surely debates about mRNA-vaccine mandates and artificial intelligence count. The Atlantic has repeatedly published entries in ongoing debates about demographic change . I understand corporate power to be a perennial topic of debate in journalistic organizations . As for natural resources, I've recently read about subjects including climate change, gas stoves, Colorado River water supply, oil drilling and pipelines, and plastics pollution.\n\nAgain, there are all sorts of critiques of the media that are plausible, on those subjects and others, but the particular critique that Carlson actually prepared and uttered is demonstrably false, so I find it strange that so many people reacted to it by treating Carlson as if he is a truth-teller. Lots of people in the American media work much harder at avoiding the utterance of falsehoods.\n\nHow to Mark May 1?\n\nThe law professor Ilya Somin commemorates it every year in a highly nontraditional fashion, arguing that we all ought to treat the traditional workers holiday as Victims of Communism Day.\n\nHere's his case:\n\nSince 2007, I have advocated using this date as an international Victims of Communism Day. I outlined the rationale for this proposal (which was not my original idea) in my very first post on the subject: May Day began as a holiday for socialists and labor union activists, not just communists. But over time, the date was taken over by the Soviet Union and other communist regimes and used as a propaganda tool to prop up their [authority]. I suggest that we instead use it as a day to commemorate those regimes' millions of victims. The authoritative Black Book of Communism estimates the total at 80 to 100 million dead, greater than that caused by all other twentieth century tyrannies combined. We appropriately have a Holocaust Memorial Day. It is equally appropriate to commemorate the victims of the twentieth century's other great totalitarian tyranny. And May Day is the most fitting day to do so ...\n\nOur comparative neglect of communist crimes has serious costs. Victims of Communism Day can serve the dual purpose of appropriately commemorating the millions of victims, and diminishing the likelihood that such atrocities will recur. Just as Holocaust Memorial Day and other similar events promote awareness of the dangers of racism, anti-Semitism, and radical nationalism, so Victims of Communism Day can increase awareness of the dangers of left-wing forms of totalitarianism, and government domination of the economy and civil society.\n\nMeanwhile, at the World Socialist Web Site, David North published the speech he gave to open the International May Day Online Rally. His remarks included provocative statements about the war in Ukraine:\n\nThe present war in Ukraine and the escalating conflict with China are the manifestations, though on a much more advanced and complex level, of the global contradictions analyzed by Lenin more than a century ago. Far from being the sudden and unexpected outcome of Putin's \"unprovoked\" invasion-as if the expansion of NATO 800 miles eastward since 1991 did not constitute a provocation against Russia-the war in Ukraine is the continuation and escalation of 30 years of continuous war waged by the United States. The essential aim of the unending series of conflicts has been to offset the protracted economic decline of US imperialism and to secure its global hegemony through military conquest.\n\nIn 1934, Leon Trotsky wrote that while German imperialism sought to \"organize Europe,\" it was the ambition of US imperialism to \"organize the world.\" Using language that seemed intended to confirm Trotsky's analysis, Joe Biden, then a candidate for the presidency, wrote in April 2020: \"The Biden foreign policy will place the United States back at the head of the table ... the world does not organize itself.\" But the United States confronts a world that does not necessarily want to be organized by the United States. The role of the dollar as the world reserve currency, the financial underpinning of American geo-political supremacy, is being increasingly challenged. The growing role of China as an economic and military competitor is viewed by Washington as an existential threat to American dominance.\n\nImperialism is objectionable but to me that premise leads to a starkly different conclusion: that the imperial ambitions of Russia and China ought to be resisted and that insofar as NATO or the United States helps Ukraine or Taiwan, we are reducing the likelihood of imperial conquest, not engaging in it.\n\nMore to Come on Trans Issues\n\nAnother batch of responses from readers should be coming soon. (If you missed the first batch, they're here .) In the meantime, here's a question from the Up for Debate reader Paul, who writes:\n\nI have come to understand and accept that the concept of \"gender\" is largely a social construct, is not synonymous with \"sex,\" and indeed is not dependent upon or related to sex in any objective way. This notion-that gender and sex are independent attributes-is, I think, one of the ideas that is fundamental to understanding and accepting transgender people. For many young people, this idea seems simple and self-evident. Yet, for anyone who has lived any length of time in a culture where, for centuries, these two words held virtually identical meanings, separating them can be a real struggle.\n\nIt is with that thought in mind-the acceptance of the fundamental difference between gender and sex-that I approach the issue of transgender people participating in competitive sport with the following sincere question: Are sports competitions divided by gender or are they divided by sex? If sports are divided by sex, then it follows logically that gender should have nothing to do with the discussion. That is, it follows that transgender people should only participate in sports along with those of their same birth sex. On the other hand, if sports participation is divided along gender lines, then everyone of the same gender (obviously, by definition this must include transgender people) should be invited to participate, regardless of sex. Is there more evidence that sports are arranged as a competition between those of the same sex, or those of the same gender?\n\nProvocation of the Week\n\nAt Hold That Thought, Sarah Haider writes that for a long time, she assumed that \"with no material incentives in one direction or another, people will think more freely. A world in which no one has to worry about where their paycheck will come will be a world in which people are more likely to be courageous, and tell the truth more openly. And of course, it is obvious how financial incentives can distort truth-telling. This is, of course, the justification for academic tenure.\" Now she wonders if tenure may actually pave the way for more conformity. She explains:\n\nFirst and foremost, it is not the case that free people will necessarily speak truthfully. No matter the romantic notions we like to hold about ourselves, humans do not deeply desire to \"speak the truth\". There are more beautiful things to say, things that make us feel good about ourselves and our respective tribes, things that grant us hope and moral strength and personal significance-truth, meanwhile, is insufferably inconvenient, occasionally ugly, and insensitive to our feelings. But lies, by their very nature, can be as beautiful and emotionally satisfying as our imaginations will allow them.\n\nUnfortunately, some degree of fidelity to reality is often required to prosper, and so occasionally we must choose truth. But that degree is dependent on our environments: lies are a luxury which some can afford more than others. Material freedom isn't just the freedom to tell the truth, it is the freedom to tell lies and get away with it. As I've noted before , the lack of economic pressures can clear the way for independent thinking, but they can also remove crucial \"skin in the game\" that might keep one tethered to reality. I suspect that on the whole, tenure might simply make more room for social pressures to pull with fewer impediments. If keeping your job is no longer a concern, you will not be \"concern-free\". Your mind will be more occupied instead by luxury concerns, like winning and maintaining the esteem of your peers. (And in fact, we do see this playing out at universities. Professors are more protected from the pressures of the outside world due to tenure, yet they are uniquely subservient to the politics within their local university environment.) ...\n\nAcademics actively shape their own environments. They grant students their doctorates, they help hire other faculty, they elect their department chairs. When an idea becomes prominent in academia, the structure of the environment selects for more of the same ... When you are forced to coexist with the enemy, you develop norms which allow both parties to function with as much freedom and fairness as possible. Ideologically mixed groups will, in other words, tend to emphasize objective process because they do not agree on ends. This environment is fairly conducive to the pursuit of truth.\n\nMore uniform groups, on the other hand, will tend to abandon process-rushing instead towards the end they are predisposed to believe is true and willing to use dubious means to get there. This creates a hostile environment for dissenting members, and over time, there will be less of them and more uniformity, which will inevitably lead to an even more hostile environment for dissent. When a majority ideology develops, it is likely only to increase in influence, and when it is sufficiently powerful, it can begin competing with reality itself.\n\nI retain hope that tenure does more good than harm but encourage faculty members who enjoy it to exhibit more courage to dissent from any orthodoxies of thought they regard as questionable."

      "text": "Tucker Carlson Is the Emblem of GOP Cynicism\n\nA personal reflection on the fallout from a rich man's toxic hubris\n\nThis is an edition of The Atlantic Daily, a newsletter that guides you through the biggest stories of the day, helps you discover new ideas, and recommends the best in culture. Sign up for it here.\n\nTucker Carlson is, for now, off the air and lying low. But his rapid slide from would-be journalist to venomous demagogue is the story of a generation of political commentators who found that inducing madness in the American public was better than the drudgery of working a job outside the conservative hothouses.\n\nFirst, here are four new stories from The Atlantic :\n\nPushing the Needle\n\nTucker Carlson has been fired, and you've probably already read a bushel of stories about his dismissal, his career, and his influence. Today, I want to share with you a more personal reflection. (Full disclosure: Carlson took a bizarre swipe at me toward the end of his time at Fox.) I always thought of Carlson as one of the worst things to happen to millions of Americans, and particularly to the working class. As Margaret Sullivan recently wrote , \"Despite his smarmy demeanor, and aging prep-school appearance,\" Carlson became \"a twisted kind of working-class hero.\"\n\nNot to me. I grew up working-class, and I admit that I never much cared for Carlson, a son of remarkable privilege and wealth, even before he became this creepy version of himself. I am about a decade older than Carlson, and when he began his career in the 1990s, I was a young academic and a Republican who'd worked in a city hall, a state legislature, and the U.S. Senate (as well as a number of other less glamorous jobs). Perhaps I should have liked him more because of his obvious desire to be taken seriously as an intellectual, but maybe that was also the problem: Carlson was too obvious, too effortful. I was already a fan of people such as George Will and Charles Krauthammer, and I didn't need a young, bow-tied, lightweight imitator.\n\nBut still, I read his writing in conservative magazines, and that of others in his cohort. After all, back in those days, they were my tribe. But the early '90s, I believe, is where things went wrong for this generation of young conservatives. Privileged, highly educated, stung by Bill Clinton's win-and, soon, bored-they decided that they were all slated for greater things in public life. The dull slog of high-paying professional jobs was not for them, not if it meant living outside the media or political ecosystems of New York and Washington.\n\nA 1995 New York Times Magazine profile of this group, some of them soon to be Carlson's co-workers, was full of red flags, but it was Laura Ingraham, whose show now packages hot bile in dry ice, who presaged what Fox's prime-time lineup would look like. After a late dinner party in Washington, she took the Times writer for a drive:\n\n\"You think we're nuts, don't you?\" muttered Laura Ingraham, a former clerk for Clarence Thomas and now an attorney at the Washington offices of the power firm of Skadden, Arps. Ingraham, who is also a frequent guest on CNN, had had it with a particularly long-winded argument over some review in The New Republic . It could have been worse. They could have been the dweebs and nerds that liberals imagine young conservatives to be.\n\nOr, more accurately, they could have been the dweebs and nerds they themselves feared they were . And in time, they realized that the way to dump their day jobs for better gigs in radio and television was to become more and more extreme-and to sell their act to an audience that was nothing like them or the people at D.C. dinner parties. They would have their due, even if they had to poison the brains of ordinary Americans to get it.\n\nCarlson joined this attention-seeking conservative generation and tried on various personas. At one point, he had a show on MSNBC that was canceled after a year. I never saw it. I do remember Carlson as the co-host of Crossfire ; I didn't think he did a very good job representing thoughtful conservatives, and he ended up getting pantsed live on national television by Jon Stewart. He was soon let go from CNN.\n\nWhen Carlson got his own show on Fox News in 2016, however, I noticed.\n\nThis new Tucker Carlson decided to throw off the pretense of intellectualism. ( According to The New York Times , he was \"determined to avoid his fate at CNN and MSNBC.\") He understood what Fox viewers wanted, and he took the old Tucker-the one who claimed to care about truth and journalistic responsibility-and drove him to a farm upstate where he could run free with the other journalists. The guy who returned alone in his car to the studio in Manhattan was a stone-cold, cynical demagogue. By God, no one was going to fire that guy.\n\nWhat concerned me was not that Carlson was selling political fentanyl; that's Fox's business model. It was that Carlson, unlike many people in his audience, knew better . He jammed the needle right into the arms of the Fox audience, spewing populist nonsense while running away from his own hyper-privileged background. I suppose I found this especially grating because for years I've lived in Rhode Island, almost within sight of the spires of Carlson's pricey prep school, by the Newport beaches. (This area also produced Michael Flynn and Sean Spicer, but please don't judge us-it's actually lovely here.)\n\nEvery night, Carlson encouraged American citizens to join him in his angry nihilism, telling his fans that America and its institutions were hopelessly corrupt, and that they were essentially living in a failed state. He and his fellow Fox hosts, meanwhile, presented themselves as the guardians of the real America, crowing in ostensible solidarity with an audience that, as we would later learn from the Dominion lawsuit, they regarded with both contempt and fear.\n\nAn especially hateful aspect of Carlson's rants is that they often targeted the institutions and norms-colleges, the U.S. military, capitalism itself-that help so many Americans get a chance at a better life. No matter the issue, Carlson was able to find some resentful, angry, us-versus-them angle, tacking effortlessly from sounding like a pompous theocrat one day to a founding member of Code Pink the next. If you were trying to undermine a nation and dissolve its hopes for the future, you could hardly design a better vehicle than Tucker Carlson Tonight .\n\nBut give him credit: He was committed to the bit. A man who has never known a day of hard work in his life was soon posing in flannel and work pants in a remarkably pristine \"workshop,\" and inviting some of the worst people in American life to come to his redoubt to complain about how much America seems to irrationally hate Vladimir Putin, violent seditionists, and, by extension somehow, poor ordinary Joes such as Tucker Swanson McNear Carlson.\n\nCarlson is emblematic of the entire conservative movement now, and especially the media millionaires who serve as its chief propagandists. The conservative world has become a kind of needle skyscraper with a tiny number of wealthy, superbly educated right-wing media and political elites in the penthouses, looking down at an expanse of angry Americans whose rage they themselves helped create. As one Fox staffer said in a text to the former CNN host Brian Stelter shortly after the January 6 insurrection, \"What have we done?\" If only Carlson and others were capable of asking themselves the same question.\n\nRelated :\n\nToday's News\n\nDispatches\n\nExplore all of our newsletters here.\n\nEvening Read\n\nHow I Got Bamboo-zled by Baby Clothes\n\nBy Sarah Zhang\n\nTo be pregnant for the first time is to be the world's most anxious, needy, and ignorant consumer all at once.

(I've posted some pictures on Twitter .) For many years, I had something of a standard academic's home office: a lot of books and maps, a bit of conference swag here and there. But I've decided in my dotage to bring in some color from the 1960s, including a framed collection of Batman cards (the kind that came with that dusty-pink stick of gum), a Star Trek wall intercom, and an original poster from the Japanese sci-fi classic Destroy All Monsters , starring Godzilla and a cast of his buddies. While I was hanging the movie poster, I wondered: Why do we love those Godzilla movies? They're terrible . Are we just nostalgic-as I sometimes am-for the old, velvet-draped movie palaces full of kids? I think it's something more.\n\nIf you've never seen the original Godzilla , it's actually kind of terrifying. It's way too intense for young kids; I can't remember when I first saw it on television, but it scared the pants off me. The stuff that came later, with the cheesy music and the cartoonish overacting by the guys in the rubber kaiju outfits, were versions that kids and adults could watch together. They answered all of your toughest kid questions: What if Godzilla fought aliens? (I am a King Ghidorah fan.) What if Godzilla duked it out with ... King Kong ? (I thought Godzilla was robbed in that one.) I love scary monster movies, but now and then, you want more monsters and fewer scares. Maybe the analogy here is Heath Ledger and Cesar Romero: Both are great Jokers, but sometimes, you'd like to enjoy the character with a shade fewer homicides. Being able to enjoy both is, perhaps, one of the subtle rewards of growing up.\n\n- Tom\n\nKatherine Hu contributed to this newsletter."

      "text": "Tucker's Successor Will Be Worse\n\nThe history of Fox News shows that the network and its issues are larger than any one anchor.\n\nTucker Carlson's rise to become the defining conservative-media personality of the Donald Trump period was a surprise. His abrupt departure from Fox News, announced this morning, is even more shocking.\n\n\"FOX News Media and Tucker Carlson have agreed to part ways,\" the company said in a terse statement . \"We thank him for his service to the network as a host and prior to that as a contributor.\"\n\nCarlson transformed himself from a bow-tie-clad smart aleck playing the role of liberals' favorite conservative into a MAGA hero, able to channel the grievances of the Trump coalition despite his patrician upbringing and reputation-or perhaps, like Trump, because of it. In the process he became Fox's biggest star, talked about as a potential presidential candidate . Carlson was a font of dangerous rhetoric and preposterous lies , and Fox's viewers absolutely loved it.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Fox News lost the lawsuit but won the war\n\nThe reasons for Carlson's departure are still emerging, and the steps he might take next are still unclear. But Fox will probably be fine without Carlson, and anyone who hopes that his disappearance from the air will improve the political discourse in this country is too optimistic. When prior bogeymen for the left-people such as Bill O'Reilly and Glenn Beck-have been pushed out of Fox, the network has always found a new figure to replace them, while the hosts themselves have struggled to match their past success. There will be a new Tucker Carlson, and it's a good bet he or she will be even worse.\n\nThe exit comes at a time of flux for Fox. Its founder, Rupert Murdoch, is 92 and has faced recent health struggles. Fox just settled a lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems over election-related lies for almost $800 million, and faces several more. The discovery process that led up to the settlement was embarrassing for Fox and for Carlson. Internal messages showed that Carlson and his colleagues knew that many of the claims they made about election fraud after the 2020 election were nonsense. They also showed Carlson furious over Fox journalists accurately reporting facts, which he worried would hurt ratings, and saying that he hated Trump. (This revelation didn't prevent him from conducting an obsequious interview with the former president earlier this month.)\n\nDavid A. Graham: Tucker Carlson, unmasked\n\nWhen the settlement was announced last week, I argued that no matter the hefty bill, it was just the cost of doing business for Fox . The network settled the suit, but airing the lies achieved its goal of vanquishing smaller, upstart conservative rivals. Fox is and remains larger than even its most important figures.\n\nCarlson will not go away, but recent history suggests that he'll have a hard time maintaining his current profile. Before Carlson, there was Bill O'Reilly, who was the leading conservative figure of his era and equally reviled by progressives. When O'Reilly was finally forced out of Fox in 2017 over sexual-misconduct claims, many critics hoped it would improve the state of the country and the press. Instead, it cleared the way for Carlson. O'Reilly has kept writing best-selling books but has become a more marginal figure in politics.\n\nThis pattern has repeated itself over the years. After O'Reilly, the longtime star Sean Hannity became Fox's marquee name. His influence was such that he was sometimes referred to as Trump's real chief of staff. But Hannity was unable to sustain his success, and though he remains at Fox, he was eventually eclipsed by Carlson.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Tucker Carlson and the new narrative of January 6\n\nA second-tier Fox star of the Obama years was Glenn Beck, a shouty and excitable host whose rise seemed to threaten O'Reilly's seat on the throne. He was pushed out in 2011, and though Beck's career has continued since, his plan to challenge Fox's supremacy with The Blaze came up short, and he's never matched the relevance he had on Fox.\n\nThe original mastermind of Fox News was Roger Ailes, the veteran TV executive and former Richard Nixon aide who recognized the market for an avowedly right-wing channel. When Ailes was forced out in 2016 (also related to sexual misconduct), many liberals hoped that it would doom the channel. But Fox is still Fox-the leader in ratings and the center of conservatism.\n\nMore details about why Carlson is leaving will surely emerge soon. Though he was connected to the Dominion lawsuit, as well as to other defamation cases against the company, a more serious offender was Maria Bartiromo, who remains at Fox (at least for now). Carlson is also implicated in a lawsuit by Abby Grossberg, a former Fox producer who has claimed that she experienced an appalling work environment while working on Carlson's show. The Washington Post reported that Carlson's messages criticizing Fox's top leadership \"played a role in his departure,\" and his political ambitions and his penchant for dishing to reporters could easily have created tensions with bosses.\n\nAny rising conservative TV star would love to grab for the crown Carlson has doffed, or that's been taken from him. The audience, influence, and money involved make it irresistible, but his career arc illustrates the hazards. To remain on top at Fox, hosts have to be ready to continually ratchet up their rhetoric, because the network's business model depends on continual audience outrage. But audiences eventually become inured and require new and more extreme input. Providing that is a challenging and soul-leaching job-and someone will be delighted to have it."

      "text": "Tucker Carlson's Final Moments on Fox Were as Dangerous as They Were Absurd\n\nThe host spent some of his last minutes on the network mocking a cult. He did not seem to appreciate the irony.\n\nTucker Carlson was in a good mood on Friday night. He was giggly. He was giddy. For the final segment of his Fox show, Tucker Carlson Tonight , the host was joined on set by a newly famous pizza-delivery man: While en route to drop off some pies earlier this month, the man had seen a police chase in action and had tripped the fleeing target with a nonchalant kick, pizzas still in hand. The scene had been captured on a doorbell camera; Carlson had aired it repeatedly on his show. Now the man in question had driven-from Pennsylvania-to deliver pizza to his studio-bound fan. He and Carlson ate the slices together, taking big bites (\"It's actually still hot!\") as they bantered. Carlson, still chewing, offered a merry sign-off to his viewers. \"We'll be back on Monday!\" he said.\n\nExcept, of course, he wasn't. Friday's episode, it turned out, was the last one Carlson would film for Fox. The most-watched host on cable has left the network for reasons that may involve lawsuits , prickly office politics, or the ongoing liabilities of a say-anything star. What seems clear for now is that Carlson's departure had little to do with the dangerous vitriol he spewed on his show-and that the decision to \"part ways,\" as Fox's announcement put it, was as much a surprise to him as it was to everybody else. Carlson is a very good actor-he has spent the past seven years convincingly playing a propagandist -but his final show gave no indication of the new script. Had he known, he probably wouldn't have ended his run on Fox with a mouth full of interstate pizza. And he probably wouldn't have chosen, as his swan song, a bizarre and menacing riff about castration.\n\nRead: Tucker Carlson's manufactured America\n\n\"Heaven's Gate! Remember that?\" Carlson began the segment, cheerfully. He proceeded to rehash the well-known details of the cult that made so many headlines in the '90s: the mass suicide; the bowl-cut-sporting co-founder, Marshall Applewhite; the belief that the Hale-Bopp comet was an interplanetary message. \"Members of the cult believed they were part of an alien species trapped in human form,\" Carlson said. \"Applewhite taught them to give up all human attachments: their relationships with their families, their friends, their jobs, their possessions, ultimately their names\"-here, he paused for dramatic effect-\"their genders , and their own bodies . Sound familiar?\"\n\nApplewhite castrated himself, Carlson told viewers, in an effort to achieve \"androgynous immortality,\" and encouraged his fellow cult members to do the same. \"You can go on Wikipedia and read all about it,\" Carlson said, \"and we recommend that you do. Why? Because, once again, it sounds familiar. Heaven's Gate is proof that when religious fanatics command you to surrender your gender and become androgynous, castrate yourself and your children-it's probably not going to end well.\"\n\nAnd then, abruptly, the segment ends.\n\nCarlson's lawyers have argued that he is not a journalist but instead, effectively, an entertainer-that anyone who might see him as a reliable purveyor of facts is making a foolish category error. His show's appeal, though, depends on its gaudy adjacency to journalism: Carlson's segments look like the news and act like the news, even as they regularly distort the news. But his Heaven's Gate rant defied that logic. The cult's deaths took place in 1997; as far as I can tell, they have no explicit connection to the current moment. Except, that is, for the cultish commands that Carlson treated as abiding dangers to his viewers: Surrender your gender. Castrate yourself, and your children .\n\nThe host shares a skill set with the man he once called \"a demonic force\" and a \"destroyer.\" Both Carlson and Donald Trump have a way with words. They wield them not simply as tools of meaning but also, often, as simple punctuation. What Trump does in his writing-the repetition, the ad hoc capitalization-Carlson does in his speech. He turns the core message of every segment he airs- they're coming for you; be afraid -into a rhythmic proposition. Like a jingle rendered in a minor key, Carlson's show turns fear into music.\n\nRead: How Fox News became a language\n\nAnd here is the grim refrain of his Heaven's Gate riff: castrate . The segment may have seemed discordant; it was, on the contrary, all too harmonious with everything else. One of Carlson's most consequential legacies, my colleague Charlie Warzel writes , will be his mainstreaming of hard-right agendas. This is what Carlson was doing as he offered up his weird little history lesson. He was vilifying transgender people-in particular, transgender women. He chose to mock 39 people who died 26 years ago in order to make an insidious suggestion: that those who identify as transgender are in the thrall of a cult.\n\nThe segment bears one more mark of a typical Carlson screed. For all its insinuations, it retains plausible deniability. In an earlier moment on Friday's show, Carlson referred to the Nashville school shooter as a \"transgenderist terrorist,\" the invented adjective suggesting an ideological choice rather than a human truth. But in the Heaven's Gate segment, Carlson never says transgender . He merely implies, and hints. Were he questioned, he could easily argue that the segment was a throwaway, a callback to the '90s that filled space in the waning minutes of a Friday-night broadcast. That ambiguity-that willingness to air words that are vetted and violent at the same time-is a core element of Carlson's rhetoric. The slippery language flatters his audience. They'll understand its grammar, the implication goes, in a way those woke liberals won't. The language protects Carlson. It serves everyone involved-save for the people who have to live in the shadow of Carlson's insinuations.\n\nRead: American cynicism is winning\n\nIt was an apt coincidence, then, that Carlson spent his final moments on Fox mocking the failures of a cult. Cults and conspiracy theories tend to share similar dynamics : They offer community to their adherents. They rationalize the world's chaos. They start from their preferred conclusions, and work backwards. \"It's super-simple,\" Carlson said in an opening segment on Friday's show, as he spun a dizzying argument that combined home appraisals, FICO scores, HUD, Kamala Harris, redlining, job training, and marijuana legalization into a claim about Democrats' electoral machinations. (\"If you want total control over the entire country,\" Carlson said, \"you need demographic change everywhere.\")\n\nConspiracy theories tend to involve what scholars call epistemic or cognitive closure: Their tales create vacuum-sealed worlds where truth becomes tautological, where everything has an easy answer, and where earwormy refrains- the ruling class , the woke left , the PC police -anchor every melody. Fox may brand itself as a bold teller of truths, fighting against conformity and groupthink; in fact, as so much reporting has suggested , the network is desperate to keep its adherents from doubting their mission or defecting from the cause. So too with Carlson. His show offered opinion; what it really sold, though, was daily reassurance: that his viewers' fears are justified, that their biases are noble, that the world is precisely as disordered as they claim it-and need it-to be. Carlson gave his audiences the stories they wanted to hear; in return, they gave him fervent loyalty.\n\nAnd so, now, Carlson is a celebrity with a massive fan base and a minimized platform. (Given that his $20-million-a-year contract will reportedly be paid out, he will also be doing what he has spent years deriding others for: getting paid for not working.) Carlson, in leaving Fox, has attained that most powerful of statuses. He is a free agent with a following. He could become the next Alex Jones . He could become the next Bill O'Reilly . He could become the next president. Carlson might have already hinted-ambiguously, teasingly-at his plans. Yesterday, his personal website transformed to acknowledge his departure from Fox. TuckerCarlson.com, like a ground game in waiting, instructs fans to text Carlson. In exchange for their data, the new language promises, they'll be among the first to learn the answer to the question so many are waiting to hear: \"what Tucker's up to next.\""

      "text": "Tucker Carlson Is Completing the Work That Trump Began\n\nThere was a time when someone like Alex Jones would have been too toxic to embrace.\n\nEarlier this week, Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson , the host of the top-rated news show on cable, rose in defense of the right-wing conspiracy theorist Alex Jones .\n\n\"Jones is often mocked for his flamboyance,\" Carlson said, \"but the truth is he has been a far better guide to reality in recent years-in other words, a far better journalist-than, say, NBC News national-security correspondent Ken Dilanian or Margaret Brennan of CBS.\"\n\nFlamboyance is a rather interesting word to apply to Jones; there are others.\n\nLast month Jones, the host of Infowars, was found liable for damages in a defamation lawsuit brought by parents of children killed in the 2012 Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, whose victims included 20 young children. Jones claimed that the shooting was a \"false flag\" operation carried out by \"crisis actors.\" He mocked grieving parents, saying , \"I've looked at it, and undoubtedly there's a cover-up, there's actors, they're manipulating, they've been caught lying, and they were preplanning before it and rolled out with it.\"\n\nRead: The lasting trauma of Alex Jones's lies\n\nThis shows a level of depravity and cruelty unusual even among right-wing conspiracists. Yet there was Carlson on Wednesday night, offering praise for Jones, whom Carlson referred to as \"one of the most popular journalists on the right.\" (Aaron Blake of The Washington Post has provided a useful summary of Jones's crazed claims.)\n\nJones's validation by Carlson is hardly surprising-but it is significant. Tucker Carlson, after all, is not some fringe figure; he is the most influential media personality on the right, the individual Republican lawmakers seek to impress and whom they genuflect before. (Carlson seems most impressed not by American politicians such as Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley, but by the authoritarian leader of Hungary, Viktor Orbán .)\n\nThere was a time-and it wasn't all that long ago-when Alex Jones would have been far too toxic and deranged a figure for any influential member of the right to embrace. No more. Jones fits right in, just as Marjorie Taylor Greene , Paul Gosar, Lauren Boebert, Madison Cawthorn, Ron Johnson, and many others do. The right wing and the Republican Party are more, not less, radical than they were when Donald Trump was president.\n\nIn praising Jones, one of the most prominent conspiracists in American politics, Carlson called him \"a far better guide to reality\" than mainstream journalists. This is the kind of tactic that propagandists such as Trump and Vladimir Putin have employed so well: making claims that are so brazen, so outrageous, so untrue that they are disorienting, aimed at destroying critical thinking. Such claims are not just an attack on objective truth; they are an inversion of it, turning people such as Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones into the gatekeepers of reality.\n\nWhat Carlson is doing is poisonous to a free society, not just because our society can't operate without shared public facts but also because he is inciting paranoia, which may well lead to political violence.\n\nThat's the reason Republican leaders' effort to portray the 2020 election as stolen and the insurrection on January 6 as justified is so significant. They aim to convince ordinary Republicans that they have been victims of what Trump has called the \"crime of the century,\" the greatest election fraud in history. In Trump's words , \"the real insurrection happened on November 3rd, the Presidential Election, not on January 6th-which was a day of protesting the Fake Election results.\"\n\nAnne Applebaum: Tucker Carlson is stirring up hatred of America\n\nCarlson recently released a three-part documentary suggesting that the January 6 insurrection was a \"false flag\" operation , while Jones was subpoenaed by the House committee investigating the Capitol attack. He reportedly helped organize the rally at the Ellipse near the White House the day of the riot; was among the group of Trump allies who met in and around a hotel near the White House the day before the riot; and spread the false narrative of a stolen election the day before the insurrection.\n\nTime after time after time over the past half-dozen years, people who care about American democracy have underestimated a movement that is inflicting enormous harm upon it. They became his enthusiastic backers. Many other Republicans who were privately horrified by Trump looked the other way, went silent, or signed up for the ride. At every key moment, when called upon, they publicly defended Trump. They might not have liked it, but they found a way to rationalize it. It would be an affectation to deny that there are policy achievements they can point to, but they should be honest about the enormous costs that accompanied their accommodation with such a corrupt and deranged president.\n\nA lot of Republicans I know assumed that after the Trump presidency, things would snap back. The opposite has happened. Trump is no longer president, but the damage to democracy doesn't require his presence in office. People like Tucker Carlson and Alex Jones and a bevy of others are ready to complete the work Trump began.\n\nThey can be stopped, but who in the Republican Party is willing to stop them?"

Although a precise reason wasn't given, the move came just days after the cable network settled a $787.5 million defamation suit brought by Dominion Voting Systems over lies propagated by the cable network about the 2020 presidential election. Since taking over the primetime slot in 2016, Carlson has also spread far-right talking points about immigrants, Black people and the LGBTQ community. For more, we speak with Madeline Peltz of Media Matters for America, where she has helped to expose Carlson's extremism. \"It creates a major vacuum in the right-wing media ecosystem,\" Peltz says of Carlson's departure.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González, as we turn to the firing of Tucker Carlson. On Monday, Fox News announced it had, quote, \"agreed to part ways\" with its most popular host. It remains unclear why Fox fired Carlson, who is known for promoting far-right and white nationalist ideas and guests. Over the years, Carlson embraced the racist \"great replacement\" theory and other anti-immigrant views, compared the January 6th insurrectionists to \"sightseers\" who were \"peaceful,\" \"orderly\" and \"meek.\" Carlson also recently called on Texas Governor Greg Abbott to pardon a man who was just convicted of murdering a Black Lives Matter activist.\n\nTucker Carlson's firing came a week after Fox agreed to pay $787 million in the largest media defamation suit in this country to settle a suit by Dominion Voting Systems for airing false claims about the 2020 election. Emails and texts released as part of the lawsuit show Carlson repeatedly criticized Fox management, as well as Donald Trump, who he privately described as \"a demonic force, a destroyer.\" Other messages showed Carlson privately did not believe Trump's lies about the election, but he never told his audience this. Carlson was also named in a new lawsuit filed by former Fox News produce Abby Grossberg, who has described a culture of sexual harassment and general misogyny at the network.\n\nCarlson's top producer, Justin Wells, was also fired Monday. In 2017, Blake Neff, one of Carlson's top writers on the show, resigned after it was revealed he had written deeply racist and homophobic remarks in online white supremacist forums and message boards.\n\nFor more, we're joined by Madeline Peltz, deputy director of rapid response at Media Matters, where her two new pieces are headlined \"With Tucker Carlson out, other Fox extremists now have the spotlight\" and \"Tucker Carlson is out at Fox News. Here's a brief look at his hatred and conspiracy theories.\"\n\nWelcome to Democracy Now! , Madeline. If you can start off -\n\nMADELINE PELTZ : Thanks you so much.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : - by talking about what you understand? I mean, all of this, obviously, increased Fox's viewership. They did not take him off the air before. This comes right after this three-quarters of a billion-dollar settlement with Dominion. Talk about what you understand happened.\n\nMADELINE PELTZ : It's difficult to overstate the impact that this will have on the cable news universe. In terms of what led to this stunning decision, it's - there's a number of factors floating around in the air. Media reporters have given disparate reports over the last 24 hours, but I imagine that there was some - it has at least something to do with the Abby Grossberg lawsuit. You can see that on air his treatment of women, of the #MeToo movement, of speaking up about sexual harassment has been met with derision and mockery, and so it would be - it would make a lot of logical sense for that to be an attitude that was reflected behind the scenes.\n\nBut again, Tucker Carlson was a kingmaker at Fox News, in the Republican Party, and the Murdochs stood behind every single outrage cycle that happened as result of his on-air racism. And so, if we know one thing, it wasn't his on-air commentary. And I think that we will learn more in the coming days about what exactly happened behind the scenes.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And could you expound a little bit about his influence on the Republican Party?\n\nMADELINE PELTZ : Absolutely. I think you can see it in how some of the Senate nominees shook out in the 2022 midterms. He was a singular force in driving the candidacy of JD Vance, that he has been a rallying point for the Republican Party's opposition agenda under the Biden administration. But under the Trump administration, he had this unique ability to speak to what was going on in the White House and influence it via his primetime show. There were times where segments not only led to Trump tweeting in direct response in real time, but also issuing directives for his administration via Twitter. And as you mentioned with the segment on Greg Abbott's pardon and also Abbott sending National Guard troops to the border, both of those were driven by Tucker Carlson. And there is simply no one who has a loud - who, in the past six, seven years, has been able to exert that type of influence over the Republican Party, and it creates a major vacuum in the right-wing media ecosystem.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, Madeline Peltz, if you can talk about - I mean, before this was O'Reilly, who went down over sexual harassment, and then you have Tucker Carlson. If you can talk about the other people? Now there's going to be rotating hosts. But it seems anyone in that position increases the visibility of Fox News, that this isn't a singular issue of one man, however white nationalist, racist, anti-immigrant, xenophobic he was.\n\nMADELINE PELTZ : Yeah. I mean, in terms of the sexual - you know, this alleged culture of sexual harassment, this is an issue that extends back to the founding of Fox News, set from the very top. Roger Ailes was forced out after it was revealed that he - what some women who worked under him described as a reign of terror via sexual blackmailing, hiring of private investigators to quash their complaints. So, it's part of a larger culture at Fox News.\n\nIn terms of the future of the 8 p.m. hour, in many ways, Tucker Carlson got lucky. The 8 p.m. hour at Fox News is an institution in and of itself, largely because of the legacy of Bill O'Reilly. And Tucker just stepped into those shoes, and so he sort of had a built-in floor of an audience. And that will continue with the - that will continue with whoever takes over the 8 p.m. hour.\n\nWith that said, the bench is very shallow within Fox News. There are not a lot of people who, from where I'm sitting, are in a position to step into this legacy hour. With that being said, the digital right-wing media sphere is extremely overcrowded and has a number of viral personalities that could come in from the outside. And in the meantime, the rotating host model is something that they instituted for the 7 p.m. hour when Martha MacCallum was fired. And they maintained a rotating host for, I believe, over a year, at least a year. And so, it could be a long time before someone steps up, but within Fox News there's simply no one who can come close to the influence that Tucker Carlson has had over the last few years.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Well, I wanted to ask you - last night, Donald Trump had his first TV appearance since Carlson's ouster, and he did it on Newsmax, a right-wing rival of Fox News. As we head into the 2024 elections, is this a sign there's going to be a growing battle between these right-wing outlets?\n\nMADELINE PELTZ : I think that Newsmax is attempting to take advantage of the moment. It's the same thing that happened when there was backlash to the Fox position, specifically, the Arizona call in the 2020 election. There was a slight bump in ratings for alternative right-wing news channels like Newsmax and One America News. And that was not something that held. And so, I think that given Newsmax's own volatility with regard to their carriage over the last few months, they are just trying to insert themselves into the headline of this massive story in media, and I don't think that it's something that is really going to stick.\n\nI think that Donald Trump's comments on Newsmax last night and his praise of Tucker Carlson and general deference to Fox shows the continued power that the network has, that this famously unrestrained figure, former president, did not bring down his most inflammatory commentary on Fox News for Tucker Carlson, but sort of staked out a wait-and-see position. And so, I think that that's also telling.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Madeline Peltz, we want to thank you for being with us, deputy director of rapid response at Media Matters. We'll to your pieces, \"With Tucker Carlson out, other Fox extremists now have the spotlight\" and \"Tucker Carlson is out at Fox News. Here's a brief look at his hatred and conspiracy theories.\"\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

We turn now to a scandal at President Trump's favorite TV channel, Fox News, where the lead writer for Tucker Carlson Tonight - the most popular cable news show in history - has resigned for posting disturbing racist and misogynist messages to an online forum under a pseudonym for years.\n\nBlake Neff stepped down Friday after CNN broke the story that he had posted multiple racist messages on the website AutoAdmit, mocking and degrading African Americans, Asian Americans and women, contributing to threads that used the N-word.\n\nOn his show Monday night, Tucker Carlson announced he, too - well, he is going on vacation for the rest of the week, after he addressed the controversy.\n\nTUCKER CARLSON : Blake fell short of that standard, and he has paid a very heavy price for it. But we should also point out, to the ghouls now beating their chests in triumph of the destruction of a young man, that self-righteousness also has its costs. We are all human.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : For more, we go to Matt Gertz. He is senior fellow at Media Matters, where he focuses on the relationship between Fox News and the Trump administration.\n\nMatt, welcome to Democracy Now! Talk about the significance of the chief writer for Tucker Carlson - again, the most popular cable show in U.S. history - him being forced to resign.\n\nMATT GERTZ : Well, I'll let Fox's executives do a little of the talking for me. They, over the weekend, in a memo to their staff, condemned him for \"horrendous and deeply offensive racist, sexist and homophobic comments.\"  That's too racist, sexist and homophobic for Fox News, which takes quite a lot.\n\nI mean, I think it's not surprising that a scandal like this has broken on Tucker Carlson's show. Blake Neff was being crudely bigoted in his free time on this message board, but his day job has been providing copy for Tucker Carlson's more sophisticated bigoted show. And so, you know, I think it was really only a matter of time until something like this happened. Tucker Carlson's Daily Caller website has had a series of these scandals. Blake Neff came to Tucker Carlson's show from there. He was hired during a period in which Carlson was managing that website.\n\nI think that this is a big problem for Fox News. It's incredibly damaging to its advertisers, certainly, to be associated with a program like Carlson's.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We can hear you, Juan. Juan?\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: Yes. I wanted to ask - in terms of the impact on Fox News, it's been one scandal after another on Fox News, whether it's Bill O'Reilly, obviously, before him. In terms of the following of Fox News, it doesn't seem to have much impact in terms of people who watch their so-called news shows.\n\nMATT GERTZ : Fox News has a business model problem. There are two ways Fox makes money. One is off of its viewers. They get a big audience, and then they can sell advertising against that audience. The way that they attract the audience is with bigoted commentary. It's with red-meat Republican talking points. It's by creating a space for the hard-right movement in this country.\n\nBut advertisers don't really like that, because, inevitably, it leads to blowups like this. It gets them in trouble, and then they start fleeing. Tucker Carlson's show at this point, its advertiser blocks are a wasteland. It's promos for other Fox content and then advertisements for MyPillow, which is a product run by a Republican businessman. And so, Fox is leaving a lot of money on the table because of this. And I think, in the long run, it's going to be quite damaging to them. They don't really have a way out of this. They keep getting caught in this cycle of one scandal after another. And the reasons for this -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Matt Gertz, in the last seconds we have, can you talk about the relationship between Tucker Carlson - and, overall, Fox - and President Trump? So often you hear Tucker Carlson's words, who Blake Neff had boasted he was always the first draft of anything Tucker Carlson would say, end up in a tweet of President Trump.\n\nMATT GERTZ : Yeah. Tucker Carlson is now one of the most powerful media figures in America, and that's because President Trump is part of his audience. Trump watches a ton of Fox News. He frequently live-tweets the segments that he takes a shine to. He also gets advice from Fox hosts directly. And more often than not, recently, that's been Tucker Carlson. From strikes against Iran to the coronavirus to, more recently, his attacks on Black Lives Matter and protests, Tucker Carlson's commentary is shaping the president's responses to the events that are happening around us. It's very dangerous.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to thank you, Matt Gertz, for being with us. Now Tucker Carlson says he's gone trout fishing. Matt Gertz is senior fellow at Media Matters. We'll link to your latest piece , \"Tucker Carlson has said enough.\" I'm Amy Goodman, with Juan González. Thanks so much for joining us.

Dominion Voting Systems, which makes voting machines, has sued the conservative cable news outlet for $1.6 billion in a defamation suit that has exposed how top hosts and executives knew they were spreading misinformation but continued to push the conspiracy theories on air. \"Fox News, despite its corporate name, is not in fact a news organization,\" says Chris Lehmann, D.C. bureau chief for The Nation . \"What they are doing is promulgating lies for the sake of maintaining audience share and high profitability.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Chris -\n\nCHRIS LEHMANN : Yeah, go ahead.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Chris Lehmann, we wanted to move on to your other piece for The Nation that's headlined \"The Internal Decapitation of Fox News: Documents from Dominion Voting Systems's lawsuit against Fox show the network's awareness of the flimsiness of its stolen-election narrative.\" That's from your piece. See, Dominion's $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit lays out how Fox News hosts and top executives thought former President Trump's 2020 election fraud claims were completely unfounded, yet continued to push his conspiracy theories on air. Included in the documents was the response from Fox News executives when anchor Neil Cavuto cut off then-Trump Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany for making unsubstantiated claims.\n\nPRESS SECRETARY KAYLEIGH McENANY: We want an honest, accurate, lawful count. We want maximum sunlight. We want maximum transparency. We want every legal vote to be counted, and we want every illegal vote to be -\n\nNEIL CAVUTO : Whoa, whoa, whoa. I just think we have to be very clear: She's charging the other side of welcoming fraud and welcoming illegal voting. Unless she has more details to back that up, I can't in good countenance continue showing you this.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, after that, Dominion said in its lawsuit that, quote, \"The brand team led by Raj Shah at Fox Corporation notified senior Fox News and Fox Corporation leadership of the 'Brand Threat' posed by Cavuto's action.\" McEnany, by the way, is back hosting now on Fox News. Chris Lehmann, can you lay out what the documents reveal and what they say about Fox News? And particularly talk about the stars of Fox, what Laura Ingraham knew, what Sean Hannity knew, what Tucker Carlson knew, what has been revealed in these emails, and what they would say on the air.\n\nCHRIS LEHMANN : Yeah, I think, you know, the clip you just played is quite revealing, because what Neil Cavuto is doing there is what's known as journalism. He's reporting on facts as he knows them and calling out a, you know, powerful spokesperson in the act of lying. That is fundamentally what, you know, in a perfect world, all journalists should be doing.\n\nWhat's so damning in the Dominion motion is you see again and again all the top talent and the top corporate executives at Fox in one breath acknowledging that they know that the stolen election narrative is a lie, but then tamping down. You know, they cited the Cavuto episode as something they should never do, going forward. And the reason for this is, their viewers, you know, who they've stoked for 25 years on resentment and grievance politics for the right, wanted to be spoonfed some sort of narrative that Donald Trump was denied a second term unjustly. And so, when the news division at Fox and some on-air commentators, like Cavuto, provided contradictory information, they started rising up and going over to Newsmax, which is a bottom-feeding, right-wing network that gleefully aired any and all claims about stolen elections. So Fox was in a meltdown at this moment, because they saw they were losing viewership.\n\nYou know, at one point, Tucker Carlson texted Sean Hannity in a fury, saying, you know, \"Our stock price is going down. Not a joke.\" And, you know, again, it's just not the case that, you know, in a functioning democracy, the primary purpose of journalism should be to boost the stock price of your company. It should be to tell the truth and let the chips fall where they may. You know, there's another sort of cliché about the conduct of journalism, is that it should be done without fear or favor. In the Dominion documents, you see all kinds of fear and all kinds of favor being extended to the Trump administration. So, this is, you know, such a damning moment, where you come to the realization that Fox News, despite its corporate name, is not in fact a news organization. What they are doing is promulgating lies for the sake of maintaining audience share and high profitability.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And we only have about a minute for this segment, but I'm wondering if you could speculate in terms of the potential long-term impact on Fox News as a result of this, and the likelihood that Dominion Systems is going to prevail in this lawsuit.\n\nCHRIS LEHMANN : Yeah, you know, it's very unusual in a defamation case for a motion for summary judgment to be granted, but the evidence is quite overwhelming. So, you know, it's a $1.4 billion suit. Fox, I think, its revenues are north of $14 billion. So it would be a hit. But it's also important to remember that a major corporation like this is going to have libel insurances, is not - you know, what's scary, now that we know that the only calculus that matters for Fox News is the financial one, they could well regard $1.4 billion as an acceptable cost of doing business in the pursuit of greater profit. So, we'll see. I mean, it's definitely damaging to the reputation of the organization and its lead on-air personalities, but, you know, the sad truth of the matter is they did rebound from this moment when they thought there were losing audience share. They are enjoying really robust ratings and healthy profits. So, in the short term, I fear, not a great deal is going to change. Until and unless we get something like the fairness doctrine, which is the whole reason that Fox News was allowed to exist in the first place - the suspension of the fairness doctrine - it's going to be a cancer on our democracy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Chris Lehmann, I want to thank you for being with us, D.C. bureau chief for The Nation . We'll link to your pieces in The Nation at democracynow.org.\n\nNext up, the family of Malcolm X announces plans to sue the CIA , the FBI , New York police and other government agencies over the 1965 assassination.

No, no, that happens. Yeah. People are attacked in their bed by demons,'\" Carlson recounted.\n\nCarlson expressed utter shock about his assistant's revelation while talking to Dreher recalling that his response to her was: \"'What?! What are you even talking about?'\"\n\nCarlson said that although he has \"very low levels of trust for Christian pastors,\" soon after the experience he was \"seized with this very intense desire to read the Bible.\"\n\nHe said that he decided to \"read it and see what's in there myself\" without \"any study aids or anything\" and free of \"other people's opinions.\"\n\n\"So I spent a year and a half reading, and then I started rereading it, and it was a, just a transformative experience for me,\" Carlson said. \"But I'm not, you know, holding myself out as someone from whom you could get theological advice, because I don't know, I don't understand any of it. But yeah, that happened.\"\n\nRegardless of how one may feel after hearing Carlson's story, the implication that Carlson's confrontation with an evil demon prompted him to \"wonder about good\" doesn't exactly check out.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Tucker Carlson Hated Trump 'Passionately.' He Just Endorsed Him At The RNC.\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nMILWAUKEE - In 2021, Tucker Carlson , then the most-watched host on Fox News, made his feelings plain about former President Donald Trump. \"I hate him passionately,\" Carlson wrote in a text message. But on Thursday evening when Carlson, no longer at Fox News, stepped into the spotlight at the Republican National Convention, to some of the biggest cheers of the convention so far, he struck a much different tone.\n\n\"When he stood up after being shot in the face, bloodied, and put his hand up, I thought at that moment that this was a transformation,\" Carlson told the crowd, referring to the attempted assassination of Trump last weekend in Butler, Pennsylvania. \"This was no longer just a man. ... He was no longer just a political party's nominee for president, or a future president. This was the leader of a nation.\"\n\nWhether Carlson underwent a genuine change of heart, or decided to hitch his wagon to the 2024 GOP presidential nominee out of craven opportunism, he is poised to wield tremendous influence over a second Trump administration. When Trump - wearing a bandage over his ear to protect the wound he suffered from a would-be assassin's bullet - made a surprise visit to the convention on Monday, he waved at his adoring fans before making a beeline for Carlson, who was sitting in the stands, to shake his hand. Trump then walked a couple of seats over to greet his new running mate, Sen. JD Vance - a man whom Carlson told Trump to choose as the vice presidential nominee.\n\nThe scene may have offered a preview of Trump's inner circle if he is to win a second term: Vance, a bearded millennial authoritarian , and Carlson, who has spent the past few years producing ugly propaganda.\n\nMere hours before taking the stage at the RNC, Carlson posted a video on X (formerly Twitter) of him conducting a friendly, softball interview with Mike Cernovich , the Pizzagate conspiracist who once said date rape isn't real . The video was produced for the Tucker Carlson Network, the digital media company he founded after being pushed out of Fox News amid a $787.5 million defamation lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems, a company Carlson frequently and falsely blamed for stealing the 2020 election for President Joe Biden.\n\nOn his new network, Carlson has routinely conducted sympathetic interviews with extreme figures, including philosopher Alexander Dugin, an outright fascist - with extensive ties to American white supremacists - who is often described as the \"brain\" behind Russian President Vladimir Putin. Earlier this year, Carlson interviewed Putin himself, laughing along with the suspected war criminal as he held forth on Russian history.\n\nThe same month as the Putin interview, Carlson sat down with Lydia Brimelow, a leader of the white supremacist organization VDare. The pair talked, per the episode description, about how \"mass immigration is completely destroying our country.\" Carlson did not challenge Brimelow during the interview, which received 18 million views on X, with the help of a retweet from the platform's owner, billionaire Elon Musk.\n\nBrimelow's VDare is a hub for propaganda about the \"Great Replacement,\" a conspiracy theory that is one of Carlson's favorite subjects . The Great Replacement, in Carlson's rendering, is the idea that Democrats support lax border enforcement in order to replace white American voters with voters of other races, who would supposedly be more likely to vote for Democrats. It's a conspiracy theory often found in the genocidal screeds of white supremacist mass shooters, but which Carlson nevertheless frequently promoted to his millions of viewers while on Fox News. Per a New York Times analysis , Carlson promoted the Great Replacement in over 400 episodes of his show, often describing non-white immigration as an \"invasion.\"\n\nWhile at Fox News, and as a host on the network's digital channel Fox Nation, Carlson was also a frequent booster of conspiracy theories about the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol, often casting the rioters as American patriots being persecuted by a tyrannical government.\n\nHe produced a whole docuseries , called \"Patriot Purge,\" on the topic for Fox Nation; it was co-directed by Scooter Downey, a filmmaker who previously made films for white supremacists. Some of the talking heads and rioters depicted in the docuseries were white supremacists, though they were never described as such.\n\nCarlson was ultimately pushed out of Fox News as the network grappled with Dominion Voting Systems' defamation lawsuit. During the course of discovery in that lawsuit, Carlson's text messages about Trump were made public, including the one in which he wrote, \"I hate him passionately.\"\n\n\"We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights,\" Carlson wrote another time, after Trump was no longer in the White House, adding: \"I truly can't wait.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

But come on. There really isn't an upside to Trump.\"\n\nPublicly at the time, Carlson was still boosting Trump, just as he did Thursday evening in Milwaukee. Carlson appeared to deliver his remarks extemporaneously, fawning over Trump for more than 10 minutes, eventually even suggesting that God may have saved Trump from the would-be assassin's bullet so that he could lead America into a glorious new future.\n\n\"What's happened over the past month, since the debate, and particularly since Saturday in Butler, I think a lot of people were like, 'What is this?'\" Carlson said. \"This doesn't look like politics. Something bigger is going on. I think even people who don't believe in God are beginning to think, 'Well, maybe there's something to this actually.' And I'm starting to think, it's gonna be OK.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nSeeking to distance himself from rank elitism, Tucker Carlson called conservative luminary William F. Buckley one of the \"great villains of the 20th century.\" He's right - but Carlson himself hasn't broken with Buckley's contempt for the working class.\n\nTucker Carlson speaks at the Turning Point Action conference on July 15, 2023 in West Palm Beach, Florida. (Joe Raedle / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn a recent episode of his show, conservative commentator Ben Shapiro bemoaned the existence of a faction \"on the Right,\" who he said \"sound very much like Noam Chomsky\" and \"very much like Bernie Sanders.\" A flustered Shapiro said he didn't know what to make of this phenomenon \"other than . . . they're just wrong.\"\n\nTo illustrate this alarming development, Shapiro played a clip of former Fox News personality Tucker Carlson being introduced by libertarian podcaster and comedian Dave Smith. At one point in the clip, Smith brings up one of the most prominent figures in the twentieth-century American right: William F. Buckley.\n\nSmith: I view Bill Buckley as one of, like, the great villains of the twentieth century.\n\nCarlson [sounding very excited]: I couldn't agree more .\n\nShapiro seemed offended. \"Tucker's a super-talented broadcaster,\" he said, \"and I think Tucker's a smart guy\" but \"I would love for him to explicate why he thinks Bill Buckley was one of the worst forces of the twentieth century.\"\n\nAs far as I know, Carlson hasn't responded to this request. But I think I know why he might feel the need to distance himself from Buckley's poisonous legacy. Carlson wants to be seen as a populist. He might have even convinced himself that he is one. And acknowledging that he's still one of Buckley's children makes it harder to pull off the act.\n\nRight-wing populists like Carlson are tying themselves in knots to look like anything other than what Buckley was: an unrepentant elitist.\n\nIn his befuddlement over Carlson's Buckley bashing, Shapiro described Buckley as \"the most prominent conservative of the twentieth century.\" That might be an exaggeration - even if he meant \"the most prominent American conservative,\" Buckley was no more \"prominent\" than Ronald Reagan or even Rush Limbaugh . But there's a straightforward case that he was more important . As the founder of National Review magazine, he set the basic parameters of movement conservatism in the United States. And without those parameters in place, we would not have gotten the versions of Reagan and Limbaugh that we did.\n\nLater, Buckley popularized the Right's ideas on PBS's Firing Line , where he often crossed words with left-wing thinkers and activists like Michael Harrington , Noam Chomsky , and even the leaders of the Socialist Workers Party. Given Buckley's politics, it's more than a little ironic that Firing Line is a show that could only have existed on public television, where no one much worried that in-depth conversations about political ideology would bore viewers and cataclysmically result in fewer eyes on the next commercial break. But Buckley deserves credit for routinely exposing his viewers to contrary points of view. More than a few of his successors notoriously lack that courage.\n\nBuckley's ideology itself was a fusion of social traditionalism, Cold War militarism, and enthusiasm about the \"free market.\" His first book, God and Man at Yale (1951), was devoted in large part to attacking Yale University (his alma mater ) for hiring professors he suspected of atheism, socialism, or both.\n\nConservative books about campus politics published in more recent decades tend to position themselves as defenses of free debate in what the authors describe as a stifling atmosphere of progressive ideological conformity. God and Man at Yale , on the other hand, is quite openly a plea for conservative ideological conformity. Buckley wanted Yale to fire all the Godless and/or Red professors - and you don't have to read the book all that closely to realize that even Keynesian economics professors were far too \"socialist\" for him. He even suggested that the Yale Alumni Association be empowered to veto new hires on ideological grounds.\n\nBuckley was a man whose contempt for ordinary people was unabashed - and my guess is that this is why Carlson wants to distance himself from Buckley's legacy now. If Buckley didn't even trust ultraprivileged Yale students around ideas that hadn't been vetted by ideological censors, how do you think he felt about the working class?\n\nIn 1965, Buckley went to the Cambridge Union to debate James Baldwin on the proposition \"The American dream is at the expense of the American Negro.\" At one point , Buckley acknowledged that of course racism could be unpleasant - but, he rhetorically asked, what did Baldwin want white people to do about it? A heckler made an obvious suggestion: \"You could let them vote in Mississippi.\" Buckley's \"witty\" response revealed everything about the way he saw the world:\n\nWhat is wrong in Mississippi, sir, is not that not enough negroes are voting but that too many white people are voting.\n\nTranslated from Buckley's polite and formal style, that's, Oh, don't worry. I hate poor people of all races.\n\nIt's clear enough why Carlson might not want to be associated with this legacy: his whole schtick is that he does care about ordinary people. Buckley presumably would have loved to restrict the right to vote to people who could flash their Yale diploma (or their country club membership card) when they got to the polling place - and, in his languorous and half-ironic way, Buckley had no problem saying that.\n\nCarlson, on the other hand, claims to hate the \"elites.\" He says he's all about \"the working class.\" But, is he ?\n\nThere was a time not long ago when Carlson made no such claims. As Shapiro pointed out in the segment we started with, \"Tucker might not like National Review now\" but \"he certainly liked writing for them back in the '90s.\"\n\nEven in the early 2000s, Tucker cohosted Crossfire along with fellow conservative Robert Novack and their deeply mediocre liberal counterparts James Carville and Paul Begala. I sometimes caught the show back then, and I can't remember Carlson pretending to be anything but a straight-down-the-line George W. Bush Republican.\n\nI can vividly recall Carlson and Begala arguing about Bush's policy of \"indefinite detention\" of suspected terrorists. Begala's centrist view was that they should be neither indefinitely detained nor allowed access to the real judicial system but instead tried in regular military courts. Carlson was all for \"indefinite\" legal limbo.\n\nBack then, he supported the war in Iraq. In a repulsive bit of leaked audio that came out much later, he once even called Iraqis \"semiliterate primitive monkeys\" who should \"shut up and obey\" the United States because they \"can't govern themselves.\" By 2009, he'd moved away from these neoconservative roots to become not a right-wing \"populist,\" but a libertarian. That was the year he became a senior fellow at the Cato Institute, a free-market fundamentalist think tank.\n\nHe had by then become a critic of the Iraq War, and I do think that some of his post-neocon evolution has been genuine. He's defended Julian Assange's right to publish information the United States finds embarrassing, for example, and that really is a significant shift from any position you could imagine Carlson taking in the early 2000s. Even there, though, his evolution has been uneven. As I noted back in April when Carlson lost his show on Fox :\n\nEven now, that evolution away from neoconservatism is incomplete. Carlson often talks like a critic of the military-industrial complex when he discusses America's global rivalry with Russia - a right-wing isolationist critic rather than a left-wing internationalist one, but a critic nonetheless. Compare, for instance, Carlson's segment pushing back against the idea that we should \"hate\" warmongering Russian president Vladimir Putin with the attitude of socialist leader Eugene V. Debs, who went to jail for his fiery speech opposing US entry into World War I - but took it for granted that he should also denounce the German kaiser and show solidarity with his antiwar comrades in Germany.\n\nBut . . . when it comes to America's global rivalry with China, Carlson switches gears and becomes the biggest booster of the military-industrial complex. He's suggested that America should be doing more to build up a \"strong military and, yes, a strong CIA\" to counter the Chinese threat. Connecting the two subjects, he's said that \"our main enemy is China\" and that \"the US ought to be in a relationship with Russia, allied against China.\"\n\nIf Tucker's evolution away from the views he held when he was writing for the National Review has been incomplete even on questions where you'd expect a Cato Institute libertarian to be better than a standard conservative, what about the issues where you would expect a \"populist\" to be better than a Cato Institute libertarian? He certainly isn't a cultural \"libertarian\" and doesn't pretend to be one; his posture on these matters is that he defends wholesome middle-American values against cosmopolitan degenerates. But what about opposition to the economic agenda of the elite - the actual, literal elite, defined in terms of access to wealth and economic power, not just people whose values can be rhetorically dismissed as \"elitist?\"\n\nIt's exactly here, at the economic core of the worldview Carlson inherited from Buckley, where the alleged transformation is most empty. Does he support a higher minimum wage? A stronger labor movement? Medicare for All? Universal childcare? Nope, nope, nope, and nope.\n\nWhat Carlson does now that he didn't in National Review or on Crossfire or in his time at the Cato Institute is find a way to weave \"populist\" concerns into the way he talks about many of the issues. In 2019, when J. D. Vance came on Carlson's show to tell him that the phenomenon of some Democrats now endorsing Medicare for All wasn't really a \"lurch to the left\" but a gift to \"the professional class\" because Medicare for All would mean that the government was paying doctors, Carlson didn't roll his eyes. He told Vance that this idea, which he'd never \"considered\" before, was \"fascinating.\" He seemed to embrace Vance's general premise that left-wing ideas are all schemes to benefit middle-class professionals. (Reality check: doctors' salaries are unusually high in the United States and would probably go down a bit if we adopted an egalitarian system like Medicare for All, which would guarantee everyone access to health care.)\n\nSimilarly, when Carlson resists the idea of a $15 minimum wage, he doesn't outright say, \"Employers' property rights are sacred, so they shouldn't have to pay one penny more than the wages people are desperate enough to accept.\" He says he can't support it because it would be bad for ordinary people who own small businesses - never mind that the end-of-the-day consequence is that the sixty million Americans who work for small businesses won't secure a living wage.\n\nCarlson has come to find unvarnished presentations of his economic beliefs embarrassing, and he does his best to add some varnish. But he has yet to sever his Buckley-ite ideological inheritance where it counts.\n\nBy analogy: You might find your father embarrassing. You might never call and never visit. You might deny being related to the old guy if anyone asks. But he's still your dad.\n\nBen Burgis is a Jacobin columnist, an adjunct philosophy professor at Rutgers University, and the host of the YouTube show and podcast Give Them An Argument .

Their conversation revealed the utter insincerity of their branding as opponents of the elite and the military-industrial complex.\n\nDonald Trump and Tucker Carlson attend a golf tournament in Bedminster, New Jersey, July 2022.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tucker Carlson asked Donald Trump if Jeffrey Epstein killed himself. It was a potentially explosive moment. Before being reduced to hosting streams on Twitter - sorry, \"X\" - Carlson was the biggest personality on Fox News. And he was asking a former president of the United States to weigh in on whether a wealthy sex trafficker, notoriously connected to a long string of famous names, including Trump himself, may have been murdered to stop him from spilling powerful people's secrets. How would Trump react?\n\nCarlson: Do you think Epstein killed himself - sincerely?\n\nTrump: I don't know. I will say he was a fixture in Palm Beach. . .\n\nTrump went on to say that Epstein probably did kill himself, before pivoting to his favorite subject: his claim to have won the 2020 election. Both men politely pretended not to know that Carlson had derided that narrative in text messages that have long since become public.\n\n\"I will say he was a fixture in Palm Beach\" was one of many bizarre moments in the forty-six-minute interview Trump gave as an alternative to attending the first GOP debate. Mostly, Trump rambled and Carlson let him. Occasionally, Carlson tried to inject a moment of drama - by asking about Epstein, or by pushing Trump to take seriously the idea that \"the Left\" was going to assassinate him or start a civil war. But Trump never quite took the bait.\n\nBoth men's friends and supporters have spent the last several years portraying them as edgy populists, enemies of the ruling class and the military-industrial complex. In the conversation on Wednesday, though, neither of them pretended to be much of anything but what they are: the former CEO of a world-spanning empire trying to get his job back, and a media clown whose two goals were to create viral moments and flatter Trump.\n\nChatting with his court jester instead of going to the debate in Milwaukee was an arrogant and antidemocratic decision - much like President Joe Biden's parallel decision not to debate his challengers for the Democratic nomination. Depressingly, it now looks like Biden and Trump may not even debate each other in the general election.\n\nIn skipping the debate, Trump was merely acting like the calculating politician he is, knowing he has a big lead and not wanting to square off against other candidates in case the voters decide someone else came out on top. Safeguarding himself from that process is hard to reconcile with his original image from 2016 as a fearlessly unfiltered bomb thrower. On paper, though, his decision to stay away from Milwaukee could have had a populist edge to it - like, \"Instead of doing a boring debate with a bunch of political hacks, here's Trump sitting down with his fellow antiwar populist Tucker Carlson to have a Real Conversation.\"\n\nThis, after all, is the image both men have carefully cultivated for themselves. In 2016, Trump ran as a different kind of Republican, promising not to cut entitlements and evincing a deep concern for laid-off workers in places like Youngstown, Ohio. And Carlson convinced a lot of people, even some who were appropriately repulsed by his demagoguery about immigrants, that he genuinely cared about American workers.\n\nIn reality, Trump governed like a regular Republican, cutting taxes for rich people, weakening workplace safety regulations, going after Medicaid and food stamps, and filling the National Labor Relations Board with hard-core union busters . The jobs he promised would come back didn't. He was a president for the 1 percent. And Carlson's populist rhetoric never matched his political positions , either, when the rubber hit the road. When the two of them sat down together on Wednesday, economic questions were simply absent.\n\nAs Branko Marcetic has noted , the candidates in Milwaukee were unanimous in calling to \"slash spending, gut entitlements, shrink government, bust unions, and cut taxes for the rich - all while maintaining current funding for the cartoonishly large US military.\" If the front-runner disagrees with any of those prescriptions, people who watched the stream on \"X\" didn't get a chance to find out. Carlson didn't bring them up.\n\nWhat about the other half of the \"antiwar populist\" image - the \"antiwar\" half? As a candidate in 2016, Trump retroactively criticized the Iraq War and ricocheted at random between sounding isolationist notes and promising to \"bomb the hell\" out of America's enemies and torture the families of suspected terrorists. As far as we know, he didn't fulfill his family torture promise, but his record in office was far closer to the warmongering half of his campaign rhetoric than the antiwar half. Trump doubled the rate of drone strikes in Yemen, tightened sanctions on Cuba, tore up the nuclear deal with Iran, assassinated Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, and sent heavy weaponry to Ukraine that Barack Obama had rejected as too escalatory.\n\nIn his chat with Tucker, the only real hint of bragging about any sort of antiwar record came when Trump patted himself on the back for meeting with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un - thus, he said, preventing nuclear war. He glossed over the fact that nothing concrete came out of those meetings. Neither the United States nor North Korea has even made a \"no first use\" pledge on nuclear weapons. And even while touting this dubious accomplishment, Trump couldn't stop himself from reminding the audience that these meetings, at best, deescalated tensions that he himself had heightened . \"The press said,\" Trump said, slipping into an impression of a stuffy journalist, \" He said nice things about Kim Jong Un . Well, I also said horrible things - in the beginning.\"\n\nEven when criticizing the CIA as part of his general critique of the \"deep state\" being politically aligned against him, Trump felt the need to emphasize that he'd used the CIA to kill lots and lots of people. Bad people, he insisted, dangerous people - although it's worth remembering that the rest of us have to take his word for it, since it's not like the public is generally allowed to see the evidence against victims of CIA assassinations.\n\nAfter Trump mentioned the Soleimani assassination, Carlson reminded the former president that he was sharing the glory with the CIA for his own accomplishment - something Trump never wants to do. The former president quickly corrected himself. \"Really,\" he said, \"that was us.\"\n\nAll of this is about Trump's past militarism, though. Perhaps he plans to be more of a dove if he gets a second term?\n\nHe did repeat his claim that he'd support peace negotiations in Ukraine. This would be quite a bit of a reversal given Trump's record in office, both on Ukraine in particular and on US-Russia relations in general, but I suppose it's possible that he'd be true to his word if he returned to office. I hope so.\n\nOn the other hand, when it comes to (a) US policy in Latin America and (b) the other great-power conflict in the world today, the one between the United States and China, Trump's message was very different. He and Carlson talked about allegations about Chinese military bases in Cuba, and, ominously, both agreed that this shouldn't be \"allowed.\" What mechanism, you might wonder, would a second Trump administration employ to disallow it? Neither he nor Carlson ever quite said.\n\nCiting US officials, the Wall Street Journal has claimed that China and Cuba have negotiated about hosting joint military training on the island. The United States has also alleged a Chinese \"spy base\" in Cuba. Carlson and Trump seemed to be going further, suggesting secret plans to permanently station Chinese troops on the island.\n\nIndignantly, Tucker asked, \"Why is China allowed to conduct imperialism in our hemisphere?\" Presumably, only we should be allowed to \"conduct imperialism\" in what is after all \"our\" hemisphere. Trump agreed that this was outrageous, said it was a problem \"all over Latin America\" and not just in Cuba, and started rambling about the history of the Panama Canal.\n\nOf course, the United States has a vast, globe-spanning network of military bases whose existence no one denies. Some are about as close to China as Cuba is to the United States. And whether or not it ever takes the form of a permanent Chinese military base, Cuba's obvious motivation for military cooperation with China isn't that it dreams of some Red Dawn scenario in which Cuba threatens the United States but precisely the opposite.\n\nThe United States sponsored an invasion of Cuba six decades ago at the Bay of Pigs, and since then has maintained crippling economic sanctions as well as sponsoring terrorism on the island. Of course Cuba wants a great-power patron to help protect it against future US aggression. One would think a couple of \"antiwar populists\" would want to deescalate the whole situation by lifting the US embargo and completing the process President Obama started of normalizing relations with Cuba. If they're concerned about bases, there's no reason future US-Cuba-China diplomacy couldn't involve the US closing some of its bases around the world in exchange for winding down any forms of China-Cuba security cooperation it finds objectionable.\n\nInstead, interspersed with his rambling reflections about all the people who were killed by \"the mosquito\" in the process of building the Panama Canal - and how appalling he found it that President Jimmy Carter relinquished permanent US control of the canal - President Trump ominously noted that Cuban \"exiles\" in South Florida wouldn't like it if the US continued to allow Chinese-Cuban military cooperation because \"that means they'll never be able to go back.\"\n\nGot that? Antiwar Tucker Carlson is concerned about sole US control over \"our hemisphere\" being violated, and antiwar Donald Trump dreams of sponsoring a counterrevolution in Cuba after taking some unspecified action by which he would not \"allow\" Chinese bases there.\n\nIf these are the doves, we don't need hawks.\n\nBen Burgis is a Jacobin columnist, an adjunct philosophy professor at Rutgers University, and the host of the YouTube show and podcast Give Them An Argument .

But every time there's a fight over something that might actually make life easier for working-class people, he never misses the opportunity to take the side of big business and the rich.\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson discusses \"Populism and the Right\" during the National Review Institute's Ideas Summit in Washington, DC, March 29, 2019.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe United States is a country where the lives and working conditions of the average person are shaped by business and oligarchy to a unique extent. US workers lack the benefits and protections that most of the world takes for granted. They pay some of the world's highest prices for medicine and health care , in a system that leaves them sicker and financially devastated . And their communities are plagued by exceptionally high rates of poverty , debt , homelessness , and deaths of despair .\n\nOver the past ten months, we saw a series of political battles over fixing or at least alleviating some of this - battles over raising the minimum wage, lowering drug prices, or keeping people housed in a pandemic, to name a few. They were battles that someone with one of the most watched cable news shows on TV could, in theory, have influenced for the benefit of working Americans.\n\nSo what has Tucker Carlson, the so-called right-wing populist who's taken to criticizing corporate America, championing the working class, and calling for an economic system that puts people before markets, had to say about all of this?\n\nThe answer is remarkably little.\n\nWatching Carlson's show means wading through an ocean of passionate, angry screeds taking aim at all sorts of the usual right-wing bugaboos: mask and vaccine mandates, immigrants and refugees, critical race theory, crime, wokeness, trans people, and so on. What you won't find - despite the host's preferred self-image as a tribune of the downtrodden working stiff - is discussion of any of the pocketbook issues immediately pressing to most working Americans, whatever their backgrounds - the kind of issues you'd expect an actual populist would be focused on.\n\nTo be fair, over the past year, Carlson has, on occasion, discussed some of the major economic questions confronting the country. He just happened to take the side of employers and the rich on every one of them.\n\nTake expanded unemployment insurance, a pathbreaking policy that actually began under Donald Trump, and which lowered US poverty , kept families afloat in a once-in-a-century crisis, gave many low-wage workers their first taste of a halfway decent living standard , and allowed them the breathing room to get off the hamster wheel and rethink their careers and life paths.\n\nNot to Carlson. Despite his show's paeans to the working class, he is firmly opposed to the measure, complaining in May that the government was paying people \"up to $700 a month not to work\" and blaming it for the country's labor shortage - a claim repeated endlessly by corporate executives and neoliberal pundits , but one that facts on the ground consistently showed was untrue . (Even his fans were wise to this nonsense, with one commenting, \"Who can live on 700 a month. Not a great point Sir. The rest was well said!\")\n\nCarlson hasn't run this segment again but has repeatedly gestured at it, vaguely blaming \"their policies\" for a continuing labor shortage without going into specifics. Fortunately for Carlson, Republican governors did as he wished , ending the expanded insurance early, as did Joe Biden, not bothering to try and extend the program.\n\nWhat about the $15 minimum wage, then? Carlson might not want people to get money while they're out of work, but surely he'd want them to get paid decently when they go back. And surveys show this is a policy with cross-party support, with more voters in solid-red Florida backing the wage raise this past November than either presidential candidate.\n\nYou'd be mistaken. When the Democrats were briefly pretending in February to want to enact a $15 federal minimum wage, Carlson opened his segment by citing a Congressional Budget Office report charging it would cause the loss of over a million jobs, and suggested the policy was a corporate plot against small enterprises, as \"these big businesses would actually be in favor of a higher minimum wage if they thought it would drive their competitors out of business.\"\n\n\"I mean, this is pretty much the last thing after a year of Covid and riots that small businesses need right now, is it not?\" Carlson asked his guest.\n\nThat guest, by the way, wasn't one of the tens of millions of workers trying to get by on the poverty wages paid by American employers, who Carlson waxes poetic about occasionally. It was hedge fund manager and former Dick Cheney advisor Neil Patel, who quickly concurred with his former college roommate by insisting that \"the huge multinational companies that dominate Washington\" were \"mostly for\" the policy.\n\nPatel called for minimum-wage policy to be segregated by size of employer - $20 or more for big ones, $10 or less for small ones - and by geography. (Of course, many months later, Carlson would crinkle his brow and yowl about how those very people in the middle he'd supported poverty wages for were being hard done by price rises ).\n\n\"That's such a smart point that I've heard from nobody else: $30 minimum wage for Amazon warehouse workers, no minimum wage for the dry cleaner on your block,\" Carlson told his guest. \"I love that.\"\n\nToo bad if you're one of the nearly 60 million Americans working for a small business - Tucker Carlson's brand of economic populism doesn't apply to you.\n\nWhat about the eviction ban, another Trump policy that Joe Biden inherited and had to be strong-armed into making even a token attempt to fight for? At that point, millions of Americans were at risk of eviction, at a point when the pandemic was killing a thousand people a day .\n\nYou will not be shocked to learn Carlson's main concern was the landlords set to throw these people out on the street. \"Tenants are no longer required to pay their rent,\" howled Carlson, raging that the government had \"decided to nationalize America's rental properties\" ( if only ), and attacking \"Sandy Cortez and the Squad\" for not calling for a mortgage moratorium they in fact had called for several times - because \"the banks are huge Democratic donors,\" as he explained. \"It is property owners who will suffer.\"\n\nAffordable housing, then? This is a time when not only are half a million Americans homeless but tens of millions paying more than 30 percent of their income on housing, with much of it centered on California .\n\nWrong again. In September, Carlson attacked a pair of bills signed by California governor Gavin Newsom to encourage more multifamily housing as a way to deal with the state's out-of-control affordability issues, but which Carlson charged would \"abolish the suburbs.\" Carlson had finally found something he could agree with the wealthy coastal elites on: keeping poor and middle-income people unhoused and out of the high-priced, single-family-home neighborhoods that profited from a tighter housing market.\n\n\"How is this improving anyone's life?\" asked Carlson. \"It won't. It means demolishing homes to put up rental units.\"\n\nThere are legitimate criticisms of the bills, some of which Carlson actually latched on to - namely that they're largely an expansion of market-rate housing that may not do all that much for housing affordability. And he was right that they'll benefit the developers who give big to Newsom's campaign. But it's telling that Carlson's main gripe isn't this but that the state's idyllic, suburban-style neighborhoods will now have more higher density rental units. Predictably, he had nothing to say when Newsom sided with his developer friends to kill a push for rent control last year.\n\nOkay, but what about the sprawling, Bernie Sanders-authored reconciliation bill the Democrats spent months half-heartedly trying to pass? Once upon a time, before the party caved to corporate interests, that bill had all manner of provisions that someone interested in the economic security of American families would support: expanding Medicare to cover more people and treatments, letting the program negotiate for lower drug prices, free community college, and universal childcare and pre-K, to name a few. But for months, a blade dangled over these programs' future, care of corporate Democrats like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. Surely Carlson would have used his considerable platform to push back, no?\n\nBy this point, you probably won't be surprised to learn Carlson barely even mentioned the bill or any of these individual provisions. In fact, the only times Carlson has talked about the bill have been to vehemently oppose it. Back in April, he issued the standard neoliberal talking point that the bill wasn't about physical infrastructure but about \"social engineering,\" and that the viewer would have to pay for it through tax hikes, because \"Biden wants to just punish you.\" The latter argument was especially curious, since at that point the only tax hike announced was one on corporations , which two-thirds of Americans supported . But it does suggest who Carlson's actually talking to in these segments.\n\nOnce again, Carlson squared the circle of pretending to champion the working class while opposing policies it would benefit from, all by simply pretending those policies were something else - a \"race-based redistribution plan,\" as he put it in April. Later, in September, with many of the bill's most important provisions under threat from a full-scale corporate assault, Carlson simply didn't bother talking about them at all, instead zeroing in his outrage on one line that mandates fines for businesses with unvaccinated workers.\n\nThere is one other key to Carlson's opposition to these bills. It's not totally accurate to say Carlson never really talks about pocketbook issues because, when it comes to both these bills and other instances, Carlson has spent this year obsessed with government spending and its supposed contribution to current inflation woes. \"Two trillion dollars sounds like a lot for anything,\" he said in April. \"Won't that kind of spending cause hyperinflation?\"\n\nIn reality, the inflation we're seeing is happening all over the world , a product of a web of pandemic-driven supply chain disruptions and interruptions in global fossil fuel production. But blaming government spending is the favorite pastime of neoliberals determined to make this economic recovery as lopsided as the last one - neoliberals like Larry Summers, the chief architect of Barack Obama's bank-friendly economic recovery, who Carlson now cites for his complaints about federal spending. \"No government in the history of the world has ever spent more money than Joe Biden is spending right now,\" Carlson has said , echoing the complaints of Wall Street hucksters like Steve Rattner.\n\nA frequent target of Carlson's, to illustrate the disconnect between politicians and the Americans hurt by inflation, is gas prices, usually a pivot point from which to demand favors for the fossil fuel industry (on behalf of their workers, of course). Yet while Carlson is consistently furious about the hurt that higher gas prices inflict on people, he's had absolutely nothing to say on the far more exorbitant cost surges that routinely gouge and bankrupt Americans - of skyrocketing drug prices or from the privatized, insurance-dominated health sector.\n\nCarlson seems just fine with those: he's called Medicare for All \"demented\" for growing the size of government, longing instead for the days when politicians simply talked about \"who can run the country most efficiently.\" Nor has Carlson ever said anything about the embattled PRO Act that would have helped workers unionize, despite his claims to support the workers of union-busting multinationals like Amazon.\n\nSo let's review. Tucker Carlson's economic populism consists of\n\nCarlson, in other words, is an exponent of the same shopworn neoliberal ideology that's dominated the two major US parties for the last forty years at least. He's an \"economic populist\" as long as that term means slipping in terms like \"working class\" here or there, or throwing out lines that suggest a vague animosity to banks and big business from time to time. But if it means supporting any of the actual policies that would make a meaningful difference to people's pocketbooks? Forget it.\n\nHats off to him, though. Like his old friend and fellow cable news celebrity Rachel Maddow, Carlson is a skilled television performer who's perfected a formula to emotionally manipulate his audience. Both anchors have defended themselves in court by explaining that no reasonable person actually believes the things they're saying on air - a lucrative bit of fraud that nets each of them millions of dollars a year .\n\nHis shtick is the bread and butter of business-friendly politicians: divide the working class on fault lines of race and cultural issues, and package a defense of the interests of business and the wealthy in lazily pseudopopulist terms, so that the \"haves\" who watch you feel like they're the put-upon little guy, and the \"have-nots\" think you're on their side.\n\nBut as we've seen with Carlson's coverage this year, sooner or later you have to take a side on an issue. Siding with the rich and powerful once might be an exception. When you do it again and again, maybe you're just another corporate stooge.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

But his hostility to the politics of solidarity remains intact.\n\nIllustration by James Clapham\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\n\"Working-class people of all colors have a lot more in common, infinitely more in common with each other than they do with some overpaid MSNBC anchor. And if you were allowed to think about that for long enough, you might start to get unauthorized ideas about economics, and that would be disruptive to a very lucrative status quo.\"\n\nOn the face of it, here is a clarion call for solidarity of the working class, an exhortation to reject racial and cultural animosity and stand shoulder to shoulder against economic elites. It's reminiscent of the words of Frederick Douglass, who wrote that the Southern landed elite \"secured their ascendency over both the poor whites and the blacks by putting enmity between them. They divided both to conquer each.\"\n\nBut there's a problem. The passage above was delivered by Tucker Carlson, the same Tucker Carlson who has said on Fox News that immigrants make America \"poorer and dirtier.\" The same Tucker Carlson who recently responded to Representative Ilhan Omar's condemnations of American militarism by saying that Omar should be grateful her Muslim Somali refugee family was allowed into the country. He went on to say that her ingratitude was proof the United States should do more to either make immigrants assimilate or stop \"importing people from places whose values are simply antithetical to ours.\"\n\nIt's not hard to prove that Carlson is full of shit. In fact, it's pretty easy. But alongside the hateful nonsense, his populist rhetoric speaks to real anger at the status quo - and the combination seems to be resonating with people who could potentially be won over to the Left.\n\nEven if we conclude that Carlson is insincere and manipulative, it's worth trying to identify what exactly it is that he's manipulating in the first place.\n\nTucker Carlson is the second most popular cable news host in the country. His show on Fox News draws about 3 million viewers per night. If you've tuned in at all recently, you've noticed that Carlson has made a major departure from the conservative economic consensus. He rails against not just liberal cosmopolitan elites - standard fare for the conservative punditry - but indeed the wealthy and powerful more generally. He even dares to question capitalism by name - previously unthinkable for a Fox News host. \"Republican leaders will have to acknowledge that market capitalism is not a religion,\" he said recently. \"You'd have to be a fool to worship it.\"\n\nHis unorthodox perspective has rankled other conservatives, including the National Review 's David French, who, in an essay titled \"The Right Should Reject Tucker Carlson's Victimhood Populism,\" argued that conser­vatives must not impress on people \"falsehoods about the power of governments or banks or elites over their personal destinies.\" In French's view, Carlson is veering perilously into the left lane, chalking individual success and well-being up to politics rather than personal responsibility and virtue.\n\nThe destruction wrought by economic and political elites is the theme of Carlson's latest book, Ship of Fools : How a Selfish Ruling Class Is Bringing America to the Brink of Revolution . A few months after its publication, he summed up its thesis on air, saying, \"Our leaders don't care. We are ruled by mercenaries who feel no long-term obligation to the people they rule. They're day traders. Substitute teachers. They're just passing through. They have no skin in this game, and it shows. They can't solve our problems. They don't even bother to understand our problems.\"\n\nYet Carlson's rhetoric is also shot through with nationalism and xenophobia. Economic elites, he says, are engaged in a conspiracy of \"demographic replacement.\" As he put it during one recent episode, \"Our plan here in the West is to just let the depressed people die off and replace them with people from other countries.\"\n\nImmigrants are interlopers, Carlson tells his viewers, and they are coming to take your jobs and destroy your quality of life. Are you unemployed or underpaid? That's because it's \"easier to import foreign labor to take the place of native-born Americans who are slipping behind.\" Does the American Dream seem to be slipping through your fingers? That's because the \"American piñata has been getting pummeled for decades and now it has finally come apart. Our national wealth is up for grabs by whomever gets here first, and they are coming.\"\n\nOf course, those who are coming are mostly nonwhite. And the Fox News host is keen to paint them as inclined to criminality, saying for example , \"If you're in our country illegally, a single crime is too many. I mean, talk about adding outrage to insult. Already breaking our laws, and then committing crimes.\"\n\nContrary to his own sound advice, Carlson is \"whipping up a racial frenzy\" that divides the working class and forecloses on a strategy to actually improve wages and living standards for all workers.\n\nWhat should we make of Carlson's hypocrisy? As political scientist Adolph Reed once said , \"Ideology is the mechanism that harmonizes the principles that you want to believe you hold with what advances your interests in the world.\" Simply put, Carlson is a cultural reactionary at heart, but in a moment of growing working-class discontent, economic populism is the key to his phenomenal success. He'd be dumb not to make the switch.\n\nCarlson wasn't always a bleeding heart for the suffering native-born American worker. Until relatively recently, he was a bow-tie-wearing libertarian who, like French, sneered at the implication that the United States is not the land of plenty. In a 2012 interview with Highbrow Magazine he spoke of \"poverty and instability\" as \"something that we don't have in this country,\" concluding flatly that \"nobody's poor in America.\" Nor was he always so careful to disavow racism, calling Iraqis \"semiliterate primitive monkeys\" in 2008.\n\nHe emerged from his chrysalis a right populist only after Donald Trump's election. That's because Carlson learned the correct lessons from Trump's victory - that an antiestablishment hunger has been growing, and that the Democratic Party is uninterested in satiating it. By speaking to the real economic concerns of working people, the Right can outflank the center. It doesn't matter if they follow through; Donald Trump hasn't. The point is to make people feel heard, to channel their demoralization and pain for political gain by marrying vague economic heterodoxy to hard-line social reaction.\n\nYou have been forgotten by elites, Carlson says. You have been forgotten in favor of immigrants.\n\nThis message is tailor-made for his audience. \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" airs on Fox News, which has the most conservative and whitest audience of any cable news channel, but also the poorest. Nearly two-thirds of Fox News viewers make less than $75,000 a year, and a third make less than $30,000 a year. Some Carlson viewers are just along for the culture-war ride, relishing the opportunity to hear him call Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \"a moron, and nasty, and more self-righteous than any televangelist who ever preached a sermon on cable access.\" But Ocasio-Cortez is known for sermonizing against economic inequality, which has a natural appeal for someone struggling to pay bills. Carlson reaches a settlement with them, allowing that Ocasio-Cortez has a point that the \"economy at its core is badly distorted.\"\n\nSince he began to admonish economic elites, Carlson's career has taken flight. And that's because his message is suitably responsive to the political reality. Since the recession, the nation has been gripped by a populist mood, but earlier attempts to reconcile conservative ideology with that mood ran aground. The Tea Party slid into ideological chaos, its libertarianism and commitment to small government proving incompatible with the reality of a deteriorating quality of life.\n\nThe populist mood persisted and found expression on the Left. There was Occupy Wall Street. There was Black Lives Matter. And then, most fearsome of all, there was the Bernie Sanders campaign, with its unexpectedly popular message of democratic socialism - even in Fox country. It was up to a few clever conservatives to rethink the movement's strategy. The smartest among them have always known that conservatism's long-term survival hinges on preventing the working-class portion of its base from heeding the siren song of the Left.\n\nEnter Donald Trump, a man apart. A billionaire, yes, but one who had little reverence for the stodgy experts whose graphs proved the struggling worker was a loser worthy of his lot. Trump spoke of the need to stay out of costly and stupid military adventures while people back home struggled to put food on the table. He promised to stop trade deals that bled jobs from whole regions, leaving husks of towns beleaguered by poverty and drug addiction and engulfed in gloom.\n\nThe conservative establishment insisted that this carnage was inevitable and fair. In 2016, in the heat of the presidential primary, the National Review published an article that read, \"The truth about these dysfunctional, downscale communities is that they deserve to die. Economically, they are negative assets.\" The article further taunted their denizens, saying, \"Donald Trump's speeches make them feel good. So does OxyContin.\" Liberals, for their part, said many times over that working-class Trump supporters got what they deserved - that economic distress was the deplorables' punishment for their gullibility and congenital racism.\n\nIn this climate, Trump, an obscenely wealthy real-estate and entertainment magnate from New York City, miraculously emerged as an anti-elitist - and once Bernie Sanders was out of the running, the only anti-elitist on offer. Trump legitimated people's perception that they were being screwed and also, for more than a few, indulged their cultural prejudices. Those liberals who have mocked the idea that \"economic anxiety\" played a role in the election outcome, declaring that the term is little more than a sneaky euphemism for racism, are missing that the Trump campaign artfully interwove those two dis-tinct forces. Here, albeit in clumsy packaging, was the winning formula. And win it did, rescuing the conservative ship despite the GOP's own best efforts to sink it.\n\nCarlson was paying close attention.\n\nAt its core, Carlson's nativist rhetoric is a powerful weapon against a social-democratic agenda. Sandwiched between monologues about unaccountable aristocrats, Carlson warns viewers that immigrants \"stream north to America's generous welfare state,\" crossing borders in search of \"free healthcare, free education, subsidized housing, food stamps.\" He accuses them of \"plunder.\"\n\nNever mind that immigrant workers, including most undocumented immigrants, do pay taxes to fund the programs they use - with even more paying into programs like Social Security ($13 billion) and Medicare ($3 billion) that they themselves never get to use, subsidizing them for everyone else.\n\nThroughout the history of modern capitalism, this rhyming couplet of manufactured scarcity and social contempt has been integral to defeating progressive reform movements and eviscerating social safety nets. If it's not immigrants sponging off the system, it's black people on welfare or homeless people with free Obama phones. The message is always that a robust welfare state is a giveaway to undesirables, whoever that may be at the moment, and is best avoided so as not to encourage their laziest, greediest tendencies.\n\nIt's impossible to ascertain how much of Carlson's own economic populist rhetoric he believes, given the vast array of motives that might be driving his ideological shift. In the end, it hardly matters. What's important is that he represents the canny adjustment of the conservative project to the realities of the present moment - replaying the old Gingrich- and Bush-era classics wouldn't get them anywhere with the public today.\n\nWhat Carlson is responding to is a groundswell of dissatisfaction with the neoliberal established order, amorphous but indisputably powerful. The Left must respond to it, too.\n\nThis means, among other things, that we can't simply camp out on the other side of the culture wars, firing live rounds at opponents who ought to be on our side and considering that sufficient. Like Tucker Carlson on his better days, we must insist that working-class people have more in common with one another than with economic elites, no matter our differences. And then, quite unlike Carlson, we must decline to viciously scape-goat people who belong in that coalition, opting instead to invite them into shared struggle on the basis of that common interest.\n\nMeagan Day is a staff writer at Jacobin .

(Fox News)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLittle time elapsed between the abrupt exit of fake populist Tucker Carlson from his perch at Fox News and the publication of paeans to his supposedly heterodox coverage, especially on US foreign policy.\n\nIt's true Carlson was one of the few voices in corporate media who allowed occasional on-air criticism of the military-industrial complex, injected any dissenting opinions about Washington's strategy regarding the Ukraine war, and rais ed concerns about nuclear war (even as his coverage has also at times veered explicitly into \"root[ing] for Russia,\" as the host once put it). Astoundingly, Carlson may be the singular person responsible for stopping Donald Trump from starting an idiotic war with Iran four years ago.\n\nThe fact that it fell to Carlson of all people - a former CIA aspirant , Iraq War supporter , and someone who once called the brutalized people of that country \"semiliterate primitive monkeys\" who \"can't govern themselves\" - to make these commonsense points on TV speaks more to the stunted conformity of corporate news coverage than Carlson's political virtue.\n\nBut the fixation on this small handful of deviations from Washington orthodoxy seems to have caused a collective bout of amnesia about something arguably far more important: the way Carlson has used his top-rated, highly influential show for years to push the US public and policymakers into a needless and disastrous conflict with China, a mirror image of the anti-Russia hawkishness the TV host criticizes elsewhere.\n\nIt's a vision that, thanks in large part to Carlson's efforts, has now become the new elite Washington orthodoxy - a remarkable achievement for a self-styled populist who claimed to be taking on the ruling class.\n\nCarlson's dissenting line on Ukraine policy has to be understood in light of his obsession with fighting China. As he outlined back in 2019 , his dim view of Washington's Russia strategy came from the fact that he viewed China, not Russia, as \"our main enemy,\" and that \"the United States ought to be in a relationship with Russia aligned against China to the extent that we can.\"\n\nHe reiterated this point three years later : because \"China is the preeminent threat to the United States,\" and because it's impossible \"to engage meaningfully simultaneously in Europe and in Asia,\" the US focus on Ukraine only \"detracts from our attention to China,\" while at the same time pushing Moscow \"into an alliance of convenience of necessity with the Chinese government.\"\n\nCarlson was right. If your main priorities are one day fighting a war with China and maintaining US supremacy across the globe - instead of, say, fixing the myriad homegrown crises of poverty and wealth inequality that fuel American despair - Washington's foreign policy of antagonizing both Russia and China at the same time has been entirely backward.\n\nCarlson was only putting forward a modified, twenty-first-century version of the foreign policy of Cold War hawks like Richard Nixon, who worked to deepen ties with Beijing in large part to keep China and the Soviet Union divided and eventually win the Cold War. Carlson's vision also happens to be along the lines of the approach favored by hawks like frequent Tucker Carlson Tonight guest Elbridge Colby, the Donald Trump appointee responsible for the billionaire president's anti-China 2018 National Defense Strategy. (\"I wish you were running the State Department,\" Carlson once told Colby.)\n\nBut, of course, such a vision has nothing to do with ensuring peace, let alone keeping Americans out of elite-led foreign adventures, like the Middle Eastern ones Carlson denounces . The opposite, actually: by paying lip service to restraint-oriented rhetoric, Carlson has worked to co-opt latent antiwar sentiment and redirect it into his warmongering crusade against China.\n\nTo this end, Carlson has worked hard to stoke anti-China hostility among his nightly audience of three million viewers, which include elected officials like the former president. Watching Carlson's show these past six or so years has meant being regularly treated to the exact kind of crude, over-the-top coverage of US-China relations that the host has criticized when it comes to how the rest of the media treats Russia policy.\n\nCarlson's broadcasts were full of overwrought fearmongering about China, even as the restraint-oriented experts whom he aped stressed the opposite: that while its government is an authoritarian one with little regard for democracy and also certainly throws its weight around beyond its borders, it was less a threat than a competitor to the United States, one with a close-to-nonexistent military presence abroad, that Americans could learn to live with.\n\nNot in Carlson's world.\n\n\"For many years, the threat from China to the United States has been growing,\" he told his viewers. It is \"no longer simply an economic rival to the United States\" but a \"dangerous enemy\"; a \" racist \" and \"militarized ethno-state\" that has \"run along traditional fascist lines for the benefit of a specific ethnic group.\"\n\nIt \" plans to rule the world .\" In fact, it already is \"taking over the world,\" Carlson insisted in one particularly melodramatic segment on what he called the \"brutal Chinese colonization of Latin America.\"\n\n\"The Chinese have succeeded in re-colonizing the entire continent of Africa,\" where the country \"now calls the shots,\" he charged. \"Allowing Brazil to become a colony of China would be a significant blow to us and potentially a very serious military threat,\" he said about deepening ties between the two countries, which, unlike the United States' relationship with nations in China's near abroad, has no military component as of yet.\n\nThis kind of thing had serious, real-world consequences. Carlson was among the most prominent voices criticizing President Joe Biden for waiting before shooting down the Chinese spy balloon that drifted off course and over the US mainland this past February, claiming - falsely - that the aircraft \"contained explosives.\" As a result of this criticism, Biden, long easily baited by right-wing claims of weakness, soon rashly ordered the military to shoot down a bunch of random objects in the sky they later admitted weren't Chinese spy balloons, with one of the missiles missing and luckily landing in a lake without killing anyone.\n\nTaking a page from the anti-Russia hysterics that he mocked - who saw the Kremlin as the cause of everything from the Occupy Wall Street and Black Lives Matter protests to anti-fracking and antiwar sentiment - Carlson presented the sinister, hidden hand of China as the singular force behind just about every domestic US problem.\n\nThe country had \"snatch[ed] up our properties in our cities, driving up rents, decreasing the rates of homeownership and destroying millions and millions, of course, of our manufacturing jobs,\" he charged . It was \"murdering tens of thousands of Americans every year with fentanyl,\" \"depopulating parts of the country,\" and \"pushing our life expectancy down.\"\n\nGot that? Not private equity firms buying up properties to become massive landlords and hike rents, not \"free trade\" deals pushed by US corporations to keep wages down and weaken workers' bargaining power, not decades' worth of politicians shredding the US safety net and corporate domination of health care throwing people into precarity or even destitution. Nope - it's all China.\n\nAt one point, guest Adam Carolla directly imitated Russiagate-era liberal paranoia to claim China was \"shut[ting] down our pipelines and hack[ing] into our infrastructure.\" Elsewhere, Carlson claimed that the US food supply was \"now imperiled\" because China was \"buy[ing] up this country's farmland,\" with Carlson approvingly quoting US representative for Washington State Dan Newhouse's claim that \"a Chinese-owned agricultural land monopoly\" was taking shape in the United States. In reality, Chinese owners are responsible for less than 1 percent of foreign-owned US agricultural land, well outside the top ten by acreage , which is dominated by Canada and nine major European countries.\n\nNo wonder, then, that Carlson's nightly show was a prized destination for a variety of war hawks to come and peddle their trade, whether Florida Republican Marco Rubio darkly warning that \"the challenge before us is dramatic,\" Missouri Republican Josh Hawley stressing that \"partnering with China is dangerous,\" or talk radio host Jesse Kelly calling for a \"flat-out hostile\" military full of troops \"who want to sit on a throne of Chinese skulls.\"\n\nOne frequent guest was Gordon Chang - famous for incorrectly predicting the imminent collapse of the Chinese government not once, not twice, but three separate times - who Carlson had on to repeat Hawley's point that, at a time when international cooperation is more urgent than ever to deal with the planetary threat of climate change and other global crises, the United States must not under any circumstances work with China.\n\nIt \"sounded very good to the ear, you know, cooperation, friendly ties, all the rest of it,\" Chang said , leading US elites \"to accept this notion of inevitable Chinese dominance.\"\n\nBut in fact, Chang argued another time, \"we've got to break those connections\" and to \"push back\" like Washington did under Trump, when the Chinese \"were afraid of him.\" Chang now pushes this same kind of message on MSNBC , suggesting the fundamental overlap between Carlson and his corporate liberal critics - a fact inconvenient to both and thus summarily ignored.\n\nIn the process of all this, Carlson regularly took part in exactly the same kind of tiresome and scurrilous neo-McCarthyite accusations of treachery that he complains about his liberal critics doing.\n\n\"Many of the very people who ranted so hysterically about Russia\" were in fact \"working on behalf of our chief global rival, the government of China,\" he said . \"Instead of protecting us from this threat . . . our leadership class collaborates with the other side,\" he charged . Elsewhere, he accus ed the Biden White House of \"intentionally trying to weaken and destroy the United States\" - even as that White House pushed through colossally wasteful military budgets and engaged in dangerous escalations .\n\nCarlson might have allowed criticism of the military-industrial complex once or twice on his show, but his China saber-rattling was explicitly about strengthening that complex - and even the \"deep state\" that he claimed to oppose. How would Beto O'Rourke's plan to reverse a ban on transgender soldiers in the military \"make America's military stronger?\" Carlson demanded to know in relation to China becoming \"a direct rival to this country.\"\n\n\"Our defensive capabilities have never been weaker and that's not an accident,\" he inton ed after Nancy Pelosi's reckless trip to Taiwan last year. \"We should have been making defensive, strategic moves for the past twenty years\" instead, he said, and \"building up a strong military and, yes, a strong CIA.\"\n\nAs Carlson's coverage of Pelosi's Taiwan visit indicated, even the occasional dovish segment on Tucker Carlson Tonight expressing alarm over the risk of provoking Beijing was framed around the need to shore up US military strength, at a time when Congress is passing record defense budgets that have the United States spending more on the military than the next ten countries combined - almost all of whom are US allies.\n\nAt one point, Colby came on the show to reprimand the Biden administration for \"pok[ing] the dragon\" with various provocations - not because it raised the risk of a Chinese attack on Taiwan or brought the two nuclear-armed countries closer to war but because the United States was \"not quite ready\" to fight that war. Carlson's only objection was that it didn't make sense to fight \"a war over Taiwan right now \" (emphasis mine).\n\nAnd while he may have warned about nuclear catastrophe in the context of the Ukraine war, Carlson treated the idea of taking steps to prevent the same outcome in the China conflict as the literal act of a traitor. He called Joint Chiefs of Staff chairman Mark Milley's admission that he would call his Chinese counterpart to tell him about a US attack ahead of time \"treason\" and \"a crime,\" with little regard for what a surprise attack could lead to in the nuclear era. As a result, Carlson charged , he was \"a danger to the country.\"\n\nCongratulations to Carlson, though, because while he might be out of a job, his years of diligent efforts to spark a war with China have paid off.\n\nLawmakers from both parties now call China the greatest foreign threat and vote lockstep for escalations that even hawks admit are dangerously provocative . Relations between the two countries are at an alarming low, as a Democratic White House terrified of accusations of being soft on China crosses lines previous presidents wouldn't. And US cooperation with Beijing has ground to a halt, as the Biden administration works to sever connections to China and decouple the two countries' economies in preparation for an eventual catastrophic war.\n\nIn the process, Carlson has engaged in exactly the same kind of disgraceful behavior as the pro-war Russia hawks he's now receiving plaudits for having criticized in the past: accusing opponents of being secretly in cahoots with the Chinese government, throwing around treason accusations, blaming any and every US problem on Chinese leadership, and deliberately inflating China's current threat to the United States.\n\nIt's telling that, in all the think pieces devoted to Carlson and his legacy since his ouster at Fox, and in the midst of a never-ending panic around misinformation, there's so far not a single piece of criticism of his rabid China coverage, even in the liberal pushback to the limited praise Carlson's gotten. That's because, in a few short years, the entire spectrum of the political and media establishment has become a collection of mini-Tucker Carlsons, quietly agreeing with the host's China war fever even as they denounce everything else he says.\n\nAll the while, the very real and far more influential role US oligarchs and corporate power has played in creating the daily miseries Carlson ascribes to China goes undiscussed - which is exactly the point.\n\nBranko Marcetic is a Jacobin staff writer and the author of Yesterday's Man: The Case Against Joe Biden .

But when push comes to shove, he sides with the ruling class and bosses, not workers.\n\nTucker Carlson speaks during the Mathias Corvinus Collegium Feszt on August 7, 2021 in Esztergom, Hungary. (Janos Kummer / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nRight-wing pundit Tucker Carlson has broken his silence for the first time since he was fired by Fox News at the beginning of the week. He released a short video full of scathing criticisms of the bipartisan establishment and the barren wasteland of cable news. It ends with a strong implication that we'll be hearing from him soon in a new venue.\n\nI'm sure that's true. In 2023, no one with a significant following goes away just because they lose a job. He might end up with a smaller platform, but he'll undoubtedly land somewhere.\n\nGood evening pic.twitter.com/SPrsYKWKCE\n\n- Tucker Carlson (@TuckerCarlson) April 27, 2023\n\nBut what message will he be promoting on the new platform?\n\nThe impression you'd get from the video is that Carlson is someone who worries about \"war\" and \"corporate power\" and sides with the working class. Or at least the native-born section of the working class - he mentions \"demographic change\" along with the other two topics when he lists important things we don't see substantive debates about on cable news.\n\nBut it's all hot air. He doesn't even support a higher minimum wage. And he's all too eager for a new Cold War with China. The truth is that while he's deviated from conservative orthodoxy on some issues, at his core Tucker Carlson is the same preppy Republican he was twenty years ago when he was wearing a bowtie and defending the Bush administration on CNN's Crossfire. \"Heterodox antiwar populist\" is the character he plays on TV.\n\nThe germ of truth in the myth of Carlson the Populist is that he really has shifted on some important questions over the decades. He's defended Julian Assange's right to publish information the Pentagon would prefer to keep secret, for example - a stance that would have been unthinkable during his Crossfire era.\n\nNot all of this evolution is recent. Back in 2009, he joined the libertarian Cato Institute as a senior fellow. Cato's press release skimped over his full-throated defense of Bush's hawkishness in the early years of the \"war on terror,\" which notoriously included calling Iraqis \"semiliterate primitive monkeys\" who should \"shut up and obey\" the United States because they \"can't govern themselves.\" Instead of dwelling on his past positions, Cato in 2009 stressed that Carlson \"became\" a critic of \"numerous Bush administration policies, including wasteful spending and the war in Iraq.\"\n\nEven now, that evolution away from neoconservatism is incomplete. Carlson often talks like a critic of the military-industrial complex when he discusses America's global rivalry with Russia - a right-wing isolationist critic rather than a left-wing internationalist one, but a critic nonetheless. Compare, for instance, Carlson's segment pushing back against the idea that we should \"hate\" warmongering Russian president Vladimir Putin with the attitude of socialist leader Eugene V. Debs, who went to jail for his fiery speech opposing US entry into World War I - but took it for granted that he should also denounce the German kaiser and show solidarity with his antiwar comrades in Germany.\n\nBut as Branko Marcetic points out , when it comes to America's global rivalry with China, Carlson switches gears and becomes the biggest booster of the military-industrial complex. He's suggested that America should be doing more to build up a \"strong military and, yes, a strong CIA\" to counter the Chinese threat. Connecting the two subjects, he's said that \"our main enemy is China\" and that \"the US ought to be in a relationship with Russia, allied against China.\"\n\nSo the \"antiwar\" part of the \"antiwar populist\" image is more than a little dubious. But it's true enough that he's improved on civil liberties since his Crossfire days, that he went from supporting America's wars in the Middle East to seeing them as misguided, and that he's been dovish on relations between Russia and the United States.\n\nThat evolution was already well underway in 2009. But what about the issues where he's supposed to have changed since leaving Cato in 2015?\n\nHere's what Carlson wrote about Medicare for All in 2019, well after his \"populist\" rebranding:\n\n\"Medicare-for-all\" is actual socialism, for-real socialism. Health care spending amounts to about a fifth of the entire American economy. Elizabeth Warren demands total control of all of it - immediately. . . .\n\nSo how do you pay for \"Medicare-for-all\"? It's not a minor detail we can settle later. It's the single most important question about the program. Why do you think we don't have it already? Because we can't afford it.\n\nReality check: The reason we don't have Medicare for All isn't that the United States is less capable of making the finances work than other advanced democracies that have implemented similar programs. It's that the bipartisan establishment Carlson rails against when it suits him does the bidding of the powerful and profitable private health-insurance industry.\n\nIn fact, the year before Carlson wrote this, the libertarian Mercatus Center - hardly primed to back such proposals - crunched the numbers on Bernie Sanders's Medicare for All plan and found that it would be more cost-efficient than the current system. (They tried to bury that finding by emphasizing how much money it would cost rather than the fact that this price tag is less than our society spends on health care right now.) A middle-income taxpayer who currently has private insurance might pay a higher tax rate, but the combined cost of their current taxes and their current premiums, co-pays, and deductibles would be greater than that higher tax bill.\n\nYou might think a \"populist\" like Carlson would care about putting more money in the pockets of ordinary people. You'd be wrong. He prefers to spout insurance-industry talking points.\n\nSimilarly, Carlson is opposed to raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour. Talking very much like the Cato Institute senior fellow he used to be, he claimed in 2021 that the wage hike would cost the economy a million jobs. He awkwardly tried to turn this into a \"populist\" talking point by claiming that \"these big businesses would actually be in favor of a higher minimum wage if they thought it would drive their competitors out of business\" and saying that he'd be fine with raising the minimum wage for large firms but not small ones.\n\nSimilarly, in a conversation last year with Amazon Labor Union leader Chris Smalls - whom Carlson seems to have invited on his show in the hopes that Smalls would take the opportunity to criticize progressive congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, with whom Smalls had previously argued on Twitter - Carlson casually said that he'd never been \"particularly pro-union\" but that he'd like to see Amazon owner Jeff Bezos have his business unionized.\n\nThese attempts to split the difference between libertarianism and \"populism\" are telling. At best, the regular people Carlson sympathizes with when he rails against Wall Street or corporate America aren't the working class. They're small-business owners. If you're one of the sixty million Americans who works for a small business, Carlson wants you to continue to earn poverty wages to prop up your employers against their larger competitors.\n\nAnd even that might be giving him too much credit. He claims he'd favor a hypothetical à la carte minimum wage hike on big companies, but the top-line consequence of his position is that he rejects attempts to raise the minimum wage in the real world - and thus lands on the side of big corporations that like wage rates just fine as is.\n\nCarlson's response to the baby formula shortage last year wasn't to blame the profit-seeking greed of the giant companies that manufacture the great bulk of the product in the United States. It was to blame a government program that provides vouchers for low-income mothers to buy formula.\n\nCarlson wrote :\n\nThe problem right now is that the Abbott Nutrition Company has made the baby formula for the vast majority of WIC contracts. The government had all its eggs virtually in Abbott's basket. Unfortunately, Abbott just closed its plant in Sturgis, Michigan because of contamination, and that means that millions of people who used WIC to buy Abbott products are forced to buy competing formulas and they're doing it all at once.\n\nGot that? Carlson doesn't even pause to ask why the contamination happened, what this had to do with Abbot's lax safety practices , or whether more regulation might have helped stop this from happening. He just homes in on too many poor mothers getting baby formula with government vouchers as \"the\" problem leading to shortages for everyone else.\n\nBut perhaps most telling of all is Carlson's response to the fentanyl crisis. The supposed antiwar populist's preferred culprit for the tens of thousands of fentanyl death every year isn't widespread poverty and despair caused by decades of capital running roughshod over a disempowered working class.\n\nInstead, his preferred story about the roots of the fentanyl crisis can be summarized in one word: China .\n\nMany of Carlson's admirers assume that he was fired for one or more of his genuinely heterodox positions - like opposing US intervention in Ukraine. But right now, evidence strongly suggests that he was let go for more mundane reasons.\n\nMultiple lawsuits against Fox implicate Carlson in one way or another, and in some of the text messages and off-air videos that have recently emerged, Carlson expresses opinions that are embarrassing to his employer. Some involve insults directed at Fox News management. Others reveal a severe gap between how he talked about Trump and claims about election fraud on air and how he spoke about these subjects in private. Still others include off-camera jokes about his \" 'postmenopausal fans' and whether they will approve of how he looks on the air .\"\n\nCarlson is, in other words, the kind of brave truth-teller who thinks very little of his audience and avoids telling them things they don't want to hear. And the kind of antiwar populist who longs for a full-fledged Cold War with China and opposes raising the minimum wage.\n\nWhat he really is, at the end of the day, is a clown. This is a man who devoted multiple segments to ranting about \"woke\" candy manufacturer Mars Wrigley changing its animated green M&M to make her less sexy.\n\nHe might have lost his gig at Fox, but I have no doubt he'll be reapplying his clown makeup and setting up a tent at some other circus soon enough. Tucker Carlson isn't going anywhere. We should be so lucky.\n\nBen Burgis is a Jacobin columnist, an adjunct philosophy professor at Rutgers University, and the host of the YouTube show and podcast Give Them An Argument .

New documents suggest they never believed any of it.\n\nTucker Carlson during the 2022 FOX Nation Patriot Awards on November 17, 2022 in Hollywood, Florida.

It enrages me,\" Tucker Carlson texted his producer two days after Election Day 2020. The \"fuckers\" in question were Fox News employees who accurately reported Joe Biden's victory in Arizona.\n\nIt's hard to think of a more succinct encapsulation of conservative media than one of its biggest stars complaining that reality is ruining his credibility.\n\nCarlson wasn't alone. A week later, Sean Hannity texted Carlson and fellow Fox personality Laura Ingraham that calling Arizona for Biden - again, we should stress, simply reporting reality - had \"destroyed a brand that took 25 years to build and the damage is incalculable.\"\n\nCarlson later tried to get another Fox News reporter fired for a tweet questioning Trump's false assertions of election fraud. Carlson didn't claim the reporter's tweets were inaccurate, according to newly revealed text messages. Rather, his main concern was that \"The stock price [of Fox's parent company] is down. Not a joke.\"\n\nIt may not surprise many readers that Fox News values right-wing propaganda over facts. But newly released documents from a major defamation case against the network show just how deep a cynical disregard for the truth went with its biggest on-air talent.\n\nIn a $1.6 billion lawsuit, the voting machine company Dominion Voting Systems says that Fox News defamed it by claiming Dominion machines were switching votes from Trump to Biden. As part of the suit, Dominion gained access to internal Fox communications, some of which were released in a court filing yesterday .\n\nQuotes like Carlson's about the stock price and continual fretting about low ratings by Fox pundits and executives bolster Dominion's argument that Fox personalities continued to make claims they knew were false out of a concern for losing viewers to even more extreme outlets like Newsmax. Carlson and Ingraham privately described Trump surrogates with terms like \"liar\" and \"a complete nut.\" But in one of the few accurate statements he's ever made, Carlson got at the heart of the issue. Trump, he wrote in a text to his producer, \"could easily destroy us if we play it wrong.\"\n\nIn their internal communications, Carlson and Hannity sound less like journalists and more like hucksters who realize the jig is up. Stuck between the potential wrath of Trump and his followers on the one hand, and Fox owner Rupert Murdoch's insistence on reporting material with some semblance of the truth on the other, they panicked.\n\nFox claims that it was simply reporting claims made by Trump and other newsworthy individuals without propagating false claims itself. But Dominion seems unusually confident in its chances, given how difficult defamation cases are for plaintiffs in the United States.\n\nSo far, Fox has managed to keep parts of its communications redacted in the public versions of court filings. Adding to Fox's legal headaches, the New York Times is suing to unseal the full record. We might not even have seen the worst of it yet.\n\nBen Beckett is an American writer in Vienna.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nJon Stewart rightly scorned cable news' empty bickering during a 2004 CNN Crossfire appearance that went viral again this week. But calls for post-partisan decency still miss the point: we need a positive agenda to improve people's lives, not empty calls to be the adults in the room.\n\nJon Stewart on CNN's Crossfire in 2004. (CNN)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nJon Stewart's famous 2004 appearance on CNN's Crossfire remains a standout takedown of the pernicious culture of spin that dominates cable news. Revisiting the clip nearly seventeen years later, it's immediately obvious why many of us still look back on it so favorably.\n\nIn debating cohosts Tucker Carlson and Paul Begala, Stewart was effortlessly funny, rhetorically effective, and, in a few instances, practically lethal. Though he made fools of his interlocutors and their show, Stewart's real target was, of course, the ethos they embodied - one summed up aptly enough by Begala during his intro: \"As our loyal viewers, of course, know, our show is about all left versus white [ sic ], black versus white, paper versus plastic, Red Sox against the Yankees.\"\n\nRepublican versus Democrat, conservative versus liberal, rural versus urban, coasts versus hinterland: it's difficult to deny that American media, and cable networks in particular, often trades in reductive binaries and emotionally potent oversimplification. Division, after all, tends to be good for business, and cable news is probably best understood as a medium sitting firmly at the intersection of corporate profits and commodified hyperpartisanship. Stewart, whose appearance on Crossfire went viral again this week, wasn't wrong to dismiss the hosts' claims that they were simply providing a forum for honest ideological \"debate\":\n\nBEGALA: We're thirty minutes in a twenty-four-hour day where we have each side on, as best we can get them, and have them fight it out.\n\nSTEWART: No, no, no, no, that would be great. To do a debate would be great. But that's like saying pro wrestling is a show about athletic competition . . . This is theater . . . you're doing theater, when you should be doing debate, which would be great. It's not honest, what you do is not honest. What you do is partisan hackery.\n\nIf the comedian's critique of empty cable TV theatrics was bang on, however, his prescription was decidedly wanting.\n\n\"Why do we have to fight?\" Stewart pleaded at the outset of the segment. \"Why do you argue, the two of you?\" - the kind of why-can't-we-all-just-get-alongism that would later define the quasi-ironic Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear (and, more recently , his 2020 film Irresistible ).\n\nAs Robin Marie Averbeck wrote it in a 2014 Jacobin essay :\n\nThe festival reached its height as the spectators were treated to a video montage of fire-breathing pundits from all the major news networks denouncing their political opponents. The message was clear: Those who tell you there are fundamental differences between Americans that are worth getting emphatically angry about are lying to you. This divided America - an America that contains people with radically different values and radically different ideas of what a just, moral society looks like - does not exist. If it seems otherwise, it is simply because, as one sign at the rally put it, we fail to use our \"inside voices.\"\n\nTo a lesser but very real extent, the enduring popularity of Stewart's Crossfire clip probably also owes itself to his dismantling of Carlson - the kind of spectacle-based rhetorical evisceration that became hugely popular and influential among liberals by way of the West Wing, the Daily Show , and their various imitators. (Conservatives, of course, have their own version of this, which is typically found in YouTube videos with titles like \"Ben Shapiro DESTROYS vegan SJW with pure logic.\")\n\nSince 2004, these two impulses - post-partisanship and rhetorically dismantling the Right - have been taken up by liberals again and again. Again and again, they have failed to yield tangible political results.\n\nPost-partisanship reached its apex during the Barack Obama era, as the president's polite entreaties toward Republicans were met with obstruction, and liberal entertainers met Tea Party populism with a rally in defense of moderation (revealingly held just days before the Democratic wipeout in the 2010 midterms). Cable news shows, comedy specials, and prestige dramas, meanwhile, have produced no shortage of rhetorical takedowns, yet conservatism somehow remains a viable and politically powerful force. Tucker Carlson, his 2004 destruction by Stewart notwithstanding, has slid further into reactionary politics and is today one of the most influential figures in the American media.\n\nTo this day, Jon Stewart's Crossfire appearance remains a solid and satisfying critique of cable news and the noxious culture on which it thrives. But its continued popularity is a sign that many liberals are still blind to cardinal truths about politics imparted again and again over the past seventeen years: you don't ultimately win by elegantly dismantling your opponents on TV, being the \"adult in the room,\" or even by having good arguments. You win by building power and advancing a positive, popular, egalitarian political agenda that goes beyond simply making your opponents look bad.\n\nLuke Savage is a staff writer at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

(Jason Koerner / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nTucker Carlson has been kicked off of Fox News, just like his predecessor Bill O'Reilly. (Sorry, he's been \" future endeavored \" if you like.) Like O'Reilly, Carlson was the target of years of boycotts and advertiser pressure campaigns from activists who opposed his right-wing demagoguery. Like O'Reilly, Carlson easily withstood it all. And like O'Reilly, what eventually brought down Tucker Carlson was the irresistible power of the democratic state.\n\nO'Reilly, remember, was fired from Fox after the New York Times reported that he had settled multiple sexual misconduct lawsuits. Fox was able to ignore twenty years of consumer activism from liberals who had hoped that they could leverage the market against him, but had to fold when it became clear that he was becoming a legal liability. Carlson withstood multiple aggressive boycott campaigns led by media watchdogs like Media Matters for America, NGOs like the Anti-Defamation League, and politicians like Ilhan Omar; but as Politico noted just a few years ago, the high ratings he brought to the network made him \"all but cancel-proof.\" But when Carlson exposed Fox to the threat of state action and, ultimately, a historic $787.5 million defamation settlement, it couldn't defend him anymore.\n\nLiberalism presents consumer activism as an effectively omnipotent cure for every problem capitalism can inflict upon us. It has to, because if we recognize the limits of things like boycotts and advertiser pressure campaigns then we have to accept that sometimes state intervention is the only possible solution. Capitalism has to resist this principle because once you acknowledge the state's ultimate sovereignty over markets, you've destroyed the premise of private property - the foundation upon which capitalism is built.\n\nThat's why even left activists are often tempted to regard boycotts as how you do politics rather than as a sometimes ill-fitting strategy.\n\nThree years ago this week, Bernie Sanders appeared on Fox News during his 2020 primary campaign. It was widely regarded as an extraordinarily successful event ; Sanders refused to pander to Fox's right-wing audience, but he was still able to build common ground with them over issues like health care and taxes. At the time, however, a widespread objection among liberals and many ostensible leftists was that by appearing on Fox he was \"legitimizing\" it. Media Matters, which had been promoting advertiser boycotts because of Carlson, loudly complained that the appearance was undermining its strategy: \"Democrats need to ask themselves if at this moment they really want to be throwing Fox News a lifeline,\" Media Matters president Angelo Carusone said.\n\nI don't think it very plausible to argue that but-for-Bernie Carlson would have left Fox in 2019, but casting blame for the strategy's failure is beside the point. It failed. As I argued at the time, if your boycott strategy demands absolute buy-in that you've never been able to achieve, it's time to change the strategy. Fox kept Carlson on because he was more of an asset than a liability; this is easy enough to see when you look at its stock yesterday.\n\nCan you guess when news broke that Carlson was leaving? Fox was always going to be able to swallow these little ad revenue hits, but what it couldn't absorb was Dominion Voting Systems taking it to court and suing it into oblivion.\n\nI am not going to use this piece to address concerns about state censorship from folks who are fine with market censorship, which is what boycott deplatforming strategies obviously are. I do, however, want to take this opportunity to remind everyone which strategy is more effective.\n\nCarl Beijer is a writer at carlbeijer.com .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nVisiting Hungary, Tucker Carlson presented its authoritarian leader, Viktor Orbán, as the defender of the normality America has lost. In fact, Orbán's kleptocracy offers a grim indication of what far-right ideologues would do in the US if they had the chance.\n\nTucker Carlson and Hungarian premier Viktor Orbán in Budapest, Hungary, in early August 2021.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nTucker Carlson and Viktor Orbán sit at a round wooden table, polished to a mirror finish. Behind them is a grand bookcase full of elegantly bound anthologies. The Fox News host is seated in front of a metal spiral staircase, like in an Ivy League library. The Hungarian prime minister sits in front of a massive national flag.\n\n\"Hundreds of thousands of migrants stream into the EU every year,\" says Carlson. \"And the rest of the EU says 'Welcome, please come.' Hungary stands alone in saying no. Why?\"\n\n\"Well,\" replies Orbán. \"That was the only reasonable position.\" He pauses for a moment. \"You have to defend your border. You have to say, 'Guys, stop!'\"\n\n\"And you think you have a right to do that?\" Carlson presses.\n\n\"Of course! It's coming from God, from nature,\" replies Orbán. \"Because this is our country. This is our population. This is our history. This is our language. So we have to do that.\"\n\n\"Saying what you just said,\" says Carlson, \"I think [that] will make sense to a lot of our viewers.\"\n\nCarlson broadcast his Fox News cable show from Budapest, Hungary, throughout the week of August 4. Tucker Carlson Tonight draws in an average viewership of 4.33 million, making it the highest-rated cable news show in US history. Carlson spent the week touring Budapest, visiting Hungary's border fence , and sitting down for multiple interview segments with Orbán, the hard-right prime minister who has ruled the central European country since 2010. On Saturday, August 7, Carlson spoke at the Mathias Corvinus Collegium (or MCC) Festival - a weekend of ultraconservative speakers hosted by the college that Orbán created in the hopes of fostering a new conservative elite.\n\nCarlson's visit to Hungary highlights the global nature of the current growth of nationalist ideology, white supremacist beliefs, and anti-migrant fearmongering. This trend is being capitalized on by authoritarian populists around the world to cement their power - and is fueling the Republican party's evolution toward an embrace of fascism .\n\nAfter spending the last half decade as a mouthpiece for Donald Trump, Carlson has elegantly transferred his allegiance to Orbán, cast as the \"Western-style conservative leader\" US voters should seek out. Presenting Hungary as a right-wing paradise does not just further Carlson's ideological manipulation of his viewers - it also allows him to reach an international viewership potentially vulnerable to his brand of misinformation. For him, Orbán's illiberal Hungary represents a blueprint for successfully subverting a consolidated liberal democracy - and a glimpse into what a more competent version of Trump might be able to achieve.\n\nSitting down with Carlson and approving his invitation to the MCC conference, Orbán also hoped to expand his own audience. This is a crucial step in his plan to establish the small country as a center for global far-right, white supremacist ideological and cultural production. A recent declaration \"protecting sovereignty\" signed by ultraconservative as well as \" identitarian \" political forces from across the EU seems to suggest that such a far-right international is indeed taking shape - with Orbán playing a key role.\n\nThe kind of authoritarian populism promoted by Orbán also appeals to broad swaths of the US right. While Carlson is known for his open support of Trump, this is what the Washington Post 's Philip Bump calls \"sycophancy-adjacent rather than entirely immersed in the MAGAverse.\" The key to Carlson's support of Trump, Bump elaborates, is that \"Trump shares many of his core philosophies, like preserving institutional power for white Americans.\"\n\nIn this sense, a notable connection to Orbán lies in \" replacement theory \" - the racist conspiracy theory postulating that white people and their culture will be driven to extinction and overtaken by immigrants of color. As far back as 2017, Carlson used his platform to argue that US Democrats \"know if they keep up the flood of illegals into the country, they can eventually turn it into a flood of voters for them.\" The Democrats \"don't have to foster economic growth,\" Carlson continued, \"or be capable administrators, or provide good government. They just have to keep the pump flowing, and power will be theirs.\"\n\nUnder Orbán's leadership, replacement theory is official state ideology. Not only was this same theme reflected in his address to the Budapest Demographic Summit in 2019, but it is also the stuff of propaganda leaflets regularly sent by the government to all Hungarian households.\n\nIf often resorting to subtler language, conservative US figures draw on this same theory. Earlier this year, House representatives Marjorie Taylor Greene and Paul Gosar were linked to a plan to create an \" America First \" caucus, centered around a belief in \"Anglo-Saxon political traditions,\" and specifically argued that when immigrants are \"imported\" into the US \"en masse,\" it threatens American culture's \"long-term existential future.\"\n\nThe political influence of this ideology can hardly be understated: an April 2021 survey by GOP pollster Kristen Soltis Anderson \" found that nearly half of Republican respondents believe politics is about 'ensuring the country's survival as we know it'\" and that \"there is a 'real sense in the Republican coalition today that they are under siege.'\"\n\nWith such clear affinities, it's no wonder Steve Bannon once called the Hungarian premier \" Trump before Trump. \" Orbán has cemented his power around the idea that a pure, ethnically homogeneous nation must be preserved from outside attacks. While he refrains from openly talking about race, it is blatantly obvious what he means when he talks about \"homogeneity\" and the preservation of \"Judeo-Christian civilization\" from a planned invasion organized by shadowy forces, like NGOs supported by George Soros. Orbán is careful not to openly endorse Nazi groups, particularly given the importance of his alliance with the Israeli far righ t . Rather, in the thirty years since Soviet troops left the country, Orbán's Fidesz party has strategically built itself on a foundation of right-wing authoritarian populist ideology that has become popular with despots around the world.\n\nThe transferability of this message shone through from the Hungarian premier's conversation with Carlson. \"This is our country, this is our population,\" Orbán tells the Fox News host. \"This is our history; this is our language. . . . You can't say simply [say,] 'It's a nice country, and I would like to come and live here because it's a nicer life.' [There] is not a human right to come here, because it's our land. It's a nation. It's a community. Family. History. Tradition. Language.\"\n\n\"Oooh . . . they're so triggered by that!\" replies Carlson. \"'Family. History. Tradition. Language.' They hate it when you say that. But why? Those are all good things!\"\n\nSince taking power in 2010, Orbán and the Fidesz party have overseen Hungary's slide into kleptocracy and authoritarianism. This \" hybrid regime \" has the trappings of representative government - a parliament, elections, some form of media - but in practice, it has been entrenched into a centralized, top-down power structure dominated by Orbán's close associates.\n\nAfter Fidesz won 68 percent of seats in parliament in 2010, granting it a so-called supermajority, Orbán was able to replace Hungary's constitution with an \"alaptörény\" - a set of \"fundamental laws.\" In 2014, he declared Hungary an \"illiberal democracy,\" arguing that liberal values today represent \" corruption, sex, and violence .\" Today, the electoral watchdog Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) deems Hungary's elections free but not fair , making Hungary a \" ballot box autocracy \" in which authoritarians design and use manipulative practices such as widespread gerrymandering and a controlled media environment to ensure their continued power.\n\nCarlson is eager to introduce his viewers to Orbán because he is so easily compared to Trump. And the Hungarian premier is only too keen to return the favor. \"Donald Trump was a great friend of Hungary,\" the prime minister tells Carlson. \"He was very supportive of us. Not just personally but politically also. . . . 'America First' is a very positive message in Central Europe. Because it means if, for Donald Trump, 'America First,' it means that, for us, Hungary could be first as well.\"\n\nAs well as describing the European Parliament as a group of \" useful idiots ,\" Orbán has especially criticized EU migration policy. In 2015, when refugees from Africa and the Middle East came to Hungary's border via what is sometimes called the Balkan route , Orbán began to demonize them as well, building a fence along the border with Serbia, where asylum-seekers faced severe human rights abuses . During his time in Budapest, Carlson visited this same fence in person and was clearly impressed - calling the border \"peaceful\" with \"no suffering mass of humanity.\" For him, it showed that Hungary has \"no desire to destroy itself\" and \"no desire to encourage crime and misery and unemployment in its cities.\"\n\nIn Carlson's portrayal, Hungary is an \"obvious success.\" \"There's an option to the chaos and crime and filth growing all around us,\" Carlson tells his viewers. \"We don't have to live like that anymore; actually, we could have a functioning country [like Hungary]. All we'd have to do is uphold our own laws. . . . Other smaller countries, far less privileged places, have figured this out.\"\n\nTo emphasize his point, Carlson airs footage of downtown Budapest taken by his film crew.\n\n\"There are not tent cities of drug addicts living in the parks here,\" he says. \"There isn't garbage and human waste littering the sidewalks. People don't get beheaded at intersections. BLM is not allowed to torch entire neighborhoods in Budapest. That's how Americans used to live before our leaders decided they no longer care about you. The Hungarian government protects its border because it wants to protect its citizens.\"\n\nIt speaks volumes about Carlson's lack of professional integrity that he makes no mention of the areas where he and Orbán hold wildly divergent views. For instance, while Carlson calls China a threat to the West, Orbán has an excellent relationship with the Chinese Communist Party and is determined to allow Fudan University to open a campus in Budapest. Tellingly, when Carlson did voice criticism of Xi Jinping, not only did Orbán avoid responding, but the Hungarian government simply censored this comment from the state copy of the interview transcript. Orbán's administration similarly tried to block a recent EU statement critical of China's actions in Hong Kong.\n\nCarlson - who frequently cries censorship and claims that voices like his are silenced by \"Joe Biden's allies within Silicon Valley\" - has not responded to this omission. This is yet another indication of how Carlson is using Hungary to project internal US politics - it doesn't truly matter to him if he disagrees with the reality of Orbán's government.\n\nThis is also apparent on the question of COVID-19 vaccines and whether people should be compelled to take them. While Carlson did cast scientifically unfounded doubts about the efficacy of vaccines and considers vaccine passes a violation of freedom, Orbán was one of the first leaders in Europe to introduce such a pass, without which people cannot access a number of indoor venues.\n\nThere are other gaping holes in Carlson's account. It is true that, compared to the United States , Hungary has relatively low levels of violent crime . This is likely due to several factors, including significantly lower levels of gun ownership . Indeed, Carlson conveniently fails to recognize the fact that other EU countries, including those that embrace multiculturalism, also have significantly lower rates of violent crime than the United States. As for homelessness, Carlson does not mention that, up until 2018, Hungary had one of the largest per capita populations of people living on the streets in the EU. What changed that year was that Orbán's Fidesz party used its power to amend Hungary's \"fundamental laws\" to make homelessness illegal . Thirty thousand unhoused people across Hungary, many of them in Budapest, were forced to either find housing or face imprisonment, where they are required to labor for the state (indeed, incarcerated labor was used to build the border fence that Carlson so admired) .\n\nCarlson nonetheless claims to be speaking truth to power. Addressing the MCC Festival, Carlson told the crowd that, as a cable news show, \"We have no real power other than to talk unimpeded, which is an increasingly rare luxury in the United States.\" Carlson frequently bemoans the state of press freedom in the United States - claiming that all media is beholden to what the \"liberal establishment\" (the Biden administration, at the moment) tells it to do. It is indeed true that US media is increasingly beholden to corporate monopolies. But as Carlson sees it, Fox News is the only accurate, unbiased media source willing to defy the journalistic establishment. And he compares American  media consolidation with that of Hungary, where hundreds of formerly private news outlets were simultaneously \" donated \" by their owners to a central company run by Orbán's close personal friends - all in a single day in 2018.\n\nBut for the Fox News host, the Hungarian press is, if anything, far freer than its US counterpart.  He continues his MCC speech, reading a tweet from Atlantic staff writer Anne Applebaum from his phone . \"In Orbán's Hungary, 90 percent of the media is controlled by the ruling party. Businesses are repeatedly harassed if they don't toe the party line. Elections are manipulated. Party leaders are mysteriously rich.\" A ripple of laughter passes through the crowd. \"And I said to myself,\" Carlson continues, \"'Wait a minute! I live in that country!'\"\n\nOrbán's regime clearly sought to use the visit by a famous international personality for domestic propaganda purposes - and Carlson did him a great favor in casting him as the defender of a \"normalcy\" America has lost. Orbán shared multiple posts about his meeting with Carlson on his social media platform, and the Fidesz-aligned new network Hír TV broadcast Carlson's entire MCC lecture.\n\nBut not everyone in Hungary was impressed. One of the country's few remaining independent news websites, 444.hu , described it as \"one of those rare events that take place in Hungary yet attract greater attention in America than in Hungary.\" There was, nonetheless, strong criticism. When Carlson asked Orbán about how he feels about Joe Biden calling him a totalitarian thug, Orbán claimed that such statements are an insult to the Hungarian people. Responding to this, Budapest's green mayor, Gergely Karácsony, said that the real insult is not what Biden said but the fact that the prime minister of Hungary is indeed a totalitarian thug.\n\nIt is important to note that, while Orbán and his Fidesz government are kleptocratic authoritarians, Hungary is still far from a totalitarian system enacting total control over citizens' everyday lives. Yet through policies like encouraging white, Hungarian, Christian families to have more children to combat the supposed decline of the white population, the prime minister does push a harsh identitarianism, in explicit counterposition to Western liberal democracy. Orbán told Carlson that Hungary is the alternative of choice for the \"millions and millions of people who disagree with the direction of the policy taken at this moment,\" policy that is \"against protecting the families\" and \"based on migration,\" that is \"welfare-oriented,\" and that is more \"Open Society\" - a reference to George Soros's nonprofit organization promoting civil society.\n\nOrbán has been pushing to transform Hungary into this alternative - with a particular emphasis on fostering right-wing culture and academia. Mathias Corvinus Collegium, the school hosting the event that Carlson spoke at this past weekend along with leaders within the international conservative community like Dennis Prager of PragerU , is a centerpiece of this agenda. The school, which was originally founded in 1996 to train Hungary's elite in a post-Soviet world, has become one of the thirty-two conservative, government-affiliated organizations in Hungary. This network includes foundations, think tanks, parks, concert halls, a cinema, and even a boarding school. These organizations receive billions of dollars annually in public funding - despite being privately owned and run. Orban allocated $1.7 billion USD to MCC at the height of the COVID-19 crisis, about 1 percent of the country's GDP .\n\nThis comes on the heels of Orbán's attempt to dismantle both higher education and any kind of dissident academic thinking. Orbán has banned gender studies in Hungary, forced the expulsion of the Central European University, an international school cofounded by George Soros, and seized control of Hungary's five largest public universities .\n\nOrbán envisions Hungary as a right-wing paradise - as he tells Carlson, a central hub within a more extensive international network of \"conservative and Christian Democrat thinkers.\" That is why, Orbán says, \"Ordinary citizens are moving to Central European countries,\" like Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia. Even as Hungary closes its borders to asylum-seekers, it is opening its arms to the \"many Christian families and conservative families who think that Western Europe is not secure enough, [that] the future is unstable.\"\n\n\"There will be a new migration,\" the prime minister tells Carlson, by \"the Christians and the Conservatives trying to find a better home.\"\n\nFor the Fox News star who claims to love America, the hope is to make his home a bit more like Hungary.\n\nRosa Schwartzburg was a Fulbright Scholar to the Netherlands in 2018 and received her MA from the Central European University in Budapest.

He's not vengeful, he loves his children. Disobedient as they may be, he loves them, because they're his children. ... And when Dad gets home, you know what he says? You've been a bad girl. You've been a bad little girl and you're getting a vigorous spanking right now. And no, it's not going to hurt me more than it hurts you. No, it's not. I'm not going to lie. It's going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me. And you earned this. You're getting a vigorous spanking because you've been a bad girl, and it has to be this way.\"\n\nAnd when Dad gets home, you know what he says? You've been a bad little girl, and you're getting a vigorous spanking right now.\n\nTUCKER CARLSON AT A TRUMP RALLY IN DULUTH, GA\n\nThe crowd went wild. And when Donald Trump came to the stage, it greeted him with rapturous cries of \"Daddy's home.\" This segment of the nation, it seems, is eager for a spanking. Or at least titillated at the prospect of  pain inflicted on others. This is not a new phenomenon within the MAGA movement, which has always been keen on the pain of those it deems wayward - but it is a florid illustration of the way patriarchal family dynamics and punishment stand at the center of contemporary right-wing morality.\n\nCarlson, of course, is hardly the first person to conceptualize the nation as a family, although he may be the first to engage in a blissed-out ode to spanking on C-SPAN. George Lakoff, linguist and philosopher , posited that conservative ideologies rely on a \"strict father\" metaphor to conceptualize the nation and how it should be ruled. In his 2006 book \"Thinking Points,\" Lakoff explained that in this model, \"The strict father is the moral authority in the family; he knows right from wrong, is inherently moral, and heads the household . ... Obedience to the father is moral; disobedience is immoral. ... When children disobey, the father is obligated to punish, providing an incentive to avoid punishment.\"\n\nAuthoritarian conservatives, Lakoff argues, apply the strict-father model \"not just to all issues but to governing itself.\" In this vision, the state and its leader adopts both absolute control and the moral necessity to punish.\n\nBut Carlson's words might have had a special resonance for a particular breed of authoritarian conservative: members of the evangelical right, who have been Trump's most loyal foot soldiers; 77% of white evangelical protestants voted for Trump in 2016 , and 85% did in 2020. Carlson - a maestro at knowingly appealing to the far-right masses - utilized a skin-crawling, sexualized misogyny in the culmination of his metaphor. But his central appeal to an angry father was consonant with a 50-year movement on the Christian right, one in which tens of millions of Americans have experienced, firsthand, the consequences of disobeying Daddy.\n\nIn the 1970s, in response to the student-led social revolutions of the 1960s - civil rights, feminism and gay rights - a newly awakened religious right created a movement designed to quash the impulses of rebellious youth. It was called \" biblical parenting .\" Its first megahit was James Dobson's incredibly cruel book \"Dare to Discipline,\" which instructed parents, in great detail, to take a \"rod of correction\"-centric approach to child rearing. Dobson, founder of the evangelical institution Focus on the Family , recommends regularly spanking children from the ages of 18 months to 10 years old, with a spanking \"of sufficient magnitude to cause tears.\" This will efficiently quash \"willful, haughty disobedience.\"\n\nPublished in 1970, the book quickly sold millions of copies and launched a movement that centered God, and the rod, in child rearing. It's a movement that has endured in millions of households across America, and across generations - leading to a new cadre of people, like the baying crowd in Duluth, for whom authoritarian principles were first nurtured in the home.\n\nFor my recently released book, \"Wild Faith: How the Christian Right is Taking Over America,\" I reviewed 50 years' worth of evangelical parenting manuals, from 1970 to 2017, and conducted  interviews with nearly 150 former evangelicals who were raised according to \"biblical parenting\" principles. Evangelicals also evince a consistently higher approval toward corporal punishment in polling than other groups, a case of successful propaganda enforced with paddles, switches, sticks and hands. The through line throughout decades of these parenting manuals, and in testimonies, was an emphasis on corporal punishment, sometimes brutal, in order to enforce, in the words of youth-centered ministry Youth With a Mission, \" instant, joyful obedience .\"\n\nIn this family model, the strict father isn't just the moral core of the household; he is also its spiritual head, with the mother as a submissive co-enforcer. Obedience to parents, according to these texts, is both a necessary prelude for and expression of obedience to God. The stakes are existentially high: One frequently cited verse is Proverbs 23:13 - \"Withhold not correction from the child: for if thou beatest him with the rod, he shall not die.\" This system coerces parents into using physical violence on their children in order to save their souls. And in an extension of Lakoff's \"strict father\" model of the nation, this model of the family, predicated on obedience enforced with physical violence, creates an authoritarian politics in its practitioners.\n\nThe best way to rebuke authoritarianism is to not just rebuke it, but to defeat it and make it look ridiculous and weak.\n\nConsider that a child who has been systemically beaten in the name of God since toddlerhood grows up to be accustomed to brutality and to exhibiting instant and joyful obedience to authority no matter how capricious or unjust. Someone who empathizes with the aggressor to survive, and is inured to brutality by repeatedly being subjected to it. When you ask what might motivate a crowd of people to cheer on the idea of a national spanking - to picture, with approval, a nation submitting to punishment by an abusive father as just and righteous, a necessary corrective to disobedience - you might not have to look any further than the kitchen tables they were raised around as kids, where wooden spoons were broken on their backs.\n\nThe best way to rebuke authoritarianism, to break the tyranny of the strict father, is to not just rebuke it, but to defeat it and make it look ridiculous and weak. Mockery and defeat undoes the authoritarian more effectively than violence. When a system is predicated on a cartoonish hypermasculinity, the solution is to treat its leaders as deserving of ridicule, not fear. And until voting ends next month, we have the chance to do just that. To disobey, with glee and en masse, the edict of this punitive would-be father. He's not our dad. He's just a man on a mission of punishment, and we can - and must - deny him that chance.\n\nTalia Lavin is a freelance writer whose work has appeared in The New Yorker, The Washington Post, GQ, The Village Voice, The New Republic and many more publications.

In his remarks, he used a good amount of time creepily dramatizing a story of what sounds like domestic violence and giving it a positive spin, drawing raucous applause from the crowd.\n\nCarlson, who's scheduled to headline an event with Trump in Arizona on Halloween, told the crowd in Georgia:\n\nThere has to be a point at which Dad comes home. Yeah, that's right. Dad comes home. And he's pissed. Dad is pissed. He's not vengeful. He loves his children. Disobedient as they may be, he loves them because they're his children. They live in his house. But he's very disappointed in their behavior and he's going to have to let them know.\n\nHe continued:\n\n'Get to your room right now and think about what you did!' And when Dad gets home, you know what he says? \"You've been a bad girl. You've been a bad little girl and you're getting a vigorous spanking right now. And no, it's not going to hurt me more than it hurts you. No, it's not. I'm not going to lie. This is going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me. And you earned this. You're getting a vigorous spanking because you've been a bad girl.'\n\nThe former Fox News host closed his speech by encouraging attendees to deny Vice President Kamala Harris' victory if she's named the winner : \"When they tell you they've won, no! You can look them straight in the face and say, 'I'm sorry. Dad's home. And he's pissed.'\"\n\nAnd when Trump walked out, attendees eerily called him \"Daddy Don\" and hollered \"Daddy's home.\"\n\nCarlson's outrageous speech - in which he described children ranging from 2 years old to 15 years old needing to be punished - prompted swift backlash online for mirroring abuser talk. I've been writing a lot lately about the MAGA movement's reliance on toxic masculinity . But few examples embody that crisis quite like this one.\n\nIt's more than a little odd that Carlson has this dramatized dialogue between an abusive father and a child so readily available in his mind. A family therapist would have a field day with that.\n\nIf you've been reading this blog, you know this is part of a pattern. Earlier this year, Carlson claimed America was in need of more fathers willing to beat up employees at their children's schools, so he seems to idolize violent father figures. Or, perhaps, just violent men in general .\n\nAs eerie as it sounded to me , I listened to this speech and thought to myself how horrifying it must've been for actual victims of domestic violence to hear this crowd of thousands cheering a made-up story of an angry father returning home to use violence against his family. I imagine there are many people - women and men - who know the experience of having an abusive husband or father and bristled at it being portrayed positively.\n\nBut this is what it looks and sounds like when a political movement is priming you for fascism . The United States is not Trump's \"house,\" and the American people are not his \"bad little girls,\" destined to live under his violent dominion.\n\nListening to his most fervent followers, though, it's clear that's the vision they have for the nation: one in which Trump is America's \"Daddy\" - a self-proclaimed protector who abuses the people he claims to protect.\n\nJa'han Jones is an MSNBC opinion blogger.

He called the expected passage of the bill \"an important day for America, and a very important day of freedom-loving countries around the world.\"\n\nThe Senate voted 80-19 on Tuesday to advance the legislation, setting up a final passage vote that's expected later in the day, or could slip to Wednesday. President Joe Biden has vowed to sign it, and it could become law within days.\n\nMcConnell, who consistently bucked loud conservative voices in his party who opposed Ukraine funding, argued that the margin of support for the war-torn country is an indication the Republican Party is tracking back to its Reaganesque roots of defending the encroachment on democracy around the world.\n\nMcConnell said he remains committed to working to help regain a Republican Senate majority, despite his plans to step back from leadership at the end of the year. He said he believes the crop of candidates the Republicans have recruited are more inclined to back away from the party's recent isolationist tendencies.\n\n\"I think we've turned the corner on the isolationist movement,\" McConnell said. \"I've noticed how uncomfortable proponents of that are when you call them isolationist. So I think we've made some progress and I think it's gonna have to continue because we got big, big problems: China, Russia, Iran. Going into World War II we just had Germany and Japan.\"\n\nThe package's difficulty in the House led to an extended period where Ukraine went without aid, primarily because of right-wing House Republicans who argued the money should not be spent abroad but instead should be spent here at home on border security. McConnell said part of the blame falls on the Biden administration for not recognizing the need earlier and reacting, but acknowledged Congress should've acted more quickly.\n\n\"Acting quicker, partially because of the administration partially because of Congress, not approving this bill sooner, has not been helpful,\" McConnell said.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican also defended House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., whose transformation from Ukraine aid skeptic to staunch supporter helped assure passage in the House. \"More important than what I think about the speaker is what the former president thinks about the speaker,\" McConnell said. \"And he obviously made it clear that he was a fan of Speaker Johnson and suggested some of his critics to shut up. So I'll just quote the former president.\"\n\nMcConnell said he feels positive about the GOP's Senate nominees so far in the battle for the majority this fall, when asked if he has the same \"candidate quality\" concerns of 2022.\n\n\"I feel pretty good about our nominees. I'm pretty confident we're going to win West Virginia. That's 50. You all can do the math. One more makes 51,\" McConnell said. \"And I hope to hand this job over to the majority leader.\"\n\nI'm a reporter for NBC News covering Capitol Hill, elections and the intersection of politics and public policy in Washington.

Tucker Carlson's creepy speech made it worse.\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Chris Hayes\n\nThis is an adapted excerpt from the Oct. 24 episode of \"All In with Chris Hayes.\"\n\nLess than 10 days to go until election and what's the message Donald Trump wants voters to take away from his campaign? Well, we got a hint of it at the former president's rally in Georgia on Wednesday, where he was joined by former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\nAfter taking the stage, Carlson described Trump as the father of the country and compared his return to the White House to a father returning home to discipline a \"bad little girl\" with a \"vigorous spanking.\"\n\nThe Republican Party is now explicitly running on a campaign of male dominion: Trump's your daddy and he stands ready to put all the \"nasty women\" in their place.\n\nThat is not just the creepy fantasizing of a disgraced TV personality or content from one of those weird right-wing podcasts. Carlson said that on a national stage as part of a Republican presidential campaign - warming up for a man whom a jury of his peers found liable for sexual abuse and defamation in a case brought by a woman who said he raped her in a dressing room.\n\nThe Republican Party is now explicitly running on a campaign of male dominion: Trump's your daddy and he stands ready to put all the \"nasty women,\" as he calls them, in their place.\n\nThe idea that this overt sexism is a viable electoral strategy has gained a lot of currency lately. Pollster John Della Volpe wrote about it in The New York Times this week: \"Aware that boasting about 'killing' Roe v. Wade drove away young women, Mr. Trump zeroed in on capturing a larger share of the young male vote.\"\n\n\"His playbook?\" Della Volpe wrote. \"A master class in bro whispering.\"\n\nDella Volpe cites Trump's embrace of cryptocurrency along with his decision to give a prime speaking spot at the Republican National Convention to UFC president Dana White, who was videotaped slapping his wife in 2022.\n\nJust as journalists once obsessed over the \"white working class,\" they're now focusing on the anxieties, and the political agency, of men. Republicans were capitalizing on this well before Vice President Kamala Harris entered the race. Think back to January, when Trump was facing a primary challenge from former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley and his disapproval ratings among women became a campaign issue.\n\nAt the time, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, one of Trump's biggest cheerleaders, told conservatives to trust the process because that was baked in: \"For every Karen we lose, there's a Julio and a Jamal ready to sign up for the MAGA movement. And that bodes well for our ability to be more diverse and to be more durable as we head into not only the rest of the primary contests but also the general election.\"\n\nMisogyny has been central to Trump's identity and, in a weird way, to his political appeal.\n\nIn a certain far-right mind, alienating women makes them more diverse, because they think it will peel off votes from Black and Latino men. It's cynical, it's gross and it's condescending. But what else are they going to do to sell Trump?\n\nAfter all, he is the man who bragged about ending Roe v. Wade, who has dozens of sexual assault allegations - including a new one this week from a woman who says Trump groped her after Jeffrey Epstein, of all people, introduced them. (Trump has denied all the sexual misconduct allegations against him.) He's a man who was convicted of 34 felonies after paying an adult film actress to stop her from divulging his extramarital affair with her (an affair he denies).\n\nMisogyny has been central to Trump's identity and, in a weird way, to his political appeal. There is a clear constituency for this kind of 14-year-old boy's idea of what manhood is. But it's just as repulsive to large swaths of the electorate, especially women.\n\nChris Hayes hosts \"All In with Chris Hayes\" at 8 p.m. ET Tuesday through Friday on MSNBC.

The physical distance seems to have been strategic. Trump has tried to publicly distance himself from Project 2025, though several of its authors were members of his administration. So perhaps some Republicans thought holding a Heritage Foundation event that's ostensibly separate from the RNC would help the GOP's effort to appear less radical.\n\nBut Monday proved that plenty of GOP power brokers are all in on Project 2025 and the politics that inspired it. Heritage Foundation CEO Kevin Roberts doubled down on Project 2025 , calling it \"a plan among a unified movement to speak on behalf of the everyday American, the forgotten American.\" In reality, it reads more like a plan to remake the government under Christian nationalist and far-right ideals that include defining heterosexual marriage as \"biblically based,\" supercharging religious exemptions to anti-discrimination laws, withdrawing Food and Drug Administration approval of abortion medication and concentrating power in the presidency.\n\nCarlson boosted these alarming ideas in his Policy Fest speech on Monday, telling the crowd the recent shooting at a Trump rally proved there is a \"spiritual battle\" underway and claimed liberals are motivated by an \"anti-human\" force that seeks to \"eliminate\" Christians. Carlson later decried the abundance of \"weak men\" unwilling to commit violence against school employees. He falsely claimed schools are trying to \"indoctrinate\" kids and turn them into \"circus freaks\" before he fantasized about harming school employees.\n\n\"In the country that I grew up in, the dad would just punch the counselor out. You know, 'Put me in jail, I don't care,'\" Carlson said, before baselessly suggesting school counselors are engaging in \"child molester stuff.\"\n\nHe continued:\n\nI just said I'm against violence, but that's, like, a very basic - that's the most basic requirement of fatherhood but also of leadership more broadly is to be willing to die for the people in your care, period. And if you're not willing to do that, you're contemptible.\n\nPolicy Fest featured several other speakers well-known among the MAGA faithful, including failed presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt and Tom Homan, acting head of Immigration and Customs Enforcement during the Trump administration. Homan, whom Trump has said he would tap for a job if he's elected again, tried to downplay Trump's authoritarian goals related to immigration. Although Trump has publicly refused to rule out building camps for mass detention as part of his campaign's vow to establish the most massive deportation effort in history , Homan claimed - without evidence - that a Trump immigration policy wouldn't include any of the things reported in the media.\n\n\"People say, 'Trump's threatening this historic deportation operation. He's going to build concentration camps. He's going to sweep neighborhoods,'\" Homan said . \"Let me be clear. None of that will happen.\"\n\nHe went on to issue a warning that seemed to apply not only to newly arriving immigrants but also to recipients of protections offered under the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals , too.\n\n\"No one's off the table,\" he said. \"If you're in the country illegally, it's not OK.

As my MSNBC colleague Zeeshan Aleem noted last year, the since-settled Dominion Voting Systems lawsuit against Fox News produced a treasure trove of communications from the network's hosts, including candid messages from Carlson that his viewers weren't aware of in real time.\n\nIn early January 2021, for example, Carlson texted , \"We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can't wait.\" He added soon after, \"I hate him passionately,\" and he confessed that he \"can't handle much more of this.\" This came on the heels of Carlson telling a colleague, in reference to Trump, \"What he's good at is destroying things. He's the undisputed world champion of that.\"\n\nThe former Fox host went on to say that he found it \"disgusting\" how many Americans believe Trump's rhetoric.\n\nReflecting on Trump's failed term, Carlson also wrote , \"We're all pretending we've got a lot to show for it, because admitting what a disaster it's been is too tough to digest. ... But come on. There isn't really an upside to Trump.\"\n\nThat was three and a half years ago. A lot has changed since. In fact, Carlson has not only taken his shtick online, he's also managed to position himself as an influential ally to the Republican he hated \"passionately.\"\n\nIt was Carlson who helped Trump choose his running mate . It was Carlson who seemed to be having a grand time at the Republican convention. And as a New York Times report noted, it was Carlson who made a return to prime time with remarks at the Republican National Convention.\n\nMr. Carlson is freshly embedded in former President Donald J. Trump's inner circle, and he delivered an unscripted monologue straight out of his old Fox News show, complete with off-color jokes and dark visions of a nation at risk of falling into tyranny should Mr. Trump not prevail in November.\n\nTo be sure, more than a few prominent Republican voices have made the transition from Trump critic to Trump sycophant. In fact, I'm aware of only one current member of the U.S. Senate who has characterized Trump as \"America's Hitler,\" and the former president just tapped him as his running mate .\n\nHas Carlson experienced a genuine change of heart, or is he opportunistically sailing on the prevailing winds in Republican Party politics? Only the right-wing host knows for sure, though his 2021 messages seem to offer a hint.\n\nEither way, however, a HuffPost report raised a point that stood out for me.\n\n[Carlson] is poised to wield tremendous influence over a second Trump administration. When Trump ... made a surprise visit to the convention on Monday, he waved at his adoring fans before making a beeline for Carlson, who was sitting in the stands, to shake his hand. Trump then walked a couple of seats over to greet his new running mate, Sen. JD Vance - a man whom Carlson told Trump to choose as the vice presidential nominee. The scene may have offered a preview of Trump's inner circle if he is to win a second term.\n\nWe don't know who the president will be next year, but if it's Trump, it's safe to say Carlson will have walk-in privileges in the Oval Office, his 2021 assessments notwithstanding.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

      "text": "The reason Vladimir Putin sat down with Tucker Carlson is obvious - and important\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThe Kremlin had its pick of the press corps to conduct Russian President Vladimir Putin's first one-on-one interview with a Western media figure since he ordered the invasion of Ukraine in 2022. But rather than have Putin sit down with The New York Times or NBC News, the BBC or Le Monde, it provided access to Tucker Carlson , who posts his videos to X and his self-named website.\n\nThat's because the Russians aren't seeking a credible interview for a mass audience. They want to target right-wing Americans with propaganda at a crucial moment when Republicans have put the prospect of future U.S. aid to Ukraine on the ropes , without needing to worry about the interviewer's forcing Putin to answer difficult questions. Carlson fits the bill perfectly.\n\nThis pretense - that only Carlson was willing to break the media blockade - fits with his broader shtick.\n\nCarlson framed the interview to his fans as an intrepid act of journalistic truth-telling. He tried to focus attention on \"why I'm interviewing\" Putin, posturing that \"corrupt\" Western reporters hadn't \"bothered\" to speak with the Russian strongman since he ordered the illegal invasion of Ukraine in 2022. This pretense - that only Carlson was willing to break the media blockade - fits with his broader shtick, which relies on presenting himself as the source for secret knowledge that mainstream journalists refuse to reveal.\n\nBut Carlson was lying. Reporters for outlets like CNN and the BBC pointed out that they had repeatedly sought their own interviews with Putin, only for their entreaties to be rejected (others noted the audacity of making such a claim when American journalists Evan Gershkovich and Alsu Kurmasheva are languishing in Russian jails for reporting from that country).\n\nIndeed, Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov subsequently acknowledged : \"Mr. Carlson is not correct. In fact, there's no way he could know this. We receive numerous requests for interviews with the president.\" Rather, Peskov explained that the Kremlin has \"no desire to communicate\" with \"traditional TV channels and large newspapers\" because they aren't \"impartial.\" Putin deigned to speak with Carlson because, by contrast, \"he has a position that differs from the rest.\"\n\nWhat is that \"position\"? Carlson touts the aesthetics and policy outcomes of ethnonationalist, illiberal autocracies that punish immigrants and LGBTQ people while castigating pluralist, liberal democracies that do not. He has turned his programs , before and after leaving Fox, into showcases for the likes of Hungary's Viktor Orbán, Poland's Andrzej Duda and Serbia's Aleksandar Vučić . Putin fits firmly within this framework. And as the host soured on America's diversity and its traditional creed in recent years, he groomed the GOP to be more sympathetic to Russia and its interests.\n\nDuring Putin-friendly Donald Trump's presidency , Carlson argued that the U.S. had no interest in deterring Russia from \"messing around\" in Eastern Europe, including the Baltic member states of NATO. He fiercely criticized U.S. military aid to Ukraine, arguing that it would only \"antagonize Russia\" and exclaiming that he was \"root[ing] for Russia\" (he later claimed to have been \"joking,\" though he added that \"we should probably take the side of Russia if we have to choose between Russia and Ukraine\").\n\nAs Western intelligence agencies warned in late 2021 and early 2022 of Russian troops massing on the Ukrainian border, Carlson alternated between offering passionate defenses of Putin, arguing that the Russian president \"just wants to keep his western border secure,\" and scoffing at the possibility of a Russian invasion. Once Russia invaded in February 2022, Carlson pivoted to blaming the war on Ukraine and President Joe Biden and doing everything in his power to convince his viewers that aiding Ukraine wasn't in America's interest.\n\nThe Kremlin's assessment that Carlson's coverage helped its interests was correct.\n\nCarlson's pro-Russia coverage of its invasion of Ukraine drew harsh criticism from Democrats, some Republicans and other media figures, and it even reportedly \"disturbed\" Fox founder Rupert Murdoch. But he did have fans within the Kremlin's propaganda apparatus.\n\nMother Jones' David Corn reported in March 2023 that a Russian government agency had distributed a memo to Russian media outlets urging them \"to use as much as possible fragments of broadcasts of the popular Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who sharply criticizes the actions of the United States [and] NATO, their negative role in unleashing the conflict in Ukraine, [and] the defiantly provocative behavior from the leadership of the Western countries and NATO towards the Russian Federation and towards President Putin, personally.\"\n\nBy that point, clips from Carlson's show had become regular features of Russian propaganda channels, which sought to highlight - and generate - dissent within Western nations. As the war continued, a Carlson-Kremlin feedback loop emerged: Reports from Russian government news outlets would get parroted by the Fox host, then clips of his reports would air on other Russian state outlets. When Fox kicked Carlson to the curb last year, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov denounced the decision , while a prominent pro-Putin host for Russian state TV said his network would \"happily offer you a job if you wish to carry on as a presenter and host.\"\n\nThe Kremlin's assessment that Carlson's coverage helped its interests was correct. At Fox, he was among the GOP's most influential figures and had a huge audience; he used that platform as a clearinghouse for pro-Russia talking points that undermined support for Ukraine within the Republican Party. There is no one - save perhaps Trump - more responsible for the GOP's rising opposition to providing Ukraine with military aid, which remains stuck in Congress as the conflict has turned into a war of attrition .\n\nSo while Carlson wants people to focus on why he sought an interview with Putin, the real question is why Putin wanted to sit down with him. The answer is both obvious and important - he expects Carlson to make him a more popular figure on the American right and boost his war of conquest in the process.\n\nMatt Gertz is a senior fellow at Media Matters for America, a progressive research center that monitors the U.S. media.

Trump after the former president's dramatic entrance in the convention hall on Monday, and cameras later caught them joking together in Mr. Trump's friends and family box, just two seats apart.

Several thousand people - almost all of whom have paid for the privilege, some as much as $1,600 - will pack into a hockey arena to watch the former Fox News host Tucker Carlson interview Mr. Vance, the Republican Party's vice-presidential nominee.\n\nThe money made from the event will not go to the Trump campaign but to Mr. Carlson's new media company, which made headlines earlier this month when Mr. Carlson aired - and praised - the views of a Nazi apologist historian who has argued that concentration camps were a \"humane\" solution to widespread hunger. \"Didn't expect Tucker Carlson to become an outlet for Nazi apologetics, but here we are,\" the conservative talk radio host Erick Erickson wrote on X.\n\nEven as Democrats and Republicans denounced Mr. Carlson, Mr. Vance refused to join the chorus, declaring that he would still appear with Mr. Carlson in Hershey because \"we believe in free speech and debate.\"\n\nBut Mr. Vance's decision to stand with Mr. Carlson isn't about free speech or even loyalty. Instead, it's a stark reminder of where power resides in the Make America Great Again movement, and where it will likely stay in the years to come. And it's not with JD Vance.\n\nMr. Carlson had the highest-rated show in the history of cable news, and when he was abruptly fired from Fox News last year, it was widely assumed he would fade from relevance. He did - for many Americans, especially liberals. After his disappearance from Fox News's lineup, the army of liberal media monitors devoted to chronicling his every provocation and outrage turned their attention elsewhere. The Tucker Carlson content farm went fallow.\n\nBut he didn't go away. Six weeks after leaving Fox News, he debuted a new show on the social media platform then known as Twitter (now X); last December he launched the Tucker Carlson Network, a streaming service that today claims to have over 400,000 paid subscribers. Mr. Carlson's podcast now regularly sits in the top five of Spotify's weekly podcast rankings and occasionally even beats \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" for the top spot.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Peters Michael S. Schmidt and Jim Rutenberg\n\nA text message sent by Tucker Carlson that set off a panic at the highest levels of Fox on the eve of its billion-dollar defamation trial showed its most popular host sharing his private, inflammatory views about violence and race.\n\nThe discovery of the message contributed to a chain of events that ultimately led to Mr. Carlson's firing.\n\nIn the message, sent to one of his producers in the hours after violent Trump supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, Mr. Carlson described how he had recently watched a video of a group of men - Trump supporters, he said - violently attacking \"an Antifa kid.\"\n\nIt was \"three against one, at least,\" he wrote.\n\nAnd then he expressed a sense of dismay that the attackers, like him, were white.\n\n\"Jumping a guy like that is dishonorable obviously,\" he wrote.\n\n\"It's not how white men fight,\" he said. But he said he found himself for a moment wanting the group to kill the person he had described as the Antifa kid.\n\nA couple of weeks ago, I was watching video of people fighting on the street in Washington. A group of Trump guys surrounded an Antifa kid and started pounding the living shit out of him. It was three against one, at least. Jumping a guy like that is dishonorable obviously. It's not how white men fight. Yet suddenly I found myself rooting for the mob against the man, hoping they'd hit him harder, kill him. I really wanted them to hurt the kid. I could taste it. Then somewhere deep in my brain, an alarm went off: this isn't good for me. I'm becoming something I don't want to be. The Antifa creep is a human being. Much as I despise what he says and does, much as I'm sure I'd hate him personally if I knew him, I shouldn't gloat over his suffering. I should be bothered by it. I should remember that somewhere somebody probably loves this kid, and would be crushed if he was killed.

Will Fox Let Him?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nIn conversations with his associates, Mr. Carlson has expressed interest in getting back to work before the agreement expires.\n\nBy Jeremy W. Peters and Benjamin Mullin\n\nTucker Carlson is making it clear to people close to him that he would like to be back on the air somewhere soon. But he first needs Fox News to agree to a deal that would allow him to work elsewhere, according to three people with knowledge of the discussions, leaving it unclear whether he will be able to start a new chapter in his media career before his current contract expires in January 2025.\n\nSince Mr. Carlson was taken off the air by Fox News last week, his lawyers have been in touch with Fox to negotiate an agreement to set the terms of his departure. And he has been the subject of unofficial courting by right-wing media outlets who've let it be known they would hire him if they could.\n\nBut a swirl of embarrassing disclosures about the prime time host's private remarks have cast a shadow over those discussions.\n\nSome of Mr. Carlson's allies have accused the network of being behind the disclosures. Fox insists that it doesn't like the leaks any more than Mr. Carlson does and is considering taking legal action to stop them.\n\nOn early Friday, lawyers for Fox sent a cease-and-desist letter to Media Matters for America, a longtime Fox critic that recently published leaked, behind-the-scenes video from Mr. Carlson's set. That footage has shown Mr. Carlson making sexist and boorish statements and fuming with hatred toward the lawyer who questioned him in a 10-hour deposition that was part of the billion-dollar defamation suit filed against Fox by Dominion Voting Systems.\n\nIn its letter, Fox lawyers said that the videos had been \"unlawfully obtained.\"\n\n\"That unaired footage is Fox's confidential intellectual property,\" the letter said. \"Fox did not consent to its distribution or publication; and Fox does not consent to its further distribution or publication.\"\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Why Eric Adams Went on Tucker Carlson's Show\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nEric Adams is on a press tour that would make Timothée Chalamet blush, blitzing longform sit-down podcast video interviews opposite dudes . You wouldn't call it getting out in front of things, exactly. Adams has already been indicted in one of at least five federal investigations ; his legal troubles are now matched by his political troubles-his favorability ratings have hit rock bottom , and his polling is even worse . If Andrew Cuomo gets in the New York mayoral race (and there is lots of speculation he will), it looks as if it'll be over for Adams . It might be over for Adams regardless.\n\nIn any case, the mayor has taken time out of his busy schedule of hitting the club and cutting the budget to clear the air. And what better way, for the cause of purification, than going on Tucker Carlson's online show.\n\nLet's just establish this from the outset: Adams has spent much of his political life as a registered Republican . He has also been dogged by allegations of corruption for nearly as long as he's been in politics.\n\nHe staked his unlikely political rise to the mayor's office in 2021 on a GOP tried and true: a crime panic. Lawbreaking was out of control in NYC, at least according to the New York Post , and only a former police officer could get tough on the poor, the turnstile-hoppers, and the homeless. Conservative media cheered his position, as did some center-left pundits.\n\nBeing \"tough on crime\" has worked for conservative politicians for decades, and it worked for Adams too. But quickly, Adams' actual conservative policies and resolute unseriousness about governance knocked him out of the public's good graces.\n\nLooking for another powerless scapegoat on which to pin the mess of his administration, and to cover up vicious and unnecessary cuts to popular social programs, Adams joined a conservative ensemble training its ire on immigrants and asylum-seekers and creating more unfounded panic, around migrant crime specifically . This, Adams believes, was the beginning of the end of his relationship with the Democratic Party, at least according to the version of events he tells Carlson. Not because his efforts were mean-spirited, cynical, unnecessary, or beset by poor leadership, but because he was engaged in such a brave act of truth-telling that it created huge political liabilities for Democrats who were captive to Big Immigrant. In Adams' version of the tale, it was then and only then that the politicized Justice Department came knocking, and clapped the cuffs on Adams .\n\n\"I read through the indictment ... I thought it was ridiculous,\" is how Carlson begins the interview. \"You were indicted for accepting upgraded flights.\"\n\nOf course, Adams' Turkish Airlines account is only the funniest piece of a litany of infractions for which he was indicted. One small problem with the interview, which was branded as \"Tucker Challenges Eric Adams,\" is that Carlson never once, in the 51-minute sit-down, mentions the straw-donor campaign scheme for which Adams has been charged.\n\nThat would lead to some inconvenient issues regarding Adams' version of this story. Long before he was the only Democrat brave enough to call out crime or immigrants, he was allegedly funding his campaign through an elaborate series of falsely reported donations. One of those straw donors pleaded guilty earlier this month.\n\nCampaign-finance infractions are grave enough as is; in Adams' case, they're particularly offensive because of his city's public matching program. The initiative, which matches small-dollar donations up to $250 from city residents at a rate of up to eight times the original amount, is one of the most well-intentioned, pro-democracy civic procedures in American politics, a meaningful bulwark against big money buying elections.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Adams' campaign conspired to funnel illegal donations from foreign nationals into his campaign coffers and encouraged business leaders to circumvent contribution limits by instructing their employees to donate, then reimbursing them. In doing so, Adams also availed himself of millions of dollars in public matching funds.\n\nIn short, the tough-on-crime mayor got into Gracie Mansion not just by abusing public trust but by allegedly stealing money from the public purse. Carlson does not dwell on this, perhaps because that's not a Republican no-no. Adams claims that New York's immigration surge was a financial drain on the city's resources, which is true, and that the federal support was insufficient, which is also likely. What he doesn't even try to back up is that his slashing of library hours and 3-K or the termination of outdoor dining had anything to do with this.\n\nWhich leads to Adams' third and (perhaps) final, well-worn Republican plaint: The Democratic Party left him. \"People often say, 'Well, you don't sound like a Democrat,' \" Adams confides to Carlson. \"No. Well, the party left me, and it left working-class people.\"\n\nIf you have a politician who talks like a Republican, governs like a Republican, and in fact was a Republican before he was a Democrat, well ... he might just be angling for a pardon from a Republican president. Or maybe he wants to join Donald Trump's Cabinet or, if worst comes to worst, to be a TV anchor in a new Republican media venture. A better question than \"Did the Democratic Party leave Eric Adams?\" is \"Why on earth did the Democratic Party get into bed with this guy in the first place?\"\n\nCarlson posits the interview as a sign that Trump's theory of the world has broken through, now undeniable even for Democrats; \"New York Mayor Eric Adams Sounds a Lot Like a Trump Voter\" is the name of the segment. What the interview actually shows, instead, is proof that there are at least two prominent Republicans from New York who will say anything to avoid consequences for their own corruption.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "My Profane, Revealing Year Working for Tucker Carlson\n\n\"They'd need a forklift to get her on the ticket!\"\n\nTwenty-one years ago, that was Tucker Carlson's response to my take on who I thought was likely to be the Democrats' 2004 vice presidential candidate. I had been trying to be clever, to impress him. We were talking presidential politics-or I was, and he was patiently listening-and I had him to myself. I didn't anticipate Tucker's reply about the U.S. senator I suggested, but I should have. Almost everything I ever heard out of his mouth in the year that I worked for him was a frat-style joke.\n\nTucker's abrupt dismissal from Fox News this week has me revisiting that year of my life. And the details emerging from a pending lawsuit over the toxic atmosphere on his production team tell me that what's new is old. Over the last two decades, the jokes have moved from a female politician's weight to, reportedly, debates about which one his staff would prefer to sleep with. In other words, little about the man's sense of humor has changed.\n\nTucker's forklift quip came as he drove me across town in his blue Audi from CNN's D.C. bureau to the George Washington University to film the show that employed us both. From 2002 to 2003 I was a young research producer for Crossfire , which meant I was one of a small team in charge of on-air factual accuracy and content for the hosts: James Carville and Paul Begala \"on the Left,\" and Bob Novak and Tucker \"on the Right.\" With few exceptions, each nightly debate put one from each ideological corner into a full hour of exchange with each other and with newsworthy guests. (A representative for Tucker Carlson did not respond to a request for comment on this article.)\n\nIn the post -Crossfire years, Begala and Carville remained fixtures within the Washington punditry, and in 2009 Novak passed away. But Tucker moved on to become the most powerful conservative cultural figure on television, occupying Fox News' 8 p.m. time slot until last Friday . In that role he was the most prominent peddler of the idea that Democrats (and, more generally, the political left) were plotting a long-term electoral strategy to disempower white Americans and supplant them with immigrants and people of color-a \" great replacement \" of one race by another.\n\nWith his return to prime-time during the Trump era, Tucker became notorious for overt anti-immigrant and often racist rhetoric. But this demagoguery didn't sprout out of nowhere; it was present during the Crossfire years too, just as a sarcastic and even prank-like part of his future persona. Tucker (the Crossfire staff addressed all four hosts by their first names, at their insistence) was in his early 30s when I worked there, but while even then he was honing the same cynicism and faux outrage familiar to audiences now-alongside his uniquely performed look of practiced confusion-he also appeared to be having great fun.\n\nMost of us at Crossfire were. James' nickname for me (for reasons I never learned) was \"fuck-stick.\" Paul had a foul mouth too, as well as a quick temper, but was unceasingly loyal, down to the youngest production assistant. Bob was nearly as humorless off-air as on, but he clearly enjoyed telling younger staffers like me about his days covering Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon. Far from serious-minded debate, some of our best-rated shows were our silliest. When I left, the staff and hosts presented me with a T-shirt from Kentucky Fried Chicken, signed by all to commemorate our frequent segments on the merit or the horror (take your pick) of what was at the time a mild controversy around requiring fast-food companies to provide nutritional labels. The unspoken nickname for Sam Feist -the show's producer, now CNN's D.C. bureau chief-was the \"corporate butt-boy.\" Unspoken except by James, who coined the term and used it to Sam's face.\n\nTucker was closer to my age than to Paul's, and an entire generation younger than James and Bob. With the young staff, men or women, he was like the president of an Ivy League eating club, regaling the pledges like me with stories of smoking pot and throwing tennis balls at his dog on his off-days from the show. Filling us in on D.C. gossip-say, which married, prominent personality he claimed was sleeping with which young political reporter. Suggesting that columnist Maureen Dowd hated men because the actor Michael Douglas had once dated and then dumped her. This was a theory of Dowd's writing also put forward by Rush Limbaugh-for all I know Tucker took it from Rush, but to my young (and, I have to acknowledge, starry-eyed) self, it was all Tucker being Tucker. In a city where hundreds of twentysomething staffers go to work every day for the prominent and would-be-famous, Tucker was a lot more fun and interesting to work around than the senators and members of Congress employing most of my friends.\n\nAnd anyway, none of Tucker's crassness was particularly a secret. Writing about Monica Lewinsky in his 2003 book Politicians, Partisans, and Parasites, Tucker described her as \"nice enough, though whatever it was that Clinton saw in her remained invisible to me. I couldn't imagine her wearing a thong. I couldn't imagine wanting to see it.\"\n\nThere was also the occasional ethnic barb, too. One regular guest on the show during the build-up to the Iraq war was a physically large scholar of Middle Eastern origin. Tucker's response every time the bookers told him the man would be a guest that night was to ask who knew that hummus had so many calories.\n\nThis all translated onto the air too, where Tucker had an impish knack for putting his private jokes directly into the program. I once convinced him to tease an upcoming segment on the French resistance to the invasion of Iraq with a line from The Simpsons : \"We are going to take a quick break: The Simpsons calls the French \"cheese-eating surrender monkeys.' ... In a minute, more on the country that hates the U.S. all the time.\"\n\nMore prescient was the way Tucker mixed those jokes with race. His favorite way to introduce one regular debate guest, the Rev. Al Sharpton, was as a \"leading contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2004.\" Sharpton at the time was sort of a B-team version of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, and he had a past. During his regular Crossfire appearances, he was also in a legal dispute about media airings of old FBI videos showing him discussing a potential drug deal with an undercover agent. Tucker loved this, and loved having Sharpton on the air. Off the air, he would laugh about this line over and again as he wrote it into his segment introductions (Paul and Tucker wrote their own scripts, James and Bob largely did not). \"He's the perfect Democrat,\" he would say, giggling. It wasn't until Paul pulled me aside and chastised me for giggling too that I understood what was happening. As Paul put it, Tucker knew \"exactly what he was doing\" by insinuating that liberals are tied to Black, perhaps drug-linked, radicalism.\n\nTo be complete, I will say that Tucker was exceedingly kind to me personally. He sent us all handwritten Christmas cards for the two holidays I was at CNN, and in my case a bottle of Dom Perignon when I got engaged. After I left, he sent me a copy of George Orwell's The Road to Wigan Pier , which was at the time his favorite book. \"Orwell was a great man,\" he wrote to me. And even after I had gone, Tucker thanked me and other staff in the introduction to the Partisans book.\n\nIn that same book, Tucker described at length the role of producers like Feist who push hosts like himself into extreme positions. \"A good producer,\" he writes, \"can smell nuance from a hundred yards ... he knows when you're starting to question the basic rightness of your case. That's when he begins his pep talk. 'Look,' he'll say calmly, 'no one expects you to defend what [Oklahoma City bomber Timothy] McVeigh did ... You're just making the point that it's not the government's business how many blasting caps you buy or how much ammonium nitrate fertilizer you stockpile.' \"\n\nA substantial portion of Tucker's TV persona has been derived from that kind of production. He found unparalleled success as a right-wing ideologue and that's where he took his career. But that's not to say it goes against his personal instincts. The McVeigh example may be extreme, but it's a helpful insight into what Tucker became-and the Fox show he built around himself. I remember one Crossfire episode where we were trying to book a debate about drunk-driving laws, and one guest was the national president of Mothers Against Drunk Driving. Our producers had absolutely no trouble convincing Tucker to go hard against that MADD mom. He was genuinely offended by what he called the \"moral blackmail\" of grieving parents using their grief to guilt the rest of us into changing public policy. He , Tucker, didn't do anything wrong, so why did the guest expect him to agree with her?\n\nIn the years since, it was exactly that pliable, televised ability to get him himself offended by the idea that he and others like him might be part of any problem that helped make him so dangerous. Consider his take on Ukraine earlier last spring: \"It may be worth asking yourself, since it is getting pretty serious, what is this really about? Why do I hate Putin so much? Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him?\"\n\nTucker was no philosopher. When I knew him, he disliked liberals as much as liberal ism , but it was as much because he suspected that liberals just don't have any fun as any particular objection to the left itself. He preferred conservatives mostly because he was white and he was wealthy-and the right happened to meet him at the places, like race and abortion, that he took for himself, rather than any special affinity for tenets or ideology. In Politicians, he describes his tobacco addiction not simply in personal terms but with the same impish resistance to being told what to do that he did for our MADD show or, more recently, with race: \"Pro-health propaganda never once detracted from my enjoyment of tobacco.\"\n\nAnd that's just it: Tucker made it fun to hate. He gave men permission to laugh at today's version of his Sharpton jokes and his weight jokes and the idea of Maureen Dowd writing columns critical of Bill Clinton's affairs because she had privately had her heart broken. What's important in the Trump and post-Trump era is that Tucker said on-air now what he kept off-air then.\n\nIn those days his on-air persona was less overt: more of a televised bewilderment that anyone could possibly think racism was still a problem in contemporary America. It had yet to become the incendiary white nationalism of 2016 and beyond.\n\nBut the act Tucker honed since his Crossfire days was to make both what is right and wrong according to the worldview of white men seem so entirely obvious . Tucker stoked a conviction that white Americans need to mind with urgent clarity everything from the takeover of the country by people of color to massive overreach by an incompetent government.\n\nThis is the conspiracy, anger, and extremism behind \"replacement.\" What Tucker suggested every night is that they're doing it right in front of our faces.\n\nWe should have listened to Jon Stewart. I left the show shortly before Stewart's now-famous takedown of the Crossfire format and of Tucker in particular. But I met Stewart before I left, when I stood with two of the Crossfire bookers in the hallway of the D.C. bureau as they pleaded with him, after he appeared on another CNN show, to join Crossfire as a guest too.\n\nStewart's primary complaint-and his reason for demurring as long as he did-was exactly what he said when he ultimately went on the air. Crossfire was \" hurting America .\" Tucker in particular. And the specific objection in that hallway had nothing to do with partisan politics but with our way of sensationalizing pain and glorifying loud dissent. As an example, Stewart pointed to a special we ran during the horror of the D.C. sniper killings. The special was called \"Sniper on the loose: A Crossfire town meeting.\" Stewart was right-once we put the word sniper alongside the show title without irony, the show had become sensationalism.\n\nFor that reason alone, Stewart said in the hallway, he would never appear on Crossfire . When he eventually relented, he all but destroyed that particular show simply by showing up in person to call it ridiculous. At the time, what Stewart was critiquing was the format and programming. But I think what he was onto was a fear that Tucker might just go forward, and if he did, he could succeed at bringing his deliberately villainous persona with him. If Tucker Carlson had never existed, the showrunner of a Netflix satire on boarding school brats or over-the-top media blowhards would have had to invent him. And then we'd all laugh the way we did at a President Meryl Streep .\n\nExcept, really, none of it is a joke.\n\nWhat scares me now is not that the Tucker I knew was kind to his support staff, silly enough to choose the word \"bowtie\" as his computer password, irritable enough to complain about the smell of Bob Novak's microwave popcorn, young enough to trade gossip with the even younger staff, and self-conscious enough to use rubber bands to keep his dress socks up under his khakis. Nor even that Tucker somehow morphed into an powerful right-wing nationalist whipping Americans into a fervor.\n\nWhat scares me is that it's not who Tucker is that matters. It's what he made possible. At Crossfire , it was smaller stuff that crossed boundaries behind the scenes and pushed limits on-air. At Fox, the antics were crueler, the audience bigger, and the impact more consequential. It was Tucker doing what he always had: making money by telling millions of people what they wanted to hear and already believed. The only question now is: What comes next?\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Tucker Carlson's Scaremongering Somehow Made Donald Trump Seem Levelheaded\n\nIn the interview posted on X, the website formerly known as Twitter, at the same time as the Republican presidential debate Wednesday night, former President Donald Trump was boasting about his poll numbers when Tucker Carlson suddenly cut him off.\n\n\"Can I ask you-that gets back to my original question,\" he said. \"If the protests didn't work, and you got elected anyway; the impeachment didn't work, twice; indictment is not working ... If you chart it out, it's an escalation, is what I'm saying. So what's next, after trying to put you in prison for the rest of your life? That's not working. Don't they have to kill you now?\"\n\nTrump didn't respond directly. \"I think the people of our country don't get enough credit for how smart they are,\" he said. \"They get it. I got indicted four times. All trivial. Nonsense. Bullshit. It's all bullshit.\"\n\nIt was the second time Carlson had brought up the strong likelihood, from his perspective, that they were going to try to kill Trump. Over the course of the 46-minute interview, Carlson emphasized, repeatedly, the looming danger from the left. It was an odd conversation in part because Trump didn't seem to want to follow him down that particular path. Trump was eager to talk about the stolen election or the failures of the Democrats or Joe Biden's senility, but he had little apparent enthusiasm for Carlson's questions about the prospect of civil war. It was, oddly, an interview that served, unintentionally, to make Donald Trump seem reasonable.\n\nThe specter of political violence first arose-in what was almost certainly the strangest moment of the interview-five minutes into the interview. In the first few minutes, Trump had addressed his decision not to attend the RNC debate: \"I'm leading by 50 and 60 points and some of them are at 1 and 0 and 2, and I'm saying, do I sit there for an hour or two hours or whatever it's going to be and get harassed?\" He then discussed the failures of cable news and his disdain for Chris Christie and Asa Hutchinson.\n\nThen, Trump was explaining why his next administration would be staffed with more loyal people than the \"Bushies\" he had dealt with before. Carlson abruptly interrupted him.\n\nCarlson: This is kind of far afield. But it was just interesting. I read Barr's account of this time; he wrote a book about it, his autobiography. And in it he lies about Jeffrey Epstein's death. Clearly lies. Do you think Epstein killed himself, sincerely?\n\nTrump: I don't know. I will say he was a fixture in Palm Beach. I don't know what Barr said about it either. I have no idea what he said. What did he say, that he killed himself?\n\nCarlson: He said he killed himself and they were going to do this investigation, and they never did the investigation. And it's never been public, and they hid it, and, like, why are they doing that?\n\nBy now, Carlson was animated, talking over Trump as the former president tried to respond. Carlson insisted, again, that Barr was covering up Epstein's death.\n\nWhen Trump was finally able to respond, he launched into a rant about Barr's failure to investigate \"election fraud\"-never responding directly to Carlson's question. But Carlson wasn't letting it go.\n\nCarlson: Do you think it was possible that Epstein was killed?\n\nTrump: Oh sure, it's possible. I mean I don't really believe it-I think he probably committed suicide. He had a life with beautiful homes and beautiful everything, and all of a sudden he's incarcerated and not doing very well. I would say he did. But there are those people, there are many people-I think you're one of them, right? But a lot of people think that he was killed. He knew a lot on a lot of people.\n\n\"He was killed,\" Carlson said firmly. Then he appeared to relent slightly. \"I think. I think the closer you look-I'm not a conspiracy person at all. I believe everything I hear.\" But he wasn't done. He smiled momentarily. \"But yeah, I mean the closer you look into it ...\"\n\nTrump, again, didn't go for Carlson's line. \"A case could be made either way,\" he said, \"but it certainly wasn't the most well-run place,\" he said in reference to the Manhattan jail where Epstein was kept.\n\nIf it seemed odd that Carlson was grilling Trump about Jeffrey Epstein, the host finally made his point clear. \"The reason I'm asking you is I'm looking at the trajectory since 2015,\" he said. \"It started with protests against you, massive protests, organized protests by the left, and then it moved to impeachment next, and then indictment. I mean the next stage is violence. Are you worried that they're trying to kill you? Why wouldn't they try to kill you, honestly?\"\n\nTrump again did not answer directly. \"They're savage animals. They're people that are sick, really sick. You have great people in the Democrat Party. ... I represent everybody; I'm the president of everybody. But I've seen what they do, the lengths they go to.\" He then began discussing the Russia investigation and the Mueller report. He never returned to the topic of left-wing violence.\n\nTrump did have his strange and very Trumpian moments. He made an oddly gendered attack on Asa Hutchinson. (\"I call him Ada Hutchinson.\" \"Why do you call him Ada?\" \"You know I could tell you, but I don't want to get myself in trouble. But he's weak and pathetic.\") He repeated many election fraud lies. He railed about crime. He ranted about the Panama Canal at some length. (\"It should have never been given to Panama; we should have had it.\") He seemed to blame Biden for the Russia invasion of Ukraine. But he didn't appear quite as extreme as Carlson.\n\nOr as mean as Carlson. At one point, Trump started mocking Joe Biden for being physically frail. He quipped that \"there's somebody there who thinks he looks fabulous at a beach; I think he looks horrible.\" But it was Carlson's blurting out \"skinny legs\" that seemed particularly personal. At another point, Trump mocked Kamala Harris' rhetorical style, asserting she speaks in \"rhyme.\" Carlson jumped in: \"She seems pretty senile, too.\" When Trump brought up a debate moderated by Chris Wallace, Carlson said: \"Bitchy little man.\" Trump then said that Wallace \"didn't have the talent of his father.\" Carlson kept going, on his own tangent: \"A little fussy man.\" And when Trump mentioned the call in which Hillary Clinton conceded the 2016 election, Carlson was gleeful: \"Did her voice crack?\"\n\nCarlson also repeatedly egged on Trump, urging him to trash Biden. When Trump was talking about his own experience with foreign leaders, Carlson cut in with, \"What do you think [Kim Jong-un] and Xi and Putin think of Biden?\" When Trump returned to his own experience with Kim, Carlson steered the conversation back: \"So you think the rest of the world is looking at Biden and thinks someone else has got to be running the government?\"\n\nHe also teed Trump up to attack Mike Pence, repeatedly asking him why Pence was not faithful to him during the certification of the 2020 election. While Trump peddled his same lies about the election, he didn't go after his former vice president, stating instead that \"I think he got very bad advice.\"\n\nIn his last question, Carlson asked Trump if \"we're moving towards civil war.\"\n\nTrump, rather than agree, praised the people who were at the Jan. 6 insurrection as peaceful patriots, while also boasting about the size of the crowd-it was the same Trump as always. But, still, next to Carlson, he seemed measured.\n\n\"So do you think it's possible there's open conflict?\" Carlson said, unable to let Trump's positive note be the final one. \"We seem to be moving towards something.\"\n\n\"I don't know,\" Trump said. \"I don't know.\" Then he finally seemed to give Carlson a bit of what he wanted. \"I can say this: There's a level of passion I've never seen. There's a level of hatred that I've never seen. And that's probably a bad combination.\"\n\nCarlson nodded. \"Donald Trump, thank you.\"\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" Trump said. The interview had ended.\n\nBut Carlson couldn't help himself. \"That is a very bad combination, by the way.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "How the Right Won Podcasting\n\nFor decades, American liberals have been waiting for a presidential election without the red-cast shadow of Rush Limbaugh. Between 1984 and 2021, the megawatt talk-radio star hosted the most popular program in the country. An estimated 15.5 million people tuned in to The Rush Limbaugh Show every day to listen to him parrot a comprehensive list of Republican talking points, and many of them internalized his uniquely cranky brand of conservatism. With his thumb finally off the scale following his death from lung cancer-related complications, some hoped that the audio monopoly of conservative media was finally breaking. Maybe, just maybe, a reliable progressive could step up to the plate and reshape the American airwaves.\n\nThree years after Limbaugh's death, it's clear that those dreams haven't come true. Terrestrial radio might not be as important to American psychology as it once was, but that's only because conservatives have taken their talents elsewhere: to radio's heir, podcasting. Scroll through Spotify's Top Podcasts chart these days, and, at any given moment, at least half of the most popular shows are hosted by figures friendly to the MAGA cause. As of this writing, Tucker Carlson's show is the fourth most-listened-to show on the platform, while anti-woke entrepreneur Patrick Bet-David lingers a few rungs below him, and Candace Owens sits comfortably between them both. Further down you can find firebrands like Charlie Kirk, Ben Shapiro, and Dan Bongino cranking out new shows every day. Similarly, Joe Rogan, with his eternally inscrutable, RFK Jr.-adjacent brand of populism , continues to dominate the top spot, while a variety of other comedians forged in Rogan's fratty mold-Theo Von, Andrew Schulz-round out the list. Even if these podcasters don't market themselves as explicitly political, many of them have recently welcomed Trump to their respective shows as part of the former president's outreach to the podcasts' core demographic of disaffected young men. Tony Hinchcliffe, another comedian turned podcaster in this milieu, was even invited to speak at Trump's Madison Square Garden rally this past Sunday. ( It went poorly. )\n\nTellingly, members of the reliably liberal podcasting commentariat are few and far between on the charts alongside their opposition. The long-running Pod Save America , famously founded by a quartet of former Obama staffers, is currently stalled out somewhere in the 30s and 40s, while Ezra Klein, the patron saint of liberal wonks, is sitting outside the top 50. At its advent, podcasting appeared to be the realm of Warby Parker-bespectacled urban millennials, but this is no longer the industry of Serial or Savage Love . While podcast charts are admittedly fluid and not exactly consistent-Apple's top chart looks different from Spotify's, for instance-and the calculations behind each of them are nearly inscrutable to outsiders, today's dominance of a certain type of podcast is hard to refute. (Spotify did not respond to a request for comment on the data behind the platform's Top Podcasts chart, or on how conservative-leaning podcasts appear to dominate much of the ranking.)\n\nThe age of Rogan is firmly upon us, and it's not ending anytime soon.\n\nAnalysts aren't sure how the right wing achieved such a stranglehold on the podcast industry, but many have conceded that the grasp conservatives held over the airwaves during the Limbaugh era has proven to be surprisingly durable. \"They were dominant in the 1990s with talk radio and Fox, and then they replicated what they had with a different medium,\" said Angelo Carusone, president of the left-leaning watchdog Media Matters for America. Republicans have adjusted their news-gathering habits accordingly-according to data from the Pew Research Center , 46 percent of conservative podcast listeners say they trust the news they hear in their audio diet more than news from other sources, compared to just 19 percent of Democrats.\n\nIt makes sense. The American conservative movement and its corresponding media arm have historically been defined by an unquenchable thirst for the counternarrative. National Review, one of the country's leading conservative publications, was born in 1955 due to right-wing author and political commentator William F. Buckley Jr.'s insistence that the other publications on the newsstand-the Nation and the New Republic in particular-were tainted with a bone-deep pinko bias. (He gathered a team of libertarians and anti-communists in order to, in his words, stand \"athwart history, yelling, 'Stop. ' \") Nicole Hemmer, author of multiple books about right-wing media, told Slate that Buckley's fundamental thesis has been integral to the reactionary cause ever since: In order to identify as a conservative in the United States, one must ravenously consume explicitly branded conservative news, while the same does not necessarily hold for liberals.\n\n\"It's much more central to Republican politics compared to the inverse,\" Hemmer said. \"There isn't a sense that, like, Rachel Maddow commands millions of voters. Liberals have a different media diet. They aren't seeking out whoever the left-wing equivalent of Candace Owens is.\"\n\nBut while the conservative podcast apparatus shares heritage with the columnists and talk-radio cranks of yore, it isn't bound by the same dictums and restraints. Unlike terrestrial broadcasting, podcasts are not regulated by the Federal Communications Commission , meaning that there is no check on a show's ability to spread misinformation. The ramifications of that shift have already become clear. When the Brookings Institution audited 8,000 political podcast episodes in 2021 , it estimated that more than one-tenth of the sample were potentially espousing false reporting. Naturally, in another study published by Brookings, the research found that the podcasts most likely to share unsupported claims were almost exclusively ideologically conservative . The leading culprit in that study was Steve Bannon's War Room , a repository for QAnon-esque charges on everything from the COVID vaccine to the patents held by Bill Gates. Nearly 20 percent of his episodes were found to contain \"false, misleading, or unsubstantiated statements.\" In an ominous symptom of that trend, a Pew report from 2023 found that 40 percent of Republican podcast listeners agree that the news they gather from their podcast diet covers stories \"they wouldn't have heard elsewhere.\"\n\nHemmer agreed that as the conservative media nucleus has migrated to the podcast charts, it has breached some of the guardrails that once kept it connected to reality. In particular, she's been paying close attention to Tucker Carlson, whose wingnut tendencies have intensified since striking out on his own. \"His podcast allows him to be crazy in a way he hasn't been before. He's talking quite explicitly about demons, in an Alex Jones type of way,\" said Hemmer. She pointed to an episode last year where Carlson interviewed a convicted felon who claimed to have had sex with Barack Obama. That segment would've almost certainly been quashed by even the editorial firewalls at Fox, but in the lawless content ecosystems of 2024, it furthers Carlson's overarching promise to his listeners: No matter what he says, he will remain eternally un-canceled.\n\nIn that sense, the sheer unaccountability of the podcast medium doubles as the primary allure for a conservative media industry-and an audience of conservative consumers-existentially concerned with their own autonomy. More than anything else, this lack of oversight is what keeps some analysts up at night. If right-wing thought leadership is being delegated to an unmoderated, unchecked, and largely fragmented broadcasting sector-brimming with an increasingly mystic brand of conservatism-then maybe Rush Limbaugh was the least of our concerns.\n\nIt's hard to know for sure how the most popular conservative podcasts have engineered their seemingly outsized success. Nick Quah, a critic and reporter who covers the podcast industry for New York magazine, can identify a couple of different indicators. First and foremost, the biggest names in this world-Megyn Kelly, Tucker Carlson, even Glenn Beck-originally cultivated their fame on cable news, and therefore possess much more name recognition than those who earned their stripes exclusively in the audio realm. Additionally, some of the more adroit operators on the right have mastered a variety of different formats across multiple disciplines and their respective algorithms-TikTok, Instagram-allowing them to flood the airspace with content. (Ben Shapiro publishes a daily podcast and, at minimum, two clips per day on his YouTube channel.) Quah also noted that some conservative podcasts are partnered with major players in terrestrial radio. For instance, The Dan Bongino Show airs nationally on the NFL-affiliated radio network Westwood One, dramatically widening the on-ramp to the conservative commentator's brand for older, less tech-savvy patrons.\n\n\"Compare that to the only major center-left media company, Crooked Media, [the company behind Pod Save America ,] which only just began getting distributed through SiriusXM,\" Quah pointed out. \"They don't have a pact with traditional broadcast media companies that can get them in front of more people.\"\n\nBut none of that changes the fact that much of the more extreme messaging contained in these podcasts-conspiracies both absurd and fascistic, like Charlie Kirk spreading rumors of Haitians eating pets -are, well, extreme, and don't necessarily hold mass appeal in and of themselves. The secret sauce, so to speak, is in how these podcasts sneak those ideas into a much more general entertainment product that is far-ranging enough to capture the attention of millions of listeners. As Carusone put it to Slate, \"Those podcasts aren't making policy statements, but they are telling a story about the respective ideologies of the political parties. ... They are like sandpaper smoothing out the edges of fascism.\"\n\nOne case study is Candace Owens' eponymous podcast Candace . Owens became famous for a number of deranged controversies after originally making a name for herself with the \"Blexit\" movement in the early days of the Trump presidency. (Blexit was a combination of the words Black and Brexit, and it referred to Owens' efforts to encourage more Black Americans to defect from the Democrats.) But in March, Owens crossed one of the very few red lines in conservative media when she alloyed her criticism of Israel's invasion of Gaza with a healthy dose of esoteric antisemitism, asserting that an elite cabal of \"political Jews\" were some of the \"most vile, dishonest, manipulative people\" she's ever met. Later on, she appeared to endorse the idea that rabbis are drinking the blood of Christians . This was apparently a bridge too far for the Daily Wire, the MAGA new-media company where Owens was a star broadcaster, and the site cut ties with her. In a parable that's become eerily familiar, Owens quickly made herself more popular than ever before, launching her podcast Candace , which has averaged more than a million downloads per episode since its debut in June. Owens has continued to advance heavy-duty antisemitic thinking on her new platform. In a July episode titled \" Literally Hitler. Why Can't We Talk About Him? ,\" she called into question the veracity of the fact that human experiments were conducted on Holocaust victims.\n\nBut, for all its extreme political whiplash, Candace is not a strictly partisan production; Owens occasionally dabbles in hard-left conspiratorial thinking , coupled with plenty of pop-culture intrigue. (She has done multiple shows on the murky P. Diddy sex-trafficking investigation, and recently, she hosted a conspiratorialist of minor renown who believes that the disappearance of Malaysia Flight 370 had something to do with the suppression of free energy.) It's a mélange of content whose ethos is less \"explicit right-wing political indoctrination\" than \"salacious background noise keeping ordinary Americans entertained in between laundry and dishwashing\"-the podcasting equivalent of Larry King sitting across from psychics and palm readers in his CNN studio.\n\n\"Everyone is talking about the Trump trial, and I'm saying 'Women shouldn't wear yoga pants.' I don't like to stay within one box, because you get bogged down by talking about one topic all the time. I just ask myself what I'm actually interested in,\" said Owens in an interview with Slate. \"Someone once described my show to be like calling up a friend and catching up with them. ... I want it to feel like that.\"\n\nHemmer calls this trend the \"Joe Rogan Effect,\" referring to another figure who has become aligned with the MAGA project without commanding a content portfolio purely defined by its caucus. Rogan, after all, maintains a Rolodex of guests that range from UFO experts to anti-trans activists to Bernie Sanders. \"You see this with Megyn Kelly, too,\" added Hemmer. \"She does whole shows that are like Dateline episodes. It makes the show something similar to lifestyle broadcasting. Mixed in with really hardcore political messaging, you can get something else.\"\n\nWhat Rogan and the like are selling is not so much a concrete ideology, but a nostalgia for an edgy, anti-PC social order that began to go out of style around the turn of the millennium-a way of life, in other words. That same attitude has been replicated by the other comedian-cum-commentators in his wake. (Theo Von, who recently had J.D. Vance on his podcast This Past Weekend , is another such figure who has integrated a dash of un-wokeness into his brand.) So I wasn't surprised that, during our interview, Candace Owens said that she wants to resurrect what she calls \"'90s gay,\" referring to a time period-the \"golden decade,\" in Owens' words-when the general populace used the term \"gay\" as a casual insult between friends rather than a denigration of sexual orientation. In the anti-woke imagination, those were the good old days, before political correctness and paralyzing partisanship made the social contract harder to navigate.\n\nThis sentiment behind many of the top right-leaning podcasts reflects a broader rift in the culture wars. Over the past two decades, the Democrats have been cast as the no-fun party, standing athwart Barstool Sports, Zyn pouches, Luke Bryan, and Hawk Tuah. There has been a growing sense among Americans who aren't strictly confined by ideology-or aren't even all that politically activated-that the mainstream corporate-liberal gestalt presents a world where your thoughts and interactions must be exclusively filtered through the prism of identity and social justice. These podcasts, then, do a good job at flavoring boilerplate civic inertness with a tinge of MAGA conservatism. So far, liberals haven't been able to crack that code. Consider Pod Save America , which has a content portfolio thoroughly defined by anxiety about Trump, the Electoral College, and the fading vitality of democracy itself. There is little room for digression or levity. It is all policy, all the time, for a country that has grown exhausted by the discourse. The show's reach is limited to the only audience it could ever hope to capture: wonks who look, talk, and think like the hosts themselves.\n\nTo be fair, there are some podcasts on the left that are doing what the right has excelled at. The venerable socialist podcast Chapo Trap House and the prodigious leftist Twitch streamer Hasan Piker, for instance, both command large audiences-predominantly made up of young people-and produce shows that feel much more like casual conversations with friends than unrepentant pro-Democrat platform messaging. But they are not wreathed with the same institutional support that once enshrined Limbaugh. (In the years after his diagnosis, Limbaugh was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Meanwhile, in a viral moment from the 2024 Democratic National Convention, Piker was removed from the premises .) Having power brokers from the liberal media enclave extend an olive branch to the few new-media lefties that young people are excited about could be a way to cultivate more effective counterprogramming against the waves of right-leaning broadcasting that continue to dominate the charts.\n\nBut not everyone is so optimistic. \"Everyone is moving closer to and closer to Alex Jones. The incentive structure is shifting. All of these right-wing voices are increasingly disconnected from reality, and it isn't as visible in this fragmented media environment,\" said Hemmer. Perhaps the war hasn't been lost yet-or maybe, as she posits, the damage has already been done, and \"there's not much you can do about it.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Alexei Navalny's Death Makes Tucker Carlson's Putin Interview Even More Dreadful\n\nIs Tucker Carlson still in Moscow? I wonder if he was lounging in a café with his FSB handlers, laughing at their jokes while savoring a scrumptious pierogi, when the news broke that Alexei Navalny-Russia's, perhaps the world's, most famous political prisoner-had died in a Siberian prison at the age of 47.\n\nCarlson had spent the week following his dreadful interview with Vladimir Putin on a guided tour of Moscow's most sparkling sights. In videos posted on his website, he marvels at the Kievskaya subway station (\"no graffiti, no filth, no rapists or people waiting to push you onto the tracks ... nicer than anything in our country\"), goes slack-jawed in a grocery store (where food prices are so low that he finds himself \"radicalized\" against American leaders), and admires the Russian capital's \"clean, safe streets.\"\n\nUntil Friday, these videos seemed merely risible, the work of an ersatz journalist so naïve that he appears startlingly unaware of the long history of gullible Westerners falling for such cherry-picked displays of Soviet majesty. Yes, the subway stations are magnificent. Does Carlson know they were dug by slave labor and designed by British engineers, some of whom Stalin jailed for espionage ; that some of the gorgeous marble was taken from the Moscow Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, which Stalin had blown up in 1931? Yes, the platforms, like the streets, are safe and clean, as are most facilities in authoritarian countries, but does he know about their facial-recognition sensors , which have led to dozens of protesters being arrested on the platforms? The groceries at the store he visited are a quarter the price of American food, but even so, they are too expensive for the typical Russian, who earns one-sixth the money that the average American does . Even so, had Carlson ventured outside Moscow's center, much less into the country's heartland, he would have found little cause for awe.\n\nBut today, after Navalny's death, Carlson's paeans to Putin's Moscow seem still more repellent. Navalny-the last serious opposition leader, the one Russian figure who could coax tens of thousands of anti-Putin protesters out to the streets-will be recorded in history books as the great martyr of modern Russian democracy. Carlson, to the extent he's remembered at all, will take his place alongside Walter Duranty , the New York Times reporter of the 1930s who covered up Stalin's crimes, romanticizing the murderous dictator as a great leader-though Duranty's deeds were deliberate, stemming from ideology, whereas Carlson is simply a bumbler. (Duranty won the Pulitzer Prize in 1932, something Carlson couldn't even dream of; it was better late than never that the Times disowned the prize in 2003.)\n\nAt the end of his embarrassing interview with Putin (which even the Russian president later trashed , saying the questions were too \"soft\"), Carlson at least asked about the fate of Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich, who has been in a Russian prison, on trumped-up charges of espionage, for almost a year. However, this seemed only prelude to Carlson's request to take Evan back home with him-a favor that Putin brushed away. But did Carlson ask about Paul Whelan, another unjustly detained American? Did he ask about Navalny? (The interview, which seems unedited, contains no such questions.)\n\nIt is not, and may never be, known whether Navalny was outright murdered, as were other critics of Putin , such as former Deputy Prime Minister Boris Nemtsov, journalist Anna Politkovskaya, double agent Sergei Skripal, human rights activist Natalya Estemirova, and Chechen-war critic Sergei Yushenkov. Either way, Navalny died in one of Putin's most remote prisons, as a result of horrid conditions in other prisons, where he was placed as a result of challenging Putin's rule.\n\nIn other words, Navalny must be added to the list of Russian citizens who died because they ran afoul of the man who excites Tucker Carlson's most fervid admiration.\n\nNavalny began his rise as an opposition leader in 2011, with widely publicized broadsides against the corruption of Kremlin elites. In 2013, while running to be Moscow's mayor, he was arrested on false charges of embezzlement; still, he came in second place. In 2018 he tried to run for president, but Putin banned his candidacy. In 2020 he was poisoned on a flight to Siberia, where he had planned to meet with other opposition politicians. (Later, through a string of prank phone calls, recorded in a riveting HBO documentary about his life, Navalny found proof that Putin's goons had administered the near-deadly toxin.)\n\nHe moved to Germany for further medical treatment but flew back to Moscow in 2021. Some were startled by his return, finding it courageous but self-destructive. Surely he knew he would be arrested-and indeed he was, upon arrival at the airport. He may have thought his jail time would be short-lived, that his followers would rally, that Putin would succumb to international pressure. None of that turned out to be the case. Instead, he was charged with steadily more serious accusations-renewed charges of embezzlement, then contempt of court, and finally \"extremism.\" He suffered from several ailments, some because of deliberate exposure to contagiously sick fellow inmates. In December, he was transferred to a penal colony in the Arctic Circle. He continued to meet with lawyers and to send customarily witty, uplifting messages to his followers. Just this week, he appeared healthy in a video, appealing his 19-year sentence. Friday morning, Russia's Interfax news service announced that he died after collapsing during a walk.\n\nWorld leaders mourned his loss and said they would hold Putin responsible. Garry Kasparov , the Russian exile, former chess champion, and prominent human rights activist, tweeted Friday morning, \"Is Tucker still in Moscow? He will be amazed by the low price of human life in Putin's Russia.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Tucker Carlson to interview Vladimir Putin\n\nThe ex-Fox News anchor announced the interview in Moscow.\n\nTucker Carlson, the former Fox News anchor and right-wing media personality, has recorded an interview with Russia n President Vladimir Putin , according to the Kremlin and Carlson.\n\nThe interview, which has yet to air, would be the first interview Putin has granted to a Western journalist since he launched his full-scale invasion of Ukraine nearly two years ago.\n\nCarlson's presentation of the interview has drawn intense criticism from independent Russian journalists who have called it a propaganda victory for the Kremlin and accused Carlson of whitewashing Putin's crackdown on media and freedom of speech in Russia since the invasion.\n\nIn a video teasing the interview posted on X Tuesday night, Carlson said he was interviewing Putin to hear his perspective on the war, claiming that the Russian leader has been ignored by major Western media organizations. Carlson falsely claimed Western media organizations had \"not bothered\" to interview Putin since the start of the invasion.\n\n\"Since the day the war in Ukraine began, American media outlets have spoken to scores of people from Ukraine and they have done scores of interviews with Ukrainian President Zelenskyy. But not a single Western journalist has bothered to interview the president of the other country involved in this conflict, Vladimir Putin,\" Carlson said.\n\nIn reality, many major international outlets regularly make requests to interview Putin, but the Kremlin has declined to accept them since the invasion. Putin for many years has also refused to give interviews to independent Russian journalists apart from those working for state and pro-Kremlin media.\n\nThe Kremlin itself on Wednesday contradicted Carlson, saying Putin receives many interview requests from Western media but has no desire to speak with them.\n\n\"Mr. Carlson is not correct. In fact, there's no way he could know this. We receive numerous requests for interviews with the president,\" Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters. But, he said, \"there's no desire to communicate with this kind of media\" because of what he said was its failure to be \"impartial.\"\n\nPeskov said the Kremlin had chosen to speak with Carlson because his position \"stands in sharp contrast\" to the rest of Western media.\n\nCarlson has long expressed positions that often align with the Kremlin's, saying before the invasion that he was \"rooting for Moscow.\"\n\n\"By any actual reality-based measure, Vladimir Putin is not losing the war in Ukraine. He is winning the war in Ukraine and Joe Biden looks at that and says we won't stop until you proffer an unconditional surrender,\" Carlson claimed in August 2022, shortly before a Ukrainian counteroffensive liberated much of the north east Kharkiv region.\n\nCarlson has also been a critic of the Biden administration's support for Ukraine, arguing that Putin is not a threat to the United States and suggesting the U.S. has stoked the conflict. Carlson has disparaged Ukraine's president, Volodymyr Zelenskyy, who he has called a \"dictator,\" \"rat-like\" and \"sweaty.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, Carlson said his team had also requested an interview with Zelenskyy.\n\nCarlson's positions have long attracted positive attention in Russia, with his clips aired on state media, which portrays him as a truth-teller. After he was abruptly fired from Fox last year, the state channel Russia 24 even aired a trailer for an imagined Russian show anchored by Carlson.\n\nHis arrival in Moscow has been met with breathless coverage in pro-Kremlin and state media, which has closely tracked his visit. A photo captured of Carlson at the Bolshoi ballet theater has circulated widely on Russian social media, and some news agencies even carried photos and reports of him visiting a supermarket.\n\nOne talk show compared Carlson's visit to Jane Fonda's anti-war trip to Vietnam in 1972. On Tuesday, the Evening Moscow newspaper carried a photo of Carlson on its front page with the headline: \"Carlson, who lives in America, but speaks the truth.\"\n\nIn his teaser video, Carson said his interview was a defiant demonstration of \"freedom of speech,\" alleging there was an effort to silence him and accusing Western media outlets of being \"corrupt\" and creating propaganda to promote Zelenskyy.\n\n\"Most Americans have no idea why Putin invaded Ukraine or what his goals are now. They've never heard his voice. That's wrong,\" Carlson said.\n\nMany prominent independent Russian journalists, however, accused Carlson of acting as a propaganda mouthpiece for the Kremlin and expressed outrage at his free speech claims, given the intense crackdown by Putin's government on independent media and dissent during the war.\n\n\"Unbelievable! I am like hundreds of Russian journalists who have had to go into exile to keep reporting about the Kremlin's war against Ukraine. The alternative was to go to jail,\" Yevgenia Albats, a well-known liberal journalist and editor of The New Times, wrote on X responding to Carlson's video. \"And now [Carlson] is teaching us about good journalism,\" she wrote, using an expletive about the former Fox anchor.\n\nSince early 2022, the Kremlin has introduced draconian laws criminalizing criticism of the war. Virtually all independent media organizations have been closed or driven abroad, along with hundreds of journalists. Reporters, activists and ordinary citizens who have spoken against the war have been arrested and some given lengthy prison sentences.\n\nTwo American reporters -- Evan Gershkovich of The Wall Street Journal and Alsu Kurmasheva of Radio Free Liberty -- are currently detained by Russia on charges widely condemned as politically motivated.\n\nAlbats and others said Putin's willingness to speak with Carlson -- but not other international news organizations or independent Russian journalists -- showed the Kremlin saw it as an opportunity to use him as a sympathetic mouthpiece to broadcast its message to millions of Americans.\n\nThe Russian media's excitement around Carlson's visit has also irritated some pro-war Russian nationalists , who see it as an embarrassing veneration of Americans.\n\n\"I am watching an amazing thing with interest: How people who ridicule Ukrainians for their subservient prostration before European politicians and public figures are meticulously recording Tucker Carlson's every move and sneeze in Moscow,\" Andrei Medvedev, a Moscow City Duma deputy and former state TV presenter, wrote on his Telegram account.\n\n\"He flew in, he ate, he drank tea. How wonderful, an American has come to visit us! How happy we are. Comrades, do you feel bipolar?\" Medvedev added.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Chris Christie in particular, saying Hutchinson shouldn't be running for president and that Christie runs \"solely on the basis\" of going after Trump.\n\nLater in the interview, when asked about former Vice President Mike Pence, Trump said he was \"disappointed\" in his former running mate and that he hasn't spoken to him \"in a long time.\"\n\nTrump claimed Pence had the right to send the electoral votes back to the states on Jan. 6, and said he thinks Pence didn't send back the votes because he \"got very bad advice,\" accusing \"RINOs\" of working with Democrats.\n\nTrump also attacked Fox News, claiming it showed favoritism toward other candidates, saying the network \"isn't particularly friendly to me, frankly.\"\n\nCarlson fed into Trump's false claims about the 2020 election in the interview. After being asked if he's worried the election could be \"stolen\" from him in 2024, Trump claimed, \"Oh, they could. [Senate Minority Leader] Mitch McConnell was trying to get senators to impeach me.\"\n\nThe sit-down interview -- which was held in Bedminster, New Jersey -- was pre-recorded last week, a source familiar with the matter confirmed to ABC News.\n\nTrump has cited his indisputable frontrunner status in the Republican race -- despite facing 91 criminal charges for which he maintains his innocence -- to suggest that he doesn't need to give his rivals a platform to attack him.\n\nTrump said his polls allow him to stay cheerful even when he gets indicted: \"I think it's a lot easier because I'm so high in the polls, because it means that people get it. The people see it's a fraud.\"\n\nAs the interview dropped, eight candidates -- Hutchinson, Christie and Pence, as well as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, South Carolina Sen. Tim Scott and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum -- appeared on stage in Milwaukee Wednesday night for the first debate among the GOP candidates.\n\nIn the months leading up to the debate, Trump teased whether or not he'd join his rivals on stage, only to reveal last week on his social media platform that he would \"NOT BE DOING THE DEBATES!\"\n\nAhead of the interview's release, Carlson said in a video message on X that Trump approached him about \"having a conversation for a far larger audience than he'd receive on cable news.\"\n\nIt's unclear precisely how many debates Trump plans on sitting out. Appearing on the conservative \"Ruthless\" podcast on Wednesday ahead of the Republican debate, Trump senior campaign adviser Chris LaCivita said the former president currently does not plan to attend the second GOP debate, which will be held in California next month.\n\nLaCivita said Trump is \"not going to be in California,\" while noting that \"he could change his mind at any moment.\"\n\nABC News' Tal Axelrod and Laura Gersony contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "How Tucker Carlson's exit could financially impact Fox Corporation, according to experts\n\nThe move sent shockwaves not only in Washington D.C., but also on Wall Street.\n\nThe seismic exit of Fox News host Tucker Carlson this week elicited reaction from politicians as varied as former President Donald Trump and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\nBut the move also sent shockwaves across Wall Street.\n\nShares of Fox News-parent company Fox Corporation on Monday tumbled more than 3%, which amounts to hundreds of millions in value.\n\nNielsen data on Tuesday showed a roughly 20% drop in audience for the first show featuring temporary replacement host Brian Kilmeade, according to The Hollywood Reporter .\n\nThe departure of Carlson, the nation's most-watched primetime cable news host, could cause significant financial damage for Fox Corporation through diminished stock value, weakened income from cable carriers and lower advertising revenue, some analysts told ABC News.\n\n\"It has the potential to be massive,\" Matthew Tuttle, the CEO and CIO of Tuttle Capital Management, who closely follows the media industry, told ABC News. \"There's going to be a very large impact from this. I don't think you can dress it up as positive.\"\n\nHowever, some media industry analysts downplayed the potential damage since the company has overcome previous departures of high-profile hosts and the move offers an opportunity for the 8 p.m. show to draw corporate advertisers alienated by Carlson's controversial programming, experts said.\n\nWhen asked if the company would prove resilient, Huber Research analyst Doug Arthur told ABC News, \"There's no doubt in my mind. The company has survived these kinds of talent hits before.\"\n\nFollowing Carlson's departure, Fox News told ABC News it's still the most watched cable news network.\n\n\"For more than 21 years, FOX News Channel has been cable news' most-watched network in all categories with more Democrats, Independents and Republicans now tuning in than either CNN or MSNBC,\" a Fox News spokesperson told ABC News. \"Attracting more of than 50% of the cable news viewing audience with the top 12 programs in cable news, FOX News' powerhouse team of journalists, analysts and opinion hosts are trusted more by viewers than any other news source.\"\n\nThe Fox Corporation did not respond to a request for comment. Carlson has yet to comment on his exit from the company.\n\nHere's how the departure of Carlson could impact Fox Corporation, according to analysts:\n\nAfter news of the Carlson exit broke on Monday morning, shares of Fox Corporation fell more than 3% by the close of trading that day. The following morning, the decline ticked past 3.5%, amounting to a lost value of more than $500 million.\n\n\"The initial stock move was all Tucker,\" Tuttle said.\n\nThe market reaction stems from the loss of a high-profile star and anticipated attrition among his viewers, analysts said.\n\nOn average, Carlson's 8 p.m. show reached about 3.25 million nightly viewers over the first four months of this year, outpacing competitors in the time slot and other nighttime hosts on Fox News, according to Nielsen.\n\n\"He was their ratings leader in primetime,\" Huber said. \"That's going to hurt.\"\n\nThe departure of Carlson compounds the financial damage and uncertainty caused by Fox News' recent $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, Huber said.\n\n\"There's a black cloud over the stock right now,\" he added.\n\nStill, the stock stabilized in trading on Wednesday, ticking up slightly for the day.\n\n\"The initial reaction seemed a little bit overdone,\" Brandon Nispel, an analyst with KeyBanc Capital Markets, told ABC News. \"I heard questions from investors: 'Is Fox worth anything without Tucker.'\"\n\n\"The answer is 'yes,'\" he added. \"But it's clearly worth something modestly less than when they had Tucker.\"\n\nFox Corporation sales depend in part on fees paid by cable carriers like Comcast and Dish Network that distribute the company's broadcasts.\n\nOver the three months ending in December, such fees delivered $1.7 billion or 37% of Fox Corporation revenue, the company's latest earnings report showed.\n\nAnalysts differed over the potential effect that the loss of Carlson poses for carrier fees.\n\nWithout Carlson and the promise of his sizable audience, the company will enter its next round of negotiations with cable carriers in a weakened position, potentially hurting the fees it can command, Tuttle said.\n\n\"That is a major concern because at least in the short term, they're going to lose viewers,\" he said. \"There's going to be an impact.\"\n\nHowever, the overall lead in audience enjoyed by Fox News in primetime will reassure cable carriers, limiting the effect of the personnel move, Arthur said.\n\n\"Their ratings lead is so large at night that I don't think any distributor is going to screw around with having Fox News fall off of their network,\" he said.\n\nNispel echoed the sentiment, saying he expects a limited effect on carrier fees.\n\n\"If anything, it will be a small margin of negative impact,\" he said, noting that Fox Corporation already renegotiated several carrier agreements over the past year.\n\nFox Corporation derives the majority of its revenue from advertising, which made up 54% of sales over the final three months of 2022, an earnings report showed.\n\nSince it boasts the largest primetime audience, Carlson's show generated more advertising revenue last year than each of the 8 p.m. shows on CNN and MSNBC, as well as each of the other primetime shows on Fox News, a New York Times analysis of Vivvixx data showed.\n\nIn all, Carlson's show delivered $77.5 million in advertising revenue last year, according to Vivvixx data.\n\nThe likely decline in audience for the 8 p.m. time slot at Fox News, at least in the short term, will hurt advertising revenue, analysts said.\n\n\"It creates a lot of uncertainty,\" Nispel said. \"They're losing their leader in their primetime lineup.\"\n\nHowever, the move opens up an opportunity for the channel to attract corporate advertisers that previously balked at the controversial views expressed by Carlson, they added.\n\n\"It's going to hurt in the short term,\" Arthur said. But he later noted: \"The point of strong ratings is to have strong advertising. If you have strong ratings but lousy advertising, what's the point?\"\n\nThe opening may attract a more moderate host who reassures major advertisers, Tuttle said, but he cautioned that a replacement would feel pressure to take up similarly controversial positions as a means of gaining a large audience.\n\n\"We're in a society where controversy sells,\" Tuttle said.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Mike Pence clashes with Tucker Carlson in Iowa\n\nThe two have had a checkered history since Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nFormer Fox News host Tucker Carlson clashed with 2024 Republican candidates like former Vice President Mike Pence at The Family Leadership Summit in Iowa on Friday, with some candidates expressing frustration that Carlson didn't focus the \"fireside chats\" on family issues which unite the crowd of evangelical Midwesterners, but instead, on topics like Ukraine and the 2020 election.\n\n\"I regret that we didn't have very much time during my time on stage talking about the progress for life or issues in the family,\" Pence told reporters after a tense encounter with the former Fox News host.\n\nAsked by ABC News Correspondent MaryAlice Parks if Pence was surprised that he had to spend a majority of the discussion defending Ukraine, Pence said, \"I'm really never surprised by Tucker Carlson.\"\n\nCarlson, who has advocated for ending aid to the war-torn country, grilled Pence on his support for defense spending in Ukraine. At one point, the former vice president was booed when he tried to explain his reasoning.\n\n\"I believe that it is in the interest of the United States of America, to continue to give the Ukrainian military the resources that they need to repel the Russian invasion and restore their sovereignty,\" Pence said, to some disapproving audience members.\n\nWhen Carlson alleged without evidence that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government is suppressing and arresting Christians, Pence explained how he asked that very question when he traveled to Ukraine two months after the invasion began and again last month.\n\n\"I asked the Christian leader in Kyiv if that was happening, and he assured me it was not. People were not being persecuted for their religious beliefs,\" Pence said, shutting down Carlson's attempt to interrupt him. \"Now, take a break here. I know we disagree on this strongly, but I respect your right, your opinion on Ukraine. I trust you to respect my time.\"\n\n\"The problem is you don't accept my answer,\" Pence added when Carlson continued. \"I just told you that I asked the religious leader in Kyiv if it was happening. You asked me if I raised the issue, and I did.\"\n\nThe meeting between Pence and Carlson was expected to be awkward given the former Fox News host's comments about Pence's tenure as vice president. Last August, he called the idea of Pence running for president \"delusional\" in an appearance on \"The Ingraham Angle.\" Host Laura Ingraham played a clip of Pence urging Republicans to stop attacking the FBI during a \"Politics and Eggs\" breakfast gathering at Saint Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire, which Carlson commented on.\n\n\"What is Mike Pence doing in New Hampshire? I mean, if Mike Pence doesn't have a summer house in New Hampshire, then he's delusional. Mike Pence, very nice guy, or seems like a nice guy, but he spent four years getting bossed around by Donald Trump like a concubine,\" Carlson said. \"He's not in a position to lead anything.\"\n\nPence has also been highly critical of Carlson ever since Carlson falsely portrayed the events of the Jan. 6 attack in cherry picked clips from security footage handed to him exclusively by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, including falsely describing rioters as \"sightseers\" on the former host's Fox News show.\n\n\"I was there at the Capitol, and let me assure you it was not, as some would have us believe, a matter of tourists peacefully enjoying our Capitol,\" Pence said in March at the annual Gridiron Club dinner for journalists in Washington, before he launched his campaign for president. \"Make no mistake about it, what happened that day was a disgrace, and it mocks decency to portray it in any other way.\"\n\nWhen Carlson asked Pence whether the events that took place on Jan. 6 were an \"insurrection,\" Pence said he's never used that term but called it a \"riot.\"\n\nOther presidential hopefuls were subjected to a similar grilling by the former Fox News host. Carlson asked Hutchinson right off the bat why he vetoed a bill in Arkansas that would have banned gender-affirming health care for minors -- a law which has since been struck down by a federal judge as unconstitutional.\n\nHutchinson reaffirmed his belief that the bill as governor he vetoed went too far:\n\n\"If there would have been a bill that said that you should not ever have transgender surgery as a minor, I would sign that. ... But this bill did go too far,\" Hutchinson said. \"So I side with parents.\"\n\n\"Permanent change is one issue but also hormonal treatment is a different issue,\" he added.\n\nWhen Carlson took issue with Hutchinson using the word \"treatment,\" Hutchinson replied, \"I hope that we'll be able to talk about some issues.\"\n\n\"This is one of the biggest issues in the country, and I think every person in this room would agree,\" Carlson replied, provoking applause. \"It is a central issue.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters after his chat, Hutchinson said he maintains a consistent message he believes in, no matter the audience.\n\n\"Anytime you go against the grain a little bit to catch his audience's off guard,\" he said. \"To me that's refreshing that you actually see a candidate that thinks through it from a constitutional standpoint, from a parent's standpoint, from a consistency standpoint, from a limited government standpoint, and I hope that they see that I think there's some room for disagreement.\"\n\n\"There's obviously some room for disagreement, and so I think that I gained respect through that presentation -- even with a difficult interviewer,\" he added.\n\nTwice during the chat, Hutchinson told Carlson to stop interrupting him. Another tense moment came when Carlson asked, \"How many COVID shots did you take, and how do you feel about it now in retrospect?\"\n\n\"How many COVID shots did you take?\" Hutchinson quipped back.\n\n\"Zero,\" Carlson said to applause. \"I can see you recoiled when I asked you that question.\"\n\nCarlson has repeatedly promoted false claims concerning the safety of COVID-19 vaccines.\n\nHutchinson defended how he signed a law forbidding the federal government from mandating government employees take the vaccine in Arkansas, and repeated that, in his view, parents shouldn't be told whether they can -- or can't -- vaccinate their child.\n\nDuring the summit, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds signed HF 732, ceasing all abortions after six weeks. The measure is raising alarms among Democrats and abortion rights supporters who argue the majority of Iowans don't agree with the legislation passed this week in a special session.\n\nThe popular governor was applauded by the audience as she signed the bill, but her neutrality in the primaries has become a sticking point for former President Donald Trump, who did not attend the summit, citing scheduling conflicts. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, whose remarks capped off the festivities Friday evening, called Trump's rebuke of Reynolds a \"misstep.\"\n\nOther Iowa summit attendees included Sen. Tim Scott, S.C., former Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley, and businessman Vivek Ramaswamy.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Tucker Carlson and his producer out at Fox News, 1 week after Dominion settlement\n\n\"We thank him for his service to the network,\" Fox said of Carlson.\n\nTV host Tucker Carlson and Fox News have \"agreed to part ways,\" Fox said in a statement Monday.\n\n\"We thank him for his service to the network,\" Fox said in the statement about the top-rated host, which noted that Carlson's last show was on Friday.\n\nThe network did not provide a reason for Carlson's departure.\n\nIn addition, the senior executive producer of Tucker Carlson Tonight, Justin Wells, was let go Monday, multiple sources told ABC News.\n\nThe decision to terminate Carlson and his producer was made this past Friday night by Fox Corporation CEO Lachlan Murdoch and Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott, a source familiar with the matter told ABC News.\n\nWells declined to comment to ABC News. A spokesperson for Fox News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe news comes nearly one week after a $787.5 million settlement agreement between the network and Dominion Voting Systems, which had accused Fox of knowingly pushing false conspiracy theories that the voting machine company rigged the 2020 presidential election in Joe Biden's favor, in what Dominion claims was an effort to combat concerns over declining ratings and viewer retention.\n\nFox defended its coverage , dismissing the suit as a \"political crusade in search of a financial windfall.\"\n\nA Dominion spokesperson declined to comment on Carlson's departure when contacted by ABC News.\n\nAs part of its discovery process, Dominion in February filed court documents containing emails, texts, testimony, and other private communications from Fox News personnel, including Carlson, in which they appeared to cast doubt on claims involving Dominion -- versus what they said on-air to their viewers.\n\nOn Nov. 8, Carlson privately texted his producer that the allegations about Dominion were \"absurd,\" according to the Dominion filing. Also that day, Carlson's producer texted him about his own doubts.\n\n\"I don't think there is evidence of voter fraud that swung the election,\" producer Alex Pfeiffer texted to Carlson, per the lawsuit. \"The software s--t is absurd,\" Carlson allegedly responded.\n\nOn his show just one night later, Carlson pushed more suggestions of fraud, though he said that \"we don't know anything about the software.\"\n\n\"We don't know how many votes were stolen on Tuesday night. We don't know anything about the software that many say was rigged. We don't know. We ought to find out,\" he said. \"But here's what we do know. On a larger level, at the highest levels, actually, our system isn't what we thought it was. It's not as fair as it should be. Not even close.\"\n\nCarlson during this show also said that \"false claims of fraud can be every bit as destructive as the fraud itself,\" according to the filing, and that \"the fraud that we can confirm does not seem to be enough to alter the election results. We should be honest and tell you that...\"\n\nIn mid-November Carlson also texted one of his producers that \"there wasn't enough fraud to change the outcome\" of the election, according to the filings, and later said that Sidney Powell, one of then-President Donald Trump's attorneys and a vocal promulgator of election denialism, \"is lying.\"\n\nMonths later, on the day of the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capital, Carlson called Trump \"a demonic force, a destroyer\" in a text message to the same producer.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Tucker Carlson out at Fox News\n\nMarkets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFox News and Tucker Carlson, the right-wing extremist who used his prime time perch at the talk network to exert a firm grip over the Republican Party, have severed ties, the network said in a stunning announcement that rocked the media and political worlds Monday.\n\n\"We thank him for his service to the network as a host and prior to that as a contributor,\" Fox News said in a short statement that did not offer an explanation for his ouster , adding only that his last show was on Friday, April 21.\n\nCarlson, the highest-rated single host at Fox News, did not respond to multiple requests for comment. The decision to part ways with Carlson was made Friday evening by Fox Corporation chief executive Lachlan Murdoch and Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott, a person familiar with the matter said.\n\nCarlson was informed of the decision on Monday morning, a second person familiar with the matter said.\n\nThe announcement came one week after Fox News settled a monster defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems for $787.5 million over the network's dissemination of election lies. The lawsuit had exposed Carlson disparaging colleagues. A lawsuit filed in March by his now-fired top booker, Abby Grossberg, also included a number of allegations of sexism on his show.\n\nDuring his time as a prime time host on Fox News, Carlson ascended to become one of the most influential figures inside the GOP. Republican lawmakers groveled at his feet and former President Donald Trump granted him the first interview earlier this month after his arraignment in New York.\n\nCarlson propelled himself to stardom in recent years by being a top promoter of conspiracy theories and radical rhetoric. Not only did he repeatedly sow doubt about the legitimacy of the 2020 election, but he also promoted conspiracy theories about the Covid-19 vaccines and elevated white nationalist talking points.\n\nJonathan Greenblatt, the head of the Anti-Defamation League, praised Fox News' decision, saying it is \"about time\" and that \"for far too long,\" Carlson has \"used his primetime show to spew antisemitic, racist, xenophobic and anti-LGBTQ hate to millions.\"\n\nInside Fox News, some of Carlson's internal critics rejoiced upon learning the news, people inside the network told CNN. There's \"a lot of relief generally, surprise they had the nerve to do it, and hope for a culture change,\" one employee explained.\n\nIt's unlikely, however, that Fox News will stray too far from the right-wing talk that its loyal audience tunes in nightly for. The network said that, for now, Carlson's 8 p.m. time slot will be filled by rotating hosts. Shares of Fox Corp. (FOXA) fell 5% on the news. The stock had been up slightly before the announcement. A top conspiracy theorist\n\nCarlson was a key figure in Dominion's mammoth defamation lawsuit against Fox News, which the parties settled last week on the brink of trial for a historic $787 million.\n\nIn some ways, Carlson played an outsized role in the litigation: Only one of the 20 allegedly defamatory Fox broadcasts mentioned in the lawsuit came from Carlson's top-rated show. But he was set to be one of Dominion's first witnesses to testify at trial. And his private text messages, which became public as part of the suit, reverberated nationwide.\n\nDominion got its hands on Carlson's group chat with fellow Fox primetime stars Sean Hannity and Laura Ingraham, and a trove of other messages from around the 2020 presidential election.\n\nThese communications revealed that Carlson told confidants that he \"passionately\" hated former President Donald Trump and that Trump's tenure in the White House was a \"disaster.\" He also used misogynistic terms to criticize pro-Trump lawyer Sidney Powell and reject her conspiracies about the 2020 election - even as those wild theories got airtime on Fox News.\n\nAdditionally, Carlson disparaged the right-wing network's leaders in a series of text messages revealed in Dominion's defamation case.\n\nIn a text on Nov. 5, 2020 - two days after the 2020 election - Carlson wrote his producer Alex Pfeiffer: \"We worked really hard to build what we have. Those f-ckers are destroying our credibility. It enrages me.\"\n\nThe pair appeared to be discussing the network's coverage of the 2020 election, which had just recently - and correctly - called the critical state of Arizona for Joe Biden, enraging the network's pro-Trump audience.\n\nCarlson later added on Nov. 6 to Pfeiffer: \"A combination of incompetent liberals and top leadership with too much pride to back down is what's happening.\" Fox and other outlets projected that Biden would clinch the White House one day later.\n\nIn a separate series of messages on Nov. 8, Carlson wrote: \"Do the executives understand how much credibility and trust we've lost with our audience? We're playing with fire, for real.\"\n\nThe lawsuit exposed how Carlson privately held a wholly different view than his on-air persona. A Dominion spokesperson did not comment on Carlson's departure from Fox.\n\nIn the two years since the attack on the US Capitol, the Fox primetime host used his huge platform to amplify paper-thin theories that the attack was a false-flag operation orchestrated by the FBI and government agents because they loathed Trump, and that the criminal rioters were themselves the victims.\n\nThe baseless theory originated from a right-wing website, and Carlson catapulted it into the mainstream by repeatedly featuring it on his show . He routinely suggested that Capitol rioter and Trump supporter Ray Epps was actually an FBI provocateur who sparked the deadly riot.\n\nIn a \"60 Minutes\" interview that aired Sunday night, Epps had this to say about Carlson's lies: \"He's obsessed with me. He's going to any means possible to destroy my life and our lives.\"\n\nAn attorney for Epps sent a legal demand to Fox News in March demanding a retraction for \"false and defamatory statements\" made about his client. Carlson never apologized on-air.\n\nCarlson's disinformation campaign about January 6 reached its apex just a few months ago, with an assist from the newly installed House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican.\n\nThe top-rated Fox host obtained and aired never-before-seen footage from Capitol security cameras, but the clips were cherry-picked and selectively edited. He said on his program that he ran the tapes by the US Capitol Police before airing the material, but they disputed his claim .\n\nShares of Fox Corp. (FOXA) fell 5% on the news. The stock had been up slightly before the announcement.\n\nGrossberg, the ex-Fox News producer who has since disavowed the network, claimed in recent lawsuits that there was rampant sexism and misogyny among Tucker Carlson's show team. Last month, she sued Fox News, Carlson, his executive producer Justin Wells and other figures, as well as Fox's parent corporation.\n\nGrossberg, who joined Carlson's team after the 2020 election, said in her lawsuit that after her first day on the job that \"it became apparent how pervasive the misogyny and drive to embarrass and objectify women was among the male staff at TCT,\" referring to \"Tucker Carlson Tonight.\"\n\nThe lawsuits also claim that Grossberg alerted Wells to some of the \"inappropriate and harassing conduct\" that she endured while working at the show, but he \"brushed aside\" her concerns, according to court filings.\n\nFox News is aggressively fighting two lawsuits from Grossberg. A Fox spokesperson previously said the lawsuits were \"riddled with false allegations against the network and our employees.\"\n\nIn a lawsuit filed last month, Grossberg said Carlson \"was very capable of using such disgusting language about women in the workplace.\" She cited some of Carlson's private texts to colleagues that were made public in the Dominion case, where he used the phrase \"c-nt\" to refer to Trump lawyer Sidney Powell, a top 2020 election denier.\n\nHer lawsuits also describe seeing sexually suggestive posters that were visible in the workplace, facing \"uncomfortable sexual questions\" from Wells about her former Fox News boss Maria Bartiromo, and witnessing internal debates on which women politicians were \"more f-kable.\"\n\nIn a TV interview, she said the sexual harassment was so bad that she considered suicide.\n\nWells was well-aware of the massive impact he and Carlson had on GOP politics, according to Grossberg's lawsuit. She quoted a November 2022 editorial meeting where Wells allegedly said they had \"the power to select the 2024 GOP presidential candidate\" and a January meeting where he said Carlson planned to \"save the Republican Party\" by resolving the epic intraparty struggle over the House speakership.\n\nCarlson's departure at Fox News comes after the network also severed ties with right-wing bomb thrower Dan Bongino, who had been a regular fixture on the network's programming, in addition to hosting a weekend show.\n\n\"Folks, regretfully, last week was my last show on Fox News on the Fox News Channel,\" Bongino said on Rumble, chalking up the exit to a contract dispute.\n\n\"So the show ending last week was tough. And I want you to know it's not some big conspiracy. I promise you. There's not, there's no acrimony. This wasn't some, like, WWE brawl that happened. We just couldn't come to terms on an extension. And that's really it.\"\n\nFox News responded in a statement, \"We thank Dan for his contributions and wish him success in his future endeavors.\"\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

      "text": "Tucker Carlson announces plans to relaunch his show on Twitter\n\nMarkets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nRight-wing extremist Tucker Carlson announced Tuesday that he will relaunch his program on Twitter, which he praised as the only remaining large free-speech platform in the world after Fox News fired him late last month.\n\nCarlson made the announcement in a video posted to the social media website, which Elon Musk acquired last year. Musk said Twitter did not sign an agreement with Carlson for his new show.\n\nTwitter has devolved in recent months into a chaotic platform where the traditional press has come under assault from the billionaire.\n\n\"Speech is the fundamental pre-requisite for democracy. That's why it was enshrined in the first of our Constitutional amendments,\" Carlson said. \"Amazingly, as of tonight, there are not that many platforms left that allow free speech. The last big one remaining ... is Twitter, where we are now.\"\n\nCarlson demonized the news media in his announcement video, accusing journalists of often excluding facts that detract from their narratives. He did not mention Musk has censored speech on Twitter, including banning several prominent reporters from the website just last year.\n\nAlthough Carlson did not directly address his abrupt firing from Fox News in the video, he strongly alluded to it.\n\n\"The best you can hope for in the news business at this point is the freedom to tell the fullest truth that you can. But there are always limits,\" Carlson said. \"And you know that if you bump up against those limits often enough, you will be fired for it. That's not a guess, that's guaranteed.\"\n\nRelated article Fox News anchor Bret Baier's reputation takes hit after text messages reveal what he said in wake of 2020 election\n\nThe Wall Street Journal , which is controlled by Fox Corporation Chairman Rupert Murdoch, reported last month that Carlson's contract with Fox News was worth about $20 million a year. The newspaper reported that Carlson was expected to be paid out in full.\n\nHis move to launch a show on Twitter could jeopardize whether he ultimately receives that money. A spokesperson for Fox Corporation could not be immediately reached for comment on the matter.\n\nMusk said Twitter did not agree to a financial arrangement with Carlson.\n\n\"We have not signed a deal of any kind whatsoever,\" Musk tweeted Tuesday night. \"Tucker is subject to the same rules & rewards of all content creators.\"\n\nCarlson's decision to relaunch his show on Twitter signals his strong desire to remain present in both the media and politics, where he played an outsized role while occupying the 8 p.m. ET slot on Fox News.\n\nAside from former President Donald Trump, Carlson was arguably the most powerful voice inside the Republican Party, with lawmakers fearing his wrath and appearing on his program in a symbolic bow to his feet.\n\nCarlson was able to achieve that influence by posting high ratings. But his monster viewership numbers were earned through the trafficking of anti-immigrant rhetoric, false conspiracy theories, and the promotion of white nationalist talking points.\n\nFox News has struggled, however, to fill the gap Carlson left. The network's ratings have not only fallen significantly in the all-important 8 p.m. time slot in wake of his departure, but they have weakened throughout prime time. The right-wing channel in recent weeks has posted some of its lowest ratings since the era before the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks.\n\nFor Twitter, the addition of Carlson's show is unsurprising.\n\nMusk has helped to elevate the visibility of far-right figures on the platform both by engaging with their tweets from his personal account and by allowing them to pay for Twitter Blue accounts, which provides them \"verified\" blue checks and comes with greater prominence in search. Musk has urged his millions of followers to vote Republican and also appeared on Carlson's show on Fox shortly before he was let go.\n\nMusk has restored the accounts of many users who had previously been banned for violating the platform's rules, including right-wing figures like Trump and a number of white supremacists and neo-Nazis.\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

But in interview with the former president he took a very different tone\n\nMarkets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nTucker Carlson plays a straight-shooter on television.\n\nFrom his prime time perch on Fox News, Carlson portrays himself to his loyal audience of millions as a truth-teller, someone who tells it like it is and calls out BS from whoever peddles it.\n\nBut it is all an act, as evidenced by his weak excuse for an interview with former President Donald Trump that aired on Tuesday night, Trump's first since being indicted on dozens of felony counts of business fraud.\n\nCarlson sat silent as Trump rambled and ranted his way through the sit-down, making a number of eyebrow-raising comments on a host of topics that were never challenged by the right-wing talk host. Carlson made no effort to press the disgraced president on any of the issues that an actual news anchor would.\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\n\nInstead, Carlson sang Trump's praises.\n\n\"For a man caricatured as an extremist, we think you'll find what he has to say moderate, sensible, and wise,\" Carlson told his audience. At another point in his program, Carlson mocked the \"Neo-con media establishment\" for suggesting Trump is a \"dangerous lunatic.\"\n\nIt was all quite a sight to see coming from a man who has been exposed to hold Trump in great disdain, as evidenced by private messages he sent which have come to light as part of Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6 billion lawsuit against Fox News.\n\nCarlson actually \"hate[s]\" Trump. And he hates him \"passionately.\" He believes Trump is a \"destroyer.\" A \"demonic force.\" A president who was a \"disaster.\" A politician whose behavior after losing the 2020 election was \"disgusting.\"\n\nCarlson just doesn't have the courage to say any of it on television - or apparently to the man whom he privately made such comments about.\n\nCarlson's refusal to disclose to his viewers his true opinions of Trump reflect the grip the former president still exerts over the Republican Party. Even Carlson, the most popular MAGA Media figure whom most of the GOP fears, thinks it is necessary to kiss the ring of Trump.\n\nIt's a broader phenomenon reflected across Fox News, as also revealed by private messages uncovered in Dominion's lawsuit. Even GOP kingmaker Rupert Murdoch appeared to fear Trump's wrath. And it speaks to what could happen in 2024 and beyond.\n\nRight-wing media stars like Carlson might want to move past Trump. Carlson, himself, confided in a producer after the 2020 election, \"We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can't wait.\"\n\nBut the reality is it will be quite difficult to ignore him now that he is once again in the race for the White House and facing criminal charges. On Tuesday night, as Carlson bowed before Trump at Mar-a-Lago, he demonstrated exactly that.\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

The news, which rocked both the media and political worlds, begs for an answer to that fundamental question.\n\nBut answering it is anything but easy. In the hours following Carlson's abrupt dismissal from the right-wing channel, a number of explanations have emerged - all with plausibility. It goes without saying that it was no coincidence that the dismissal came just days after Fox's historic settlement with Dominion Voting Systems. But what specifically about that case prompted Carlson's undoing remains murky.\n\nPerhaps it was related to ex-producer Abby Grossberg's lawsuit against the network, which alleged rampant sexism and anti-Semitic behavior behind the scenes at Carlson's show? Or perhaps it was profanity-laced remarks, some of which were redacted in the Dominion discovery documents, that Carlson privately made, disparaging his colleagues, including Fox brass? Or perhaps Rupert Murdoch, and his chief executive son Lachlan, wanted to send a message about who is ultimately in command at the company after having been embarrassed for months with the public airing of Fox's dirty laundry?\n\nIt's possible it was all of the above, given that each of the issues are intertwined. For its part, Fox News did not offer an explanation for Carlson's ouster in the short statement the network put out announcing the bombshell decision. \"We thank him for his service to the network as a host and prior to that as a contributor,\" Fox News said. Carlson also offered no comment on Monday, ignoring my many texts and phone calls seeking information.\n\nWhich leaves us in a frustrating position. We know the basic contours of how the decision was made (Lachlan Murdoch and Suzanne Scott came to agreement Friday evening about canceling Carlson's show and informed him on Monday morning, just before publicly announcing the news). But we are unable to say definitively, for now, what led to the firing of one of the most powerful figures in modern American media and politics.\n\nOne veteran television news executive told me that they believed the decision came down to a straightforward calculation by the Murdochs: Risk versus reward. \"There's a lot of drama and intrigue, but this is always about managing risk vs reward,\" the person said.\n\n\"I know that's not very exciting, but it's how these decisions get made at the highest level,\" the executive added. \"A weighing of the negatives - and risks to the business - versus the positives or benefits.\"\n\nRelated article Tucker Carlson out at Fox News\n\nAnd if you're the Murdochs, it is easy to say how holding on to Carlson comes with more much more risk than reward. Carlson is not a team player, and in fact is uncontrollable. He carries legal baggage, and the Murdochs are trying to put an end to the legal disputes they find themselves in. He regularly births negative news cycles about the network that tarnish the brand, and Fox News is desperate to emerge from the cloud of negative press it has been the subject of. Meanwhile, mainstream advertisers have stayed far away from Carlson's show, which is far too toxic to associate with.\n\nThe Murdochs also have plenty of evidence to support the bet that Fox News is bigger than any single person. Just look at Glenn Beck, Bill O'Reilly, Megyn Kelly, and others who have exited the network. None of them have bigger platforms today than they did when they were on Fox News. They all have a less powerful megaphone than the one they carried when employed by the Murdochs.\n\nMeanwhile, the network itself has endured. It is pretty much enshrined as a law of physics in the universe of right-wing media that whoever the Murdochs put in prime time will rate. In some cases, certain shows have out-rated their predecessors. Beck was replaced by the higher rated \"The Five,\" for instance.\n\nAll that said, Carlson will test the hypothesis that Fox News as a brand trumps any single personality. Carlson is a force unlike any other in right-wing media and politics. He commands a loyal audience that is really not akin to anything else in the space. If he were to turn up on another channel, it's certainly possible that a not-so-insignificant chunk of his audience would follow him over - especially with former President Donald Trump eager to rip the Murdochs and fan chaos in right-wing media.\n\nWhich is all to say that, while the Murdochs may have made a calculated bet that the odds will remain in their favor, it is still a bet.

In a statement, the Vance campaign sought to distance the candidate from the interview.\n\n\"Senator Vance doesn't believe in guilt-by-association cancel culture but he obviously does not share the views of the guest interviewed by Tucker Carlson,\" Vance campaign spokesperson William Martin told CNN in a statement.\n\nCNN's Alayna Treene contributed reporting.\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS.

      "text": "Tucker Carlson 'passionately' hates Trump, and eight more key revelations about Fox News from new Dominion filings\n\nMarkets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFox News continues to be exposed like never before.\n\nRelated video Hear why legal analyst thinks Fox News is facing 'very serious' legal exposure\n\nIn legal filings made public Tuesday as part of Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6 billion defamation lawsuit against the right-wing channel, a trove of private text messages, emails, and deposition transcripts offered a new look at how the sausage is made behind the scenes at the channel - and it is ugly.\n\nThe filings expose the face of the network, Tucker Carlson, as a fraud. They show that Rupert Murdoch rejected conspiracy theories about Dominion, despite allowing them to be promoted on his network. And they show the contempt that hosts like Sean Hannity have for some of their colleagues who tried to tell the truth about what actually transpired in the 2020 election.\n\nA version of this article first appeared in the \"Reliable Sources\" newsletter. Sign up for the daily digest chronicling the evolving media landscape here.\n\nThe legal filings total hundreds and hundreds of pages. Journalists will unquestionably be sifting through them for days and weeks to come. But here are some immediate takeaways:\n\n► Carlson \"passionately\" hates Trump: In a number of private text messages, Carlson was harshly critical of Trump. In one November 2020 exchange, Carlson said Trump's decision to snub Joe Biden's inauguration was \"so destructive.\" Carlson added that Trump's post-election behavior was \"disgusting\" and that he was \"trying to look away.\" In another text message conversation, two days before the January 6 attack, Carlson said, \"We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights. I truly can't wait.\" Carlson added of Trump, \"I hate him passionately.\" The Fox host said of the Trump presidency, \"That's the last four years. We're all pretending we've got a lot to show for it, because admitting what a disaster it's been is too tough to digest. But come on. There isn't really an upside to Trump.\"\n\n► Murdoch rejected conspiracies: In his January deposition, Murdoch was repeatedly asked about various electronic voting conspiracy theories - and he rejected all of them. \"You've never believed that Dominion was involved in an effort to delegitimize and destroy votes for Donald Trump, correct?\" a Dominion lawyer asked at one point. \"I'm open to persuasion; but, no, I've never seen it,\" Murdoch replied.\n\n► Top hosts probably \" went too far\": In an email to Fox News chief executive Suzanne Scott, Murdoch conceded that some of his top hosts probably crossed the line in the aftermath of the 2020 election. \"Maybe Sean [Hannity] and Laura [Ingraham] went too far,\" Murdoch wrote Scott, in an apparent reference to election denialism after Trump's loss.\n\n► Fury at Fox News' decision desk: Murdoch lashed out in an email on November 7, 2020, over an imminent decision by Fox News to project that Biden would become the next president. \"CNN declares and FOX coming in minutes,\" Murdoch wrote to former New York Post editor-in-chief Col Allan. \"I hate our Decision Desk people! And pollsters! Some of the same people I think. Just for the hell of it still praying for Az to prove them wrong!,\" he said in reference to Biden's victory over Trump.\n\nRelated article Fox Chairman Rupert Murdoch rejected election conspiracy theories, Dominion lawsuit documents show\n\n► Murdoch wanted  to \"help\" his friend Jared Kushner: In his deposition, Murdoch was asked why he divulged confidential campaign ad information to Kushner. \"I was trying to help Mr. Kushner,\" Murdoch said. \"he's a friend of mine.\"\n\n► Hannity, Carlson, and Ingraham discussed their power: In a group text message, the Fox News prime time bloc, concerned about losing viewers and upset about the direction the network was going, talked about flexing their muscle. \"I think the three of us have enormous power,\" Ingraham texted, adding that they have \"more power than we know or exercise.\" She continued, \"we should think about how together we can force a change.\" Hannity said he had to hop on calls but urged Ingraham to \"keep thinking.\" Carlson said that \"the first thing\" they needed to do is \"exactly what we want to do.\" Carlson added in another message to the group, \"We are all officially working for an organization that hates us.\"\n\n► Hannity and Doocy mocked Fox's journalists: In a series of November 2020 text messages, Hannity and Steve Doocy attacked the reporting from their colleagues on the so-called \"straight news\" side of the network. \"'News' destroyed us,\" Hannity complained. \"Every day,\" Doocy replied. \"You don't piss off the base,\" Hannity said. \"They don't care. They are JOURNALISTS,\" Doocy texted back. Hannity said he has \"warned\" people at the network \"for years\" and there is \"NOTHING we can do to fix it.\"\n\n► Bartiromo refused to call Biden President-elect: In text messages to Steve Bannon, after the election had been called for Biden, Bartiromo said she had instructed her staff to not refer to the Democrat as President-elect. \"I want to see massive fraud exposed ... I told my team we are not allowed to say pres elect at [all]. Not in scripts or in banners on air. Until this moves through the courts,\" Bartiromo wrote, saying she is \"scared & sad.\" Bannon said she is a \"fighter\" and that the movement needed her. \"Ok,\" Bartiromo replied.\n\n► Fox D.C. chief decried \"existential crisis\" at network: More than a month after the 2020 election, then-Fox News DC Managing Editor Bill Sammon decried the network's coverage of false election claims in private messages to a colleague, fearing it had become an \"existential crisis\" for the right-wing channel. \"It's remarkable how weak ratings makes good journalists do bad things,\" Sammon wrote then-political editor Chris Stirewalt. Stirewalt replied, \"It's a real mess.\"\n\nMost stock quote data provided by BATS. US market indices are shown in real time, except for the S&P 500 which is refreshed every two minutes.

      "text": "White House calls Tucker Carlson 'shameful' in extraordinary rebuke\n\nMarkets\n\nHot Stocks\n\nFear & Greed Index\n\nLatest Market News\n\nHot Stocks\n\nThe White House lashed out at Fox News host Tucker Carlson Wednesday in an extraordinary rebuke of the late-night commentator who has been airing false depictions of the January 6, 2021, attack this week.\n\nCarlson, given access to about 40,000 hours of US Capitol security camera footage by Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, has aired carefully selected clips to portray the pro-Trump mob as peaceful patriots. Carlson falsely claimed that the footage provided \"conclusive\" evidence that Democrats and the House select committee that investigated January 6 lied to Americans about the day's events.\n\nAccording to the Justice Department, 140 officers were assaulted at the Capitol that day, including 60 Metropolitan Police officers and 80 US Capitol Police officers.\n\nThe Fox News host was roundly lambasted by the Capitol Police , Democratic lawmakers and some Republicans this week. White House spokesperson Andrew Bates added to the condemnation Wednesday.\n\n\"We agree with the chief of the Capitol Police and the wide range of bipartisan lawmakers who have condemned this false depiction of the unprecedented, violent attack on our Constitution and the rule of law - which cost police officers their lives,\" Bates said. \"We also agree with what Fox News's own attorneys and executives have now repeatedly stressed in multiple courts of law: That Tucker Carlson is not credible.\"\n\nSuccessfully defending Carlson in a 2020 libel lawsuit, attorneys for Fox News argued that he engages repeatedly in rhetorical hyperbole and opinion .\n\nDuring her daily news conference with reporters Wednesday, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre called January 6, 2021, \"a very dark day and attack on our democracy.\"\n\n\"To have said what he said, when we when we saw Capitol Police officers lose their lives or police officers lose their lives is just - it's just shameful,\" Jean-Pierre said.\n\nAlthough Carlson claimed he had Capitol Police review footage before airing it, multiple sources on Capitol Hill told CNN that Carlson's show provided only one clip to review and not the others. The Capitol Police has continuously warned that release of all security footage from the Capitol could pose a potential security risk for the building.\n\nUS Capitol Police Chief Tom Manger on Tuesday said Carlson selected favorable clips to mislead his audience about the attack . Manger called Carlson's depictions of the events \"offensive.\"\n\n\"The program conveniently cherry-picked from the calmer moments of our 41,000 hours of video,\" Manger wrote in an internal department memo obtained by CNN. \"The commentary fails to provide context about the chaos and violence that happened before or during these less tense moments.\"\n\nManger added that Carlson's show didn't reach out to the police department \"to provide accurate context.\"\n\nCarlson was the subject of several damning documents released as part of Dominion Voting Systems' $1.6 billion lawsuit against Fox that appeared to show Carlson holds opposite views of what he tells his audience. Included in court filings in the defamation case was a series of private text message in which Carlson said he \"passionately\" hates former President Donald Trump.\n\nIn one November 2020 exchange, Carlson said Trump's post-election behavior was \"disgusting.\" And in another text message conversation, two days before the January 6 attack, Carlson said, \"We are very, very close to being able to ignore Trump most nights.

      "text": "What to know about the Tucker Carlson January 6 footage\n\nFox News host Tucker Carlson aired newly released footage on his show Monday from the January 6, 2021, US Capitol attack, that included images of the rioter known as the \"QAnon Shaman,\" as well as of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick , who died following the attack.\n\nRelated video Hear why Kevin McCarthy gave Jan. 6 security footage to Tucker Carlson\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy granted Carlson access to more than 40,000 hours of the Capitol security footage from January 6. CNN and other news organizations have also requested access to the security footage. McCarthy's office said it is still working out the process to make the footage \"more widely available\" but did not comment further. The speaker said Tuesday that the footage would be released to all media organizations, but did not say when.\n\nCapitol Police have continuously warned that release of all security footage from the Capitol could pose a potential security risk for the building. CNN has reached out to Capitol Police for comment.\n\nCarlson, who used the footage in an attempt to downplay the violence and defend the pro-Trump mob, claimed he had Capitol Police review the footage before airing it.\n\nRelated article Analysis: Tucker Carlson, with help from Kevin McCarthy, tries to sanitize the very real violence of the January 6 attack\n\n\"We do take security seriously, so before airing any of this video we checked first with the Capitol Police,\" Carlson said. \"We're happy to say their reservations were minor and for the most part they were reasonable. In the end, the only change that we made was in blurring the details of a single interior door in the Capitol building.\"\n\nMultiple sources on Capitol Hill, however, told CNN that Carlson's show provided only one clip to review and not the others.\n\nHere's what was in the footage that aired Monday:\n\nCarlson claimed that new Capitol security footage taken on January 6 shows Jacob Chansley, known as the \"QAnon Shaman,\" walking through the Capitol without pushback from police.\n\nIn one clip, Chansley is shown with two officers who attempt to open a door near the Senate chamber. In a second clip, Chansley, still flanked by the two original officers, walks between a group of about half a dozen officers and none appear to try to step in.\n\nThere is no audio in the videos, and it is not clear whether the officers and Chansley are talking to each other.\n\nIn court documents, however, prosecutors say that Capitol Police officers repeatedly tried to engage with Chansley and others in the crowd, asking them to leave.\n\nProsecutors say that Chansley disobeyed that request and walked to the Senate floor. Video from that day shows officers following Chansley around the building, and an officer walks into the chamber with Chansley and continues to ask rioters to leave.\n\nAdditionally, Capitol Police officers have testified at several January 6 trials that after the initial wave of rioters entered the building, they felt outnumbered and were afraid of escalating violence by engaging with the mob. Members of the crowd were therefore able to walk into the building without much, or any, physical resistance, according to the officers.\n\nChansley pleaded guilty to a felony charge of obstructing the Electoral College proceedings on January 6 and was sentenced to 41 months in prison.\n\nCarlson aired never-before-seen surveillance footage that he said showed Sicknick, who died one day after the January 6 insurrection. Carlson said he focused on this because Democrats have turned Sicknick into a \"prop\" and a \"martyr\" by overstating the links between his death and the insurrection.\n\nCarlson used the new video to try to undermine the known facts surrounding Sicknick's death, and to argue that January 6 was less violent and \"deadly\" than it has been portrayed.\n\nThe video shows Sicknick in the crypt of the Capitol, appearing to give instructions to some of the nearby rioters who are milling around the area, repeatedly waving his arms. Carlson argued that Sicknick looks \"healthy and vigorous\" in the video, and therefore \"it's hard to imagine\" that he was severely injured by the rioters or that he died because of the insurrection.\n\nOn January 6, Sicknick was attacked with pepper spray and physically fought with members of the mob. An officer testified that she saw Sicknick in significant distress after he was sprayed. He died one day later after suffering a series of strokes. The DC medical examiner ruled that he died of natural causes but said, \"all that transpired (on January 6) played a role in his condition.\"\n\nAccording to Carlson, the new tape of Sicknick was recorded after he was attacked on the frontlines of the Capitol steps, earlier in the day. CNN does not have access to the footage and cannot verify Carlson's claims, and it's unclear how Fox News determined that it's Sicknick in the video.\n\nThe new Sicknick footage does not disprove the medical examiner's conclusion that January 6 influenced Sicknick's death, and it doesn't erase the fact that Trump supporters assaulted Sicknick that day.\n\nTwo rioters pleaded guilty to crimes related to the pepper spray attack against Sicknick, though neither were accused of killing him. Julian Khater, who deployed the spray, is currently serving a six-year prison term . His friend George Tanios spent five months in jail and has been released.\n\nSicknick's mother, Gladys Sicknick, previously blamed Trump supporters for his death. In a statement Monday, after Carlson's show, the Sicknick family blasted Fox News and argued that the footage shows how he was able to valiantly \"resume his duties\" after being attacked by the mob.\n\n\"Every time the pain of that day seems to have ebbed a bit, organizations like Fox rip our wounds wide open again, and we are frankly sick of it,\" the Sicknick family said in the statement.\n\nAccording to statistics released by the Justice Department earlier Monday, more than 999 people are facing federal or local charges related to the January 6 attack, 326 of whom have been charged with assaulting, resisting, or impeding officers or employees.\n\nAccording to the department, 140 officers were assaulted at the Capitol that day, including 60 Metropolitan Police officers and 80 Capitol police officers.\n\nAnd 518 of those charged have pleaded guilty to various charges related to that day, including 60 defendants who have pleaded guilty to federal charges of assaulting officers.\n\nFederal prosecutors said in a court filing Tuesday that \"nearly all\" of the security footage played by Carlson was previously available to attorneys representing riot defendants.\n\nThe disclosure came as part of a response to defense attorney Joseph McBride, who represents several Capitol riot defendants. McBride had asked a federal judge last week to delay his client Ryan Nichols' upcoming trial so that he too could review the footage from McCarthy's office.\n\nThe judge in that case has not yet ruled on whether the trial will be delayed. Nichols has pleaded not guilty.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Tuesday strongly criticized Carlson for diving \"deep into the waters of conspiracy\" to tell \"the bold faced lie\" that the Capitol attack was not violent.\n\nHe also strongly condemned McCarthy for sharing the footage with Fox, arguing McCarthy is \"every bit as culpable\" as Carlson.\n\n\"To say January 6 was not violent is a lie - a lie pure and simple,\" Schumer said in a speech on the Senate floor. \"I don't think I've ever seen a prime time cable news anchor manipulate his viewers the way Mr. Carlson did last night. I don't think I've ever seen an anchor treat the American people and American democracy with such disdain and he's going to come back tonight with another segment.\"\n\nThe pushback didn't just fall along party lines. Several GOP senators rejected the notion that January 6 was \"mostly peaceful chaos\" as Carlson had contended.\n\n\"I think it's bullsh*t,\" GOP Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina told CNN Tuesday of Carlson's portrayal of the attack, adding, \"I just don't think it's helpful, but I do think it's important to point out that that's happened on both ends of the political spectrum and they're both wrong.\"\n\nSen. Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, similarly told CNN, \"I think that breaking through glass windows and doors to get into the United States Capitol against the orders of police is a crime.\"\n\n\"I think, particularly when you come into the chambers, when you start opening the members' desks, when you stand up in their balcony, to somehow put that in the same category as a permitted peaceful protest is just a lie,\" Cramer said.\n\nBut McCarthy told reporters Tuesday evening that he had no regrets about releasing security footage to Carlson.\n\n\"I said at the very beginning, transparency, and so what I wanted to produce for everybody is exactly what he said - that people can actually look at it and see what's going on that day,\" McCarthy told CNN's Manu Raju.\n\nWhen pushed on whether he agrees with Carlson's characterization of the attack on the Capitol, McCarthy said that everyone has their own opinions of January 6.\n\n\"Each person comes up with their own conclusion,\" the California Republican said.\n\nThis story has been updated with additional information.\n\nCNN's Manu Raju, Melanie Zanona, Kristin Wilson and Nicky Robertson contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

The network will rely on a rotation of interim hosts until it names a permanent anchor for the 8 p.m. ET programming block.\n\nThe decision to part ways with Carlson was made by Fox Corp. CEO Lachlan Murdoch and Fox News CEO Suzanne Scott on Friday, according to a person familiar with the matter.\n\n\"Fox & Friends\" co-host Brian Kilmeade anchored the 8 p.m. hour on Monday and opened the show with a brief statement addressing the elephant in the room: \"As you probably have heard, Fox News and Tucker Carlson have agreed to part ways. I wish Tucker the best.\"\n\n\"I'm great friends with Tucker and always will be,\" Kilmeade added. \"But right now, it's time for 'Fox News Tonight,' so let's get started.\"\n\n\"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" a cornerstone of the Fox News  lineup since 2016, was one of the most-watched shows on American cable news, outpacing rivals at CNN and MSNBC.\n\nCarlson, 53, established himself as one of the most influential figures in a conservative political coalition reshaped by former President Donald Trump. He regularly drew controversy for incendiary statements about race, immigration, LGBTQ rights and other topics.\n\nCarlson faced fierce criticism last year when extremism experts drew a connection between his on-air statements and the \"great replacement\" white nationalist views espoused by a gunman who killed 10 people in Buffalo, New York.\n\nHe also attracted intense scrutiny for spreading political misinformation, fostering conspiracy theories about the results of the 2020 presidential election, minimizing the severity of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol and attacking journalists at other outlets.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Dominion trial, Carlson's internal communications were released and showed him criticizing Trump and acknowledging that claims about voter fraud in the 2020  election were baseless.\n\n\"I hate him passionately,\" Carlson said in a text message to an unidentified person on Jan. 4, 2021, according to exhibits unsealed before the Dominion trial was set to begin. (Fox and Dominion settled the suit for $787.5 million last Tuesday, just as opening statements were to start. Dominion declined to comment on Monday.)\n\nBut Carlson later backtracked and recently devoted a full episode of his show to an interview with Trump, who is once again seeking the Republican nomination for president.\n\nThe stock price of Fox Corp., the parent company of Fox News, dropped sharply after Carlson's departure became public, dipping more than 4%.\n\nFox News faces other lawsuits related to statements anchors made in the wake of the 2020 election. The network is also being sued by Abby Grossberg, a former producer for Carlson who alleges the company is a hotbed of discrimination and misogyny.\n\nGrossberg, who once worked as the head of booking on Carlson's show, alleged in a legal filing that the anchor created \"a work environment that subjugated women based on vile sexist stereotypes, typecasted religious minorities and belittled their traditions, and demonstrated little to no regard for mental health.\"\n\nFox has disputed Grossberg's claims, and a spokeswoman for the network recently said: \"We will continue to vigorously defend Fox against Ms. Grossberg's unmeritorious legal claims, which are riddled with false allegations against Fox and our employees.\"\n\nGrossberg's attorney, Gerry Filippatos, said Monday that they'd discussed possible settlement talks with a third-party mediator over the weekend and that those talks had ended \"unfruitfully\" on Monday.\n\nAn outside lawyer investigated Grossberg's allegations, Filippatos said, and Fox News conveyed to Grossberg's lawyers after her firing that her allegations were \"unfounded.\"\n\nThe television news industry was rattled yet again on Monday when CNN anchor Don Lemon shared on Twitter that he had been terminated by the network after 17 years there. Lemon recently provoked backlash for on-air comments about GOP presidential contender Nikki Haley's age.\n\nIn addition to hosting a popular prime-time show, Carlson was also one of the marquee personalities on the company's nascent streaming platform, Fox Nation, after signing a new deal with the company in 2021. \"Tucker Carlson Originals,\" a documentary series, recently profiled people who eat bugs.\n\nCarlson took over the 8 p.m. ET time slot after the departure of Bill O'Reilly, who left the network in 2017 amid a series of sexual harassment allegations. O'Reilly's attorney denied any misconduct at the time.\n\nEarlier in his career, Carlson put in stints at CNN and MSNBC. He also co-founded the conservative commentary website The Daily Caller and wrote articles for various magazines, including Esquire and The Atlantic.\n\nDaniel Arkin is a national reporter at NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

JD Vance, Donald Trump Jr., Rep. Marjorie Taylor Green, former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and far-right pundit Glenn Beck.\n\n\"We're going to be talking about real issues with real people,\" Carlson said in a June statement announcing the live shows. \"You'd better believe the Establishment will be losing their minds.\"\n\nCarlson, 55, is hitting the road two months before the presidential election and will visit several key battleground states, like Arizona, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.\n\nCarlson did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nThe tour kicks off Wednesday in Phoenix with English comedian Russell Brand, who recently converted to Christianity after facing multiple rape and sexual assault allegations.\n\nIn a video posted to his social media accounts last year, Brand denied the allegations and said his relationships had all been consensual.\n\nHe said he received \"extremely disturbing\" communications from a mainstream TV company and a newspaper \"listing a litany of extremely egregious and aggressive attacks.\"\n\n\"But amidst this litany of astonishing, rather baroque attacks are some very serious allegations that I absolutely refute,\" Brand said.\n\nBritish media reported last year that police in the U.K. had questioned Brand about the allegations but he was not arrested nor  charged.\n\nIn June, before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race, Brand endorsed Trump on Fox News and attended the Republican National Convention in July.\n\nAmong the other states Carlson will visit are Florida, Utah, Oklahoma and Texas. His only stop in California will be in Republican-leaning Orange County.\n\n\"This is a brave new world,\" said Larry Elder, a conservative radio host who ran for California governor and, briefly, for president. \"He is unleashed now.\"\n\nElder will join Carlson onstage in Milwaukee, where Republicans recently held their national convention.\n\nCarlson's roster builds on his recent momentum within the Trump and Make America Great Again camp while fueling speculation of Carlson's own political ambitions.\n\nHis name has been mentioned within GOP circles over several election cycles, although Carlson has never formally announced an intention to run for office.\n\nHe was among a handful of insiders who worked behind the scenes to persuade Robert F. Kennedy Jr. to end his independent bid for the White House and endorse the former president, NBC News was first to report.\n\n\"It really is just rallying the troops and the diehard former Tea Party people, the MAGA people,\" said Reece Peck, an associate professor of media culture at the City University of New York-College of Staten Island.\n\n\"They're giving up on the independent, persuadable voter,\" Reece said of Carlson's lineup, describing his guests as \"the stars of the old conservative media world.\"\n\nIn July, about 15 months after he was fired from Fox News, Carlson returned to the beating heart of the GOP when he addressed Republicans at the national convention.\n\nHe took an almost reverential tone when talking about Trump despite once purporting in private texts to hate him.\n\nIn his 11-minute address to delegates, Carlson called Trump \"a changed man\" after an attempted assassination in Pennsylvania and praised the former president's courage and selflessness.\n\n\"This was no longer a man. He was no longer just a political party's nominee or a former president or a future president. This was the leader of a nation,\" Carlson said, describing the event as \"divine intervention.\"\n\nHe also railed against corruption in Washington, called the Biden administration's ongoing military aid to Ukraine a \"middle finger in the face of every American\" and said \"Trump is the funniest person he's ever met.\"\n\nCarlson was abruptly fired from Fox News in April 2023 after the network agreed to pay nearly $800 million to Dominion Voting Systems to avert a defamation trial related to baseless conspiracies it peddled surrounding the 2020 election.\n\n\"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" had been a cornerstone of the Fox News lineup since 2016 and was one of the most watched shows on American cable news.\n\nHe pushed conspiracy theories and misinformation, including spreading falsehoods about the results of the 2020 presidential election and minimizing the severity of the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol.\n\nAfter being fired from Fox News, Carlson announced his eponymously named latest venture in December. The Tucker Carlson Network is a mix of news, documentaries and other streaming services. His podcast was ranked No. 2 Friday on Spotify.\n\nIn February, Carlson became the first Western-based media figure to interview Russian President Vladimir Putin since his forces invaded Ukraine in 2023.\n\n\"It's important to remember who Tucker Carlson is. He comes from incredible wealth,\" said MSNBC commentator Charlie Sykes. \"This is not a middle class guy. His motivations are not the same as the person who just lost his job. He wants to be relevant and have a bit of a revenge.\"\n\nCarlson's father, a journalist-turned-ambassador, married an heiress to the Swanson food fortune. Despite his posh upbringing, Carlson's broad appeal made him a leading voice in the modern conservative movement.\n\nSince his departure from Fox News, Carlson appears to have further stretched his reach through streaming services that helped personalities like Joe Rogan shoot to stardom.\n\n\"Here is someone who really knows how to walk in both worlds,\" said Christina Bellantoni, professor of journalism at the University of Southern California. \"He's a personality who can make money delivering to crowds. He's adaptable.\"\n\nAlicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Former Fox News host Tucker Carlson interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin gave a more than two-hour interview to former Fox News host Tucker Carlson that was released online Thursday, covering a variety of topics, from Ukraine to the Russian economy, but breaking little new ground.\n\nPutin told Carlson that Russia has not achieved its war aims in its widely condemned invasion of neighboring Ukraine , and he began the interview with a roughly 20-minute, mostly uninterrupted, speech about history that included the days of Catherine the Great, the empress of Russia from 1762 to 1796.\n\nCarlson at one point flattered Putin and said it was not boring but added, \"I just don't know how it's relevant.\"\n\nNBC News has not been provided any details about the circumstances under which the interview was recorded. Putin spoke in Russian, and the translation was provided by Carlson's show.\n\nPutin did not rule out that Russia could release jailed Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich , whom the U.S. says is being wrongfully detained, but suggested that the U.S. would have to make a deal.\n\nThere is an \"ongoing dialogue between the special services,\" he said.\n\n\"We want the U.S. special services to think about how they can contribute to achieving the goals our special services are pursuing. We are ready to talk. Moreover, the talks are underway,\" Putin said.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal dismissed Putin's claim that Gershkovich, 32, was involved in \"espionage,\" but it said Thursday it was encouraged by any deal that could bring him home.\n\n\"Evan is a journalist, and journalism is not a crime. Any portrayal to the contrary is total fiction. Evan was unjustly arrested and has been wrongfully detained by Russia for nearly a year for doing his job, and we continue to demand his immediate release,\" the Journal said .\n\nIt was Putin's first interview with a Western-based media figure since his forces inva ded Ukraine two years ago. He delivered many familiar talking points and was rarely challenged by Carlson.\n\nCarlson has consistently repeated falsehoods, misinformation and conspiracy theories, and he has been a vocal critic of U.S. support of Ukraine.\n\nReferring to sanctions the U.S. and other countries placed on Russia in response to the invasion of Ukraine , Putin said, \"The tools that the U.S. uses don't work.\"\n\nPutin also said he had a good personal relationship with former President George W. Bush. \"I had such personal relationship with Trump, as well,\" he said.\n\nAsked whether there could be renewed communication between the U.S. and Russia in an administration after President Joe Biden, Putin said: \"It is not about the leader. It is not about the personality of a particular person.\"\n\nThe interview was posted on Carlson's website at about 6 p.m. Thursday, with Carlson's account on X also posting it. X, the social media site owned by Elon Musk, has - along with Facebook and Instagram - been blocked in Russia since the early days of the war.\n\nThe Kremlin has been engineering another expected election victory for Putin in March - and the Russian military has been making gains on the battlefield while aid for the Ukrainians is held up in Congress by Republicans loyal to former President Donald Trump.\n\nCarlson, who was fired from Fox News in April , has since fashioned himself as an independent journalist. He boasted ahead of the interview that he was the only Western journalist willing to interview Putin - a claim that was undermined by the Kremlin, which indicated that Carlson got the interview precisely because of his pro-Russia stance on the war in Ukraine.\n\nNot only has Carlson questioned U.S. support for Kyiv, but he has also frequently been featured on Kremlin propaganda channels since he left Fox News.\n\nUkrainians were quick to criticize Carlson for speaking to Putin while Russia continued to bombard their country.\n\n\"I hope he will be asked why he kills civilians and hits residential buildings,\" said Andriy Yermak, the chief of staff for Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. \"Criminals should be tried, not talked to.\"\n\nCarlson has also accused the Western media of neglecting to interview Putin while often talking to Zelenskyy at length.\n\nNBC News' Keir Simmons interviewed Putin in Moscow in 2021, and former CNBC anchor and correspondent Hadley Gamble also spoke with him just months before the war. In December, NBC News interviewed Putin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov.\n\nIn addition, an untold number of Western journalists have made repeated requests for interviews with Putin, only to be rebuffed by the Kremlin.\n\nPeskov himself contradicted Carlson's claim that no Western media had \"bothered\" to interview Putin, saying Wednesday that the Kremlin receives \"many requests\" for interviews with him.\n\nBut Peskov also accused Western news outlets of being inherently biased against Putin, adding that \"there is no desire to communicate with such media.\" He said Carlson was granted the interview because his position \"differs from the rest.\"\n\nReporting from Russia during the war has proved dangerous for domestic and foreign journalists after Moscow enacted draconian legislation that criminally penalizes criticism of its armed forces. The laws have forced many Russian independent media and Western news organizations to move their operations out of Russia.\n\nTwo U.S. journalists are in Russian custody. Gershkovich is still awaiting trial after he was detained last spring, facing espionage charges that his employer and the U.S. government strenuously deny.\n\nAlsu Kurmasheva , a Russian American reporter with Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL), was detained in October and has been charged with failure to register as a foreign agent. RFE/RL is a nonprofit news organization funded through the United States Agency for Global Media.\n\n\"Tucker Carlson should concentrate on his journalism, and stop attacking other journalists - doing so makes himself look like the worst kind of fact-adverse shock jock,\" Tim Dawson, the deputy general secretary of the International Federation of Journalists, said in a statement to NBC News. \"Any honest attempt to understand President Putin is welcome. It is sad that Tucker Carlson is promoting his interview with unevidenced invective and untruth.\"\n\nPutin rarely interacts with the public, and he has relied on prepared speeches and official events to rail against the West. In December, he held his first big news conference since the war started, a carefully curated event at which only one Western media outlet was given the opportunity to ask a question.\n\nCarlson has openly questioned U.S. support for Kyiv , accused Washington of provoking Russia to invade and criticized the Ukrainian government. He is popular in Russia and is regularly quoted by Russian propagandist media as an authoritative pro-Moscow voice in the U.S.\n\nIn the days leading up to the interview, Russian state media closely followed Carlson's every move, reporting feverishly on his trips to the Bolshoi Theater and the Russian version of McDonald's.\n\nFor Putin, Carlson's visit was a welcome distraction from a bleak winter in which Russia has grappled with a widespread utility crisis, growing protests by soldiers' wives and a potential c hallenge from Boris Nadezhdin , a surprisingly popular anti-war politician.\n\n\"Carlson's help is invaluable for Putin,\" Abbas Gallyamov, a Russian political analyst and former Putin speechwriter, said on his Telegram channel. \"It is not possible to find momentum inside the country, so Carlson is the main hope here.\"\n\nFox News parted ways with Carlson in April after it agreed to pay nearly $800 million to Dominion Voting Systems to avert a high-stakes defamation trial that had cast a shadow over the network's future.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Dominion trial, Carlson's internal communications were released, showing him criticizing Trump and acknowledging that claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election were baseless.\n\nSince then, he has launched a show on X and a subscription-based streaming service.\n\nShortly after he left Fox News, Carlson also received offers of employment from Russia's propagandist RT network and Vladimir Solovyov, a pro-Kremlin propagandist and commentator on Russia state TV.\n\nBut Carlson has chosen to build his own brand. In recent months he has interviewed Hungary's autocratic leader, Viktor Orbán, and Argentina's right-wing president, Javier Milei.\n\nNational Security Council spokesman John Kirby said earlier Thursday that no one in the U.S. should be misled by Putin's attempts to justify the invasion of Ukraine.\n\n\"He invaded a neighboring country without provocation - Ukraine wasn't a threat to anybody, and the American people understand that. And the American people understand what Ukraine is fighting for,\" Kirby said.\n\n\"Remember, you're listening to Vladimir Putin,\" Kirby said at a briefing. \"And you shouldn't take at face value anything he has to say.\"\n\nYuliya Talmazan is a reporter for NBC News Digital, based in London.\n\nPhil Helsel is a reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

NBC News has not seen the letter, but the source familiar with the matter confirmed that all the details in the Axios report were accurate. Top spokespeople at Fox News did not immediately respond to emails seeking comment.\n\nThe first installment of Carlson's new show, \"Tucker on Twitter,\" debuted June 6. In a roughly 10-minute video monologue titled \"Ep. 1,\" he claimed without evidence that Ukraine perpetrated an attack on a large dam in Russian-occupied territory and characterized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy in terms that the Anti-Defamation League called antisemitic .\n\nCarlson will address the federal indictment of former President Donald Trump in the next episode of the show, set to premiere Tuesday, according to his producer. Trump is slated to be arraigned in federal court in Miami on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn a separate letter to Carlson's lawyers last week that did not expressly demand he stop posting videos on Twitter, Fox News general counsel Bernard Gugar said the former prime-time host was \"in breach\" of his contract with the network. The contract, signed in November 2019 and amended in February 2021, limits his ability to appear on other media outlets.\n\nIn a statement, Bryan Freedman - another attorney for Carlson - insisted that any legal action by Fox News would infringe on the television personality's First Amendment rights.\n\n\"Fox defends its very existence on freedom of speech grounds,\" Freedman said. \"Now they want to take Tucker Carlson's right to speak freely away from him because he took to social media to share his thoughts on current events.\"\n\nThe conflict between Fox News and Carlson comes at an inflection point for the conservative media ecosystem.\n\nFox's ratings in the 8 p.m. programming block once occupied by Carlson have lagged since his exit, and the network faces competition from upstart right-wing news sources such as One America News Network (OANN) and Newsmax.\n\nMeanwhile, Twitter owner Elon Musk is attempting to present the social media service as a welcome home for other commentators. He tweeted after Carlson posted the first episode of his program that it \"would be great to have shows from all parts of the political spectrum on this platform!\"\n\nCarlson's ouster from Fox News shocked the overlapping worlds of politics and media. \"Tucker Carlson Tonight,\" a cornerstone of the Fox News lineup since 2016, was one of the most-watched shows on American cable news.\n\nHe established himself as one of the most influential figures in a conservative political coalition reshaped by Trump. The TV host regularly drew controversy for incendiary statements about race, immigration, LGBTQ rights and other topics.\n\nIn the lead-up to the Dominion trial, Carlson's internal communications were released and showed him criticizing Trump and acknowledging that claims about voter fraud in the 2020 election were baseless. Carlson later backtracked .\n\nDaniel Arkin is a national reporter at NBC News.\n\nDiana Dasrath is entertainment producer and senior reporter for NBC News covering all platforms.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

In 2023 British media reported allegations that Brand had sexually and emotionally abused four women, which he denies.\n\nTogether, Carlson and Brand mostly delivered a Bible sermon surrounding their shared Christian identity and only tangentially touched on the presidential race.\n\n\"After this election, you are going to be the inheritors of the new United States of America,\" Brand said. \"I suppose, in particular, I'm encouraged by the joining of Trump's Republican MAGA movement by Robert Kennedy.\"\n\nCarlson entered the Footprint Center to thunderous applause and a standing ovation following a video compilation that showed dystopian images of smash-and-grab robberies and excerpts of interviews with Democrat lawmakers, including Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nBrand closed the night by dropping to his knees and leading the crowd in prayer.\n\nOutside, Phoenix resident Deirdre Mischelle Scanlan said the two were a natural fit on stage.\n\n\"They're free media,\" she said. \"We  share the apprehension about the deep state and how it seems like we're not getting the truth.\"\n\nNorth Carolina resident Alexandrea Iverson, who planned a visit with family around Carlson's tour, said she felt politically inspired for the first time this election cycle.\n\n\"I'm a Kennedy supporter and if I say Kennedy's my guy, everybody says, 'Oh, isn't he a nut job?'\" she said. \"But not tonight.\"\n\nCarlson, 55, was abruptly fired from Fox News last year and has since launched his own eponymous media company.\n\nIt's difficult to track Carlson's official reach, but his podcast is No. 2 on Spotify. While there appear to be plenty of tickets available for each night of his 16-date tour, some VIP packages, which cost $1,600 and feature meet-and-greets with special guests including Alex Jones and Donald Trump Jr., are sold out.\n\nCarlson's event kicked off a whirlwind week of Republican appearance in Arizona. Sen. JD Vance spoke to a local church congregation Wednesday afternoon and is scheduled to hold a campaign event in Phoenix Thursday.\n\nArizona, which swung blue in the 2022 midterms , is a crucial state to win in November and both presidential candidates are laser focused on gaining an advantage.\n\nHarris visited in early August , and made immigration a key component of her stump speech during a packed rally in Glenade, a Phoenix suburb.\n\nSeveral weeks later, Trump was joined onstage in the same suburb by  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. shortly after the independent dropped out and endorsed the former president.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jimmy McCain, the youngest son of the late Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., announced during an interview with CNN that he registered as a Democrat and has decided to vote for Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nHe made the decision after an incident involving Donald Trump's campaign staff at Arlington National Cemetery, Jimmy McCain said.\n\nTrump visited the cemetery last week with relatives of service members who were killed in Kabul during the U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan three years ago.\n\nA member of Trump's team \"pushed aside\" a cemetery official so that campaign staff could take photos and videos in an area where they are normally prohibited, according to the Army.\n\nTrump's team has disputed that account.\n\nThe incident was the last straw for the younger McCain, whose father and sister had previously distanced themselves from Trump.\n\nCORRECTION (Sept. 5, 2:16 p.m. ET): A previous version of this article misstated that Tucker Carlson dropped to his knees and led the crowd in prayer. It was Russell Brand who did so, not Carlson.\n\nAlicia Victoria Lozano is a California-based reporter for NBC News focusing on climate change, wildfires and the changing politics of drug laws.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

The million-dollar question: Can the firebrand conservative commentator cultivate a devoted following on a brand-new platform?\n\nTwitter does not disclose information about the number of people who watch videos on the platform, making it difficult to discern the size of the viewing audience for Carlson's incendiary straight-to-the-camera monologues about topics like the federal indictment of former President Donald Trump and the war in Ukraine .\n\nBut data shared exclusively with NBC News this week offers a window into how Carlson's videos are performing on Twitter since he and his production team started posting them on June 6, just 43 days after Fox News announced that it had agreed to \"part ways\" with the host of the most popular primetime show on the network.\n\nThe first episode of \"Tucker on Twitter,\" a roughly 10-minute monologue in which Carlson asserted without evidence that Ukrainian forces attacked a dam in Russian-controlled territory, netted roughly 26 million video views, according to statistics shared by Tubular Labs , a third-party media analytics firm that has access to the platform's developer tools and contracts with other major internet platforms, including Facebook and YouTube.\n\nThe second episode, a more than 12-minute monologue in which Carlson appeared to suggest that the threat of American white supremacy has been overstated, received 13.2 million video views. The video views for the third episode, released hours after Trump was arraigned in a Miami courtroom, improved over the second installment, netting 18.7 million, according to the statistics.\n\nThe numbers shared by Tubular Labs are not publicly available. The \"views\" metric that appears under most videos on Twitter refers to the approximate number of users who saw the tweet while scrolling through their timelines - not the number of people who pressed play and started watching.\n\nIn fact, Twitter owner Elon Musk's team appears to have recently removed the real-time tally of video views that used to be a staple of the platform.\n\nJustin Wells, Carlson's executive producer, did not immediately reply to an email on Thursday seeking more data on the \"Tucker on Twitter\" videos, including metrics such as video starts, retention rates (the average amount of time a user spends watching a video, calculated as a percentage point), completion rates and total minutes viewed.\n\nTwitter's press office did not immediately respond to emails seeking information about the metrics and requesting comment on the Tubular Labs data. NBC News received two emails with the Musk-era Twitter press team's default reply: the \"poop\" emoji.\n\nA spokesperson for Carlson could not immediately be reached for comment.\n\nThe insights come at a pivotal time for Carlson, who established himself as one of the leading voices in the Trump-era conservative movement while at Fox News and must now start fresh on Twitter, a much more crowded platform that may not be as familiar to the older viewers who make up a core part of Fox's audience, according to Reece Peck, an associate professor in the department of media culture at the City University of New York who studies news.\n\nCarlson is also facing stern legal warnings from Fox News. The company sent him a cease-and-desist letter this week demanding that he stop posting videos to Twitter because he is still under contract at the network. Carlson's lawyers have argued that the network cannot infringe on his First Amendment rights.\n\nMeanwhile, Musk and Twitter's newly installed CEO, Linda Yaccarino, are attempting to pitch the platform as a welcome home to other well-known television news broadcasters, including Don Lemon (who was fired from CNN on the same day Fox News dismissed Carlson) and MSNBC's Rachel Maddow. (Yaccarino used to oversee advertising sales at NBCUniversal, the parent company of NBC News.)\n\n\"It'd be great to have @maddow, @donlemon & others on the left put their shows on this platform,\" Musk wrote on June 8 above a retweet of the second installment of Carlson's show. \"You will receive our full support. The digital town square is for all.\"\n\nThe metrics obtained by NBC News help clarify misconceptions that have spread on social media.\n\nIn the days since \"Tucker on Twitter\" debuted, pro-Carlson accounts on Twitter have made claims about the size of his audience based on the number of \"views\" listed underneath his tweets. The day after the first episode dropped, for example, Carlson's biographer, Chadwick Moore, tweeted in part : \"Tucker's video got 90 million, and counting.\"\n\nThe video views data shared with NBC News helps paint a more well-rounded portrait of Carlson's performance on Twitter, but the numbers might overstate his viewership, too. Twitter's official guidelines for content creators states that a \"video view metric is triggered when a user watches a video for at least 2 seconds and sees at least 50% of the video player in-view.\"\n\nCarlson's admirers have implied that his viewership on Twitter dwarfs the average number of viewers who reliably tuned into \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" in the 8 p.m. hour of Fox News, which attracted a nightly average of 3.391 million viewers in April, the final month it was on air, according to Nielsen, the television industry's leading measurement firm.\n\nBut those claims are misleading, and the comparisons are apples and oranges, as the former president of Nielsen explained in a widely cited 2015 blog post .\n\n\"In TV, the standard measurement unit for viewership is the average-minute audience - how many viewers there are in an average minute of content,\" Steve Hasker wrote in the post. \"In the digital space, on the other hand, video measurement is commonly expressed as the gross number of times the video is viewed,\" even if only for a second or two.\n\n\"These two metrics are quite different, and comparing one to the other unfairly tilts the comparison against TV,\" he added.\n\nDaniel Arkin is a national reporter at NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

He was charged by information , suggesting that he plans to enter a plea deal. Not long after he was charged, a virtual plea agreement hearing was set for Wednesday, Sept. 20 before Chief Judge James Boasberg.\n\nThe criminal information charges that Epps \"did knowingly, and with intent to impede and disrupt the orderly conduct of Government business and official functions, engage in disorderly and disruptive conduct in and within such proximity to, a restricted building and grounds-that is, any posted, cordoned-off, and otherwise restricted area within the United States Capitol and its grounds, where the Vice President was and would be temporarily visiting-when and so that such conduct did in fact impede and disrupt the orderly conduct of Government business and official functions, and attempted and conspired to do so.\"\n\nMost of the thousands who unlawfully gathered on the restricted grounds of the U.S. Capitol have not been charged unless they engaged in some sort of aggravating conduct, like attacking police or destroying property. Video shows that Epps attempted to deescalate tensions between the police and rioters, though he's also shown with his hands on a giant Trump sign the rioters jammed into the police line. A federal judge acquitted another Jan. 6 participant who had his hand on that same sign, saying that his intent was unclear.\n\nEpps is not charged with entering the Capitol; he is only known to have been on the grounds on Jan. 6. Reached for comment a lawyer for Epps, Edward J. Ungvarsky, said that the case \"is filed with an anticipation of entry of a guilty plea tomorrow to the charge\" and declined to comment further.\n\nIn an interview with the Jan. 6 committee last year, Epps said that he'd gone to Washington, D.C., in January 2021 as a supporter of former President Donald Trump, but that the conspiracy theories that followed had torn his life apart.\n\n\"I never intended to break the law,\" Epps, a former Marine, told the committee. \"It's not in my DNA. I've never - I'm sure you've looked up my record.

I got on stage and there was no Tucker.\"\n\nHe wasn't. Within a minute of sitting down, Carlson immediately dove into asking if Pence thought Jan. 6 was an insurrection.\n\n\"I've never used the word insurrection, Tucker, over the last two years, but it was a riot that took place at the Capitol that day,\" Pence said of the 2021 attack.\n\nBut it was Pence's stance on Ukraine that proved to be the most controversial.\n\nThe two argued over whether Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's government was respecting religious liberty. While on Fox News, Carlson was frequently critical of Ukraine and U.S. support for the country in the war with Russia.\n\nPence outlined his position saying, \"I believe that it is in the interest of the United States of America to continue to give the Ukrainian military the resources that they need to repel the Russian invasion and restore their sovereignty.\"\n\nThose comments elicited boos from the audience - the first of the day.\n\nThe exchange then escalated when Tucker continued to insist Zelenskyy had \"arrested priests for having views they disagree with.\" Pence repeatedly pushed back, saying he had asked religious leaders about this issue during his trip to the country in June and was told it was not happening.\n\nCarlson would not let Pence move on, continuing \"I can't let you glide over the question of the treatment of Christians and clergy.\"\n\nPence cut in firmly, \"The problem is you won't accept my answer.\"\n\nPence has leaned into his support for Ukraine during his presidential run, distinguishing himself from some of his rivals - including former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis - who have been far more critical of U.S. involvement there.\n\nIn remarks to reporters after the interview with Carlton, Pence was asked if he was surprised by how much of the conversation he spent defending his support of Ukraine.\n\n\"I'm really never surprised by Tucker Carlson,\" he replied.\n\nHe laid the blame for much of the audience's disagreement with him on this issue at the feet of President Joe Biden.\n\n\"The fact that Joe Biden has failed at [leading domestically and internationally], I think, has undermined the willingness of some conservative Americans, including conservative Christians, to otherwise stand behind our role as leader of the free world,\" Pence said. \"But look, I believe in leadership, not followership.\"\n\nBianca Seward is a producer with NBC News.\n\nSarah Dean is a 2024 NBC News campaign embed.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Far right laments Tucker Carlson's ouster and loss of its shot at the mainstream\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nFox News' dismissal of top-rated host Tucker Carlson sent shock waves through mainstream and conservative media this week. But nowhere was Carlson's loss felt more than on the fringe and right-wing websites and forums where so many of his narratives originated.\n\nOn web shows and message boards, creators of hate and conspiracy theory content bemoaned the loss of Carlson and their path to a mainstream audience.\n\n\"He amplified [my] reporting more than anyone else,\" Darren Beattie, a blogger and purveyor of conspiracy theories related to the Jan. 6 attack on the Capitol, said Monday on a web show hosted by Turning Point USA President Charlie Kirk.\n\n\"He was basically the only person on Fox who would dare to have me on, and I'm not the only case,\" Beattie said. \"There are other people, and nobody would dare let them on any other Fox show. But Tucker would have them on to say things that you won't hear anywhere on American TV.\"\n\nCarlson's relationship to fringe figures on the far right was, in some ways, symbiotic. He would use his platform to attack institutions and people, unleashing a troll army drawn from the very ranks of the fringe right-wingers and 4Chan users who loved him - something the authors of this article have experienced on several occasions.\n\nSteve Bannon, a former top Trump aide who appeared Tuesday on Kirk's show, said the \"power of Tucker Carlson\" was his ability to distill and package fringe political ideas to a new audience. Bannon said Rupert and Lachlan Murdoch, the father and son who oversee Fox News' parent company , fired Carlson to keep \"those ideas [from] seeping into a more mainstream audience.\"\n\nThose sentiments are backed up by academics and researchers who study how internet extremism makes its way into mainstream U.S. politics and culture. Carlson's show repeatedly echoed conspiracy theories and disinformation that gained traction on extremist forums like 4chan - and that would otherwise not have appeared on Fox News.\n\n\"Once a story reached Tucker Carlson, it was at the apex of conservative media, and Fox News is the voice of authority in conservative media,\" said Robert Faris, a senior researcher at Harvard University's Shorenstein Center on Media, Politics and Public Policy, who studies networked digital technologies and media. \"It let other people know that it's OK to talk about these kinds of things in the language that they use. Just that it's on the air, it's ambient and it's on in so many public spaces means that anything they platform has a wider reach than any of the more committed hyper-partisan sites.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Fox News declined to comment beyond the statement the company issued announcing Carlson's departure and thanking him for his work there.\n\nCarlson used his platform at Fox News to spread information that had been widely discredited.\n\nCarlson featured a segment this month claiming that Ukrainian casualties in the Russian invasion were widely underreported. He was citing an altered document that first appeared on 4chan and had been widely debunked before the segment aired.\n\nDays before that, Carlson devoted a segment to a 4chan hoax about a \"Trans Day of Vengeance\" that was being promoted on April Fools' Day. As evidence, he aired a tweet from an anti-Black troll account whose name alludes to a racial slur.\n\nCarlson also used his platform to turn his audience on certain people. Most recently, Ray Epps, who has sought a retraction over Carlson's false allegations that he worked for the federal government and helped incite the riot at the Capitol, said on CBS News' \"60 Minutes\" that he believed Carlson was trying to destroy his life.\n\nThe authors of this article saw that firsthand at times when Carlson aired segments about our reporting and even lobbed personal and professional attacks at us, alleging that legitimate reporting was an effort to ruin lives and that reporting on social media platforms was activism for censorship.\n\nBeyond the attacks and misinformation, Carlson also embraced some of the more extreme views of white supremacists.\n\nAn analysis last year by The New York Times found that Carlson had repeatedly promoted a racist conspiracy theory known as the Great Replacement Theory, which posits that Jews and Democrats encourage immigration, feminism and gender nonconformity as part of a conspiracy to wipe out the white race. The analysis found he devoted at least 600 segments to white victimhood.\n\nWithout Carlson, experts say, a sort of pipeline carrying misinformation and hateful ideologies from the fringes of the internet to a large national audience is now missing a crucial juncture.\n\n\"Tucker Carlson often looks for relatively obscure figures and theories that are basically defenses of white supremacy and gender binary ideologies,\" said A.J. Bauer, an assistant professor who studies right-wing movements and media at the University of Alabama.\n\n\"He platforms those and finds ways of amplifying peculiar, narrow theories that don't have a widespread circulation,\" Bauer said. \"Because of that, he's been particularly dangerous with regard to the problems of misinformation and conspiracy thinking. These fringe and marginal figures who struggled to get mainstream media access saw Tucker Carlson as their route into the mainstream.\"\n\nWhite supremacist message boards, which frequently watched along live with Carlson's show, were overloaded with posts lamenting his firing.\n\nUsers on the politics board on 4chan implored one another to \"stop flooding the board\" with new threads announcing his departure.\n\n\"Tucker's one of the last /ourguys/,\" a 4chan user wrote, referring to a meme among white nationalists to identify fellow travelers online .\n\n\"Bad times coming, anons. Been obvious for a while, but it seems to be reaching its apogee,\" another 4chan user wrote.\n\nThe \"newslinks and articles\" board on Stormfront, the web's oldest self-identifying white nationalist message board, was flooded with new posts lamenting the cancellation of Carlson's show.\n\nThe forum's posts usually struggle to crack double-digit replies, but a thread about the Carlson news had over 200 posts, many of which blamed his firing on an antisemitic conspiracy theory about control of the media.\n\nNBC News was unable to reach Carlson for comment. He did not respond to direct messages on Twitter, and messages left on cellphone numbers and at an email address associated with him were not answered.\n\nOther prominent white nationalists, like Nick Fuentes and the white supremacist website The Daily Stormer, brushed off Carlson's impact, saying they do not believe his ability to \"soft redpill\" his audience - or slowly radicalize them into white supremacy - had a major impact.\n\nEric Owens, who worked for Carlson for five years when Carlson was The Daily Caller's editor-in-chief, said the future of the far right-to-mainstream pipeline depends on what Fox News executives decide to do next.\n\n\"Are they actually worrying about making the country better and avoiding these lawsuits in the future, or are they just going to replace him with another newer, cheaper Tucker?\" Owens said in an interview, referring to Dominion Voting Systems' recent lawsuit against Fox.\n\nOwens, who has frequently renounced The Daily Caller's current iteration, said Carlson noticeably changed between the time he began working at The Daily Caller in 2012 and when he left in 2018.\n\n\"I don't know what happened to Tucker,\" Owens said. \"I think the executives at Fox News just kind of lost control, and I think they're scared.\"\n\nOwens pointed to Carlson's text messages unveiled in the Fox-Dominion trial, which cost the network $787 million to settle. In the texts, Carlson noted that telling the truth about the 2020 election was \"measurably hurting the company\" and noted that \"the stock price is down\" while insisting that the network should stop accurately reporting on the results.\n\n\"They became a juggernaut, and then they realized they had to serve these really bad impulses,\" Owens said of Fox News.\n\nWhether Fox News tries to reproduce the pipeline Carlson built or whether Carlson could rebuild it at another outlet remains to be seen.\n\n\"The question becomes if the grievance machine is still going to need feeding and someone to feed it, what can Fox News add to that time slot?\" Faris, of Harvard's Shorenstein Center, asked. \"How are they going to replace Tucker?\"\n\nBrandy Zadrozny is a senior reporter for NBC News.

He called the expected passage of the bill \"an important day for America, and a very important day of freedom-loving countries around the world.\"\n\nThe Senate voted 80-19 on Tuesday to advance the legislation, setting up a final passage vote that's expected later in the day, or could slip to Wednesday. President Joe Biden has vowed to sign it, and it could become law within days.\n\nMcConnell, who consistently bucked loud conservative voices in his party who opposed Ukraine funding, argued that the margin of support for the war-torn country is an indication the Republican Party is tracking back to its Reaganesque roots of defending the encroachment on democracy around the world.\n\nMcConnell said he remains committed to working to help regain a Republican Senate majority, despite his plans to step back from leadership at the end of the year. He said he believes the crop of candidates the Republicans have recruited are more inclined to back away from the party's recent isolationist tendencies.\n\n\"I think we've turned the corner on the isolationist movement,\" McConnell said. \"I've noticed how uncomfortable proponents of that are when you call them isolationist. So I think we've made some progress and I think it's gonna have to continue because we got big, big problems: China, Russia, Iran. Going into World War II we just had Germany and Japan.\"\n\nThe package's difficulty in the House led to an extended period where Ukraine went without aid, primarily because of right-wing House Republicans who argued the money should not be spent abroad but instead should be spent here at home on border security. McConnell said part of the blame falls on the Biden administration for not recognizing the need earlier and reacting, but acknowledged Congress should've acted more quickly.\n\n\"Acting quicker, partially because of the administration partially because of Congress, not approving this bill sooner, has not been helpful,\" McConnell said.\n\nThe Kentucky Republican also defended House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., whose transformation from Ukraine aid skeptic to staunch supporter helped assure passage in the House. \"More important than what I think about the speaker is what the former president thinks about the speaker,\" McConnell said. \"And he obviously made it clear that he was a fan of Speaker Johnson and suggested some of his critics to shut up. So I'll just quote the former president.\"\n\nMcConnell said he feels positive about the GOP's Senate nominees so far in the battle for the majority this fall, when asked if he has the same \"candidate quality\" concerns of 2022.\n\n\"I feel pretty good about our nominees. I'm pretty confident we're going to win West Virginia. That's 50. You all can do the math. One more makes 51,\" McConnell said. \"And I hope to hand this job over to the majority leader.\"\n\nSahil Kapur is a senior national political reporter for NBC News.\n\nRyan Nobles is a correspondent covering Capitol Hill.\n\nFrank Thorp V is a producer and off-air reporter covering Congress for NBC News, managing coverage of the Senate.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

But his show has not reached the ratings peaks that Carlson garnered while he was at the network.\n\nMeanwhile, Carlsonâs new turn as a digital content creator on X has made some news, primarily with his controversial interview of Vladimir Putin.

The news of his departure sparked strong reactions from politicians and media figures across the political spectrum Monday.\n\nCarlson was a prominent supporter of Donald Trumpâs 2016 presidential campaign and many of this stances and policies throughout his presidency.\n\nHe recently made headlines after old texts surfaced in which Carlson was discussing Trump in early 2021 and said, âI hate him passionately.â The messages were released by Dominion Voting Systems amid its defamation suit against Fox News.\n\nLast week, the network agreed to pay over $787 million to Dominion to settle the suit, which included claims that Carlsonâs show promoted harmful lies about the 2020 election.\n\nAbby Grossberg, a producer who had worked on Carlsonâs show, filed lawsuits against the company last month related to the Dominion case, including claims that she and other women faced sexism and harassment from coworkers and officials.\n\nGrossbergâs lawyer Parisis G. Filippatos said in a statement to Semafor that they were aware of reports that mention Grossberg in coverage of the Dominion lawsuit and Carlson and Wellsâ departure. He said he had âno comment on those reports other than to say that timing is a matter of physics, and as such is undeniable.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor media"

      "text": "Trump envoy blasted over 'insane' Putin comments in Tucker Carlson interview\n\nWASHINGTON - Rep. Seth Moulton, D-Mass., blasted recent comments on Russia and Ukraine by special envoy Steve Witkoff as \"insane,\" accusing President Donald Trump's real estate mogul friend of \"negotiating for the other side.\"\n\nIn a Friday interview with former Fox News host Tucker Carlson , Witkoff bandied Russian talking points used to legitimize the invasion of Ukraine and praised Russian President Vladimir Putin as a \"super smart guy\" who he takes \"at his word.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN's Kate Bolduan on Monday morning, Moulton, a former Marine, said it was \"insane that you have a U.S. negotiator taking the side of our enemy.\"\n\n\"He's literally negotiating for the other side, negotiating for the aggressor, negotiating for the violator of international law,\" Moulton said.\n\nWitkoff has taken a leading role in the Trump administration's ongoing talks with Russia and Ukraine to negotiate an end to the war, now in its fourth year. In the hour-plus interview with Carlson, he said he doesn't see Putin as \"a bad guy.\"\n\nComing two days before U.S. talks to end the war restarted in Saudi Arabia, Witkoff's comments pointed to a unprecedented shift in the U.S. stance towards Russia and its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nWitkoff visited Putin earlier this month in a meeting that \"got personal,\" he told Carlson. Putin commissioned a portrait of Trump from a \"leading Russian artist\" that Witkoff delivered to the White House, he said.\n\n\"It was such a gracious moment,\" he added.\n\nAfter Trump was shot in the ear during an assassination attempt last summer, Putin \"prayed\" for Trump , Witkoff said, \"not because he was the President of the United States or could become the President of the United States,\" but because \"he was praying for his friend.\"\n\nWitkoff implied Russia had legitimate claim to four territories of Ukraine that it illegally seized during the invasion - Donetsk, Luhansk, Zaporizhzhia and Kherson.\n\nTaking up a talking point brandished by Russia to legitimize its invasion, he said residents of those territories had voted in favor of Russian annexation. Those elections, held in September 2022, months after Russia invaded, were widely denounced as a sham by the U.S. and its European allies.\n\n\"The Russians are de facto in control of these territories,\" Witkoff said. \"The question is...will the world acknowledge that those are Russian territories?\"\n\nTrump has strengthened ties with Putin, even as he has berated and criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy , provoking alarm from lawmakers and Ukraine's European allies.\n\nHe cut off U.S. aid and intelligence sharing with Ukraine for around 10 days after an Oval Office meeting with the Ukrainian leader late last month devolved into a shouting match in which Trump berated him for \"gambling with World War III.\"\n\nTrump has called Putin directly several times - an about-face from former President Joe Biden, who sought to ostracize Putin on the world stage and never dealt with him directly after the Feb. 2022 invasion. Last week, Putin agreed on a call with Trump to pause Russia's attacks on Ukrainian energy infrastructure for 30 days."

Georgia could prove vital on the way to 270 electoral college votes for the win, as it holds 16 votes.\n\nDuring his speech to the crowd , he described Democratic leadership during the last four years using a couple of metaphors.\n\nThese included calling Democratic leadership a \"hormone-addled 15-year-old daughter,\" or even a toddler who is allowed to \"smear the contents of his diapers on the wall of your living room.\"\n\nHe went on to describe Trump as a disappointed father, ready to discipline his children.\n\n\"When Dad gets home, you know what he says? 'You've been a bad girl, you've been a bad little girl, and you're getting a vigorous spanking right now,\" he said. \"I'm not going to lie. This is going to hurt you a lot more than it hurts me. And you earned this. You're getting a vigorous spanking because you've been a bad girl.\"\n\nVideo of the speech showed the crowd cheering following Carlson's metaphor.\n\nToward the end of his remarks, Carlson suggested to the crowd that if Harris were to win in November, they should not accept the results.\n\n\"At the end of all of that, when they tell you they've won, no!\" Carlson said. \"You can look them straight in the face and say 'I'm sorry, Dad's home, and he's p-----.'\"\n\nFernando Cervantes Jr. is a trending news reporter for USA TODAY.

Really? Not a word about himself,\" Carlson said. \"Everything was different after that moment. Everything. This convention is different. The nation is different. The world is different. Donald Trump is different.\"\n\nTrump famously got his news from FOX News and Carlson's high-profile talk show while in office. The pair have maintained a friendship over the years, and Carlson claimed the shooting transformed Trump.\n\n\"In that moment, Donald Trump, months before the presidential election, became the leader of this nation, \"Carlson said. \"I think it changed him.\"\n\nCarlson also alluded to his past false claims that the 2020 presidential election was \"stolen\" from Trump while seeming to take jabs at President Joe Biden .\n\n\"You could take, I don't know, a mannequin, a dead person, and make him president,\" Carlson said. \"Theoretically possible. With enough cheating, that could happen.\"\n\nFOX News parted ways with Carlson in 2023 following a nine-figure settlement with Dominion Voting Systems, which sued the company over Carlson's on-air comments about the 2020 election. Soon after, Carlson founded his own streaming network to broadcast to his audience, and in February, he interviewed Russian President Vladimir Putin .\n\nThe former president's son, Donald Trump, Jr., revealed this week that if his father had not tapped Ohio Senator JD Vance to join him on the Republican ticket this November, he hoped he would have chosen Carlson.\n\nRachel Barber is a 2024 election fellow at USA TODAY, focusing on politics and education.

He said in the case Trump is reelected on Nov. 5. and returns to the White House next year, it will be as if he is coming home to punish his misbehaving daughter, the country.\n\n\"He's not vengeful.

Former White House Communications Director Kate Bedingfield responded to a clip of Carlson's metaphor on X writing , \"what the actual...\" and James Singer, a spokesperson for the Kamala Harris campaign, called Carlson's comments \"weird\" using an expletive.\n\nLater, when Trump took the stage at the Duluth campaign stop, members of the audience chanted \"Daddy's home.\" Trump used the appearance as an opportunity to celebrate the state's record early voter turnout and its potential swing-state impact.\n\nAs the host of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on Fox News, Carlson was one of the network's biggest stars. The show was canceled last year following a series of controversies . Carlson drove ratings at the network but, his critics say he pushed extreme right-wing views and trafficked in racist and misogynistic themes and conspiracy theories.\n\nSavannah Kuchar contributed to this report.

He also featured singer Kid Rock and Trump cabinet nominees Vivek Ramaswamy and Robert F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nThe show describes itself as a \"beacon of free speech and honest reporting in a media landscape dominated by misinformation,\" adding that \"the only solution to ending the propaganda spiral is by telling the truth.\"\n\n\"That's our job. Every day. No matter what,\" the description of the right-wing podcast says.\n\nCarlson was dismissed from Fox News in April 2023. The network's ex-top-rated cable news host announced last spring that they were \"parting ways.\"\n\n\"We thank him for his service to the network as a host and prior to that as a contributor,\" Fox said at the time.\n\nCarlson became Fox's most popular personality after replacing Bill O'Reilly , who was fired in 2016 after settling a sexual harassment claims. During Carlson's tenure at the network. he consistently made headlines for far-right coverage, including airing tapes from the Jan. 6 Capitol insurrection to minimize the impact of the deadly attack.\n\nNetwork spokespersons didn't respond to a request to elaborate on the reasons for his departure at the time, but it coincided with $787.5 million payment Fox agreed to make last spring to settle a lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems.  Dominion's suit accused Fox News of recklessly airing false election claims and conspiracy theories following the 2020 presidential election, with Tucker's revealed text messages front and center in the case.\n\nCarlson recently garnered headlines at a Georgia campaign rally for Donald Trump before the 2024 presidential election for comments in which he likened Trump to a father coming home to spank his misbehaving teenage daughter, the country.\n\n\"He's not vengeful.

      "text": "In Tucker Carlson interview, Putin's plans for Ukraine appear to echo Trump's\n\nFormer Fox News host and divisive conservative political commentator Tucker Carlson on Thursday released a lengthy and carefully stage-managed interview with President Vladimir Putin - the first Western media figure to do so since Russia invaded Ukraine nearly two years ago.\n\nCarlson published the video interview on his personal website. It was also posted on his X social account. The interview took place in a gilded hall at the Kremlin palace in Moscow.\n\nIt covered a variety topics from the war in Ukraine to President Joe Biden, from the fate of detained Wall Street Journal reporter Evan Gershkovich to Elon Musk. The interview did not break meaningful new ground. Carlson has consistently spread misinformation and conspiracy theories. He's also been a strident critic of Ukraine.\n\n\"If you really want to stop fighting, you need to stop supplying weapons,\" Putin said when asked by Carlson about the prospect for peace in Ukraine, referring to Western aid. \"It will be over within a few weeks. That's it.\"\n\nPutin said he didn't see a point in calling Biden , whom he had not spoken to since before the invasion. Biden has refused to speak to the Russian leader unless genuine conditions for negotiating a peace deal are put forward.\n\nInstead, Putin's answers about the fighting in Ukraine seemed to echo with the U.S. president he said he had a positive relationship with: Donald Trump .\n\nPutin called on the U.S. to \"make an agreement\" to end the war, likely involving Ukraine ceding territory to Russia.\n\n\"Before I even arrive at the Oval Office, shortly after I win the presidency, I will have the horrible war between Russia and Ukraine settled,\" Trump said at a Manchester, New Hampshire, rally last month.\n\nTrump has not explained how he would achieve this.\n\nThe interview comes as momentum on the battlefield appears to have swung in Russia's favor while fresh U.S. aid for Ukraine remains uncertain in Congress. Polls show the majority of Americans believe the U.S. should be supporting Ukraine, but many are concerned it may be doing too much at the expense of domestic priorities. Republicans are far more skeptical than Democrats over the utility of sending Ukraine more wartime aid.\n\nAt times, the interview, which lasted more than two hours, became somewhat confrontational. However, Carslon did not explicitly challenge Putin's many false assertions, nor did he push Russia's leader on his military's alleged war crimes in Ukraine or political repressions at home.\n\nWhen Putin said he believed Russia and the U.S. could potentially reach a deal to free Gershkovich, an American journalist Russia detained last year, Carlson pressed him: \"This guy's obviously not a spy. He's a kid, and maybe he was breaking your law in some way, but he's not a super spy, and everybody knows that.\"\n\nPutin's government has been holding Gershkovich for more than a year for reporting on the invasion. Gershkovich has been charged with espionage, an allegation he and the U.S. State Department deny. The U.S. government has determined that Gershkovich is being wrongfully detained.\n\nThe U.S. made an offer late last year to secure Gershkovich's release but said Moscow rejected it. Putin appeared to indicate Thursday that he would consider swapping Gershkovich for Vadim Krasikov, a Russian assassin who killed a Georgian-born dissident in a park in Berlin in 2019. Krasikov followed his victim to the park on a bicycle. He's serving a jail sentence in Germany.\n\nPutin dominated the conversation. He also appeared to occasionally joke and snarl at Carlson's expense.\n\n\"Are we having a talk show or a serious conversation?\" Putin said in response to a question about why he had previously said he believed the U.S. could, via NATO, launch a \"surprise attack\" on Russia.\n\n\"Your basic education is in history, as far as I understand,\" Putin added. \"So if you don't mind, I will take only 30 seconds or one minute to give you a short reference to history to give you a little historical background.\"\n\nPutin then went on to speak for more than 20 minutes about the history of Eastern Europe, including references to Catherine the Great, the 18th century empress of Russia.\n\nCarlson struggled to interrupt Putin during his personal overview of Russian history.\n\nAt one point, the conversation took a turn to discussing the U.S. reputation in the international community. Putin claimed the U.S. is more afraid of a \"strong China\" than it is of a \"strong Russia.\"\n\nPutin repeated false claims Russia did not attack Ukraine. He addressed his relationships with past U .S. presidents , saying he had a \"very good\" one with George W. Bush .\n\nAnd he lavished praise on Tesla's founder, who also owns X.\n\n\"I think there's no stopping Elon Musk,\" he said.\n\nIn a social media monologue prior to releasing the interview, Carlson said he wanted to sit down with Putin because \"most Americans are not informed\" on how the war in Ukraine is \"reshaping the world.\" He blamed U.S. mainstream media for this, alleging that \"no one has told them the truth.\" He has previously claimed, without providing evidence, that the U.S. government has thwarted his attempts to sit down with Putin.\n\nCarlson said Western journalists have, by contrast, interviewed Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskyy many times. He described these interviews as \"fawning pep sessions\" aimed at amplifying Ukraine's need for more U.S. weapons and ultimately directed at getting the U.S. more involved in the war.\n\nThere was no immediate official reaction to Carslon's interview with Putin from Ukraine's government.\n\nInternational media outlets have sat down with Zelenskyy dozens of times since the war's start. However, there is little merit to Carlson's other claims. Journalists in Russia face extreme reporting restrictions. They can be arrested for labeling Russia's invasion a \"war\"; instead, they have to call it a \"special military operation.\"\n\nRussia's crackdown on free speech extends to regular citizens as well as journalists. They can be arrested or fined for criticizing the war in Ukraine. Carlson promotes his show on social media platform X as a defender of free speech.  The International Criminal Court in The Hague, Netherlands, has issued an arrest warrant for Putin . It accused him of war crimes in Ukraine including deporting children from Ukraine to Russia.\n\nSince news of the interview broke, many Western journalists have been posting on social media how they have repeatedly attempted to secure interviews with Putin over the last two years. The last time Putin was interviewed by an American journalist was in June 2021 with NBC's Keir Simmons .\n\n\"Does Tucker really think we journalists haven't been trying to interview President Putin every day since his full scale invasion of Ukraine?\" CNN's Christiane Amanpour wrote on X. She called his claim \"absurd.\"\n\nPutin himself has made many speeches and public appearances during which he's commented at length on the war in Ukraine and his \"objectives.\" At various times, he's described these as \"denazification, demilitarization and its neutral status.\" There is no evidence to indicate that Ukraine has a systemic problem with neo-Nazis. Putin has long been vehemently opposed to Ukraine and other neighboring nations joining NATO.\n\nPutin has said that Western countries have been \"stupefied\" by anti-Russian propaganda.\n\nBefore the interview ran, White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters that Americans shouldn't believe anything Putin said in the interview.\n\n\"Anybody (who) watches that interview you need to make sure to remember that you are listening to Vladimir Putin. You shouldn't take at face value anything he has to say.\"\n\nAs the host of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" on Fox News, Carlson was one of the network's biggest stars. The show was canceled last year following a series of controversies . Carlson drove ratings at the network but, his critics say he pushed extreme right-wing views and trafficked in racist and misogynistic themes and conspiracy theories.\n\n\"Tucker Carlson isn't a journalist, he's a propagandist,\" wrote Ian Bremmer of the Eurasia Group, a global political risk consultancy, on X.\n\nCarlson has been a longtime defender of Putin and he has consistently questioned U.S. support for Ukraine.\n\n\"It may be worth asking yourself, since it is getting pretty serious, what is this really about? Why do I hate Putin so much?\" he said as Russia's leader amassed troops on Ukraine's border , ready to invade, in February 2022.\n\n\"Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? These are fair questions, and the answer to all of them is: 'No.' Vladimir Putin didn't do any of that.\" Carlson described Ukraine as a \"a pure client state of the United States State Department\" and the then looming war as a \"border issue.\"\n\nPrior to his interview with Putin, one of the topics Carlson addressed on his X account, which posts material from his subscription streaming service, was about male-pattern baldness.\n\nContributing: Francesca Chambers"

      "text": "American extremists love Tucker Carlson. Five ways he helped spread their messages\n\nFor years, America's far-right extremists have relied on Fox News' Tucker Carlson as \"our guy\" - the man who would take white supremacist tropes from the darkest corners of the internet, give them his own twist, and send them out to his tens of millions of viewers.\n\nWhen the news broke Monday that Carlson had \"parted ways\" with Fox News, immediate reaction focused on his role in the channel's false claims about Dominion Voting Systems , which led to a settlement of more than $700 million.\n\nBut extremists across the far right lamented the loss of perhaps the most reliable amplifier of their theories and rumors by the host of one of cable TV's most-watched shows.\n\n\"Tucker Carlson was taken off the air because he was telling the truth and because he was popular,\" fumed conspiracy theorist Alex Jones in a video posted to social media Monday. \"Fox News is all about having controlled conservatives to manipulate and lead the narrative, but Tucker Carlson didn't sell out to the system.\"\n\nHere are five times Carlson, who was fired from Fox on Friday, has amplified extremist talking points:\n\nCarlson has long pushed the racist and antisemitic theory of a \"great replacement\" happening in America. This debunked theory posits that white people are being systematically \"replaced\" by immigrants of color not by natural demographic changes but in a deliberate scheme orchestrated by an elitist liberal cabal.\n\nThe Great Replacement Theory aims to inject fear into white, conservative voters that they are being \"replaced\" by immigrants of color, who, as the theory goes, are more likely to vote for the liberal policies favored by the shadowy group working to bring them into the country.\n\nLast year, The New York Times reported that Carlson pushed this theory on more than 400 episodes of his show. Last May, the Anti-Defamation League called for Carlson to be removed for his promotion of the Great Replacement theory.\n\nIn August 2018, then- President Donald Trump tweeted that he had asked Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to investigate \"the large scale killing of farmers\" in South Africa. The tweet directly followed one of several television segments Carlson devoted to the claim that white South African farmers were being killed in huge numbers.\n\nThat story had been formed and spread on 4Chan and other spaces online, where posters spread the lie of a \"white genocide\" in South Africa as justification for their hatred of Black people. Those same forums erupted with joy when Carlson, then Trump, repeated their baseless ruse.\n\nThere was, and is, no truth to this rumor, but that didn't stop Trump and Carlson spreading it to their tens of millions of followers.\n\nHeidi Beirich, who then led the Southern Poverty Law Center's Intelligence Project on hate and extremism, said of the Fox News host at the time: \"Tucker Carlson has become our hate mainstreamer-in-chief.\"\n\nIn December 2018, Carlson said on the air that immigration makes America \"poorer, and dirtier and more divided.\"\n\nThe comments, on which Carlson later doubled down , led to an exodus of advertisers from his show.\n\nEarlier this year, Carlson aired a segment featuring previously unseen video footage from inside the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. (In a sign of Carlson's influence among conservatives, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy had given him \"exclusive\" access to a trove of security video.)\n\nBy picking a few snippets of video, Carlson told his viewers that the insurrection was not the deadly, violent uprising it was. Instead, he portrayed Jan. 6 as a largely peaceful gathering of law-abiding patriots, recasting the Washington mob that breached the Capitol as an \"orderly and meek\" gathering of \"sightseers.\"  His comments were contradicted by the U.S. Capitol Police chief , who called the segment \" offensive and misleading .\"\n\nA dangerous new wave of social media chatter followed, including death threats against Capitol police officers and Democratic leaders, according to experts who monitor extremism and a report from Advance Democracy.\n\nCarlson has led the way among many conservative pundits pushing the idea that anti-fascist activists are part of a highly organized army called \"Antifa.\" This idea seeks to lump any leftist organizers and activists together as evil anarchists bent on destroying America.\n\nThat claim has even been taken up by prosecutors, including in one landmark case in San Diego.\n\nCarlson's reports on Antifa - earlier this year he called Antifa the \" armed militia of the Democratic Party \" - have been instrumental in the battle to convince millions of Americans that any young person who dresses in black and protests against anything from police brutality to environmental damage is part of this group.\n\nCarlson, like others, regularly places the responsibility for any property damage caused during protests or riots on the shoulders of  \"Antifa,\" even when violence occurs at clashes between far-left and far-right protestors like members of the Proud Boys."

      "text": "Dick Carlson, Award-Winning Journalist, Political Whisperer and Father of Tucker Carlson, Dies at 84\n\nManage your account\n\nRichard \"Dick\" Carlson, an award-winning journalist, political lobbyist and diplomat whose colorful - and often personally tragic - life took him from a Boston orphanage to the highest levels of media, business and American political power, has died. He was 84.\n\nHis son, former Fox News host and conservative podcaster Tucker Carlson, confirmed his death Wednesday on X , saying he died at his home in Boca Grande, Florida, after six weeks of illness.\n\n\"He refused all painkillers to the end and left this world with dignity and clarity, holding the hands of his children with his dogs at his feet,\" Carlson wrote in his obituary, including details of his father's difficult childhood.\n\nRichard Carlson was born in 1941 to a 15-year-old girl who spoke only Swedish and tried to hide the pregnancy. He developed rickets because of malnutrition and was left at a Boston orphanage, and after years in foster homes, was placed with the Carlson family in Massachusetts. His adoptive father died when he was 12, and after a troubled teenhood, he served in the Marines and drove to California in search of adventure, where he found his calling in journalism.\n\n\"Over the next decade, he was a copy boy at the LA Times, a wire service reporter for UPI and an investigative reporter and anchor for ABC News, covering the upheaval of the period,\" Tucker Carlson wrote. \"He knew virtually every compelling figure of the time, including Jim Jones, Patty Hearst, Eric Hoffer, Jerry Garcia, as well as Mafia leaders and members of the Manson Family. In 1965, he was badly injured reporting from the Watts riots in Los Angeles.\"\n\nIn 1975, Richard Carlson was married with two small boys \"when his wife departed for Europe and didn't return,\" wrote Tucker Carlson, who has said that she wanted to pursue a \"bohemian lifestyle.\" His father \"threw himself into raising his boys, whom he often brought with him on reporting trips\" and educated them at the dinner table \"on topics that ranged from the French Revolution to Bolshevik Russia, PG Wodehouse, the history of the American Indian and, always, the eternal and unchanging nature of people.\"\n\nAs a reporter and anchor at KABC-TV in Los Angeles, Carlson won several awards, including a Peabody in 1971 for a story about car promotion fraud. He later became the longest-serving director of Voice of America, the federal government's nonmilitary broadcasting arm, under the Reagan Administration.\n\nHe left in 1991, when President George H.W. Bush nominated him as U.S. ambassador to the Seychelles, and served less than a year before becoming CEO of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, the private but publicly-funded facilitator of content for public airwaves, where he remained five years.\n\nIn 1997, Carlson became president and CEO of King World Public Television, a subsidiary of \"Oprah\" syndicator King World Productions, in 1997, until it was sold to CBS in 1999.\n\nAll the while, Carlson had a foot in politics, with close ties to the White House, and was involved in negotiations on behalf of the U.S. government with many foreign countries, including China, Korea, the USSR, Germany and Israel. He lost a San Diego mayoral race and has testified dozens of times before various U.S. Congressional committees on a broad range of topics.\n\n\"The last 25 years of his life were spent in work whose details were never completely clear to his family, but that was clearly interesting,\" Tucker Carlson wrote. \"He worked in dozens of countries and breakaway republics around the world, and was involved in countless intrigues. He knew a number of colorful national leaders, including Rafic Hariri of Lebanon, Aslan Abashidze of Adjara, Mobutu Sese Seko of Zaire, and whomever runs Somaliland.\"\n\nHe married Patricia Swanson, heir to the Swanson Foods fortune, in 1979.\n\n\"They were together for 44 years, all of them happy,\" Tucker Carlson wrote. \"She died sixteen months before he did and he mourned her every day.\"\n\nRichard Carlson is survived by his sons, Tucker and Buckley, his daughter-in-law Susie, and five grandchildren.\n\n\"He was the toughest human being anyone in his family ever knew, and also the kindest and most loyal,\" Tucker Carlson concluded. \"RIP.\"\n\nThe post Dick Carlson, Award-Winning Journalist, Political Whisperer and Father of Tucker Carlson, Dies at 84 appeared first on TheWrap ."

      "text": "Tucker Carlson Says He's 'Definitely More Sympathetic to Putin Than Zelensky'\n\nManage your account\n\nRight-wing commentator Tucker Carlson, who has often been called a MAGA puppeteer, said he was \" sympathetic \" to Russian President Vladimir Putin in an interview with NewsNation's Chris Cuomo. The conservative conspiracy theorist added that Russia was \"thriving\" as it continues to bombard Ukraine with deadly missiles three years into the war.\n\nCarlson confessed that he's \"definitely more sympathetic to Putin than Zelensky for the following reason: I think it's fair to judge leaders on how they do for their country. They have one job. Do a good job for your country. Make it better.\"\n\nHe also suggested that Putin was not an autocrat but rather a typical leader: \"Putin does not have absolute control of his country, and there are all kinds of potential rivals,\" he said. \"He's been there for 20 years.\"\n\nCarlson's links to the Kremlin run deep. In the war's early days, Putin sent out talking points to state propaganda outlets and encouraged them to feature Carlson \"as much as possible\" on their broadcasts because he was slamming the United States and its \"negative role in unleashing the conflict in Ukraine.\"\n\nCarlson was even able to interview Putin himself last year. The pair talked for over two hours. During his trip, Carlson filmed a video of himself fawning over a supermarket . \"Coming to a Russian grocery store, the 'heart of evil,' and seeing what things cost now and how people live ... it will radicalize you against our leaders,\" he said, referring to then-President Joe Biden. \"That's how I feel, anyway ... radicalized.\"\n\nWhen Carlson returned, he said he was not pro-Putin, but \"if I was, that's okay too. I'm an adult man, an American citizen. I can like or dislike anyone I want. I can have the opinion I want.\"\n\nCarlson has previously been interviewed by Cuomo, his former rival who once claimed he was interviewing Putin for \"attention.\" Still, he claimed that the \"conversation\" has to reflect a \"range of ideas.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump has historically been complimentary of Putin and sought to establish ties with Russia. He's taken an unprecedented stance on the war by publicly accusing Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky of being a \"dictator\" and humiliating him in an Oval Office meeting in which he complained Zelensky had failed to show sufficient appreciation for the U.S.'s wartime support. He also said that Zelensky was \"gambling with World War Three\" and wasn't ready for peace.\n\nTrump has further shown support for Putin by saying it was a \"mistake\" for Russia to be kicked out of the G7. Putin was originally forced out of the group after Russia invaded and annexed Ukraine's Crimea region in 2014.\n\nTrump has also pointedly refused to accuse Russia of starting the war and even blamed Zelensky instead.\n\nCuomo's full interview will air Monday. In the preview, Carlson said that Russia is doing well and \"actually, for a country at war, is thriving.\"\n\nBeside Putin, Carlson has long been a booster of Trump. In 2023, he said, \"I'm voting for Trump, and if they convict him, I will send him the max donations, and I will lead protests. That's how I feel.\"\n\nDespite his public support for the president, Carlson reportedly said in private text messages-which came to light during Dominion Voting Systems's lawsuit against Fox News-that he hates Trump \"passionately.\"\n\nA previous producer on his show said that Carlson threatened to \"destroy\" top Republicans if they didn't obey Trump and used his show to promote the party's leadership. Fox fired Carlson with little explanation in April 2023.\n\nThe Daily Beast has reached out to Tucker Carlson for comment."

It's the last time you'll hear it in this conversation.\"\n\nCuomo recalled Carlson telling him, \"Give it time, embrace doing what you're doing, and don't look for the acceptance of where you were,\" adding, \"That was really good advice.\"\n\nIn December 2021, Cuomo was fired after reports that he helped his brother Andrew Cuomo, then the governor of New York, defend himself from sexual harassment allegations.\n\nCarlson called CNN's treatment of Cuomo, who had interviewed the then-governor on-air, \"weird hypocrisy.\"\n\nCuomo added, \"So from a year ago until today, I now know that.

      "text": "Richard Carlson, former KABC reporter and father of Tucker Carlson, dies at 84\n\nManage your account\n\nRichard Carlson, a controversial fixture in West Coast TV journalism during the 1970s, died Monday at his Florida home after a long illness.\n\nCarlson's death was announced by his son Tucker, the conservative pundit and former Fox News host, in a post on X.\n\nRichard Carlson, who started his award-winning career as a copy boy at the Los Angeles Times, became a familiar presence to Los Angeles TV viewers as an investigative reporter for KABC. He also worked at KGO in San Francisco and KFMB in San Diego.\n\nWhile at KABC, Carlson aggressively reported on the fall of G. Elizabeth Carmichael, a transgender woman who developed a three-wheeled electric car when the country was dealing with skyrocketing gas prices. Carmichael never produced the car and was convicted for defrauding investors.\n\nCarlson, whose reporting revealed that Carmichael was transgender, was featured prominently in a 2021 HBO documentary about the entrepreneur, \"The Lady and the Dale.\" Carlson remained unrepentant about outing Carmichael, telling her documentarians, \"If Liz's behavior is normal, then so too is Jeffrey Dahmer's.\"\n\nWhile working at KFMB, he outed transgender professional tennis player Renée Richards after she won a women's singles division title in a La Jolla tournament.\n\nCarlson left journalism shortly after the Richards story, saying he was disillusioned by the global sensation it generated. \"There are so many interesting things I think are important and interesting, but the media can be counted on to do handstands over that kind of scandal and sexual sensation,\" he told The Times in 1984.\n\nRichard Carlson was born on Feb. 10, 1941. His mother was a 15-year-old Swedish-speaking girl who placed him in an orphanage in Boston. After years in foster homes, Carlson was adopted by a family in Norwood, Mass.\n\nRichard Carlson's adoptive father, a tannery manager, died when he was 12. He became a juvenile delinquent, arrested and jailed at 17 for car theft. He eventually enlisted in the Marine Corps and was a merchant seaman before pursuing a career in journalism, according to Tucker Carlson's post.\n\nAfter his military service, Richard Carlson joined The Times, where he became friends with Carl Brisson, the son of actress Rosalind Russell. They formed a journalistic partnership that included a Look magazine report that linked former San Francisco Mayor Joseph Alioto to organized crime, ending his political career.\n\nAlioto called the article \"character assassination for political purposes\" and eventually won a $350,000 libel award. Carlson was not named as a defendant in the case.\n\nIn 1971, Carlson moved to TV station KABC, where he earned a Peabody Award for an investigative report on car promotion fraud. He moved to KFMB as a reporter and anchor in 1975.\n\nCarlson's first wife left him in 1975, leaving him as a single father to raise Tucker and his brother, Buckley. He remarried in 1979 to Patricia Swanson, the heiress to the frozen-food company, who died in 2023.\n\nAfter leaving television, Carlson joined Great American Federal, a San Diego-based savings and loan. He toyed with a career in politics, making an unsuccessful bid to become mayor of San Diego in 1984 against incumbent Roger Hedgecock, who was under indictment for perjury at the time.\n\nIn 1985, Carlson moved to Washington to work for the Reagan administration. He spent five years as the director of the Voice of America, and then moved to the Seychelles as the U.S. ambassador. In 1992, he became the chief executive of the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, which provides federal funding to public media.\n\nIn 1997, Carlson joined King World, the syndication company that distributed \"The Oprah Winfrey Show,\" \"Jeopardy!\" and \"Wheel of Fortune\" before it was sold to CBS in 1999. He later served as vice chairman for the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, a Washington-based neoconservative think tank.\n\nAlong with his two sons, Carlson is survived by five grandchildren.\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times ."

And as you can see, because it's a left lean, they wrote terrible stories about President [Donald] Trump,\" Soon-Shiong told Carlson in an interview that aired Wednesday . \"So my statement to them was, 'You may have an opinion, but all of us should have opinions based on facts.'\"\n\nSoon-Shiong's appearance on Carlson's podcast comes as he tries to attract more conservative readers to his newspaper, which he argues has become too liberal. He has clashed repeatedly with the union representing the paper's journalists, which has said the billionaire owner is increasingly \"voicing his political opinions and, at times, misrepresenting our journalism - a stark change from when he saved the paper in 2018.\"\n\nThe decision to pull back the endorsement led to the resignation of the paper's editorials editor , triggered mass turnover on the editorial board and pushed thousands of readers to cancel their subscriptions.\n\n\"We lost a lot of viewers,\" Soon-Shiong said to Carlson. \"Thousands of people unsubscribed. But I don't think it's right that we should be this canceling society.\"\n\nSoon-Shiong took to X to explain his decision last October and said that he instead asked the editorial board to draft a \"factual analysis of all the positive and negative policies by each candidate\" while they were in the White House. The board declined, he wrote.\n\n\"I took a lot of heat because the editorial board resigned,\" Soon-Shiong told Carlson. \"I can just say they were not happy.\"\n\nThe newspaper owner and billionaire doctor has faced blowback from within the paper in recent months, including for inviting conservative CNN commentator Scott Jennings to join the Times' editorial board and promoting HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. during his confirmation process.\n\nSoon-Shiong has said he is building a new \" fair and balanced \" editorial board.\n\n\"What's exciting to me is I'm rebuilding with young people,\" he said."

His reading and life experiences convinced him that God is real. He had an outlaw spirit tempered by decency. \"\n\nIn 1979, Dick married frozen food heiress Patricia Swanson.

It's All Too Clear Why He Did.\n\nManage your account\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nEric Adams is on a press tour that would make Timothée Chalamet blush, blitzing longform sit-down podcast video interviews opposite dudes . You wouldn't call it getting out in front of things, exactly. Adams has already been indicted in one of at least five federal investigations ; his legal troubles are now matched by his political troubles-his favorability ratings have hit rock bottom , and his polling is even worse . If Andrew Cuomo gets in the New York mayoral race (and there is lots of speculation he will), it looks as if it'll be over for Adams . It might be over for Adams regardless.\n\nIn any case, the mayor has taken time out of his busy schedule of hitting the club and cutting the budget to clear the air. And what better way, for the cause of purification, than going on Tucker Carlson's online show.\n\nLet's just establish this from the outset: Adams has spent much of his political life as a registered Republican . He has also been dogged by allegations of corruption for nearly as long as he's been in politics.\n\nHe staked his unlikely political rise to the mayor's office in 2021 on a GOP tried and true: a crime panic. Lawbreaking was out of control in NYC, at least according to the New York Post , and only a former police officer could get tough on the poor, the turnstile-hoppers, and the homeless. Conservative media cheered his position, as did some center-left pundits.\n\nBeing \"tough on crime\" has worked for conservative politicians for decades, and it worked for Adams too. But quickly, Adams' actual conservative policies and resolute unseriousness about governance knocked him out of the public's good graces.\n\nLooking for another powerless scapegoat on which to pin the mess of his administration, and to cover up vicious and unnecessary cuts to popular social programs, Adams joined a conservative ensemble training its ire on immigrants and asylum-seekers and creating more unfounded panic, around migrant crime specifically . This, Adams believes, was the beginning of the end of his relationship with the Democratic Party, at least according to the version of events he tells Carlson. Not because his efforts were mean-spirited, cynical, unnecessary, or beset by poor leadership, but because he was engaged in such a brave act of truth-telling that it created huge political liabilities for Democrats who were captive to Big Immigrant. In Adams' version of the tale, it was then and only then that the politicized Justice Department came knocking, and clapped the cuffs on Adams .\n\n\"I read through the indictment ... I thought it was ridiculous,\" is how Carlson begins the interview. \"You were indicted for accepting upgraded flights.\"\n\nOf course, Adams' Turkish Airlines account is only the funniest piece of a litany of infractions for which he was indicted. One small problem with the interview, which was branded as \"Tucker Challenges Eric Adams,\" is that Carlson never once, in the 51-minute sit-down, mentions the straw-donor campaign scheme for which Adams has been charged.\n\nThat would lead to some inconvenient issues regarding Adams' version of this story. Long before he was the only Democrat brave enough to call out crime or immigrants, he was allegedly funding his campaign through an elaborate series of falsely reported donations. One of those straw donors pleaded guilty earlier this month.\n\nCampaign-finance infractions are grave enough as is; in Adams' case, they're particularly offensive because of his city's public matching program. The initiative, which matches small-dollar donations up to $250 from city residents at a rate of up to eight times the original amount, is one of the most well-intentioned, pro-democracy civic procedures in American politics, a meaningful bulwark against big money buying elections.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Adams' campaign conspired to funnel illegal donations from foreign nationals into his campaign coffers and encouraged business leaders to circumvent contribution limits by instructing their employees to donate, then reimbursing them. In doing so, Adams also availed himself of millions of dollars in public matching funds.\n\nIn short, the tough-on-crime mayor got into Gracie Mansion not just by abusing public trust but by allegedly stealing money from the public purse. Carlson does not dwell on this, perhaps because that's not a Republican no-no. Adams claims that New York's immigration surge was a financial drain on the city's resources, which is true, and that the federal support was insufficient, which is also likely. What he doesn't even try to back up is that his slashing of library hours and 3-K or the termination of outdoor dining had anything to do with this.\n\nWhich leads to Adams' third and (perhaps) final, well-worn Republican plaint: The Democratic Party left him. \"People often say, 'Well, you don't sound like a Democrat,' \" Adams confides to Carlson. \"No. Well, the party left me, and it left working-class people.\"\n\nIf you have a politician who talks like a Republican, governs like a Republican, and in fact was a Republican before he was a Democrat, well ... he might just be angling for a pardon from a Republican president. Or maybe he wants to join Donald Trump's Cabinet or, if worst comes to worst, to be a TV anchor in a new Republican media venture. A better question than \"Did the Democratic Party leave Eric Adams?\" is \"Why on earth did the Democratic Party get into bed with this guy in the first place?\"\n\nCarlson posits the interview as a sign that Trump's theory of the world has broken through, now undeniable even for Democrats; \"New York Mayor Eric Adams Sounds a Lot Like a Trump Voter\" is the name of the segment. What the interview actually shows, instead, is proof that there are at least two prominent Republicans from New York who will say anything to avoid consequences for their own corruption."

The network said in a press release Monday that the popular and controversial prime-time host's last program aired on Friday.\n\nLoading...\n\nApril 24, 2023, 3:30 p.m. ET | New York\n\nFox News said Monday that it is parting ways with prime-time host Tucker Carlson, whose stew of grievances and political theories about Russia and the Jan. 6 insurrection had grown to define the network in recent years and influence GOP politics.\n\nFox offered no explanation for the stunning move, saying that the last broadcast of \"Tucker Carlson Tonight\" aired last Friday.\n\nShares of Fox Corp. slid 4% within seconds of the announcement of Mr. Carlson's departure.\n\nThe break comes less than a week after Fox agreed to pay $787 million to settle a lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems over the network's airing of false claims following the 2020 presidential election. Mr. Carlson was also recently named in a lawsuit by a former Fox producer who said the show had a cruel and misogynistic workplace.\n\nMeanwhile, CNN axed its own controversial anchor, Don Lemon, part of a one-day bloodletting in cable television news.\n\nMr. Carlson, who worked at both CNN and MSNBC earlier in his career, ditched his bow-tie look and quickly became Fox's most popular personality after replacing Bill O'Reilly in the network's prime-time lineup in 2016.\n\nHis populist tone about elites out to get average Americans rang true with Fox's predominantly conservative audience, even leading to talk about him becoming a political candidate himself one day.\n\nHe did not immediately return a message seeking comment on Monday.\n\n\"Tucker Carlson had become even bigger than Fox News,\" said Brian Stelter, who's writing an upcoming second book about Fox, \"Network of Lies.\" \"His sudden ouster will have profound consequences for Fox News, for TV news, and the Republican Party.\"\n\nWhen Mr. Carlson's exit was announced during a live showing of the ABC daytime talk show \"The View\" on Monday, the studio audience applauded. Host Ana Navarro then led the crowd in a sing-along to a line from the song, \"Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye.\"\n\nEarlier this year, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy gave Mr. Carlson exclusive access to security tapes from the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, which the show used to conclude \"the footage does not show an insurrection or riot in progress.\" His interpretation was denounced by many, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\nMr. Carlson has also been outspoken in questioning the United States' support of Ukraine following its invasion by Russian forces.\n\n\"It might be worth asking yourself since it is getting pretty serious: What is this really about?\" Mr. Carlson said on his show. \"Why do I hate Putin so much? Has Putin ever called me a racist? Has he threatened to get me fired for disagreeing with him? Has he shipped every middle-class job in my town to Russia?\"\n\nMr. Carlson had been expected to be among the first witnesses called if Dominion's case had gone to trial, but the two parties settled last Tuesday on the same day that opening statements were expected.\n\nDominion had contended that some Fox programs had falsely aired allegations that the company had rigged the election against President Donald Trump, even though several Fox executives and personalities didn't believe them. Mr. Carlson's show was not among them; emails and text messages revealed as part of the lawsuit showed him profanely ridiculing one of the accusers.\n\nIn several messages, though, Mr. Carlson spoke candidly about his distaste for Mr. Trump at the time and his fear that the network was losing viewers among the former president's fans.\n\nMr. Carlson was recently named in a lawsuit filed by Abby Grossberg, a Fox News producer fired after claiming that Fox lawyers had pressured her to give misleading testimony in the Dominion lawsuit. Ms. Grossberg had gone to work for Mr. Carlson after leaving Maria Bartiromo's Fox show.\n\nHer lawsuit says that Ms. Grossberg learned \"she had merely traded in one overtly misogynistic work environment for an even crueler one - this time, one where unprofessionalism reigned supreme, and the staff's distaste and disdain for women infiltrated almost every workday decision.\"\n\nOn her first day of work at Mr. Carlson's program, Ms. Grossberg said in her lawsuit, she was met with large, blown-up photographs of Nancy Pelosi in a bathing suit with a plunging neckline.\n\nFox has countered with its own lawsuit, trying to bar Ms. Grossberg from disclosing confidential discussions with Fox attorneys and saying in a statement that \"her allegations in connection with the Dominion case are baseless.\"\n\n\"Fox News Tonight\" will air in Mr. Carlson's 8 p.m. ET prime-time slot, hosted by a rotating array of network personalities, for the time being.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

He suggested Moscow wants the release of a Russian imprisoned in Germany.\n\nWhite House national security spokesman John Kirby tried to minimize the impact of Mr. Carlson's interview ahead of its release, saying, \"Remember, you're listening to Vladimir Putin. And you shouldn't take at face value anything he has to say.\"\n\nRussian media on Feb. 9 gave the interview blanket coverage, with major broadcasters showing excerpts and one state news agency describing it as \"a dagger blow through the curtain of propaganda of the dishonest media of the civilized world.\"\n\nBefore leaving Fox, Mr. Carlson repeatedly questioned the validity of U.S. support for Ukraine following Russia's invasion, asking why Americans are told to hate Mr. Putin so much. His commentaries were frequently circulated on Russian state-run media.\n\nAsked why the Kremlin granted Mr. Carlson's interview request out of many from Western media, Mr. Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the former Fox host's position is different from a \"one-sided\" stance by other outlets.\n\nMr. Putin has heavily limited his contact with international media since invading Ukraine in February 2022. Russian authorities have cracked down on independent media at home, forcing some outlets to close and blocking others, while also ordering a number of foreign reporters to leave. Besides the Journal's Mr. Gershkovich, it also has jailed Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty's Alsu Kurmasheva.\n\nAsked by Mr. Carlson if Russia would release Mr. Gershkovich, Mr. Putin said Moscow is open to talks but repeated he was charged with espionage, an accusation Mr. Gershkovich denies.\n\n\"He was caught red-handed when he was secretly getting classified information,\" Mr. Putin said, adding that he doesn't exclude the reporter could return home.\n\nIn a statement, the Journal reaffirmed that Mr. Gershkovich \"is a journalist, and journalism is not a crime,\" adding that \"any portrayal to the contrary is total fiction.\"\n\n\"We're encouraged to see Russia's desire for a deal that brings Evan home, and we hope this will lead to his rapid release and return to his family and our newsroom,\" it said.\n\nMr. Putin said Russia is \"ready to solve it but there are certain conditions that are being discussed between special services. I believe an agreement can be reached.\"\n\nHe pointed to a man imprisoned in a \"U.S.-allied country\" for \"liquidating a bandit\" who had killed Russian soldiers during fighting in the Caucasus. Mr. Putin didn't mention names but appeared to refer to Vadim Krasikov, a Russian serving a life sentence in Germany after being convicted of the 2019 killing of Zelimkhan \"Tornike\" Khangoshvili, a 40-year-old Georgian citizen of Chechen ethnicity.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Since 2017, Mr. Carlson's 8 p.m. weekday show had made him a conservative media star and a kingmaker within the Republican Party, particularly its pro-Trump wing where his bomb-throwing culture-war agenda resonated.\n\nHis departure, which Fox announced Monday in a terse statement , represents a potential hinge point for the network, which has the highest ratings in cable news television, but faces growing competition from right-wing digital media, especially for younger viewers, and is currently in negotiations with cable companies over bundled fees paid by subscribers . On Monday night, Brian Kilmeade, a co-host of Fox & Friends, hosted its 8 p.m. show. Fox is expected to rotate hosts in that slot until it picks a permanent replacement for Mr. Carlson.\n\nStill, anyone who expects a substantive shift at Fox, such as a retreat from the hard-right ideas that Mr. Carlson espoused, may be disappointed, say analysts. A more likely outcome is a new face on Fox with similar opinions who can serve the same audience. \"The show goes on,\" says A.J. Bauer, an assistant professor of journalism at the University of Alabama who researches conservative media. \"The time slots matter more than the people in them.\"\n\nWhy would you fire your top-rated host? Fox News has a history of doing just that - with its brand being more important than any individual personality.\n\nLast week, Fox settled a lawsuit filed by Dominion Voting Systems over false claims of voting-machine fraud aired after the 2020 election by Mr. Carlson and other opinion hosts. But the company faces other legal perils: Another voting-machine company, Smartmatic, has also sued the network, raising the possibility of further payouts by Fox Corp., which is controlled by Rupert Murdoch and his family.\n\nMr. Carlson's ouster, however, may turn more on another lawsuit. Last month, Abby Grossberg, a former producer for Mr. Carlson, filed a complaint against Mr. Carlson and Fox, alleging a pattern of misogynistic behavior toward colleagues and guests. Fox responded by firing Ms. Grossberg, whom it accused of disclosing privileged information.\n\nHer lawsuit has echoes of past upheaval at Fox News. In 2016-17, multiple lawsuits and instances of alleged sexual harassment led to the ousting of its founder Roger Ailes and a prime-time host, Bill O'Reilly, whom Mr. Carlson eventually replaced on air. Fox paid millions of dollars to settle multiple claims by women against Mr. Ailes, who died in 2017, and Mr. O'Reilly.\n\nNow Mr. Carlson faces complaints about how he treats his staff, after the Dominion lawsuit had already revealed a trove of his often derogatory texts and emails about Fox reporters and executives. Some of the comments he made were redacted in court filings, but may relate to Ms. Grossberg's lawsuit, which also alleged antisemitic comments by Mr. Carlson and his team.\n\nThat makes Mr. Carlson \"a bit of a lawsuit risk\" to Fox and its owners, says Nicole Hemmer, a political historian at Vanderbilt University and author of \"Messengers of the Right: Conservative Media and the Transformation of American Politics.\"\n\nMr. Murdoch reportedly made the decision after consulting with board members and Fox executives. Why exactly Fox chose to terminate Mr. Carlson's contract is still unknown, but the decision seems to be less about the content of Mr. Carlson's show or his viewership than the liability he represented to Fox Corp., says Professor Hemmer. \"There's a cost to keeping Carlson on air.\"\n\nMr. Carlson wasn't the only media host to lose his job this week. CNN chose Monday to fire Don Lemon, a morning news anchor who had drawn flak most recently for sexist comments about Nikki Haley, a Republican seeking the presidential nomination in 2024. Mr. Lemon had apologized for what he said on air.\n\nMr. Carlson's rise to the pinnacle of Fox fame and compensation - he was reportedly paid $20 million a year - overlapped with the Trump presidency and its aftermath. He took Mr. O'Reilly's slot and grew the audience until he became the most watched cable news host ever in 2020, says Professor Hemmer. That success was rooted in Fox's embrace of Donald Trump and his followers after having not leaned into his run for the GOP nomination. \"Tucker Carlson was a huge part of that. He becomes the voice of the MAGA base,\" she says.\n\nBut while hosts like Sean Hannity, who was in daily contact with President Trump, became a mouthpiece for the administration after 2017, Mr. Carlson drew deeply on fringe ideas on the right, including racist theories about the deliberate replacement of white Americans by people of color who migrate to the U.S., says Professor Bauer. He wasn't the only Fox host to play on fears of migrants, but he was the most effective popularizer of far-right ideas. \"He dipped into somewhat obscure sexist and racist theories and found a way to make it palatable to folks who don't consider themselves to be white supremacists,\" he says.\n\nMr. Carlson also drew criticism, including from Republicans in Congress, for trying to whitewash the violent assault by Trump supporters on the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021. He called them \"mostly peaceful\" patriots and edited hundreds of hours of footage from the attack to this end.\n\nMr. Carlson hasn't commented on his departure from Fox or what he will do next. While his contract with Fox is likely to prevent him taking a similar job with a major news network, he could try to build his own media empire, says Ms. Hemmer. He could tell his fans that \"Fox is corporate media and they got rid of me because they don't care about you,\" she says.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Neither Mr. O'Reilly nor Glenn Beck, another Fox host who left in 2011, has managed to find as large an audience on his own. Megyn Kelly, who quit Fox in 2017 after clashing with Mr. Trump, later signed a lucrative contract with NBC, but after two years her show was canceled .\n\nWithin a fractured media landscape, Fox remains the biggest draw for conservatives, particularly for Republican candidates seeking a national audience. That seems unlikely to change, whoever is the face of prime-time opinion. \"Fox is a massive platform with very few peers,\" says Professor Bauer.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Clips from his former and current programs are frequently played on Russian TV, showing him angrily dissenting from official U.S. foreign policies, particularly regarding Russia and the war in Ukraine.\n\nA series of street interviews conducted by the news agency Sputnik saw apparently average Russians lauding him. They described him as a truth-teller who's run afoul of U.S. authorities because of his critical views, and a person who honestly wants to report on the real state of affairs in Russia and learn firsthand about Mr. Putin's point of view. Russian media closely followed his movements around Moscow, including to the Bolshoi Theatre, where he viewed the ballet \"Spartacus\" and the sprawling new Russia Expo , which he was said to have enjoyed.\n\nTo hear it from Tucker Carlson or his Russian fans, his soon-to-be-aired interview with Russian President Vladimir Putin is an exercise in journalistic parity. But both Mr. Carlson and the Kremlin are pushing agendas.\n\nMr. Carlson explained why he chose to sit down with the Russian leader in a brief video posted Tuesday . But if Mr. Carlson's interview with the Russian leader (which reportedly is completed but is not yet published) happens to make an impact, it likely won't be because it reveals anything new.\n\nMr. Putin's views on almost every topic are already well known, if only because of his frenetic public schedule, which sees him almost constantly attending meetings, speechifying, and answering questions. The Kremlin website details over a dozen such meetings since the new year.\n\nNor would it be because other Western news organizations have refused to talk with Mr. Putin since the war began. Kremlin spokesperson Dmitry Peskov acknowledged Wednesday that the president's staff receives many requests for interviews from Western journalists. But he says the Kremlin turns them down because of the \"one-sided position\" of most Western news outlets. Mr. Carlson, Mr. Peskov said, was granted an interview because he has a different approach from most traditional Western media and does not take sides.\n\nIndeed, most Western media organizations have found it difficult to continue working in Moscow amid wartime conditions. Many have left voluntarily, while others have been officially ordered to leave . One U.S. journalist, Evan Gershkovich of The Wall Street Journal, has been in Moscow's Lefortovo prison for almost a year, facing espionage charges that his family, employers, and the U.S. government categorically deny.\n\nBut the apparent affinity between the Kremlin and Mr. Carlson probably runs much deeper than mere opportunism. During the Cold War, American outsiders such as Angela Davis were treated as heroes in the Soviet Union, where the authorities (and many ordinary people) saw them as speaking for a different kind of America, one that they might be friends with. Today's lionizing of Mr. Carlson in the Russian media seems to reflect a similar desire to greet him as an emissary of a United States that many Russians wish existed.\n\n\"Tucker is regarded as a representative of millions of Americans who want better relations with Russia,\" says Sergei Markov, a former Kremlin adviser.\n\nMost people have seen at least selections of Mr. Carlson's views, which are often broadcast on Russian TV. \"Russians like that he says openly that Ukraine is not a democracy, that Russia is not all bad and has some valid interests. They like that he speaks up for traditional family, Christian values. He sounds like someone we can work with,\" says Mr. Markov.\n\nMr. Markov says a key issue in setting up the interview was that it had to be published complete and uncut, something Mr. Carlson pledged to do on his webpage and on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"Other Western media aren't being denied interviews with Putin on some principle, but just because we know they will manipulate the material, cherry-pick quotes, to make us look bad,\" Mr. Markov says. \"I'm quite sure that CNN could get an interview if they just promised to run the whole thing without any games.\"\n\nSome Russian political experts say the Kremlin granted Mr. Carlson the interview as an indirect way of boosting Donald Trump, as the former Fox anchor is viewed as a supporter of the former U.S. president.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nBut Alexei Mukhin, director of the independent Center for Political Information in Moscow, says that's unlikely to be the Kremlin's intent.\n\n\"Probably the Kremlin wants Americans to take a fresh look at Putin and Russia, since by now it's clear we haven't been defeated by sanctions or war,\" he says. \"As for Trump, I don't think Putin wants to help him. We already had our experience with Trump; it wasn't pleasant for us at all. If Putin's interview makes Biden and his supporters uncomfortable, that's good enough.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Mr. Carlson was filling in for Sean Hannity on the Fox News Channel .\n\nCarlson didn't suggest the means of execution he had in mind (perhaps being thrown into a pit of angry canines). Here's his full quote:\n\n\"I'm Christian. I've made mistakes. I believe fervently in second chances. Michael Vick killed dogs in a heartless and cruel way. I think, firstly, he should have been executed for that. The idea the president of the United States would be getting behind someone who murdered dogs is beyond the pale.\"\n\nNow it's not like Mr. Obama called a press conference to announce his position on Vick and the Eagles. It was a brief, one-on-one conversation with Eagles owner Jeffrey Lurie . But of course as soon as Mr. Lurie told Sports Illustrated 's Peter King , it was all over the place - including on the Eagles' website.\n\n\"The president wanted to talk about two things, but the first was Michael,'' Lurie told SI's Mr. King. \"He said, 'So many people who serve time never get a fair second chance.'

And he was happy that we did something on such a national stage that showed our faith in giving someone a second chance after such a major downfall.''\n\n(The other thing Obama wanted to talk about, by the way, was Lurie's plans for alternative energy at the Eagles' Lincoln Financial Field - proving that one can be wonky, sports-minded, and philosophical all in one brief conversation.)\n\nBut really! Suggesting redemption for a millionaire professional sports figure who abused animals for fun?\n\nThe White House has been trying to spin the story by saying the main reason for Obama's call was clean energy at the Eagles' stadium. But at least as team owner Lurie recalls it, that wasn't the case.\n\nEither way, is anybody surprised that Fox News Channel commentators - even (or maybe especially) when they're filling in, as Carlson is - take every possible chance to ding Obama? I don't think so.\n\nAnd Obama's perhaps impolitic comment in support of a convicted animal abuser gave Carlson - who's also a well-known animal advocate, by the way - something hot to talk about.\n\nBut it's not just Fox newsies chewing on Obama's ankles.\n\nOver at the Washington Post , columnist Richard Cohen is even harsher on Obama.\n\n\"The sanctimony regarding this dog killer is sickening,\" Mr. Cohen writes. \"Vick got a second chance not because he deserves it but because he can play football. This is the lesson we can all take from this sorry episode.\"\n\nFor his part, Vick has said he'd like to have another dog some day. Can he be sincere? Here's a true test: Obama should invite him to the White House for a little pooper-scooper duty after he's met first dog Bo.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Suggesting redemption for a millionaire professional sports figure who abused animals for fun?\n\nThe White House has been trying to spin the story by saying the main reason for Obama's call was clean energy at the Eagles' stadium. But at least as team owner Lurie recalls it, that wasn't the case.\n\nEither way, is anybody surprised that Fox News Channel commentators - even (or maybe especially) when they're filling in, as Carlson is - take every possible chance to ding Obama? I don't think so.\n\nAnd Obama's perhaps impolitic comment in support of a convicted animal abuser gave Carlson - who's also a well-known animal advocate, by the way - something hot to talk about.\n\nBut it's not just Fox newsies chewing on Obama's ankles.\n\nOver at the Washington Post , columnist Richard Cohen is even harsher on Obama.\n\n\"The sanctimony regarding this dog killer is sickening,\" Mr. Cohen writes. \"Vick got a second chance not because he deserves it but because he can play football. This is the lesson we can all take from this sorry episode.\"\n\nFor his part, Vick has said he'd like to have another dog some day. Can he be sincere? Here's a true test: Obama should invite him to the White House for a little pooper-scooper duty after he's met first dog Bo.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Carlson appeared on CNN 's \"Reliable Sources\" yesterday and had little nice to say of the Daily Show host.\n\nCarlson claimed Stewart is a \"partisan hack\" who is so popular that no one dares to criticize him. And that's frustrating Carlson.\n\nIf this is the case, then the two do have a lot in common.\n\nSmackdown\n\nEverybody knows what happens if you are a Republican (with standing) and say anything negative about Rush.\n\nHe'll call you on it. You get concerned. You apologize . The DNC mocks you on a website. Chris Matthews , Rachel Maddow , and Keith Olbermann all laugh (at you, not with you). And pundits start writing your political obit .\n\nWorser Smackdown\n\nWhat happens if you criticize Jon Stewart? It's worse.\n\nAsk CNBC 's Jim Cramer . He was clobbered last week.\n\nUnlike Limbaugh who will forgive wayward Republicans if they kiss his ring, Stewart went medieval on Cramer.\n\nGranted, Cramer might have had a better outing by not showing up ( Rick Santelli is looking pretty smart for bailing). Or perhaps something even more crazy like thinking about what you might say before appearing.\n\nBe mad\n\nBut why be upset at Stewart? Many say he is just reflecting society's anger at those who should have known something was wrong with our financial system before it blew up.\n\nIt's not that, Carlson said. Stewart took out the long knives as soon as Cramer criticized the president. ( see video below )\n\n\"Let's be honest, this was a partisan attack,\" Carlson said. \"He went after Cramer the moment Cramer criticized Obama 's budget. That was the mortal sin. That's what kicked off this entire feud.\"\n\nAnd that makes Stewart disingenuous, Carlson claims. He said Stewart is abrogating his responsibility to his viewers \"who actually believe him.\"\n\nCowboy\n\nAnd although many in the media are subject to criticism, Carlson claims criticizing Stewart is like touching the third rail.\n\nWell, the carnage of what used to be Jim Cramer kinda does prove this.\n\n\"He's a sacred cow,\" Carlson said. \"There's nobody who [will] attack Jon Stewart because he's too popular. The press sucks up to him like I've never seen -- it's like Oprah .\n\n\"I would like to see somebody ... come out and say, Jon Stewart's kind of a pompous jerk, actually,\" Carlson said.\n\nBut he's not, said another guest on the show.\n\n\"But he is!\" said Carlson.\n\nLay it down\n\nSo laid the gauntlet. Carlson's taking him on.\n\nIt's not like he hasn't been here before. He was a victim of a Stewart beat-down a few years ago. Although nothing like the Cramer catastrophe.\n\nFunny\n\nRegardless, it's hard to beat funny. Funny works. Because with funny you can dodge, you can pivot, you can better illustrate. You can win.\n\nLet's just say that Cramer came to the show a compelling argument. No matter what he could have said, Stewart still wins with:\n\n\"If I had only followed CNBC's advice, I'd have a million dollars today ... provided I had started with $100 million dollars.\"\n\n-----\n\nHey, if you follow our advice you'd probably be broke. Regardless, follow us on Twitter (we're brand new to it - so help a brother out).\n\nAlready a subscriber?

His son, Lachlan Murdoch, will control both companies.\n\nLoading...\n\nSept. 21, 2023, 11:44 a.m. ET | New York\n\nRupert Murdoch, the 92-year-old Australian media magnate whose creation of Fox News made him a force in American politics, is stepping down as leader of both Fox's parent company and his News Corp. media holdings.\n\nFox said Thursday that Mr. Murdoch would become chairman emeritus of both companies, effective at board meetings in November. His son, Lachlan Murdoch, will become News Corp. chairman and continue as chief executive officer of Fox Corp.\n\nLachlan Murdoch said that \"we are grateful that he will serve as chairman emeritus and know he will continue to provide valued counsel to both companies.\"\n\nBesides Fox News, Mr. Murdoch started the Fox broadcast network, the first to successfully challenge the Big Three of ABC, CBS, and NBC, with shows like \"The Simpsons.\" He is owner of The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post.\n\nHe slimmed down his corporate holdings with the 2019 sale of many entertainment assets to the Walt Disney Co. These included film production, rights to certain Marvel comics, National Geographic, and the cable network FX.\n\nFox News Channel has profoundly influenced television and the nation's politics since its start in 1996, making Mr. Murdoch a hero to some and pariah to others. The 24-hour network converted the power and energy of political talk radio to television. Within six years, it outrated CNN and MSNBC.\n\nBut it has been a rough year for Fox, which was forced to pay $787 million to settle a defamation lawsuit related to its coverage of false claims following the 2020 presidential election. Shortly after, Fox fired its most popular personality, Tucker Carlson.\n\nStock in Fox Corp., while positive this year, began to decline early in 2022, due in part to lawsuits and also investor anxiety over the loss of viewers to smaller media outlets.\n\nMr. Murdoch vowed in a letter to employees that he would remain engaged at Fox.\n\n\"In my new role, I can guarantee you that I will be involved every day in the contest of ideas,\" Mr. Murdoch wrote. \"Our companies are communities, and I will be an active member of our community. I will be watching our broadcasts with a critical eye, reading our newspapers and websites and books with much interest.\"\n\nThere was no immediate word on why Mr. Murdoch's announcement came now. Ironically, it is the week author and Murdoch biographer Michael Wolff is publishing a book, \"The End of Fox News,\" speculating on what will happen to the network when the patriarch is gone.\n\nMr. Murdoch and his family, particularly children James, Lachlan, Elisabeth, and Prudence, were said to be the model of the HBO show \"Succession.\"\n\nHe built his empire from a single newspaper in Adelaide, Australia, inherited from his father and became a multi-billionaire. Forbes estimated the Murdoch family's net worth at roughly $19 billion in 2020.\n\nWhile Mr. Murdoch never ran for political office, politicians in the United States and Britain anxiously sought his approval. He had a complicated relationship with Donald Trump. Mr. Wolff reported in 2018 that Mr. Murdoch had called Mr. Trump an \"idiot,\" adding an expletive for emphasis, but Fox News is built with an audience that largely admires Mr. Trump.\n\nAfter Fox briefly seemed to tout the candidacy of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in the current election cycle, that has faded along with Mr. DeSantis' prospects.\n\nFox News went through a series of sexual harassment scandals in the 2010s, which led to top executive Roger Ailes and prime-time personality Bill O'Reilly being pushed out. He dismissed them as isolated instances that were \"largely political because we're conservative.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

The deal was announced on what would have been the first day of a high-profile trial in a Delaware court that was widely seen as a test of First Amendment protections for news organizations.\n\nPretrial revelations about how Fox fed misinformation to its viewers about the 2020 vote to maintain its ratings had already embarrassed the country's most powerful conservative media outlet. And Dominion's attorneys have claimed victory for its defense of the truth. But the settlement - among the largest ever paid by a media company - doesn't appear to compel Fox to admit wrongdoing or issue public apologies.\n\nStill, it is not the end of the matter for Fox, which will have to contend with additional related lawsuits and damage to its reputation over the weeks and months to come.\n\nThe court case between Dominion Voting Systems and Fox News reached a settlement at the last minute. But the ripple effects on the conservative network's reputation - and its bottom line - may continue.\n\nMedia defamation lawsuits rarely go to trial. Plaintiffs face a high bar to prove intent or recklessness by a news organization, and judges often dismiss suits for this reason. But many experts believed Dominion had a strong case against Fox, bolstered by pretrial rulings by Superior Court Judge Eric Davis that weakened Fox's defense that it was simply reporting newsworthy allegations. Those allegations were the unfounded claims by former President Donald Trump and his allies, amplified by Fox hosts, that Dominion's machines had rigged the 2020 election by flipping votes to Joe Biden. Judge Davis wrote that \"evidence developed in this civil proceeding demonstrates that [it] is CRYSTAL clear that none of the statements relating to Dominion about the 2020 election are true.\"\n\nDominion had been demanding $1.6 billion in damages, and up until the last minute, Fox seemed to be preparing for a public defense of its reporting. Jury selection was finished on Tuesday morning, after which attorneys were due to make their opening statements. Behind closed doors, the two sides were instead finalizing a settlement.\n\nThat Fox chose to pay Dominion such a large sum points to its legal vulnerability, says George Freeman, director of the Media Law Resource Center and a former in-house counsel for The New York Times. \"They obviously had calculated what the odds were on what a jury would have done,\" he says.\n\nA trial would also have meant more negative coverage of Fox, on top of the depositions and internal communications already released, and would have forced many of its hosts and executives to testify under oath.\n\nMr. Freeman says that while Fox hasn't apologized for its actions, money speaks louder than words. \"$787 million is a pretty implicit admission of something.\"\n\nIn a statement , Fox acknowledged \"the Court's rulings finding certain claims about Dominion to be false.\" It also said the settlement reflected its \"continued commitment to the highest journalistic standards. We are hopeful that our decision to resolve this dispute with Dominion amicably, instead of the acrimony of a divisive trial, allows the country to move forward from these issues.\"\n\nFox still faces a $2.7 billion defamation suit from Smartmatic, another voting-machine company that was the target of pro-Trump conspiracy theories in 2020. That case was filed in New York, and a judge has denied Fox's motions to dismiss it . Smartmatic quickly seized on the Dominion settlement to vow to continue its legal fight so that Fox could be held \"accountable for undermining democracy.\"\n\nIn addition, Fox shareholders have sued the company for failing in its fiduciary duties in its coverage of 2020 election falsehoods. And a former producer for host Tucker Carlson has sued Fox for allegedly coercing her into giving false testimony to attorneys for Dominion; Fox has said the producer was fired for sharing privileged information.\n\nDominion has separately sued MyPillow founder and CEO Mike Lindell, a Trump supporter who spread conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, including on frequent Fox appearances. In his deposition, Fox Corp. Chair Rupert Murdoch said that Mr. Lindell was booked on shows because he was a major advertiser.\n\nDominion is also suing two other right-wing news outlets, One America News Network and Newsmax, for their election coverage. The Dominion court filings show that Fox executives fretted about losing their audience to those other outlets in the wake of the 2020 election, if they didn't promote Mr. Trump's rigged-election narrative.\n\nThe lawsuit has cast an uncomfortable spotlight on Fox News and its executives, including Mr. Murdoch, its patriarch, who built a media empire in Australia and the United Kingdom before Fox News launched in 1996. He has a history of settling lawsuits out of court, including substantial payments to litigants in the U.K. whose phones were hacked by Murdoch-owned newspapers, a scandal that forced him to close a popular Sunday newspaper in 2011.\n\nSome analysts say such payouts to litigants are the cost of doing business for media tycoons like Mr. Murdoch and are unlikely to change how he runs his news outlets. Fox News is a profitable division of Fox Corp., delivering high ratings that support ad revenues and cable fees.\n\nWhile Fox is certain to tread carefully in any future election-related coverage that involves Dominion and other companies, hosts like Mr. Carlson continue to cast doubts on the legitimacy of the 2020 election, as does Mr. Trump as he seeks the GOP nomination in 2024.\n\n\"It's still possible to spread conspiracies about an election,\" says Nicole Hemmer, a political historian at Vanderbilt University who studies conservative media.\n\nWhat may prove more lasting is the damage that the Dominion suit has done to Fox's reputation as a news organization, she adds. Its election-night calls and straight news reporting had been respected in Washington because there was supposed to be an internal firewall from Fox's opinion shows and their political agendas. But the revelation that Fox executives sidelined news reporters who challenged Mr. Trump's lies has exposed the firewall as a fiction.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

It's measurably hurting the company.\"\n\n\"Fox has played a very important role in conservative media because it's so visible and it was treated as a legitimate news organization,\" says Ms. Hemmer. Now, Fox \"has no one left to impress. The only pressures are coming from the right.\"\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "Tucker Carlson Reportedly Forming New Media Company\n\nFormer Fox News anchor Tucker Carlson is planning a new media company with ex-White House advisor Neil Patel, the Wall Street Journal reports , with Carlson reportedly \"seeking to raise funds\" for the new venture even as Fox has sent him a cease and desist letter for allegedly breaching his contract by creating content on Twitter.\n\nTucker Carlson speaks during 2022 FOX Nation Patriot Awards on November 17, 2022 in Hollywood, ... More Florida.\n\nThe reported venture would \"potentially use Twitter as its backbone,\" the Journal reports based on anonymous sources, suggesting a model where shorter versions of Carlson's videos could be viewed on Twitter, but users would need to subscribe to watch full videos.\n\nCarlson and Patel-who Carlson previously founded right-wing news site the Daily Caller with, which Patel still runs-are seeking to raise hundreds of millions of dollars to fund the venture and have already \"lined up financiers, lawyers and media strategists,\" the Journal reports.\n\nThe media venture would eventually include videos from other hosts and would have its own website and mobile app, the Journal reports, noting that videos could be hosted off of Twitter as well-though Carlson and Patel are hesitant to use YouTube given concerns their videos could be censored by the platform.\n\nCarlson and Patel have already met with Twitter, as has Carlson's Fox producer Justin Wells, and Carlson's team has discussed with Twitter employees the platform's \"readiness\" for features like watching Twitter videos on a television, the Journal reports.\n\nCarlson turned to Twitter after being suddenly ousted by Fox in April, announcing in May he was launching a show on Twitter that then started airing episodes in early June.\n\nFox News, which has contended Carlson's Twitter show is in breach of his Fox contract, declined to comment to the Journal and has not yet responded to a request for comment.\n\nThe Journal report does not give any indication of when Carlson and Patel's new media venture could launch, assuming it moves forward. Letters sent from Fox News to Carlson and reported by Axios indicate Carlson's contract with the network states any content he produces must be exclusive to Fox through December 31, 2024, though Carlson's lawyer Harmeet Dhillon suggested to Axios Carlson is refusing to follow that. \"Tucker will not be silenced by anyone ... He is a singularly important voice on matters of public interest in our country, and will remain so,\" Dhillon said, criticizing Fox for \"demanding that Tucker Carlson be silent until after the 2024 election.\"\n\n467.1 million. That's the number of views Carlson's show on Twitter has received as of Friday morning, according to Twitter metrics from the nine episodes of Carlson's show that have been released so far. Twitter video views are not directly comparable to viewership on cable or network news, with the social media platform counting a video \"view\" as a viewer watching a video for at least two seconds with at least 50% of the video player in view.\n\nCarlson was suddenly fired at Fox News in April, days after the news outlet settled a defamation lawsuit with voting machine company Dominion Voting Systems that was in part based on Carlson's show and off-screen comments . Discovery during the lawsuit uncovered a text message in which Carlson criticized an attack by Trump supporters as \"not how white people fight,\" which reportedly launched an investigation into his behavior that led to his firing, and Carlson's show was also the subject of a now-settled lawsuit with former producer Abby Grossberg, who alleged it was a toxic workplace with pervasive sexism. The network has also since been sued by Trump supporter Ray Epps, after Carlson promoted a false conspiracy theory on air suggesting Epps was an undercover government agent who instigated the January 6 riot. Carlson was Fox News' highest-rated anchor before his ousting, making his sudden departure more shocking, and the network's ratings went down in the wake of Carlson's departure as supporters appeared to decamp to right-wing network Newsmax . Fox announced in June that anchor Jesse Watters would take over Carlson's former time slot.\n\nTucker Carlson Is Creating a New Media Company (Wall Street Journal)\n\nFox Reportedly Sends Tucker Carlson Cease-And-Desist Letter Over Twitter Show (Forbes)\n\nTucker Carlson Launches New Twitter Show Weeks After Fox News Ouster-And Talks Ukraine And UFOs (Forbes)\n\nTrump Supporter Ray Epps Sues Fox News After Tucker Carlson Baselessly Called Him A Jan. 6 Instigator (Forbes)"

Dan Crenshaw is a former United States Navy Seal who was first elected to Congress in 2018. ... More (Photo by Alex Wong/Getty Images)\n\nTexas Republican Congressman Dan Crenshaw was caught on a \"hot mic\" earlier this week , apparently suggesting he'd \"kill\" former Fox News host Tucker Carlson if the two ever met in person. Video of the off-the-cuff comment quickly made the rounds on social media and created a minor firestorm for Crenshaw, a former United States Navy Seal who was first elected to Congress in 2018.\n\nAfter being interviewed by GB News journalist Steven Edginton earlier this month, the U.S. lawmaker responded to a seemingly off-the-record question in which he was asked if he had ever met Carlson.\n\n\"We've talked a lot on Twitter,\" said Crenshaw, adding, \"If I ever meet him, I'll f****** kill him,\" while also apparently describing Carlson as \"the worst person.\"\n\nCarlson and Crenshaw have a history of trading barbs on social media, and as Politico.com reported Carlson has described Crenshaw as being among \"the dumbest\" Republicans, while Crenshaw has suggested Carlson is a \"cowardly, know-nothing elitist.\"\n\nEarlier in the interview with GB News, when asked about Carlson's opposition to U.S. aid to Ukraine, Crenshaw said the former Fox News host \"doesn't know what he's talking about.\"\n\nCrenshaw hasn't directly addressed his stance on wanting to \"kill\" Carlson, but responded on X to a post from Republican Georgia Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene, who asked if he threatened her \"friend.\" The Texas lawmaker only wrote, \"Lol, no.\"\n\nThe comments about Carlson were made as Edginton and Crenshaw were being unmiked after the interview was concluded, and the congressman likely didn't realize that the cameras were still rolling.\n\nIt isn't the first time a politician was caught saying something they may have soon regretted. Just over a year ago, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was caught on a hot mic criticizing his opponents moments before he ended his 2024 presidential bid.\n\nCrenshaw also isn't even the first lawmaker to suggest they'd carry out harm on someone. In 1984, President Ronald Reagan infamously joked during a sound check with National Public Radio, \"My fellow Americans. I'm pleased to tell you today that I've signed legislation that will outlaw Russia forever. We begin bombing in five minutes.\"\n\nThat quip wasn't broadcast live but was part of the transmission that went to NPR stations around the country and was later leaked. It was the sort of levity that was described as common for Regan , but the Soviet Union didn't find it particularly funny.\n\n\"Both intentional and unintentional 'gaffes' on a hot mic have a long history,\" said Dr. Cliff Lampe, professor of information and associate dean for academic affairs in the School of Information at the University of Michigan.\n\nReagan and Crenshaw are likely far from the only politicians who threatened to kill someone and then had to walk it back, but today's technology makes it much easier for a simple wisecrack or blunt comment to reach the masses.\n\n\"I would hope most of us have not done that, we people with manners who know that words matter, and that given the existing technology, someone can always whip out a phone and start filming or taping,\" explained Susan Campbell, distinguished lecturer in the Communications, Film, and Media Studies Department at the University of New Haven.\n\n\"That means that if we act badly, we run the risk of being the world's latest 'Karen,'\" Campbell added. \"We are one TikTok rant away from eternal ignominy, so it helps if your personal habits don't include issuing threats to kill someone.\"\n\nBefore the social media era, it was much harder for comments like Crenshaw's to spread so quickly. Yet, the lawmaker didn't apologize and has barely acknowledge that he made the remarks. In the social media era, his, \"Lol, no,\" response could be enough of a response.\n\n\"What social media makes different in this context is that multiple channels and sources can choose to spread the off-the-cuff comments, and they can become viral in a way that was less possible when media was more gate-kept by a few companies,\" added Lampe. \"The other aspect of social media that makes this different is that counter-narratives and falsehoods move so quickly through these communication networks that it's possible to deny a statement even when one was recorded saying it."

      "text": "Tucker Carlson's Viewership Is Down But Still Outpacing Cable News\n\nBy Peter Suciu\n\nBy Peter Suciu ,\n\nContributor.\n\nIn June Tucker Carlson made the jump from cable news to social media, and his weekly videos now ... More appear on the formerly Twitter platform  (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nWhen former Fox News Channel host Tucker Carlson moved to Twitter in June, his first show was seen around 120 million times. That dropped by about half, and the numbers have only steadily fallen since.\n\nThe most recent Episode 11, where Carlson conducted an interview with rapper Ice Cube has been seen just 6.1 million times since it was posted last Thursday. However, those are still numbers that any prime-time cable news channel producer or executive would kill for.\n\nSince Carlson moved to the social media platform after being let go from the cable news channel, there has been speculation that other Fox News hosts would make a similar jump.\n\n\"Twitter aka X seems to be in a transition period with Musk wanting to put his imprimatur on his acquisition. In the name of free speech, will Musk seek to create a more 'even-handed; and neutral site where brand advertisers will return-or will the concept of free speech tilt Twitter towards becoming a social platform for the right-wing and other spreaders of hate that scream about free speech, but only if it's their opinion,\" explained technology analyst Susan Schreiner of C4 Trends.\n\nIt may not just be cable news hosts that could be part of such a transition. In May, Elon Musk-who acquired the social media platform last year for $44 billion-hired NBCU's Linda Yaccarino. She previously oversaw global advertising and partnerships and has vast experience in generating revenue and partnerships with key brands.\n\n\"That move would indicate that he is concerned about the appearance of Twitter stabilization in order to generate revenue and entice advertisers to return,\" explained Schreiner.\n\nHowever, that could seem in contrast to Musk's budding relationship with Tucker Carlson.\n\n\"In recent weeks, Tucker has moved further right and seemingly winking at white nationalists and other hate-mongers-in the name of free speech,\" added Schreiner who suggested that Musk could still perceive that the former Fox News host could be good for his investment in X (formerly Twitter) and that Carlson could play a key role in creating a platform to rival traditional right-wing cable news and YouTube.\n\n\"It seems like for both men there's the vanity piece and then there's revenue. While Tucker had high ratings popularity at Fox News-this was in juxtaposition to actual revenue generated, particularly when brand advertisers fled his show,\" she explained. \"It seems like there's an element of the Rush Limbaugh model-but nowadays there's more fragmentation and competition in the right-wing media genre.\"\n\nEven as Carlson has seen a decline in viewers, it is still a large audience for a platform not known for video.\n\n\"It is a bit surprising that Tucker has been able to make an audience on Twitter or X,\" noted Dr. Cliff Lampe, professor of information and associate dean for Academic Affairs in the School of Information at the University of Michigan.\n\n\"His numbers are a bit hard to interpret, as there are a lot of bots that might be affecting total views,\" Lampe explained. \"He's got fewer followers than Rachel Maddox or Jimmy Kimmel as examples. I feel like with his content he's hitting a single and claiming a grand slam in terms of impact.\"\n\nLampe also suggested that Carlson is not the first media personality to \"discover\" the disintermediating effects of the Internet.\n\n\"Removing the power of gatekeepers has been part of the Internet for at least 30 years, and really for longer,\" he added. \"I'm not sure there's anything about X that makes it better than YouTube or TikTok for sharing video, but it is true that it's never been easier to make video and post it online. I think some like Tucker would argue that it's Musk's promise of no moderation that makes the difference. However, nothing Carlson or these other hosts are posting would be moderated out of YouTube either.\"\n\nWhat is notable is how Carlson could truly become the anchor for short-form videos on X, which comes as the nation is entering the next election cycle. Musk and Carlson might be able to tap into the ad revenue in that lead-up, but the question is whether it is sustainable and at what price of harm to X's brand\n\n\"Musk has been 'fiddling' with X since his acquisition, and seemingly broken Twitter's social media contract as a reliable and reputable brand for content consumption,\" said Schreiner.\n\nThis of course is just one of several changes that Musk has implemented with the former Twitter.\n\n\"Recently, Musk's vision is slowly coming into focus and it relates to making X the U.S. version of WeChat-that unifies social media, business and friendly communications, with commerce and fintech,\" Schreiner continued. \"For this X platform to succeed it would need widespread acceptance. Why is Musk alienating content creators, followers and advertisers? Where does the fear and misinformation spread by Tucker Carlson fit into Musk's grander vision?\""

More the National Review Institute's Ideas Summit at the Mandarin Oriental Hotel March 29, 2019 in Washington, DC. Carlson talked about a large variety of topics including dropping testosterone levels, increasing rates of suicide, unemployment, drug addiction and social hierarchy at the summit, which had the theme 'The Case for the American Experiment.'  (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nFormer Fox News talk show host Tucker Carlson reached an audience that any cable news network executive would kill for - as his debut 10-minute video captioned \"Ep.1\" of the brand new \"Tucker on Twitter\" was seen more than 35 million times by Wednesday morning.\n\nCarlson's new \"show,\" which debuted on the social media platform on Tuesday, was essentially an opinion-based monologue without any guests, and without any evidence to back up his many claims.\n\n\"As of today, we've come to Twitter,\" Carlson said in the video. \"We're told there are no gatekeepers here. If that turns out to be false, we'll leave.\"\n\nThe most notable aspect of the new show wasn't actually what Carlson had to say, but rather that he attempted to hit several topics in just over 10 minutes. Clearly, Carlson may be used to a full-length program where he was able to delve into multiple subjects.\n\n\"Going forward, for this to be successful it is going to have to be more segment focused,\" said Jason Mollica, professorial lecturer and program director at American University's School of Communication.\n\n\"Trying to encapsulate a 40-minute show into just 10 minutes isn't going to work, so Carlson may need to speak to one topic,\" Mollica added. \"To repeat the style of his cable news show on Twitter is impossible.\"\n\nThis really isn't about Tucker Carlson, as it is about Twitter-which began as a microblog where individuals could share quick thoughts with friends and colleagues before it became a broadcast tool to reach the masses. In both cases, however, users have largely kept things short.\n\nTen minutes could be the maximum length for any video program on the service.\n\n\"Unless it has been a live event, Twitter just has proven to be ill-suited to such content,\" explained Mollica. \"Hosting 10-minute-long videos doesn't seem be the purpose of the service. That is what YouTube is for with video, or you can listen to a podcast. Twitter has always been about sharing quick thoughts, updates, and short videos.\"\n\nThere is little denying that Carlson's first episode reached a massive audience, but there is also no denying that a lot of people tuned in out of curiosity. Carlson may still have to fight hard to get those viewers to come back for \"Ep.2\" and beyond.\n\n\"The large majority of Twitter users don't care about Carlson,\" suggested Mollica.\n\n\"Carlson's nightly audience on Fox was just over three million viewers. He's got almost eight million followers on Twitter,\" added social media analyst Greg Sterling, co-founder of Near Media. \"It's possible that his 'show' on Twitter could reach comparable audiences, but unlikely. The more interesting idea is whether Elon Musk will try to encourage more such programming as part of an evolution of content on Twitter.\"\n\nThere is certainly no shortage of high-profile individuals that already use the platform as their soapbox, but Twitter is unlikely to become a YouTube rival.\n\n\"It would have to be someone who could draw in an audience,\" said Mollica. \"There also needs to be something interesting to hook in viewers, and that is more than offering your opinion on a few notable news items that day.\"\n\nTwitter is also unlikely to see much benefit from this sort of content. There are simply too many alternate platforms competing for the same eyeballs.\n\n\"Twitter is not streaming and it's still a pretty toxic environment for advertisers,\" explained Sterling. \"So I doubt that we'll see that many others follow Carlson because there isn't a ton of money to be made on Twitter today. YouTube is a much more viable platform in that regard.\"\n\nCarlson may have been a huge cable news star-but whether he can retain his audience via 10-minute videos has yet to be seen. However, as Mollica noted, Carlson needed this more than Twitter needed Carlson.\n\n\"He needs an audience or else he'll just do guest spots on second-tier news channels,\" Mollica suggested. \"This sort of helps Carlson fill the void.\""

The emergence of Threads has cut ... More into Twitter usage. Fox News is banking on a new post Carlson programming lineup to turn around falling ratings.  (Photo by Thilina Kaluthotage/NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nSince Tucker Carlson was suddenly fired from Fox FOXA News last April and began posting videos on Twitter on June 6, his audience has been in a freefall. Carlson's inaugural video on Twitter, dubbed Tucker on Twitter , had generated 26 million video views. (Twitter counts a video view as any person that watches a video for two or more seconds with half the screen viewable.) In the second episode, two days later, Carlson's video views dropped to 13.9 million. While the third episode, which coincided with Trump's indictment from the Justice Department, saw an increase to 18.7 million views, the general trend has been downward. For Carlson's more recent eighth episode, on June 30, the viewing was only 3.8 million, its lowest to date and a 86% decline since June 6.\n\nSimilarly, through the weeks, the views to Carlson's accounts have also dropped precipitously . At first, Carlson's Twitter post on May 9, announcing his new \"program\", generated 134.1 million views on the microblogging site. The day his first video episode was streamed, Carlson's Twitter post had 120 million views. The Twitter post for Carlson's eighth episode had a mere eight million views. The view counts are based on Carlson's video, photo or text posts.\n\nUsing a far different audience measurement methodology than Twitter's, while at Fox News Tucker Carlson Tonight typically averaged over three million viewers each weeknight, making it among the highest rated programs on cable television. Clearly television has more staying power than Twitter.\n\nWhether Carlson's post and videos will continue on Twitter is another question. Carlson's contract with Fox News, which pays him a reported $20 million annually comes with a non-compete clause. On June 13 lawyers for Fox News sent Carlson a cease-and-desist letter informing him to stop posting videos on Twitter. At that time Carlson's attorneys said, \"Tucker will not be silenced by anyone. He is a singularly important voice on matters of public interest in our country and will remain so.\" Carlson's contract with Fox News expires on December 31, 2024.\n\nMusk has said Carlson is not being paid by Twitter nor does he have a contract with the company. Carlson has said, \"I'm not working for Elon Musk, he hasn't offered to hire me and if he did, I wouldn't accept, what he's done is offered me what he's offered every other user of Twitter which is a chance to broadcast your views without a gatekeeper.\"\n\nCarlson was let go days after Fox News reached a $787 million settlement from a defamation lawsuit with Dominion Voting Systems. In addition, in late June, Fox News agreed to pay $12 million to former producer Abby Grossberg. Grossberg had accused the network of having a hostile and discriminatory workplace and also said Fox News wanted her to provide false testimony in the Dominion deposition. Carlson among others were named in Grossberg's complaint.\n\nFox News is still facing a $2.7 billion defamation lawsuit with Smartmatic, another voting machine company. Also, Fox News could be facing a potential lawsuit involving Tucker Carlson. Earlier this week, the New York Times reported a lawyer, representing Ray Epps, says Carlson had falsely portrayed him as a secret government agent who had directed the events of January 6. Epps has demanded an on-air apology.\n\nCarlson joining Twitter had come at a time when the social media website continues to struggle. Since Elon Musk took over Twitter last October, advertisers and users have been in decline. The New York Times NYT reported over a five-week span in early second quarter Twitter's ad revenue was $88 million, a year-over-year decline of 59%. Insider Intelligence projects, year-over-year, Twitter's global ad revenue will drop by 29% in 2023.\n\nA survey from Pew Research , released in May, found while a majority of highly active Twitter users continue to use the service after Musk's takeover, many are not posting as often. Pew also reported about 60% of U.S. adults who used Twitter in the past year have taken a hiatus from the platform recently. In addition, one-fourth of those users said they are not likely to return to Twitter in the next 12 months.\n\nAnother threat has been the emergence of Threads, a rival micro blogging site from Meta, parent company of Facebook and Instagram. A few days after its launch, Threads had surpassed 100 million users outpacing even the launch of ChatGPT. If Threads maintains this record setting pace, they will surpass Twitter users relatively quickly.\n\nCNN notes that Cloudflare NET , which measures popularity among other websites, reported in January Twitter had ranked 32 nd , by early July, Twitter had fallen to 40 th . Cloudflare measures website popularity as the size of a population of users that look up a domain per unit of time. Cloudflare CEO Matthew Prince noted, \"Twitter traffic tanking.\" Similarweb, another web analytics company, reports a similar fall-off in Twitter usage since the emergence of Threads, with percent double-digit declines when compared to one year ago.\n\nPost Tucker Carlson, Fox News is facing their own challenges beyond lawsuits. This week Wells Fargo WFC analyst Steven Cahall had downgraded the ratings of Fox Corp. from \"equal weight\" to \"down weight\". In a note, Cahall said, most of the earnings from Fox come from Fox News, which is facing news risks, cord-cutting risks and earnings risks.\n\nThe ratings of Fox News continue to decline. In June the network shed 31% of their primetime audience compared to one year ago. Nonetheless, they continue to be the top-rated cable news network. On July 17, Fox News will launch its new primetime programming lineup with Jesse Watters moving into Carlson's 8 p.m. (ET) time period."

The dubbed \"Tucker\" show appeared in an advertisement with the tagline \"at the weekend,\" which seemed to indicate the show would appear on the weekends despite offering no other details. Carlson was also contacted by the Russian state outlet RT, formerly known as Russian Today, which told Carlson \"you can always question more\" with RT.
