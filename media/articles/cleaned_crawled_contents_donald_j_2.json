Trump attends a White House Listening Session on Youth Vaping and Electronic Cigarette Epidemic Friday, Nov. 22, 2019, in the Cabinet Room of the White House. (Official White House Photo by Joyce N. Boghosian)\n\nThe United States' reputation internationally has taken a massive hit in recent weeks, partially as a result of both President Donald Trump's rollout of sweeping new tariffs and by the Trump administration taking a radically different approach to European and Middle Eastern policy compared to his predecessors. Now, one former national security official has a theory about the root cause of this antipathy - and how it actually goes beyond the current administration.\n\nDuring a Friday segment on MSNBC , Ben Rhodes - who was deputy national security advisor to former President Barack Obama - pointed out that Trump was elected to the presidency twice. And that during his 2024 campaign for the White House, he ran on \"mass tariffs, mass deportations [and] destruction of the U.S. administrative state.\" And Rhodes observed that Trump was elected again in spite of his turbulent first term, signifying to the international community that the American public actively chose \"chaos.\"\n\n\"What the rest of the world has watched is, after the chaos of the first Trump presidency, after the chaos of January 6th ... he got elected on that platform with a bigger margin than he won eight years ago,\" Rhodes said. \"And so the hard thing that we all have to reckon with is, it's not like Donald Trump is just doing this. He was elected to do these things.\"\n\nRhodes went on to argue that Trump's reelection has broken the \"trust\" other countries previously had in the United States, and that regaining that trust will take more than one election cycle. He proposed that regaining that trust and retaking power would require a \"regeneration of American politics\" in which Democrats embrace their identity as an opposition party and leadership is handed off to an entirely new generation.\n\n\"They don't trust the president of United States and Donald Trump, and they don't trust America because we elected Donald Trump twice, and we have to deal with that now,\" he said.\n\n\"So how do we come back from this? ... We're kind of waiting for the Democratic Party to come up with some formula in a laboratory in Washington. We're waiting for some politician to emerge with the right talking points or messaging strategy or the right electoral strategy every four years in Wisconsin,\" he continued. \"It's going to have to involve people that are not in politics getting involved. It's going to have to be people looking out for one another. It's got to be people standing up for things that they believe in.\"\n\nRhodes emphasized that \"the rest of the world isn't just seeing Trump,\" but seeing American businesses \"capitulate\" to the administration, tech CEOs \"become lackeys of Trump,\" law firms \"fold\" for the sake of profit and American universities \"get rolled.\" He concluded that the international community is still \"waiting to see whether there's a different America\" than the one that elected Trump twice.\n\nWatch the full segment below, or by clicking this link."

      "text": "Dems file bill to rename Miami prison to 'Donald J. Trump Federal Correctional Institution'\n\nHouse Democrats have submitted a two-page bill to name a federal building after former President Donald Trump - more specifically, a federal prison.\n\nAxios reported that Reps. Gerry Connolly (D-Virginia), John Garamendi (D-California) and Jared Moskowitz (D-Florida) filed the bill on Friday to designate the Federal Correctional Institution Miami building as the \"Donald J. Trump Federal Correctional Institution.\" The three Democrats notably submitted the bill just days after House Republicans filed legislation to rename the John Foster Dulles International Airport in the Virginia suburbs of Washington, DC after the former president.\n\n\"When our Republican colleagues introduced their bill to rename Dulles after Donald Trump, I said the more fitting option would be to rename a federal prison,\" Connolly said in a public statement. \"I see no reason to wait. ... I hope our Republican friends will join us in bestowing upon Donald J. Trump the only honor he truly deserves.\"\n\nBecause the House of Representatives is under Republican control and House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-Louisiana) is not likely to even consider bringing the bill up for a vote, its passage is a virtual impossibility. However, according to Axios, the bill's sponsors are filing the bill as a means of drawing attention to Trump defending himself against 91 felony charges laid out in four separate indictments across three different jurisdictions.\n\nIn a tongue-in-cheek public statement, Moskowitz said the former president should logically by in favor of the bill, as it would accomplish his goal of having his name emblazoned on a federal building for the first time.\n\n\"Everyone knows President Trump loves to write his name in gold letters on all his buildings, but he's never had his name on a federal building before, and as a public servant, I just want to help the former president,\" he stated. \"Help us make that dream a reality.\"\n\nThe fact that the three chose FCI Miami as the chosen building to carry Trump's name is likely not random. In addition to it being the closest federal prison to Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, FCI Miami is also currently the home of former Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro , at least for the next four months.\n\nNavarro was sentenced in January for his refusal to comply with a subpoena from the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack, which he called a \"kangaroo court.\" Navarro - who had served in the Trump administration since 2017 - was one of the architects of Trump's plot to overturn the 2020 election during Congress' certification of electoral college votes. He has already lost a motion to remain free while appealing his sentence, and it's not likely he'll win that appeal.\n\nIt's not know whether Trump would go to FCI Miami if convicted in any of his two upcoming federal trials. And because his first criminal proceeding is for crimes allegedly committed in Manhattan, he would go to a New York prison if convicted in this month's hush money trial. And of course, a conviction in Trump's trial in Fulton County, Georgia would also potentially mean the former president could go to prison in Georgia, though the logistics of how a former president would be incarcerated in multiple jurisdictions - which would be unprecedented and historic - has not yet been finalized."

      "text": "'Pathetic': Trump blasted for demanding apology from governor 'because she embarrassed him'\n\nDonald J. Trump\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump took to his social media platform Truth Social on Saturday to demand an apology from Maine Gov. Janet Mills, a Democratic, after the two had a heated exchange at the White House in February over an executive order banning transgender women and girls from playing in women's sports.\n\nThis new scrutiny on Maine comes as the state has been subject to numerous probes and funding cuts following that exchange that \"have been widely interpreted as retaliatory,\" according to the local outlet the Maine Morning Star .\n\n\"While the state of Maine has apologized for their governor's strong, but totally incorrect, statement about men playing in women's sports while at the White House House Governor's Conference, we have not heard from the governor herself, and she is the one that matters in such cases,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n\"Therefore, we need a full throated apology from the governor herself, and a statement that she will never make such an unlawful challenge to the federal government again, before this case can be settled,\" he added.\n\nThe statement, according to Politico, implied that the Trump administration would continue to target Maine unless Trump receives the apology he wants.\n\n\"King Trump demands an apology from the Governor of Maine because she embarrassed him\" wrote former NBCUniversal studio executive Mike Sington. \"Pathetic.\"\n\nMultiple outlets reporting on the remarks from Trump noted it was not immediately clear what Trump meant when he said that the \"state of Maine\" had apologized.\n\nOn Saturday, Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows wrote on Bluesky: \"Can confirm 'state of Maine' hasn't apologized. (As the official keeper of all state records and guardian of the seal ;)).\"\n\nJonathan Ladd, an associate professor Georgetown University's public policy school, wrote that \"Trump is constitutionally required to take care that U.S. laws be faithfully executed. On what legal basis can he treat the people of Maine differently depending on if their governor apologizes to him? None.\"\n\nThe dispute between Trump and Mills stems from an interaction at a White House event as part of the National Governors Association on February 21.\n\n\"We're going to follow the law sir. We'll see you in court,\" Mills told the president in a heated exchange , referring to the Maine Human Rights Act, which was amended four yeas ago to include gender identity as a protected class. Mills and Maine Attorney General Aaron Frey have argued that the law supersedes the president's edict barring transgender girls from participating in sports that match their gender identity.\n\nSince that episode, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services investigated and found Maine to be in violation of Title IX for allowing transgender girls to compete in women's sports, the U.S. Department of Agriculture launched and resolved a probe into the University of Maine System's Title IX compliance, and the Trump administration briefly imposed an end to the practice of allowing parents to register their newborns for a social security card at the hospital, among other measures.\n\nNOW READ: John Roberts has created a monster - and he knows it"

      "text": "Rubio sidesteps J6 pardons by declaring 'I work for Donald J. Trump'\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio refused to comment on President Donald Trump's pardons and commutations of more than 1500 people convicted of crimes surrounding the January 6 assault on the U.S. Capitol, including the insurrection - despite having denounced the attack in strong terms four years ago.\n\nIn three separate interviews on Tuesday - on ABC News, CBS News, and NBC News - when presented with his comments about the 2021 attack, Rubio declared that he would not discuss domestic issues because he is now Secretary of State.\n\nCBS News' Gayle King told Secretary Rubio, \"in February 2021, even you issued a statement and you said the images of the attack stirred up anger in you, the nation was embarrassed in the eyes of the world by our own citizens.\"\n\n\"How do you personally reconcile those feelings with the pardons that he did yesterday?\" she asked. \"I understand you have work to do in the job is hard for many things, but on this particular issue, I'm curious about what you're thinking.\"\n\n\"Yeah, well, what I'm thinking is that I used to be a United States senator until midnight last night, and now I'm going about to be sworn in as the Secretary of State of the United States,\" Rubio curtly replied. \"And that's what I'm thinking is I work for Donald J. Trump , the new president of United States, the 47th president who has a clear mandate to reorient our foreign policy to one that once again puts America and our interests at the center. And that's what I'm gonna focus on. A hundred percent.\"\n\nIn an interview with ABC News' George Stephanopoulos, Rubio would not budge, even when faced with more of his own comments from 2021.\n\n\"You called it a national embarrassment, saying we now have third world countries that are lecturing us and we have tinpot dictators that are mocking us,\" Stephanopoulos told him. \"Of course, you're now America's top diplomat. You'll be speaking with your counterparts around the world. What message does that pardon send to them?\"\n\n\"Well, I don't anticipate a single one of our partners will ask about it, obviously, and you know this well, from your time in the [Clinton] administration and my job is to focus on the foreign policy of the United States,\" Rubio continued. \"I have a different job this morning and a different focus. And it's one that demands 100% of our attention, and so that's what I'll be focused on and won't be opining on domestic matters at this point, because, frankly, my focus needs to be 100% on how I interact with our, you know, counterparts, our adversaries, our potential enemies around the world to keep this country safe to make it prosperous.\"\n\n\"That's the clear mandate from the president,\" he added. \"It's what he campaigned on.\"\n\n\"But as a senator,\" Stephanopoulos pressed, \"you did say that it affected our standing in the world. Don't believe that anymore?\"\n\n\"Well,\" Rubio, seemingly somewhat irritated, replied, \"as a senator, I had an opinion all kinds of domestic matters, but now I'm focused singularly on foreign policy, on how I interact with our allies.\"\n\nPresident Trump's pardons of the convicted January 6 attackers, including nearly 90 who committed acts of violence, even against law enforcement officers, were also the subject of Rubio's interview with NBC News' Craig Melvin on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to Fox News , Melvin played video of Rubio saying in 2021, \"Vladimir Putin loved everything that happened here today because what happened is better than anything he could have ever come up with to make us look like we're falling apart.\"\n\nMelvin then \"asked Rubio what message the pardons send to the rest of the world,\" Fox reported.\n\nBut Rubio declared that he \"would not 'engage in domestic political debates' with the media and could not in his role as the head of the State Department.\"\n\n\"I hope you guys all understand that my days - at least in the time at the Department of State - of engaging in domestic politics will be put aside as I focus on the affairs the United States has around the world and the engagements we have to have to make our country a safer, stronger, more prosperous place,\" he said, after refusing to respond.\n\nWhen pressed again, Rubio apparently expressed frustration.\n\n\"I think it's unfortunate, you know, our first engagement as I agree to come on this morning with you. I'm going to be working on foreign policy issues, and you want to revisit these issues that are going on in domestic politics. I'm just - it's not going to happen,\" Rubio said. \"If you have questions for me about foreign policy and engaging in the world, I'd be happy to talk to you about those.\"\n\nWatch the videos below or at this link ."

Some chanted they wanted to \"hang Mike Pence\" for refusing to block the certification.\n\nThey came directly from a rally Trump held on the Ellipse, in which Trump repeated his false claim that the election had been stolen and told the crowd, \"if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\"\n\nAccording to the indictment from the office of Special Counsel Jack Smith, Trump directed those supporters to the Capitol \"to obstruct the certification proceeding and exert pressure\" on Pence. The indictment further states:\n\nThe FBI estimates that between 2,000 and 2,500 people entered the Capitol Building during the attack, some of whom participated in vandalism and looting, including the the offices of members of Congress. Rioters also assaulted Capitol Police officers. They occupied the empty empty Senate chamber while federal law enforcement officers defended the evacuated House floor.\n\nWithin 36 hours, five people died. One was shot by Capitol Police, another died of a drug overdose, three died of heart attacks or strokes, including a police officer who died the day after being assaulted by rioters. Many were injured, including 174 police officers. Four other officers who responded to the attack died by suicide within seven months.\n\n\"President Trump was wrong,\" Pence said subsequently. \"I had no right to overturn the election. And his reckless words endangered my family and everyone at the Capitol that day, and I know history will hold Donald Trump accountable.\"\n\nBut Trump has not been held accountable.\n\nA week after the attack, the House of Representatives impeached Trump for incitement of insurrection. In February 2021, after he had left office, the Senate voted 57-43 in favor of conviction, but fell short of the required two-thirds, resulting in his acquittal.\n\nSenate Republicans then blocked a bill to create a bipartisan independent commission to investigate the attack, leaving the House to organize its own select committee.\n\nAfter an 18-month investigation including more than 1,000 witnesses and nine televised public hearings, the House's select committee identified Trump as the \"central cause\" of the Capitol attack by the pro-Trump mob.\n\nThe panel, made up of seven Democrats and two Republicans, voted unanimously to recommend charges to the Justice Department to prosecute Trump for seeking to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nFollowing a special counsel investigation by the Justice Department, Trump was indicted on four charges in August 2023.\n\nBut after Trump's reelection to the presidency, all charges were dismissed.\n\nOf the 1,424 people charged with federal crimes relating to the riot, 1,010 pled guilty, and 1,060 have been sentenced. Enrique Tarrio, then the chairman of the Proud Boys, received the longest sentence, a 22-year prison term.\n\n***\n\nTrump and his lackeys in the Republican Party have since promoted a revisionist history of the event - downplaying the severity of the violence, spreading conspiracy theories, and portraying those charged with crimes as hostages and martyrs.\n\nTrump has tried to recast the violent events as a \" day of love .\" He has promised that in the first day of his new administration he would consider pardons for those who have been prosecuted for their roles on Jan. 6.\n\nOn December 8, 2024, in his first broadcast news interview since the 2024 election, Trump said members of the House committee that investigated the riot \"should go to jail.\"\n\n***\n\nThat Donald J. Trump - the same person who instigated a coup four years ago tomorrow, when Congress last gathered to certify an election - will become President on January 20 is an assault on the rule of law and the foundations of our democracy.\n\nWe must never forget. January 6, 2021 should live in infamy, as should Trump.\n\nNOW READ: The scarlet F is coming for Trump - and there's nothing he can do about it\n\nRobert Reich is a professor of public policy at Berkeley and former secretary of labor.

Trump, I am writing to inform you that your position as special counsel of the U.S. Office of Special Counsel is terminated, effective immediately. Thank you for your service[.]\"\n\nThe complaint lists six defendants, including Gor, Trump, acting Special Counsel of the Office of Special Counsel (OSC) Karen Gorman (\"upon the purported removal\" of Dellinger, according to the complaint), Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, Chief Operating Officer of the OSC Karl Kanmann, and Director of the Office of Management and Budget Russell Vought.\n\nDellinger is requesting that the court declare his firing unlawful and affirm that he is the head of the OSC.\n\nThe filing also asks the court to order that \"Bessent, Gor, Kammann, and Vought may not place an acting special counsel in plaintiff Hampton Dellinger's position, or otherwise recognize any other person as special counsel or as the agency head of the Office of Special Counsel.\"\n\nThe watchdog group Project on Government Oversight called the move against Dellinger \"illegal\" and wrote on X on Monday that it \"undermines the office that investigates whistleblower disclosures of wrongdoing and enforces the law meant to keep partisan politics out of the federal workforce.\"\n\nThe OSC is both an investigative and prosecutorial agency whose main mission is to protect federal employees from \"prohibited personnel practices\" -in particular reprisals for whistleblowing. The office is different from the \"special counsels\" that the U.S. Department of Justice may appoint to prosecute cases in instances where they deem there may be a conflict of interest.\n\nDellinger was nominated to be the special counsel of the OSC by then-President Joe Biden in 2023 and was confirmed by the Senate to a five-year term that was set to expire in 2029.\n\nThe complaint cites federal statute, which mandates that \"the special counsel may be removed by the president only for inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance in office.\" Dellinger's legal counsel argues that the email from Gor does not accuse Dellinger of \"any inefficiency, neglect of duty, or malfeasance... nor could it.\"\n\nIn late January, Trump fired National Labor Relations Board Member Gwynne Wilcox, who has since sued over her dismissal, as well as two Democratic members of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. Federal Election Commission Commissioner and Chair Ellen Weintraub also said that Trump tried to remove her improperly.\n\nThe Trump administration also purged over a dozen inspectors generals who perform oversight duties at various federal agencies.\n\nThe filing also argues that the removal of these sorts of civil servants makes the work of the OSC all the more important.\n\n\"Congress authorized the OSC with a crucial investigative and oversight role to protect the integrity of the civil service in circumstances such as these,\" wrote Dellinger's lawyers.\n\n\"The recent spate of terminations of protected civil service employees under the new presidential administration has created controversies, both about the lawfulness of these actions and about potential retaliation against whistleblowers,\" they added."

(AP Photo/Ben Curtis)\n\n▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump says he is firing members of the board of trustees for the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts and naming himself chairman.\n\nHe also indicated that he would be dictating programming at one of the nation's premier cultural institutions, specifically declaring that he would end events featuring performers in drag.\n\nTrump's announcement Friday came as the Republican president has bulldozed his way across official Washington during the first weeks of his second term, trying to shutter federal agencies, freeze spending and ending diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives across the government.\n\n\"At my direction, we are going to make the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C., GREAT AGAIN. I have decided to immediately terminate multiple individuals from the Board of Trustees, including the Chairman, who do not share our Vision for a Golden Age in Arts and Culture,\" Trump wrote on his social media website.\n\n\"We will soon announce a new Board, with an amazing Chairman, DONALD J. TRUMP!\"\n\nIn a statement later on its website, the Kennedy Center said it was aware of Trump's post. \"We have received no official communications from the White House regarding changes to our board of trustees,\" the statement said. \"We are aware that some members of our board have received termination notices from the administration.\"\n\nThe statement continued: \"Per the Center's governance established by Congress in 1958, the chair of the board of trustees is appointed by the Center's board members. There is nothing in the Center's statute that would prevent a new administration from replacing board members; however, this would be the first time such action has been taken with the Kennedy Center's board.\"\n\nDrag artists accused Trump of targeting them because of who they are in a country where freedom of expression is guaranteed by the Constitution.\n\n\"This is about who gets to exist in public spaces and whose stories get to be told on America's stage,\" said Blaq Dinamyte, president of Qommittee, a national network of drag artists and allies. \"Banning an entire art form is censorship, plain and simple. Americans don't have to agree on everything, but we should be able to speak our minds and perform our art without bans, retaliation, or intimidation.\"\n\nUnlike Democratic President Joe Biden and other presidents through the decades, Trump did not attend the annual Kennedy Center Honors ceremonies during his first term.\n\nShortly after Trump's post, the Kennedy Center website began experiencing technical difficulties. Visitors got a message reading \"We are experiencing high traffic\" and were redirected to a \"waiting room\" that listed how many hundreds of people were trying to access the site ahead of them.\n\nTrump suggested in his post that he would be implementing some changes to the center's performance schedule, noting that last year \"the Kennedy Center featured Drag Shows specifically targeting our youth - THIS WILL STOP.\"\n\nAccording to its website, the center in July hosted a preshow titled \"A Drag Salute to Divas\" and a November \"Drag Brunch.\"\n\nIn his post, Trump did not clarify which board of trustee members he would terminate besides the current chairman, philanthropist David Rubenstein. The board often features political powerbrokers and major donors, and is currently made up of members from both sides of the aisle.\n\nRubenstein was first elected to the post in 2010 and reelected each year since that time. He was originally appointed to the Kennedy Center board by Republican President George W. Bush and subsequently reappointed by Democratic President Barack Obama and Biden.\n\nThe current board features Biden's White House press secretary, Karine Jean-Pierre , as well as Mike Donilon, Biden's longtime ally, and Stephanie Cutter, a former Obama adviser. The treasurer of the center's board of trustees is television producer Shonda Rhimes , who hosted fundraisers for Biden before he abandoned his reelection bid last summer.\n\nBut the current board also features Trump allies, including Pam Bondi, his recently confirmed attorney general, and Lee Greenwood, whose song \"God Bless the USA,\" was the unofficial anthem of Trump's presidential campaigns.\n\nDuring his first term in 2019, Trump announced that he was tapping actor Jon Voight, a longtime supporter, to the board, along with former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who is Trump's second-term pick to be the U.S. ambassador to Israel.\n\n--\n\nAssociated Press writer Darlene Superville in Palm Beach, Florida, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Trump's Truth Social looks set to hit Wall Street in a move that could give him stock worth billions of dollars on paper. But the former president likely can't cash it out right away, unless some things change. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Former President Donald Trump launched his social media platform, Truth Social, in early 2022, after he was banned from major sites such as Facebook and the platform formerly known as Twitter following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhile he's since been reinstated to both , he's mostly stayed off X, the Elon Musk-owned platform that was once his primary megaphone. On Facebook, meanwhile, his posts are largely videos and images with slogans and messages like \"THANK YOU, MISSOURI! Together, WE are going to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"\n\nThat's unlikely to change even as the Trump Media & Technology Group starts trading on the NASDAQ stock market.\n\nHere are some things to know about Trump's social media platform and where it fits into the broader social media landscape.\n\nBefore Truth Social, there was a short-lived blog on Trump's personal website called \"From the Desk of Donald J. Trump.\" But it didn't last long, and Trump's camp was already hinting that the former president had a social media platform in the works.\n\nTruth Social launched in the Apple App store in February 2022. It was a glitchy start, but it shot to the top of Apple's list of most downloaded free apps. While the platform sought to capitalize on the outrage over Trump's social media bans to attract a broad audience, Truth Social, much like fellow right-leaning social media platforms Gettr and Parler, has not been able to move much beyond an echo chamber of conservative political commentary - if they are able to stay online in the first place.\n\n\"It is marketed in opposition to mainstream media apps, which Trump and his supporters allege discriminate against their views and limit free expression. Its content and audience are overwhelmingly conservative and made up of the MAGA base,\" said Roxana Muenster, a doctoral student at Cornell University who studies the far-right and digital communication. \"There is also a lot of hate speech and extremism on the platform due to their lax approach to content moderation.\"\n\nThe company behind Truth Social doesn't disclose user numbers. As it lays out in a regulatory filing, \"since its inception, TMTG has focused on developing Truth Social by enhancing features and user interface rather than relying on traditional performance metrics like average revenue per user, ad impressions and pricing, or active user accounts, including monthly and daily active users.\"\n\nNonetheless, research firm Similarweb estimates that Truth Social had roughly 5 million monthly visits in February of this year. That compares with more than 2 billion for TikTok and more than 3 billion monthly active users for Facebook, for instance, by Meta's own reporting. However, the site fares better than rivals in the so-called \"alt-tech\" space, such as Parler, which just returned to Apple's app store this week after being offline for more than a year , or Gettr, which had less than 2 million visitors in February.\n\nTrump reaches far fewer people on his platform, where he has less than 7 million followers, than he might on X, where he boasts 87 million.\n\n\"It's unlikely that Truth Social will rival mainstream social media platforms any time soon. For many users, Trump is what draws them to Truth Social. For many more, it's what keeps them away,\" Muenster said. \"But more importantly, it will be hard for it to rival X because of the way platforms work. Social networks benefit from scale: The more users are on one platform, the more it increases in value - that is called network effects.\"\n\nDigital World itself has pointed out the need to grow its user base in order to be successful. In its filing with U.S. regulators, the company listed many of the risks facing TMTG. Chief among them is the need for the platform to grow its user base\n\n\"In order to be successful, TMTG will need millions of those people to register and regularly use TMTG's platform,\" the company wrote. \"If President Trump becomes less popular or there are new controversies that damage his credibility or the desire of people to use a platform associated with him, and from which he will derive financial benefit, TMTG's results of operations could be adversely affected.\"\n\nTruth Social looks and feels a bit like X. Users have a profile, they can follow one another, post \"truths\" or \"retruths\" and send direct messages. Ads are called \"sponsored truths.\"\n\nTo sign up, Truth Social asks for an email address and phone number. Users have to agree to receive text messages from it before they can complete the signup process. This is uncommon for social media companies looking to attract as many people as possible, since it may turn off some potential users. And unlike mainstream social media companies, which allow teenagers to sign up, Truth Social requires users to be at least 18 - though it does not verify ages.\n\nTruth Social's feed looks much like X's, with a purple color scheme and a \"for you\" section of recommended posts as well as a feed of accounts a user follows. There's an abundance of conservative-leaning political posts, voices of support for Trump, railing against immigration and President Joe Biden.\n\nAs part of an agreement that runs until February 2025, Trump has agreed to wait six hours after posting on Truth Social before he can post any \"non-political communications\" on other social media platforms\n\nHowever, this is at the former president's sole discretion, and as the company notes in a regulatory filing, as \"a candidate for president, most or all of President Trump's social media posts may be deemed by him to be politically related.\"\n\nNewer social media apps targeting conservative users, including Truth Social, Parler and Gab, haven't come remotely close to matching the success of Facebook or X. That's partly because Republican politicians and causes already draw large audiences on existing, better established platforms, so they see little reason to move to a new service.\n\nA 2022 Pew Research Center survey - the most recent one available - found that while 27% of Americans had heard of Truth Social, only 2% used it to get their news. Still, the site fared better than rival conservative-leaning apps. It was second only to Parler, which was temporarily taken offline following the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nTruth Social says it encourages an \"open, free, and honest global conversation without discriminating on the basis of political ideology.\" But while it has touted minimal content moderation, a 2022 report from the nonprofit Public Citizen found that early users experienced \"bans after selecting usernames or authoring posts that made fun of or criticized the former president and his allies.\"\n\nMuenster notes that while it is marketed as a free expression platform, Truth Social still engages in some content moderation, including limiting illegal or copyrighted material. It's also stricter on sexual content and language than other platforms, she said.\n\n\"Their policy also leaves a lot of room for the company to decide which other type of content they deem inappropriate. And they have made use of that, with reports that they banned accounts that tweeted about the Jan. 6th investigation and parody accounts who were accused of impersonating others,\" Muenster said.\n\nPrivate companies are accountable to their owners, while public companies are accountable to the shareholders who own the company's stock. Now that it's being traded on the market, some $300 million is expected to flow into the company and TMTG will be required to report its quarterly finances as well as other material news to the Securities and Exchange Commission. While at the outset, Trump will hold the majority of its stock, should he decide to sell it, the company's stock will be subject to the whims of Wall Street, with investors looking for healthy finances and growth.\n\nIn this sense, Truth Social faces some of the same problems that X has been contending with - mainstream advertisers who don't want to be associated with hate speech and other controversial content.\n\n\"X is also in a precarious situation, but the users who leave X because of its new owner's online activity or political views are more likely to choose one of the many other platforms trying to take X's place, such as BlueSky or Meta's Threads, than a platform owned by a politician whose views and activity they also deem problematic,\" Muenster said. \"But if this deal goes through, Truth Social will have to answer to investors, investors who will want their investment to pay off. For this to happen, the platform will have to attract more users. It will be interesting to see how they attempt to go about this.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

All Rights Reserved.\n\nOn his first full day in office, President Donald Trump defended his decision to pardon people convicted of assaulting police officers during the Jan. 6 Capitol attack and suggested there could be a place in US politics for the Proud Boys extremist group.\n\nToday's live updates have ended. See what you missed below and follow new updates from Jan. 22, 2024 .\n\nDonald Trump began his presidency with a dizzying display of force , signing a blizzard of executive orders that signaled his desire to remake American institutions while also pardoning nearly all of his supporters who rioted at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nOn the first full day of his second term , Trump defended his decision to grant clemency to Jan. 6 rioters, suggested there was a place in his movement for the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers and directed that federal staffers who work on DEI efforts be put on leave.\n\nHe also met with Republican congressional leaders and issued a pardon to the founder of an underground website for selling drugs whom supporters likened to a \"libertarian political prisoner.\"\n\nTrump's administration is directing that all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on paid leave, and that agencies develop plans to lay them off, according to a memo from the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nTuesday's memo follows an executive order that Trump signed his first day ordering a sweeping dismantling of the federal government's diversity and inclusion programs that could include anti-bias training and funding for minority farmers and homeowners.\n\n▶ Read more about the administration's efforts to dismantle federal DEI programs\n\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump pardoned, commuted the prison sentences or vowed to dismiss the cases of all of the 1,500-plus people charged with crimes in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nOn the one side of Trump sat Speaker Mike Johnson. On the other was Senate Majority Leader John Thune.\n\nAnd other GOP leaders joined for the meeting in the Cabinet Room.\n\nIt was more of a date than a marriage, said one person familiar with the private meeting, and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\nTrump floated many ideas on the priorities ahead - for tax cuts, disaster aid, regulatory reforms and the upcoming March deadline to fund the government - with no clear preference for their various strategies, only that they get the job done. Policy aides Stephen Miller and James Braid joined the talk.\n\nThe GOP leaders were given chocolate chip cookies and commemorative coins.\n\nIt was all carrot, no threat of sticks, for now, the person said. They're confident they'll have a second date.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has had a busy first 24 hours back in the White House. He attended various events and signed executive orders and memorandums.\n\nThe Nielsen company says an estimated 24.6 million people watched coverage ofTrump's second inauguration. That's the lowest Inauguration Day audience since 2013, when Barack Obama was sworn in for his second term.\n\nNielsen said it's also down from the 33.8 million who saw Joe Biden's inauguration four years ago, and the 30.6 million who saw Trump take office for the first time in 2017.\n\nFox News Channel, the most popular network among Trump's supporters, had more than twice as many viewers as any other single network.\n\nTrump says he has pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, who was serving a life sentence.\n\nUlbricht created the underground website that prosecutors had described as an unprecedented one-stop online shopping mall where the supply of drugs was virtually limitless.\n\nAt his 2015 sentencing , the judge cited six deaths from drugs bought on his site and five people he tried to have killed. Ulbricht said at his sentencing that he was a changed man.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social that he spoke to Ulbricht's mother on his first full day in office.\n\n\"It was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,\" he wrote. \"The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me.\"\n\nSenators vetting the nomination of Pete Hegseth for defense secretary received an affidavit from a former sister-in-law alleging that the onetime Fox News host was abusive to his second wife to the point where she feared for her safety.\n\nA lawyer for Hegseth denied the allegations.\n\nIn an affidavit obtained by The Associated Press, Danielle Hegseth said she believes Pete Hegseth is \"unfit\" to run the Defense Department based on what she witnessed and heard.\n\n▶ Read more about the affidavit\n\nTrump said Tuesday that the 25% tariffs that he intends to place on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1 would have \"nothing to do\" with renegotiating the existing trade pact among the three countries. For him, the tariffs are all about stopping unauthorized migration and the flow of any illicit drugs.\n\nTrump has also threatened tariffs against China over the exporting of chemicals used to make fentanyl, though the U.S. president said he didn't have prolonged discussions about the import taxes in his conversation last week with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\"We didn't talk too much about tariffs other than he knows where I stand,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Trump administration has named an adviser to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott as chief of the U.S. Border Patrol.\n\nMike Banks has advised Texas on the multibillion-dollar \"Operation Lone Star,\" which put the state in an unprecedented role in border enforcement. Texas frequently faced off with the Biden administration over legal authorities to police the border.\n\nBanks replaces Jason Owens, who is retiring after nearly three decades in the Border Patrol. Banks, a former Border Patrol agent, said he will \"strengthen partnerships, enhance operations and embrace innovation.\" He will oversee about 20,000 agents.\n\nTrump repeated that he expects to speak with Putin \"very soon\" as he once again called for an end game in the nearly 3-year-old Russian invasion of Ukraine and claimed that the conflict would have never happened if he had been president.\n\n\" Russia never would have gone into Ukraine,\" Trump said. \"I had a very strong understanding with Putin. That would have never, ever happened. He disrespected Biden. Very simple. He disrespects people. He's smart. He understands. He disrespected Biden.\"\n\nThe Senate has delayed an expected vote to confirm President Donald Trump's pick to be the next CIA director after Democrats raised objections.\n\nRepublican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas says Tuesday's vote was put off after Senate Democrats raised objections about John Ratcliffe's nomination.\n\nCotton accused Democrats of trying to drag out the nominations intentionally to obstruct Trump. He said Thursday is the earliest a vote could be held on Ratcliffe's nomination.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut says the delay is needed to discuss questions about whether Ratcliffe would put his loyalty to Trump over the duties of the job. Murphy said Ratcliffe's nomination deserved a \"full, real debate.\"\n\nThe Senate gained two Republican new members on Tuesday as Florida's Ashley Moody and Ohio's Jon Husted were sworn in.\n\nMoody, who was serving as Florida's attorney general, was appointed to replace Sen. Marco Rubio, who was confirmed as President Donald Trump's secretary of state on Monday.\n\nAnd Husted, who was Ohio's lieutenant governor, is replacing Vice President JD Vance. Both of them will serve until at least 2026, when elections will be held to permanently fill their seats.\n\nVance swore them both in, serving in his new capacity as president of the Senate.\n\nTrump is defending his decision to terminate the Secret Service detail assigned to his former national security adviser, John Bolton.\n\nBolton was the target of an alleged 2021 Iranian assassination plot.\n\nTrump said of the past years of protection for Bolton: \"I think that was enough time.\"\n\n\"We're not going to have security on people for the rest of their lives,\" Trump said. He added, \"You can't have that for life. You shouldn't expect it for life.\"\n\nPresidents have Secret Service protection for life.\n\nTrump also called Bolton, who has since become a fierce Trump critic, \"a very dumb person\" and a \"warmonger\" and blamed him for entangling the U.S. in bloody Middle Eastern wars.\n\nTrump says he doesn't have TikTok on his phone, but that could be changing. Leaving his infrastructure event, he was asked whether he's installed the app, which the U.S. government has banned from federal devices due to concerns it could lead to spying by Chinese intelligence agencies.\n\n\"No but I think I might put it there,\" Trump said.He repeated his praise for the platform, which he says helped him perform well with young voters.\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" Trump said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok, calling it a national security threat ^\n\nTrump's phone has already been hacked by China.\n\nTrump is describing the letter Joe Biden left him in the Resolute Desk.\n\n\"It was a very nice letter,\" Trump tells reporters. \"It was a little bit of an inspirational-type letter,\" he said, with Biden emphasizing \"how important the job is\" and telling him to do a job.\n\nTrump found the letter -- addressed to \"47\" -- while he was signing executive orders in the Oval office Monday in front of a gaggle or reporters and said he'd opened in Monday night.\n\nHe says he is considering releasing it publicly at some point.\n\nTrump was asked whether there is a place for the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers in the \"Make America Great Again\" movement after he granted clemency to some of them, who were among the Jan. 6 rioters.\n\nTrump said, \"Well, we have to see. They've been given a pardon. I thought their sentences were ridiculous and excessive.\"\n\nPresident Trump is defending his decision to pardon people who were charged and convicted of assaulting police officers during the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot , despite having run as an ally of law enforcement.\n\n\"I am the friend of police, more than any president who's ever been in this office,\" he said.\n\nTrump tells reporters at the White House that those he pardoned have already served years in prison.

Andy Beshear said any policies that jeopardize jobs, health care, safety, schools and other \"issues that the American people are worried about ... that's when we should be pushing back.\"\n\nHe expressed concerns about the prospect that tariffs - which Trump has promised - could drive up prices, recalling how retaliatory tariffs against U.S. goods in the president's first term affected products like Kentucky bourbon.\n\n\"That was hundreds of millions of dollars of negative economic impact that we are still feeling that cost jobs - that that cost us in exports,\" Beshear said.\n\nTrump returning from inaugural prayer service, says 'they could do much better'\n\nEighteen states, plus the District of Columbia and San Francisco sued in federal court to block Trump's order.\n\nNew Jersey Democratic Attorney General Matt Platkin said Tuesday the president cannot undo a right written into the Constitution with a stroke of his pen.\n\n\"Presidents have broad power but they are not kings,\" Platkin said.\n\nNot long after Trump signed the order, immigrant rights groups filed suit to stop it.\n\nChapters of the American Civil Liberties Union in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts along with other immigrant rights advocates filed a suit in New Hampshire federal court. The suit asks the court to find the order to be unconstitutional.\n\nThe 14th Amendment did not always guarantee birthright citizenship to all U.S.-born people. Congress didn't authorize citizenship for all Native Americans born in the United States, for instance, until 1924.\n\nIn 1898, an important birthright citizenship case unfolded in the U.S. Supreme Court. The court held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants, was a U.S. citizen because he was born in the country. After a trip abroad, he had faced denied reentry by the federal government on the grounds that he wasn't a citizen under the Chinese Exclusion Act.\n\nBut some advocates of immigration restrictions have argued that while the case clearly applied to children born to parents who are both legal immigrants, it's less clear whether it applies to children born to parents without legal status.\n\nBirthright citizenship means anyone born in the U.S. is a citizen, regardless of their parents' immigration status. People, for instance, in the United States on a tourist or other visa or in the country illegally can become the parents of a citizen if their child is born here.\n\nIt's been in place for decades and enshrined in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution , supporters say. But Trump and allies dispute the reading of the amendment and say there need to be tougher standards on becoming a citizen.\n\nTrump moved to end birthright citizenship when he ordered the cancellation of the constitutional guarantee that U.S.-born children are citizens regardless of their parents' status.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday ordered that no federal officer, employee or agent may unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen. AP's Ali Swenson breaks down what this early step toward one of his many campaign promises means.\n\nFresh off his trip to the inauguration, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said he had instructed officials to lawfully cooperate with Trump's agenda around immigration and other issues, while flatly refusing to criticize the president or any of his policies.\n\n\"I'm not going to be warring with the president,\" Adams told reporters. \"I'm going to be working with the president.\"\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams watches the 60th Presidential Inauguration from Emancipation Hall in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. (Angelina Katsanis/Pool Photo Photo via AP)\n\nAdams was elected as a Democrat and previously criticized the \"abusive rhetoric and tactics\" of the first Trump era. But he has increasingly embraced Trump in recent months, raising speculation that he is angling for a pardon in his federal case on bribery and campaign finance charges.\n\nOn Tuesday, Adams declined to say whether he opposed Trump's executive orders that pardoned Jan. 6 defendants, revoked birthright citizenship and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. And he repeatedly ducked questions about how the city would respond to large-scale immigration raids promised by Trump.\n\n\"You shouldn't start out the gate criticizing,\" Adams said. \"You should start trying to collaborate, trying to cooperate.\"\n\nIt came as Rubio took the helm of the State Department just hours after taking the oath of office.\n\nTrump's first confirmed cabinet appointment, Rubio entered the department through its main entrance to loud applause and cheers before addressing his new employees in the same lobby in which former Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered farewell remarks to the building Friday.\n\n\"The voters decide the course of our nation, both domestically and abroad, and they have elected Donald J. Trump as our president when it comes to foreign policy on a very clear mission,\" Rubio said. \"And that mission is to ensure that our foreign policy is centered on one thing, and that is the advancement of our national interest, which (was) clearly defined through his campaign as anything that makes us stronger or safer or more prosperous.\"\n\nTrump has been publicly skeptical of the value of the State Department since his first term in office and, as he has done with with other agencies, accused some in the diplomatic corps of working to blunt or derail his policy priorities.\n\nSome senators are urging Collins to fight the federal hiring freeze Trump declared Monday, saying it will sap the Department of Veterans Affairs' ability to provide medical care or even run veteran cemeteries.\n\n\"This hiring freeze should not apply to direct care workers,\" said Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.\n\nDoug Collins, President Donald Trump's pick to be Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, speaks at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, noted the text of the order says it won't adversely affect Social Security, Medicare and veterans benefits. He asked Collins whether that meant the VA was exempt from the freeze. Collins said he's still examining what it means \"but we support the president's initiative in this phase.\"\n\nCollins also said he believes there are numerous opportunities to streamline the VA, but said Trump will protect care.\n\n\"I was told by the president to take care of veterans,\" Collins said. \"We're going to take care of veterans.\"\n\nSpeaking at a Federalist Society forum Tuesday, John Yoo, a University of California law professor and former government official who's promoted the idea of expansive presidential authority, said Trump's decision to allow TikTok to continue to operate, for now, appears to run afoul of the law that called for it to shut down by Sunday. The law gave the president the authority to extend the deadline, but Yoo noted that the window when that was allowed had closed by the time Trump took office and signed the order.\n\nYoo also said the order to end birthright citizenship appears to be unconstitutional. And sending to the military to seal the southern border may have gone too far, he said, because it relies on the premise that the U.S. is being invaded.\n\nMontana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said during the forum that the state could consider suing the Trump administration to try to undo Trump's executive order allowing TikTok to continue operating.\n\nDoug Collins, President Donald Trump's pick to be Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, speaks at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025.

But he says the VA \"exists for the veterans\" and that particularly newer veterans may prefer private providers.\n\nDemocrats are urging Collins to protect the current system, saying it provides valuable expertise. But some Republicans in particular say it should be easier for veterans to access private medical care because of long distances.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Trump's Truth Social looks set to hit Wall Street in a move that could give him stock worth billions of dollars on paper. But the former president likely can't cash it out right away, unless some things change. (AP Photo/John Minchillo)\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (AP) - Former President Donald Trump launched his social media platform, Truth Social, in early 2022, after he was banned from major sites such as Facebook and the platform formerly known as Twitter following the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nWhile he's since been reinstated to both , he's mostly stayed off X, the Elon Musk-owned platform that was once his primary megaphone. On Facebook, meanwhile, his posts are largely videos and images with slogans and messages like \"THANK YOU, MISSOURI! Together, WE are going to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"\n\nThat's unlikely to change even as the Trump Media & Technology Group starts trading on the NASDAQ stock market.\n\nHere are some things to know about Trump's social media platform and where it fits into the broader social media landscape.\n\nBefore Truth Social, there was a short-lived blog on Trump's personal website called \"From the Desk of Donald J. Trump.\" But it didn't last long, and Trump's camp was already hinting that the former president had a social media platform in the works.\n\nTruth Social launched in the Apple App store in February 2022. It was a glitchy start, but it shot to the top of Apple's list of most downloaded free apps. While the platform sought to capitalize on the outrage over Trump's social media bans to attract a broad audience, Truth Social, much like fellow right-leaning social media platforms Gettr and Parler, has not been able to move much beyond an echo chamber of conservative political commentary - if they are able to stay online in the first place.\n\n\"It is marketed in opposition to mainstream media apps, which Trump and his supporters allege discriminate against their views and limit free expression. Its content and audience are overwhelmingly conservative and made up of the MAGA base,\" said Roxana Muenster, a doctoral student at Cornell University who studies the far-right and digital communication. \"There is also a lot of hate speech and extremism on the platform due to their lax approach to content moderation.\"\n\nThe company behind Truth Social doesn't disclose user numbers. As it lays out in a regulatory filing, \"since its inception, TMTG has focused on developing Truth Social by enhancing features and user interface rather than relying on traditional performance metrics like average revenue per user, ad impressions and pricing, or active user accounts, including monthly and daily active users.\"\n\nNonetheless, research firm Similarweb estimates that Truth Social had roughly 5 million monthly visits in February of this year. That compares with more than 2 billion for TikTok and more than 3 billion monthly active users for Facebook, for instance, by Meta's own reporting. However, the site fares better than rivals in the so-called \"alt-tech\" space, such as Parler, which just returned to Apple's app store this week after being offline for more than a year , or Gettr, which had less than 2 million visitors in February.\n\nTrump reaches far fewer people on his platform, where he has less than 7 million followers, than he might on X, where he boasts 87 million.\n\n\"It's unlikely that Truth Social will rival mainstream social media platforms any time soon. For many users, Trump is what draws them to Truth Social. For many more, it's what keeps them away,\" Muenster said. \"But more importantly, it will be hard for it to rival X because of the way platforms work. Social networks benefit from scale: The more users are on one platform, the more it increases in value - that is called network effects.\"\n\nDigital World itself has pointed out the need to grow its user base in order to be successful. In its filing with U.S. regulators, the company listed many of the risks facing TMTG. Chief among them is the need for the platform to grow its user base\n\n\"In order to be successful, TMTG will need millions of those people to register and regularly use TMTG's platform,\" the company wrote. \"If President Trump becomes less popular or there are new controversies that damage his credibility or the desire of people to use a platform associated with him, and from which he will derive financial benefit, TMTG's results of operations could be adversely affected.\"\n\nTruth Social looks and feels a bit like X. Users have a profile, they can follow one another, post \"truths\" or \"retruths\" and send direct messages. Ads are called \"sponsored truths.\"\n\nTo sign up, Truth Social asks for an email address and phone number. Users have to agree to receive text messages from it before they can complete the signup process. This is uncommon for social media companies looking to attract as many people as possible, since it may turn off some potential users. And unlike mainstream social media companies, which allow teenagers to sign up, Truth Social requires users to be at least 18 - though it does not verify ages.\n\nTruth Social's feed looks much like X's, with a purple color scheme and a \"for you\" section of recommended posts as well as a feed of accounts a user follows. There's an abundance of conservative-leaning political posts, voices of support for Trump, railing against immigration and President Joe Biden.\n\nAs part of an agreement that runs until February 2025, Trump has agreed to wait six hours after posting on Truth Social before he can post any \"non-political communications\" on other social media platforms\n\nHowever, this is at the former president's sole discretion, and as the company notes in a regulatory filing, as \"a candidate for president, most or all of President Trump's social media posts may be deemed by him to be politically related.\"\n\nNewer social media apps targeting conservative users, including Truth Social, Parler and Gab, haven't come remotely close to matching the success of Facebook or X. That's partly because Republican politicians and causes already draw large audiences on existing, better established platforms, so they see little reason to move to a new service.\n\nA 2022 Pew Research Center survey - the most recent one available - found that while 27% of Americans had heard of Truth Social, only 2% used it to get their news. Still, the site fared better than rival conservative-leaning apps. It was second only to Parler, which was temporarily taken offline following the Jan. 6 attack.\n\nTruth Social says it encourages an \"open, free, and honest global conversation without discriminating on the basis of political ideology.\" But while it has touted minimal content moderation, a 2022 report from the nonprofit Public Citizen found that early users experienced \"bans after selecting usernames or authoring posts that made fun of or criticized the former president and his allies.\"\n\nMuenster notes that while it is marketed as a free expression platform, Truth Social still engages in some content moderation, including limiting illegal or copyrighted material. It's also stricter on sexual content and language than other platforms, she said.\n\n\"Their policy also leaves a lot of room for the company to decide which other type of content they deem inappropriate. And they have made use of that, with reports that they banned accounts that tweeted about the Jan. 6th investigation and parody accounts who were accused of impersonating others,\" Muenster said.\n\nPrivate companies are accountable to their owners, while public companies are accountable to the shareholders who own the company's stock. Now that it's being traded on the market, some $300 million is expected to flow into the company and TMTG will be required to report its quarterly finances as well as other material news to the Securities and Exchange Commission. While at the outset, Trump will hold the majority of its stock, should he decide to sell it, the company's stock will be subject to the whims of Wall Street, with investors looking for healthy finances and growth.\n\nIn this sense, Truth Social faces some of the same problems that X has been contending with - mainstream advertisers who don't want to be associated with hate speech and other controversial content.\n\n\"X is also in a precarious situation, but the users who leave X because of its new owner's online activity or political views are more likely to choose one of the many other platforms trying to take X's place, such as BlueSky or Meta's Threads, than a platform owned by a politician whose views and activity they also deem problematic,\" Muenster said. \"But if this deal goes through, Truth Social will have to answer to investors, investors who will want their investment to pay off. For this to happen, the platform will have to attract more users. It will be interesting to see how they attempt to go about this.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

Trump takes the stage to the song at each of his rallies and has appeared with Greenwood at events.\n\n\"Happy Holy Week! Let's Make America Pray Again. As we lead into Good Friday and Easter, I encourage you to get a copy of the God Bless the USA Bible,\" Trump wrote, directing his supporters to a website selling the book for $59.99.\n\nThe effort comes as Trump has faced a serious money crunch amid mounting legal bills while he fights four criminal indictments along with a series of civil charges. Trump was given a reprieve Monday when a New York appeals court agreed to hold off on collecting the more than $454 million he owes following a civil fraud judgment if he puts up $175 million within 10 days. Trump has already posted a $92 million bond in connection with defamation cases brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll , who accused Trump of sexual assault.\n\n\"All Americans need a Bible in their home, and I have many. It's my favorite book,\" Trump said in the video posted on Truth Social. \"I'm proud to endorse and encourage you to get this Bible. We must make America pray again.\"\n\nThis story is featured in our One Notable Number series , which spotlights the key numbers leading our coverage.\n\nTake a look at more Notable Numbers here.\n\nYou can also read more ONEs:\n\nBilling itself as \"the only Bible endorsed by President Trump!\" the new venture's website calls it \"Easy-to-read\" with \"large print\" and a \"slim design\" that \"invites you to explore God's Word anywhere, any time.\"\n\nBesides a King James Version translation, it includes copies of the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence and the Pledge of Allegiance, as well as a handwritten chorus of the famous Greenwood song.\n\nThe Bible is just the latest commercial venture that Trump has pursued while campaigning.\n\nLast month, he debuted a new line of Trump-branded sneakers , including $399 gold \"Never Surrender High-Tops,\" at Sneaker Con in Philadelphia. The venture behind the shoes, 45Footwear, also sells other Trump-branded footwear, cologne and perfume.\n\nTrump has also dabbled in NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, and last year reported earning between $100,000 and $1 million from a series of digital trading cards that portrayed him in cartoon-like images, including as an astronaut, a cowboy and a superhero.\n\nWhat to know about Trump's hush money trial:\n\nHe has also released books featuring photos of his time in office and letters written to him through the years.\n\nThe Bible's website states the product \"is not political and has nothing to do with any political campaign.\"\n\n\"GodBlessTheUSABible.com is not owned, managed or controlled by Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization, CIC Ventures LLC or any of their respective principals or affiliates,\" it says.\n\nInstead, it says, \"GodBlessTheUSABible.com uses Donald J. Trump's name, likeness and image under paid license from CIC Ventures LLC, which license may be terminated or revoked according to its terms.\"\n\nCIC Ventures LLC, a company that Trump reported owning in his 2023 financial disclosure, has a similar arrangement with 45Footwear, which also says it uses Trump's \"name, likeness and image under paid license from CIC Ventures LLC, which license may be terminated or revoked according to its terms.\"\n\nA Trump spokesperson and God Bless the USA Bible did not immediately respond to questions about how much Trump was paid for the licensing deal or stands to make from each book sale.\n\nTrump remains deeply popular with white evangelical Christians , who are among his most ardent supporters, even though the thrice-married former reality TV star has a long history of behavior that often seemed at odds with teachings espoused by Christ in the Gospels.\n\nWhen he was running in 2016, Trump raised eyebrows when he cited \"Two Corinthians\" at Liberty University, instead of the standard \"Second Corinthians.\"\n\nWhen asked to share his favorite Bible verse in an interview with Bloomberg Politics in 2015, he demurred.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to get into it. Because to me, that's very personal,\" he said. \"The Bible means a lot to me, but I don't want to get into specifics.\"\n\nWhen he was president, law enforcement officers aggressively removed racial justice protesters from a park near the White House, allowing Trump to walk to nearby St. John's Church, where he stood alone and raised a Bible. The scene was condemned at the time by the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington.\n\nBefore he ran for office, Trump famously hawked everything from frozen steaks to vodka to a venture named Trump University, which was later sued for fraud .\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

See what you missed below and follow new updates from Jan. 22, 2024 .\n\nDonald Trump began his presidency with a dizzying display of force , signing a blizzard of executive orders that signaled his desire to remake American institutions while also pardoning nearly all of his supporters who rioted at the U.S. Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021.\n\nWhat to know:\n\nOn the first full day of his second term , Trump defended his decision to grant clemency to Jan. 6 rioters, suggested there was a place in his movement for the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers and directed that federal staffers who work on DEI efforts be put on leave.\n\nHe also met with Republican congressional leaders and issued a pardon to the founder of an underground website for selling drugs whom supporters likened to a \"libertarian political prisoner.\"\n\nTrump's administration is directing that all federal diversity, equity and inclusion staff be put on paid leave, and that agencies develop plans to lay them off, according to a memo from the Office of Personnel Management.\n\nTuesday's memo follows an executive order that Trump signed his first day ordering a sweeping dismantling of the federal government's diversity and inclusion programs that could include anti-bias training and funding for minority farmers and homeowners.\n\n▶ Read more about the administration's efforts to dismantle federal DEI programs\n\nOn Monday, President Donald Trump pardoned, commuted the prison sentences or vowed to dismiss the cases of all of the 1,500-plus people charged with crimes in the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nOn the one side of Trump sat Speaker Mike Johnson. On the other was Senate Majority Leader John Thune.\n\nAnd other GOP leaders joined for the meeting in the Cabinet Room.\n\nIt was more of a date than a marriage, said one person familiar with the private meeting, and granted anonymity to discuss it.\n\nTrump floated many ideas on the priorities ahead - for tax cuts, disaster aid, regulatory reforms and the upcoming March deadline to fund the government - with no clear preference for their various strategies, only that they get the job done. Policy aides Stephen Miller and James Braid joined the talk.\n\nThe GOP leaders were given chocolate chip cookies and commemorative coins.\n\nIt was all carrot, no threat of sticks, for now, the person said. They're confident they'll have a second date.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has had a busy first 24 hours back in the White House. He attended various events and signed executive orders and memorandums.\n\nThe Nielsen company says an estimated 24.6 million people watched coverage ofTrump's second inauguration. That's the lowest Inauguration Day audience since 2013, when Barack Obama was sworn in for his second term.\n\nNielsen said it's also down from the 33.8 million who saw Joe Biden's inauguration four years ago, and the 30.6 million who saw Trump take office for the first time in 2017.\n\nFox News Channel, the most popular network among Trump's supporters, had more than twice as many viewers as any other single network.\n\nTrump says he has pardoned Silk Road founder Ross Ulbricht, who was serving a life sentence.\n\nUlbricht created the underground website that prosecutors had described as an unprecedented one-stop online shopping mall where the supply of drugs was virtually limitless.\n\nAt his 2015 sentencing , the judge cited six deaths from drugs bought on his site and five people he tried to have killed. Ulbricht said at his sentencing that he was a changed man.\n\nTrump posted on Truth Social that he spoke to Ulbricht's mother on his first full day in office.\n\n\"It was my pleasure to have just signed a full and unconditional pardon of her son, Ross,\" he wrote. \"The scum that worked to convict him were some of the same lunatics who were involved in the modern day weaponization of government against me.\"\n\nSenators vetting the nomination of Pete Hegseth for defense secretary received an affidavit from a former sister-in-law alleging that the onetime Fox News host was abusive to his second wife to the point where she feared for her safety.\n\nA lawyer for Hegseth denied the allegations.\n\nIn an affidavit obtained by The Associated Press, Danielle Hegseth said she believes Pete Hegseth is \"unfit\" to run the Defense Department based on what she witnessed and heard.\n\n▶ Read more about the affidavit\n\nTrump said Tuesday that the 25% tariffs that he intends to place on Canada and Mexico as soon as Feb. 1 would have \"nothing to do\" with renegotiating the existing trade pact among the three countries. For him, the tariffs are all about stopping unauthorized migration and the flow of any illicit drugs.\n\nTrump has also threatened tariffs against China over the exporting of chemicals used to make fentanyl, though the U.S. president said he didn't have prolonged discussions about the import taxes in his conversation last week with Chinese President Xi Jinping.\n\n\"We didn't talk too much about tariffs other than he knows where I stand,\" Trump said.\n\nThe Trump administration has named an adviser to Texas Gov. Greg Abbott as chief of the U.S. Border Patrol.\n\nMike Banks has advised Texas on the multibillion-dollar \"Operation Lone Star,\" which put the state in an unprecedented role in border enforcement. Texas frequently faced off with the Biden administration over legal authorities to police the border.\n\nBanks replaces Jason Owens, who is retiring after nearly three decades in the Border Patrol. Banks, a former Border Patrol agent, said he will \"strengthen partnerships, enhance operations and embrace innovation.\" He will oversee about 20,000 agents.\n\nTrump repeated that he expects to speak with Putin \"very soon\" as he once again called for an end game in the nearly 3-year-old Russian invasion of Ukraine and claimed that the conflict would have never happened if he had been president.\n\n\" Russia never would have gone into Ukraine,\" Trump said. \"I had a very strong understanding with Putin. That would have never, ever happened. He disrespected Biden. Very simple. He disrespects people. He's smart. He understands. He disrespected Biden.\"\n\nThe Senate has delayed an expected vote to confirm President Donald Trump's pick to be the next CIA director after Democrats raised objections.\n\nRepublican Sen. Tom Cotton of Arkansas says Tuesday's vote was put off after Senate Democrats raised objections about John Ratcliffe's nomination.\n\nCotton accused Democrats of trying to drag out the nominations intentionally to obstruct Trump. He said Thursday is the earliest a vote could be held on Ratcliffe's nomination.\n\nDemocratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut says the delay is needed to discuss questions about whether Ratcliffe would put his loyalty to Trump over the duties of the job. Murphy said Ratcliffe's nomination deserved a \"full, real debate.\"\n\nThe Senate gained two Republican new members on Tuesday as Florida's Ashley Moody and Ohio's Jon Husted were sworn in.\n\nMoody, who was serving as Florida's attorney general, was appointed to replace Sen. Marco Rubio, who was confirmed as President Donald Trump's secretary of state on Monday.\n\nAnd Husted, who was Ohio's lieutenant governor, is replacing Vice President JD Vance. Both of them will serve until at least 2026, when elections will be held to permanently fill their seats.\n\nVance swore them both in, serving in his new capacity as president of the Senate.\n\nTrump is defending his decision to terminate the Secret Service detail assigned to his former national security adviser, John Bolton.\n\nBolton was the target of an alleged 2021 Iranian assassination plot.\n\nTrump said of the past years of protection for Bolton: \"I think that was enough time.\"\n\n\"We're not going to have security on people for the rest of their lives,\" Trump said. He added, \"You can't have that for life. You shouldn't expect it for life.\"\n\nPresidents have Secret Service protection for life.\n\nTrump also called Bolton, who has since become a fierce Trump critic, \"a very dumb person\" and a \"warmonger\" and blamed him for entangling the U.S. in bloody Middle Eastern wars.\n\nTrump says he doesn't have TikTok on his phone, but that could be changing. Leaving his infrastructure event, he was asked whether he's installed the app, which the U.S. government has banned from federal devices due to concerns it could lead to spying by Chinese intelligence agencies.\n\n\"No but I think I might put it there,\" Trump said.He repeated his praise for the platform, which he says helped him perform well with young voters.\"I have a warm spot in my heart for TikTok,\" Trump said.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump tried to ban TikTok, calling it a national security threat ^\n\nTrump's phone has already been hacked by China.\n\nTrump is describing the letter Joe Biden left him in the Resolute Desk.\n\n\"It was a very nice letter,\" Trump tells reporters. \"It was a little bit of an inspirational-type letter,\" he said, with Biden emphasizing \"how important the job is\" and telling him to do a job.\n\nTrump found the letter -- addressed to \"47\" -- while he was signing executive orders in the Oval office Monday in front of a gaggle or reporters and said he'd opened in Monday night.\n\nHe says he is considering releasing it publicly at some point.\n\nTrump was asked whether there is a place for the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers in the \"Make America Great Again\" movement after he granted clemency to some of them, who were among the Jan. 6 rioters.\n\nTrump said, \"Well, we have to see. They've been given a pardon. I thought their sentences were ridiculous and excessive.\"\n\nPresident Trump is defending his decision to pardon people who were charged and convicted of assaulting police officers during the Jan. 6, 2021, U.S. Capitol riot , despite having run as an ally of law enforcement.\n\n\"I am the friend of police, more than any president who's ever been in this office,\" he said.\n\nTrump tells reporters at the White House that those he pardoned have already served years in prison. And he claims murderers often aren't charged for their crimes.\n\n\"We pardoned people who were treated unbelievably poorly,\" he said.\n\nTrump pardoned, commuted the prison sentences or vowed to dismiss the cases of all of the 1,500-plus people charged with crimes connected to the riot on his first day back in office.\n\nPresident Donald Trump says after meeting Tuesday with Republican congressional leaders that the Los Angeles wildfires will make budget talks easier with Democrats.\n\nTrump said the budget talks have in some ways been \"made simpler by Los Angeles because they're going to need a lot of money. And generally speaking, I think you'll find that a lot of Democrats are going to be asking for help.\"\n\nThe president met Tuesday afternoon with House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D.\n\n\"We have a good situation now,\" Trump says on spending plans.\n\nTrump says he'll make the first trip of his second administration on Friday, visiting hurricane-hit parts of western North Carolina before going to Los Angeles and then Nevada.\n\nThe new president vowed federal assistance for the people of Los Angeles after the fires, and said that government funding will continue to flow to North Carolina -- a state he said Democrats \"have abandoned.\"\n\nHe said he'd then visit Nevada to \"thank them for the big vote.\" Trump noted that the state usually votes Democratic in presidential races, and he wanted to mark his November victory there.\n\nFollowing a meeting with President Donald Trump, Senate Republicans are raising the threat of recess appointments for his Cabinet.\n\nSenate Majority Leader John Thune said, \"I think we're going to find out here fairly quickly, you know, whether or not the Democrats want to help us get through some of these nominations in a way that gets us back on track with the way it was done prior to the last two presidencies.\"\n\nThune has pushed for a speedy confirmation process for Trump's Cabinet, yet the new president has also demanded that Republicans be ready to put the Senate into recess, which could allow Trump to appoint Cabinet positions without Senate confirmation.\n\nTrump is announcing a new partnership that has committed to investing at least $500 billion in artificial intelligence infrastructure on his first full day in office.\n\nTrump has been joined by Masayoshi Son of SoftBank, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Larry Ellison of Oracle at the White House.\n\nHe says their new entity, Stargate, will make a \"tremendous investment\" in what he says will be the \"largest AI infrastructure project, by far, in history.\"\n\nHe's calling it \"a resounding declaration of confidence in America's potential\" since he won.\n\nWhile Trump has used similar announcements to show that his presidency is boosting the economy, there were already expectations of a massive buildout in data centers and electricity plants needed for the development of AI.\n\nCongressional Republican leaders emerged from a lengthy hours-long meeting at the White House with plans to push ahead on what Trump has previously called a \"big, beautiful bill\" to hold their priorities.\n\n\"We're moving forward on reconciliation- with one bill,\" said House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La.House and Senate Republicans have been at odds over strategy, with Senate Majority Leader John Thune pushing a two-bill approach but House GOP leaders dug in on a single package.\n\n\"He's got a resolve, you could just see it,\" Scalise said of Trump. \"He came here to really solve the problems that our country's facing, and do it quickly.\"\n\nFormer Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms disputed Trump's assertion that he fired her from the President's Export Council, posting on Instagram a resignation letter she said she sent to Biden on Jan. 4 that said she was resigning from her position effective Monday.\n\n\"You can't fire someone who has already resigned,\" she wrote.\n\nPresident Trump is back in the Oval Office - and the room looks very similar to how it appeared in his first term.\n\nTrump's meeting with Republican congressional leaders has wrapped up.\n\nHouse and Senate leaders including Speaker Mike Johnson and Senate Majority Leader John Thune did not speak to reporters before leaving the White House late Tuesday afternoon.\n\nTrump directed his Justice Department to pause enforcement of the TikTok ban until early April, but a host of questions remain - including whether Trump has the authority to issue such an order and whether TikTok's China-based parent would be amenable to selling the popular social media platform.\n\n▶Read more about the next steps with TikTok\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump used one of the flurry of executive actions that he issued on his first day back in the White House to begin the process of withdrawing the U.S. from the World Health Organization for the second time in less than five years. (AP produced by Javier Arciga)\n\nRight-wing extremists are celebrating Elon Musk's straight-arm gesture during a speech Monday, although his intention wasn't totally clear and some hate watchdogs are saying not to read too much into it.\n\nMusk himself was dismissive of the critics who saw it as a Nazi salute, though he didn't offer further explanation.\n\nBut the confusion and plea for calm hasn't stopped critics and fans alike of the world's richest man from reading into the gesture what they wanted.\n\n▶ Read more about Musk's controversial gesture\n\nMarco Rubio was confirmed by the Senate for secretary of state with unanimous support.\n\nNow comes the hard part that could make or break his tenure: retaining the full backing of his new boss, Donald Trump.\n\n▶ Read more about the challenges Rubio may face\n\nSenate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer is mocking Trump's promise of a \"golden age,\" saying the flurry of executive orders the president signed created a \"golden age\" for big monied interests and law-breaking Jan. 6 rioters.\n\n\"With a flick of a pen, President Trump took steps to make it harder to enroll in health care,\" and \"did nothing, nothing\" for lowering the cost of groceries, housing or other aspects of everyday living, Schumer said.\n\n\"It ain't a golden age for you, average American, that's for sure,\" Schumer said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump will sit down with Fox News Channel host Sean Hannity on Wednesday, the network announced.\n\nHannity, a long-time backer of Trump and his agenda, will tape the appearance from the Oval Office Wednesday and it will air during his show at 9 p.m. Eastern. The network says Trump and Hannity will discuss \"the executive orders he's signed thus far, his first 100 days in office and news of the day.\"\n\nThe Episcopal bishop of Washington used the inaugural prayer service at the Washington National Cathedral Tuesday to directly address President Donald Trump, urging him to \"have mercy\" and compassion for LGBTQ people and undocumented migrant workers.\n\nThe National Treasury Employees Union late Monday filed a lawsuit against the new Trump administration over the President's executive order that reclassifies large numbers of federal employees with the intent of making them at-will workers.\n\nThe lawsuit states that the executive order \"is contrary to Congress's intent in establishing broad protections for most federal employees.\"\n\nNTEU National President Doreen Greenwald said Trump's action \"is a dangerous step backward to a political spoils system that Congress expressly rejected 142 years ago, which is why we are suing to have the order declared unlawful.\"\n\nBolton has been the subject of assassination plots by Iran. He served in Trump's administration for nearly a year and a half as national security adviser before releasing a book in 2020 that was sharply critical of Trump and embarrassing for the president amid his failed reelection effort.\n\n\"I am disappointed but not surprised that President Trump has decided to terminate the protection previously provided by the United States Secret Service,\" Bolton said in a statement.\n\nFILE - In this July 8, 2019, file photo, national security adviser John Bolton speaks at the Christians United for Israel's annual summit, in Washington. (AP Photo/Patrick Semansky, File)\n\nIt's the latest in a string of actions by Trump in his first hours in office to punish political opponents.\n\nPresident Joe Biden extended Secret Service protection to Bolton in 2021 in light of ongoing threats from Iran, and his Justice Department charged an Iranian official a year later with trying to orchestrate a plot of Bolton's life.\n\n\"That threat remains today, as also demonstrated by the recent arrest of someone trying to arrange for President Trump's own assassination,\" Bolton said. \"The American people can judge for themselves which President made the right call.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Tuesday will announce investments worth up to $500 billion for infrastructure tied to artificial intelligence by a new partnership formed by OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank.\n\nOpen AI CEO Sam Altman, center, speaks with boxer Jake Paul and wrestler Logan Paul in Emancipation Hall at the 60th Presidential Inauguration, Monday, Jan. 20, 2025, at the U.S. Capitol in Washington. (Al Drago/Pool Photo via AP)\n\nThe new entity, Stargate, will start building out projects needed for the further development of the fast-evolving AI in Texas, according to the White House.\n\nJoining Trump for the announcement fresh off his inauguration will be Masayoshi Son of SoftBank, Sam Altman of OpenAI and Larry Ellison of Oracle.\n\nSpeaking at the World Economic Forum annual meeting in Davos, Switzerland, Gov. Andy Beshear said any policies that jeopardize jobs, health care, safety, schools and other \"issues that the American people are worried about ... that's when we should be pushing back.\"\n\nHe expressed concerns about the prospect that tariffs - which Trump has promised - could drive up prices, recalling how retaliatory tariffs against U.S. goods in the president's first term affected products like Kentucky bourbon.\n\n\"That was hundreds of millions of dollars of negative economic impact that we are still feeling that cost jobs - that that cost us in exports,\" Beshear said.\n\nTrump returning from inaugural prayer service, says 'they could do much better'\n\nEighteen states, plus the District of Columbia and San Francisco sued in federal court to block Trump's order.\n\nNew Jersey Democratic Attorney General Matt Platkin said Tuesday the president cannot undo a right written into the Constitution with a stroke of his pen.\n\n\"Presidents have broad power but they are not kings,\" Platkin said.\n\nNot long after Trump signed the order, immigrant rights groups filed suit to stop it.\n\nChapters of the American Civil Liberties Union in New Hampshire, Maine and Massachusetts along with other immigrant rights advocates filed a suit in New Hampshire federal court. The suit asks the court to find the order to be unconstitutional.\n\nThe 14th Amendment did not always guarantee birthright citizenship to all U.S.-born people. Congress didn't authorize citizenship for all Native Americans born in the United States, for instance, until 1924.\n\nIn 1898, an important birthright citizenship case unfolded in the U.S. Supreme Court. The court held that Wong Kim Ark, who was born in San Francisco to Chinese immigrants, was a U.S. citizen because he was born in the country. After a trip abroad, he had faced denied reentry by the federal government on the grounds that he wasn't a citizen under the Chinese Exclusion Act.\n\nBut some advocates of immigration restrictions have argued that while the case clearly applied to children born to parents who are both legal immigrants, it's less clear whether it applies to children born to parents without legal status.\n\nBirthright citizenship means anyone born in the U.S. is a citizen, regardless of their parents' immigration status. People, for instance, in the United States on a tourist or other visa or in the country illegally can become the parents of a citizen if their child is born here.\n\nIt's been in place for decades and enshrined in the 14th Amendment to the Constitution , supporters say. But Trump and allies dispute the reading of the amendment and say there need to be tougher standards on becoming a citizen.\n\nTrump moved to end birthright citizenship when he ordered the cancellation of the constitutional guarantee that U.S.-born children are citizens regardless of their parents' status.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday ordered that no federal officer, employee or agent may unconstitutionally abridge the free speech of any American citizen. AP's Ali Swenson breaks down what this early step toward one of his many campaign promises means.\n\nFresh off his trip to the inauguration, New York City Mayor Eric Adams said he had instructed officials to lawfully cooperate with Trump's agenda around immigration and other issues, while flatly refusing to criticize the president or any of his policies.\n\n\"I'm not going to be warring with the president,\" Adams told reporters. \"I'm going to be working with the president.\"\n\nNew York Mayor Eric Adams watches the 60th Presidential Inauguration from Emancipation Hall in the U.S. Capitol in Washington, Monday, Jan. 20, 2025. (Angelina Katsanis/Pool Photo Photo via AP)\n\nAdams was elected as a Democrat and previously criticized the \"abusive rhetoric and tactics\" of the first Trump era. But he has increasingly embraced Trump in recent months, raising speculation that he is angling for a pardon in his federal case on bribery and campaign finance charges.\n\nOn Tuesday, Adams declined to say whether he opposed Trump's executive orders that pardoned Jan. 6 defendants, revoked birthright citizenship and withdrew the U.S. from the Paris climate agreement. And he repeatedly ducked questions about how the city would respond to large-scale immigration raids promised by Trump.\n\n\"You shouldn't start out the gate criticizing,\" Adams said. \"You should start trying to collaborate, trying to cooperate.\"\n\nIt came as Rubio took the helm of the State Department just hours after taking the oath of office.\n\nTrump's first confirmed cabinet appointment, Rubio entered the department through its main entrance to loud applause and cheers before addressing his new employees in the same lobby in which former Secretary of State Antony Blinken delivered farewell remarks to the building Friday.\n\n\"The voters decide the course of our nation, both domestically and abroad, and they have elected Donald J. Trump as our president when it comes to foreign policy on a very clear mission,\" Rubio said. \"And that mission is to ensure that our foreign policy is centered on one thing, and that is the advancement of our national interest, which (was) clearly defined through his campaign as anything that makes us stronger or safer or more prosperous.\"\n\nTrump has been publicly skeptical of the value of the State Department since his first term in office and, as he has done with with other agencies, accused some in the diplomatic corps of working to blunt or derail his policy priorities.\n\nSome senators are urging Collins to fight the federal hiring freeze Trump declared Monday, saying it will sap the Department of Veterans Affairs' ability to provide medical care or even run veteran cemeteries.\n\n\"This hiring freeze should not apply to direct care workers,\" said Maine Sen. Angus King, an independent who caucuses with Democrats.\n\nDoug Collins, President Donald Trump's pick to be Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, speaks at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nSen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, noted the text of the order says it won't adversely affect Social Security, Medicare and veterans benefits. He asked Collins whether that meant the VA was exempt from the freeze. Collins said he's still examining what it means \"but we support the president's initiative in this phase.\"\n\nCollins also said he believes there are numerous opportunities to streamline the VA, but said Trump will protect care.\n\n\"I was told by the president to take care of veterans,\" Collins said. \"We're going to take care of veterans.\"\n\nSpeaking at a Federalist Society forum Tuesday, John Yoo, a University of California law professor and former government official who's promoted the idea of expansive presidential authority, said Trump's decision to allow TikTok to continue to operate, for now, appears to run afoul of the law that called for it to shut down by Sunday. The law gave the president the authority to extend the deadline, but Yoo noted that the window when that was allowed had closed by the time Trump took office and signed the order.\n\nYoo also said the order to end birthright citizenship appears to be unconstitutional. And sending to the military to seal the southern border may have gone too far, he said, because it relies on the premise that the U.S. is being invaded.\n\nMontana Attorney General Austin Knudsen said during the forum that the state could consider suing the Trump administration to try to undo Trump's executive order allowing TikTok to continue operating.\n\nDoug Collins, President Donald Trump's pick to be Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs, speaks at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee, at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Jan. 21, 2025. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nCollins says he supports giving veterans access to private medical care but is disavowing any intention to privatize or dismantle the existing VA health system.\n\n\"There will always be a VA health system for the veteran\" Collins said. But he says the VA \"exists for the veterans\" and that particularly newer veterans may prefer private providers.\n\nDemocrats are urging Collins to protect the current system, saying it provides valuable expertise. But some Republicans in particular say it should be easier for veterans to access private medical care because of long distances.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Nell Redmond)\n\nHe's sold Bibles , sneakers , photo books and cryptocurrency during his third campaign for president. Now, Donald Trump is launching a new business venture: diamond-encrusted watches.\n\nThe Republican presidential candidate unveiled the \"Official Trump Watch Collection\" on Thursday. The most expensive, listed as including 122 diamonds on its bezel and available in three 18-karat gold styles, costs $100,000. Another \"Fight Fight Fight\" model is listed at $499.\n\nTrump has hawked a series of branded products since he launched his 2024 White House campaign, following his long tradition of melding his political and business interests. Thursday's launch, coming 40 days before Election Day, could open him up to criticism about monetizing his campaign, particularly as he makes an argument that Vice President Kamala Harris is out of touch with Americans' economic struggles.\n\nWhile websites for the various products note that proceeds from their sales do not directly benefit Trump or his campaign, they also note that each is subject to a \"paid license agreement.\" That's the same mechanism that allowed Trump, well before he entered politics, to profit for years from sales of everything from water, vodka and steaks.\n\nEarlier this week, he announced the sale of $100 silver coins bearing his face. In March, ahead of Easter, Trump released a video on Truth Social urging his supporters to spend $59.99 for a \"God Bless the USA Bible,\" inspired by country singer Lee Greenwood's patriotic ballad. Trump takes the stage to the song at each of his rallies and has appeared with Greenwood at events.\n\nIn February, he hawked new Trump-branded sneakers at \"Sneaker Con,\" a gathering that bills itself as the \"The Greatest Sneaker Show on Earth.\" The shoes, shiny gold high tops with an American flag detail on the back, are being sold as \"Never Surrender High-Tops\" for $399 on a new website that also sells other Trump-branded shoes and \"Victory47\" cologne and perfume for $99 a bottle.\n\nTrump has also dabbled in NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, and last year reported earning between $100,000 and $1 million from a series of digital trading cards that portrayed him in cartoon-like images, including as an astronaut, a cowboy and a superhero.\n\nSome of those items, including the coins, sneakers and Bibles, were listed as affiliated with CIC Ventures LLC, a company that Trump reported owning in his 2023 financial disclosure, has a similar arrangement with 45Footwear, which also says it uses Trump's \"name, likeness and image under paid license from CIC Ventures LLC, which license may be terminated or revoked according to its terms.\"\n\nThe items have gone up for sale in the wake of a $489 million civil fraud judgment against the former president, which a New York appellate court on Thursday appeared to be open to reducing or reversing.\n\nAccording to a disclaimer on a sales website, the watches are covered by a similar agreement to license Trump's name, image and likeness, and proceeds from their sales do not go to Trump's campaign or the Trump Organization and \"are not designed, manufactured, distributed or sold by Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization or any of their respective affiliates or principals.\"\n\nInstead, TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC - the company listed as the sales entity - says it uses the \"'Trump' name, image and likeness under a paid license agreement which may be terminated or revoked according to its terms. Trump Watches are intended as collectible items for individual enjoyment only, not for investment purposes.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the Trump campaign referred questions about the licensing deal to the Trump Organization, which did not immediately return a message seeking comment. TheBestWatchesonEarth LLC also did not immediately respond to an inquiry on the deal via its website.\n\n___\n\nMeg Kinnard reported from Chapin, South Carolina, and can be reached at http://x.com/MegKinnardAP\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

All Rights Reserved.\n\nThis cover image released by St. Martin's Press shows \"How to Think Like Socrates: Ancient Philosophy as a Way of Life in the Modern World\" by Donald J. Robertson. (St. Martin's Press via AP)\n\nThis cover image released by St. Martin's Press shows \"How to Think Like Socrates: Ancient Philosophy as a Way of Life in the Modern World\" by Donald J. Robertson. (St. Martin's Press via AP)\n\nThe lessons of Socrates have never really gone out of style, but if there's ever a perfect time to revisit the ancient philosopher, now is it.\n\nIn \"How to Think Like Socrates: Ancient Philosophy as a Way of Life in the Modern World,\" Donald J. Robertson describes Socrates' Athens in terms that seem all too familiar: a society recovering from a pandemic where people's trust in government is shaken, and an extremely polarized split between political factions.\n\nDespite its title, Robertson's book isn't solely a self-help guide based on ancient philosophy. Robertson's book is certainly easier than slogging through Plato and multiple volumes of ancient Greek history.\n\nBut the book is inconsistent and difficult to follow sometimes, as it bounces from an easy distillation of Socrates' philosophy to an all-too-detailed history of ancient Greece. Some of the history is understandably needed to give context to Socrates, but often it feels as though Robertson is writing two separate books for two different audiences.\n\nThe explanation of Socrates, particularly a section walking readers through the Socratic Method - the question-based method Socrates used to teach students - is the strongest portion of Robertson's book. The book offers a solid biography of Socrates and his times, but it could use some work weaving in the modern-day application of his lessons.\n\nRobertson easily demonstrates throughout the book how Socratic philosophy can be used for addressing fear, including anxiety over death. His lessons on how to defend ourselves against rhetoric are particularly timely in an era of rampant misinformation.\n\nRobertson also successfully explains to readers why they should be skeptical of the sweeping generalizations offered by self-help books.\n\n\"Wisdom requires being able to identify when a rule no longer holds true, and good advice becomes bad advice,\" he writes.\n\nThrough Robertson is able to underscore how timeless Socrates' advice remains, his book could stand to be more accessible for readers hoping to find that advice.\n\n___\n\nAP book reviews: https://apnews.com/hub/book-reviews\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Trump takes the stage to the song at each of his rallies and has appeared with Greenwood at events.\n\n\"Happy Holy Week! Let's Make America Pray Again. As we lead into Good Friday and Easter, I encourage you to get a copy of the God Bless the USA Bible,\" Trump wrote, directing his supporters to a website selling the book for $59.99.\n\nThe effort comes as Trump has faced a serious money crunch amid mounting legal bills while he fights four criminal indictments along with a series of civil charges. Trump was given a reprieve Monday when a New York appeals court agreed to hold off on collecting the more than $454 million he owes following a civil fraud judgment if he puts up $175 million within 10 days. Trump has already posted a $92 million bond in connection with defamation cases brought by the writer E. Jean Carroll , who accused Trump of sexual assault.\n\n\"All Americans need a Bible in their home, and I have many. It's my favorite book,\" Trump said in the video posted on Truth Social. \"I'm proud to endorse and encourage you to get this Bible. We must make America pray again.\"\n\nThis story is featured in our One Notable Number series , which spotlights the key numbers leading our coverage.\n\nTake a look at more Notable Numbers here.\n\nYou can also read more ONEs:\n\nBilling itself as \"the only Bible endorsed by President Trump!\" the new venture's website calls it \"Easy-to-read\" with \"large print\" and a \"slim design\" that \"invites you to explore God's Word anywhere, any time.\"\n\nBesides a King James Version translation, it includes copies of the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights, the Declaration of Independence and the Pledge of Allegiance, as well as a handwritten chorus of the famous Greenwood song.\n\nThe Bible is just the latest commercial venture that Trump has pursued while campaigning.\n\nLast month, he debuted a new line of Trump-branded sneakers , including $399 gold \"Never Surrender High-Tops,\" at Sneaker Con in Philadelphia. The venture behind the shoes, 45Footwear, also sells other Trump-branded footwear, cologne and perfume.\n\nTrump has also dabbled in NFTs, or nonfungible tokens, and last year reported earning between $100,000 and $1 million from a series of digital trading cards that portrayed him in cartoon-like images, including as an astronaut, a cowboy and a superhero.\n\nWhat to know about Trump's hush money trial:\n\nHe has also released books featuring photos of his time in office and letters written to him through the years.\n\nThe Bible's website states the product \"is not political and has nothing to do with any political campaign.\"\n\n\"GodBlessTheUSABible.com is not owned, managed or controlled by Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization, CIC Ventures LLC or any of their respective principals or affiliates,\" it says.\n\nInstead, it says, \"GodBlessTheUSABible.com uses Donald J. Trump's name, likeness and image under paid license from CIC Ventures LLC, which license may be terminated or revoked according to its terms.\"\n\nCIC Ventures LLC, a company that Trump reported owning in his 2023 financial disclosure, has a similar arrangement with 45Footwear, which also says it uses Trump's \"name, likeness and image under paid license from CIC Ventures LLC, which license may be terminated or revoked according to its terms.\"\n\nA Trump spokesperson and God Bless the USA Bible did not immediately respond to questions about how much Trump was paid for the licensing deal or stands to make from each book sale.\n\nTrump remains deeply popular with white evangelical Christians , who are among his most ardent supporters, even though the thrice-married former reality TV star has a long history of behavior that often seemed at odds with teachings espoused by Christ in the Gospels.\n\nWhen he was running in 2016, Trump raised eyebrows when he cited \"Two Corinthians\" at Liberty University, instead of the standard \"Second Corinthians.\"\n\nWhen asked to share his favorite Bible verse in an interview with Bloomberg Politics in 2015, he demurred.\n\n\"I wouldn't want to get into it. Because to me, that's very personal,\" he said. \"The Bible means a lot to me, but I don't want to get into specifics.\"\n\nWhen he was president, law enforcement officers aggressively removed racial justice protesters from a park near the White House, allowing Trump to walk to nearby St. John's Church, where he stood alone and raised a Bible. The scene was condemned at the time by the bishop of the Episcopal Diocese of Washington.\n\nBefore he ran for office, Trump famously hawked everything from frozen steaks to vodka to a venture named Trump University, which was later sued for fraud .\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "Hypocrisy, Spinelessness, and the Triumph of Donald Trump\n\nHe said Republican politicians would be easy to break. He was right.\n\nListen to more stories on curio\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here .\n\nI n the summer of 2015 , back when he was still talking to traitorous reporters like me, I spent extended stretches with Donald Trump. He was in the early phase of his first campaign for president, though he had quickly made himself the inescapable figure of that race-as he would in pretty much every Republican contest since. We would hop around his various clubs, buildings, holding rooms, limos, planes, golf carts, and mob scenes, Trump disgorging his usual bluster, slander, flattery, and obvious lies. The diatribes were exhausting and disjointed.\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nBut I was struck by one theme that Trump kept pounding on over and over: that he was used to dealing with \"brutal, vicious killers\"-by which he meant his fellow ruthless operators in showbiz, real estate, casinos, and other big-boy industries. In contrast, he told me, politicians are saps and weaklings.\n\n\"I will roll over them,\" he boasted, referring to the flaccid field of Republican challengers he was about to debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library that September. They were \"puppets,\" \"not strong people.\" He welcomed their contempt, he told me, because that would make his turning them into supplicants all the more humiliating.\n\n\"They might speak badly about me now, but they won't later,\" Trump said. They like to say they are \"public servants,\" he added, his voice dripping with derision at the word servant . But they would eventually submit to him and fear him. They would \"evolve,\" as they say in politics. \"It will be very easy; I can make them evolve,\" Trump told me. \"They will evolve.\"\n\nLike most people who'd been around politics for a while, I was dubious. And wrong. They evolved.\n\nJ. D. Vance: Donald Trump is an opioid for the masses\n\n\"I've never seen anything like it,\" Trump told me the following spring, as he was completing his romp to the 2016 nomination. We were talking on the phone, and Trump had just wrapped up a rally in Anaheim, California. Former Texas Governor Rick Perry had recently endorsed him, despite dismissing Trump earlier as a \"cancer on conservatism\" and \"a barking carnival act.\"\n\n\"He made a statement saying something like I'm 'the smartest guy ever to run for office,' \" Trump told me (Perry didn't say exactly that , but close). \"How do you get from 'cancer on the party' to that? I get it, I get it; it's how politicians are. But I couldn't do that.\"\n\nTrump accepted Perry's support, and then promptly taunted him. \"He was going [around] saying the worst things about me!\" Trump said at the Anaheim rally. \"I have never seen people able to pivot like politicians.\"\n\n\"It's happening with all of them,\" Trump said. \"Lindsey Graham just called and was very nice ... even though he used to say the worst things.\" (Graham had called Trump, among other not-nice things, \" a race-baiting, xenophobic religious bigot \" and \"a kook.\") Soon enough, the last holdouts would come around too. \"It's just so easy, how they do that,\" Trump said.\n\nAs went individual Republican politicians, so went the party. Reince Priebus, the chair of the Republican National Committee in 2016, would become frustrated with Trump over his obvious scorn for his organization. Still, Priebus would gamely try to assure me that the GOP was shaped not by one man but rather by a set of traditions, principles, and conservative ideals. \"The party defines the party,\" Priebus kept telling me.\n\nAfter Trump won the nomination in 2016, \"The party defines the party\" became a familiar feckless refrain among the GOP's putative leaders. House Speaker Paul Ryan vowed to me that he would \"protect conservatism from being disfigured.\" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told the radio host Hugh Hewitt that \"Trump is not going to change the institution,\" referring to the GOP. \"He's not going to change the basic philosophy of the party.\"\n\nIn retrospect, this was hilarious.\n\nBy the second night of the 2024 Republican National Convention at Milwaukee's Fiserv Forum in July, some attendees had started showing up with a gauze pad slapped over their right ears, a tribute to the boxy white dressing Trump wore to cover the injury he'd suffered in an attempt on his life in Pennsylvania just days earlier.\n\nThe near miss had cast a peculiar aura over Trump's jubilee in Milwaukee. For one thing, the bloodshed reaffirmed the popular Republican notion that Trump is a uniquely marked and defiant figure, as reflected by the T-shirts being sold depicting the wounded nominee raising his fist (as well as the still-fashionable mug-shot merchandise). But I spoke with several convention-goers who appeared stunned into a heightened sense of vulnerability by the event: Trump's physical vulnerability, yes, but perhaps something shared as well. One could view the ear bandages in the crowd as a communal gesture of humanity, or even empathy.\n\nFrom the January/February 2024 issue: Trump voters are America too\n\nWhatever was behind them, the ear accessories quickly spread through the crowd and became ubiquitous. In a sense, the entire Republican Party has become an accessory. To no one's surprise, everything in Milwaukee revolved around its unavoidable protagonist, \"our 45th and soon-to-be 47th president, Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nOn the first night of the convention, Trump made what would become his familiar WWE-style entrance. His head filled the big screen as the Republicans' official cantor, Lee \"God Bless the U.S.A.\" Greenwood, provided the walk-up sermon. \"Prayer works,\" Greenwood called out as Trump stood in the wings. And God ensured, \"as Donald Trump turned his head just slightly, that the bullet missed him just enough.\" Trump was then seen on-screen doing a quick twirl of his finger, the universal gesture for Let's get on with this .\n\n\"We have believed for so long that God will make some changes in this country,\" Greenwood continued. (This was a few days before the other party's God, Joe Biden's \"Lord Almighty,\" would finally get through the White House switchboard.) Greenwood persisted in bestowing his blessings until Trump could wait no longer and began his slow walk onto the convention floor.\n\nThe roar was colossal. Trump waved and clapped for himself. Everyone he passed stepped back in reflexive obedience, or awe. I'd been watching Trump's adulators work the arena all week, trying to outdo one another. \"My fellow Americans,\" Senator Marco Rubio said from the podium while Trump-his Audience of One-squinted up at him like a building inspector. As with many other brand-name Republicans in the arena, Rubio had once despised Trump. He ran against him for president in 2016. It got ornery. Rubio implied that Trump had a small penis; Trump derided Rubio as \"Liddle Marco\" and called him \"weak like a baby.\" That last assessment held up well.\n\n\"The only way to make America wealthy and safe and strong again is to make Donald J. Trump our president again,\" Rubio declaimed from the podium. Trump nodded along from his center box, radiating pride of ownership-Liddle Marco had grown up so beautifully.\n\nNot all that long ago, Rubio had told me that \"we should not have cults of personality\" in the U.S. His parents and grandparents had fled dictatorship in Cuba. Their journey made him appreciate the gift of freedom and the danger of strongmen.\n\nI talked a lot with Rubio in the last days of the 2016 primary, back when he was happy to speak candidly about Trump, and about how he knew better than to entrust the leadership of the United States to a \"fraud,\" \"lunatic,\" and \"con artist\" with autocratic instincts. And they all knew better-the Rubios, the Ted Cruzes, the J. D. Vances, the Doug Burgums, the Nikki Haleys, the Mitch McConnells, the Vivek Ramaswamys, all of them. They probably still know better. But they are all expedient, to their political core. \"If you don't want to get reelected,\" Graham once told me, \" you're in the wrong business .\"\n\nFor years, many had predicted a reckoning, a shared realization that the noisy, grievance-packed redoubt that the GOP had become-marked by servile devotion to one man-was perhaps not aligned with the party's best traditions of rugged, free-thinking individualists. \"Anytime a leader builds an entire movement around himself, it almost always leads to disaster,\" Rubio had told me.\n\nAfter so many party defections, electoral defeats, and broken spirits, surely some Republican self-correction was inevitable. But although there have been flashes, they haven't lasted. I've heard all the private doubts about Trump from his most public of validators. These private doubts were once very public. \"Mark my words, there will be prominent people in American politics who will spend years explaining to people how they fell into this,\" Rubio told The New York Times in 2016 , right before he \"fell into this\" himself.\n\n\"I don't think so,\" Doug Burgum, the North Dakota governor, said during his Republican-primary campaign last year, when asked whether he would ever do business with Trump. \"I just think it's important that you're judged by the company you keep.\" Within a few months, however, Burgum would be eager to tell everyone what regular company he was keeping with Trump. \"It's been a real honor for Kathryn and I to have spent as much time with the president as we have,\" Burgum said in June as he was auditioning to be Trump's running mate.\n\nI'd thought that maybe 2024 would be the year the GOP finally began some semblance of a post-Trump future. At the very least, new voices of resistance had to finally assert themselves .\n\n\"I feel no need to kiss the ring,\" Nikki Haley, Trump's most competitive primary challenger in 2024, had vowed in February. Haley even made what passed for a subversive remark in her convention speech, when she said that not everyone agrees with Trump all of the time. \"That's their problem,\" someone yelled out from the crowd.\n\nBut the ring, it would be kissed. \"Donald Trump has my strong endorsement, period,\" Haley said.\n\nI ran into former Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson on the arena concourse. He was one of the only Republican-primary challengers who dared question Trump's worldview. His campaign had gone nowhere, but Hutchinson held relatively firm. \"I'm troubled,\" Hutchinson told me. \"I don't want our party to be defined by attacks on our judiciary system. I don't want it to be defined by anger.\"\n\nHutchinson had previously distinguished himself as one of the few Republicans to have held elected office who said he would not vote for Trump. \"I've made some commitments about not voting for a convicted felon,\" Hutchinson conceded to ABC News later at the convention. Then he softened his position. \"But that seems like a long time ago.\"\n\nAlso a long time ago: the 2016 Republican convention in Cleveland, where Ted Cruz had delivered his plucky \"vote your conscience\" speech in defiance of Trump, whom Cruz had called \"utterly amoral\" and \"a sniveling coward.\"\n\n\"God Bless Donald J. Trump\" is how Cruz's speech in Milwaukee began. \"Let me start by giving thanks to God Almighty for protecting President Trump,\" he said, while the bandaged Almighty himself preened up at the sniveling coward onstage, who would follow him anywhere.\n\nBiden's defeat of Trump in 2020 had seemed certain to weaken Trump's grip on the Republican Party, if not end his political career. No relevant precedent existed for any one-term president to become his party's default front-runner in the next election. Especially not an extremely unpopular one-term president who lost by 7 million votes, refused to concede, incited a lethal insurrection in an attempt to overturn the result, was impeached for a second time, defied long-honored tradition by skipping the swearing-in of his successor, left behind a traumatized nation (with 25,000 National Guard troops defending the capital against his own supporters), became the first former president to be indicted ... and the rest of the whole loser litany.\n\nYet the speed with which Trump has settled back into easy dominance of his party has been both remarkable and entirely foreseeable-foreseen, in fact, by Trump himself. Because if there's been one recurring lesson of the Trump-era GOP, it's this: Never underestimate the durability of a demagogue with a captive base, a desperate will to keep going, and-perhaps most of all-a feeble and terrified opposition of spineless ciphers (\"weak like a baby\").\n\n\"You know what I liked about Trump?\" Lindsey Graham asked, waxing nostalgic about the former president-and yearning for his return-during a speech in Nashville in 2022. \"Everyone was afraid of him. Including me.\" It was a killer line, Graham in his amiable-mascot mode. It would also suffice as a preview of the 2024 Republican presidential primaries. \"Resistance\" to Trump, lame as it was, had become an inside joke among the party faithful.\n\nTrump's last remaining primary challenger, Haley, quit the race on March 6. That same day, Mitch McConnell-who had criticized the then-president for his \"disgraceful\" conduct on January 6, 2021-endorsed Trump. Two days later, the spring meeting of the Republican National Committee, in Houston, featured a final address by the outgoing chair, Ronna McDaniel.\n\nMcDaniel can get a little weepy at times, especially during goodbyes-or, in her case, an eviction. She started the job in 2017, the day before Trump delivered his mood-setting \"American carnage\" speech at his inauguration. She had done her best for Trump, taken so much of his abuse and carried so much of his water. She sacrificed her dignity, her reputation, her future employment prospects-even her dynastic family surname, Romney, because Uncle Mitt had fully established himself as a MAGA infidel.\n\nThe granddaughter of a Republican governor of Michigan (George Romney) and niece of her party's last pre-Trump nominee (Mitt), McDaniel was always the wrong nepo baby for this dynasty. Yet she tried to adapt. She said all the right things and made herself MAGA-friendly and reliable, enough to persuade Trump to make her his RNC chair.\n\nEven then, McDaniel had to know that an inelegant end would come, as it usually does for even Trump's most fervent flunkies and flatterers. She steadied herself at the podium on the fourth floor of the Hilton Americas-Houston, acknowledged her family, and gave a special nod to her staff. \"Thank you for all your hard work to send our candidate, Donald J. Trump, back to the White House,\" she said. A few RNC employees wiped away tears. They were surely aware that their own days were numbered in this consolidating family business.\n\nSure enough, 60 RNC staffers would quickly be axed by the incoming regime, executed by the new RNC co-chairs, Michael Whatley and-the real new boss-Lara Trump, Eric Trump's wife, who had been handpicked by the holy father (in-law) himself.\n\nThe message was clear: \"That Republican Party, frankly, no longer exists,\" Donald Trump Jr. gloated on Newsmax the day of the RNC staff purges. \"The moves that happened today-that's the final blow. People have to understand that ... the MAGA movement is the new Republican Party.\"\n\nLara Trump rose from her seat, slim, cocksure, and angular in the classic style of the family wives. Her father-in-law called Lara \"his most valuable asset,\" the Maryland committeeman David Bossie would say in his speech seconding her. She was fully fluent in the family language: victimhood. How unfair it all is. All of the witch hunts. \"The scales are always tipped against him,\" the new co-chair would later tell Sean Hannity on Fox News. \"It's rigged so heavily.\"\n\n\"Since the day my father-in-law came down the golden escalator-everyone remembers that famous day-this has never just been about each of us as individuals,\" she said in her acceptance speech in Houston. \"It is about us as a family, and it's been about our country.\"\n\n\"This isn't about just right versus left, Republican versus Democrat,\" she said. \"It's about good versus evil.\"\n\nThese were big stakes indeed. Heads nodded in every row as Lara gazed upon the crowd, and her voice softened in reverence.\n\n\"I'd be remiss,\" she said, \"if I didn't thank President Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nShe would never be remiss.\n\nAfter Lara's speech, I made a quick sweep of the place in search of McDaniel, but she had disappeared, possibly never to be seen again.\n\nAs I left the Hilton, I ran into Ron Kaufman, a Republican committeeman from Massachusetts. I was surprised to find that Kaufman, a vestige of the pre-Trump party-he served in George H. W. Bush's administration-was still involved with the RNC. As it would turn out, he would not be there much longer: Kaufman was voted off by the MAGA-fied committee a month later.\n\nHe had to have seen this coming. Kaufman remained close to Mitt Romney and, unlike McDaniel, did nothing to hide this association. After Houston, Kaufman told me, he was heading down to Florida to celebrate Romney's 77th birthday, not far-geographically, anyway-from Mar-a-Lago, where Trump would be receiving a dear friend of his own the same weekend: Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, an authoritarian whom Trump hailed as the best leader in the world.\n\nKaufman told me he was fine with Trump, explaining to me in the common parlance of a practiced Trump apologist that \"not everybody likes his style.\"\n\n\"Don't you have any ambivalence at all about Trump?\" I asked.\n\n\"I have ambivalence about my first wife,\" Kaufman replied.\n\nThis was not an answer I was expecting.\n\n\"But you probably wouldn't vote for her as president, either,\" I said. \"Or would you?\"\n\nI include this exchange because it typifies how some longtime Republican officials-clearly uneasy about Trump-can become comically evasive whenever asked about him. I interviewed several who veered straight into spheroid equivocation.\n\nGeorgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, whom Trump famously tried to strong-arm to \"find 11,780 votes\" to overturn Biden's 2020 victory in the state, seemed especially anxious when I had breakfast with him in Atlanta in May. \"Why are you so afraid of saying what you really feel about Trump?\" I asked.\n\n\"Because no one gives me the platform to do that,\" he replied.\n\n\"But I just did,\" I said.\n\n\"That's not the platform,\" Raffensperger said, looking down at the phone on which I was recording our discussion.\n\n(Raffensperger's communications aide then jumped in, effectively shutting down whatever platform this was or wasn't.)\n\nThe night before, which happened to be primary night in Georgia, I'd attended an election watch party hosted by Mike Dugan, a former Republican majority leader in the state senate who was running for an open congressional seat near the Alabama border.\n\n\"Does anything about Trump give you pause?\" I'd asked him.\n\n\"Oh yeah, I don't want to hang out with him,\" Dugan had told me, adding that he likes many of Trump's policies.\n\nBut what about all of the outrage, distraction, and controversy Trump tends to generate?\n\n\"He's not asking me to come play golf with him,\" Dugan had explained to me.\n\n\"What if he did ask?\"\n\n\"I'm not a golfer.\"\n\nUnluckily for Dugan, his main Republican rival for the congressional seat, Brian Jack, used to work for Trump in the White House. Back in March, Trump had traveled to Rome, Georgia, for a rally in which he would praise Jack as \"a fighter\" and \"a MAGA man.\"\n\nJack seemed like a savvy operative with good political instincts (proof: he did not respond to my texts). \"I am both humbled and honored to earn your endorsement,\" he said at the rally for the man he called \"the greatest president and political athlete of all time.\" As someone who has hung around Trump a lot, Jack knew enough to focus on the boss's main erogenous zone: his golf game. Trump appears to reserve special appreciation for those attendants who are willing to exult in his alleged physical prowess-right out of the authoritarian playbook of the bare-chested and robust Vladimir Putin on horseback.\n\n\"I'm not sure if I should say this,\" Jack said faux-sheepishly, \"but, just a few weeks ago, President Trump put to shame two professional golfers.\" He then revealed that Trump had shot a 70 on 18 holes. This sounded impressive, I thought, though not as impressive as the 11 holes in one that the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Il shot in the first golf game he ever played (source: North Korean state media, 1994).\n\nAlthough Jack was not yet well known in this heavily Republican district, he was \"Trump-endorsed\"-all the yard signs said so-which is akin to a golden ticket in today's GOP. (Jack wound up winning the primary by a large margin.) The path always starts with a beeline to Trump's rump. As Florida Governor Ron DeSantis observed in January: \"You can be the most worthless Republican in America, but if you kiss the ring, he'll say you're wonderful.\"\n\nIn 2022, J. D. Vance proved himself a master. Although the Senate candidate from Ohio had previously dismissed Trump as \"noxious,\" \"reprehensible,\" and \"cultural heroin,\" among other things, he worked to convince Trump that he was reformed. Trump may or may not have believed him, but he very much relished the grovel of it.\n\n\"J.D. is kissing my ass. He wants my support so bad!\" Trump bragged at a campaign stop with Vance in Youngstown in 2022. He also claimed that Vance had fallen \"in love\" with him. If anything, this is the fun part for Trump: showing off that he has snapped up another politician like a distressed condo asset. He had made another Republican candidate-a rich Ivy League ex-Marine, no less-self-emasculate on his behalf.\n\nThey all wore red ties, or most of them did. Fat and long, the signature Trumpian garments hung just below their belts. It was not clear whether Trump himself cared (he probably did; such an honor!), but dressing in the boss's full uniform-white shirt, navy suit, and the signature neckwear-was an added curtsy. If Trump had a mustache, his acolytes would all grow and groom one just like his-as Baath Party loyalists did for Saddam Hussein.\n\nThey made their pilgrimage to the Manhattan Criminal Courthouse, where Trump spent a good part of May facing 34 criminal counts stemming from his ill-fated attempt to hide a $130,000 payment to his alleged porno paramour. The acolytes flanked their victim/defendant on the 15th floor as he sat with his arms crossed, jacket open, and eyes closed through prolonged stretches. \"I do have a lot of surrogates, and they are speaking very beautifully,\" Trump bragged during one of his news conferences.\n\nMy visit to 100 Centre Street coincided with the arrival of a large retinue of Trump's defenders: 11 Republican House members made the trip that Thursday. They would take turns decrying (\"very beautifully\") the \"political persecution\" that was taking place and the travesty of how Biden had \"weaponized\" the courts against the \"greatest president in history.\" I waited for the House members at a park across the street from the courthouse, along with a daily clot of reporters and camerapeople, clusters of pro- and anti-Trump demonstrators, and some bemused tourists, most of them from other countries, who had no idea what they'd stumbled upon.\n\n\"Standing back and standing by, Mr. President,\" said Representative Matt Gaetz, the poofy-haired provocateur from Florida who led that day's brownnoser brigade. Gaetz's words, which appeared on X, intentionally echoed Trump's from the 2020 debate where he'd been asked to condemn neofascist groups who had been disrupting some of that summer's Black Lives Matter protests. \"Proud Boys, stand back and stand by\" is how Trump responded to the debate question, less a call for restraint than a call to action. (\"A dog whistle through a bullhorn\" is how Kamala Harris described it at the time.)\n\nEach of the Trump toadies in attendance outside the courthouse said their piece about the towering injustice that was occurring inside. Trump is \"in good spirits,\" Representative Anna Paulina Luna of Florida reported, while Gaetz complained that their hero was facing \"the Mr. Potato Head doll of crimes,\" which is not technically a legal classification, by the way.\n\nA group of New York hecklers greeted the traveling-circus caucus with Bronx cheers. One man stood behind the field-trippers holding a Bootlickers sign.\n\n\"Lies, lies,\" the hecklers cried out.\n\n\"Get the fuck out of New York!\"\n\n\"Go to fucking hell!\"\n\n\"Matt Gaetz is a pedophile!\"\n\nRepresentative Lauren Boebert of Colorado started to speak but was interrupted by chants of \"Beetlejuice, Beetlejuice,\" which, for the uninitiated, referred to an incident at a Denver theater in September 2023 when Boebert was evicted from the musical comedy for performing a series of infractions in her seat: vaping, giggling, and fondling her date below the belt.\n\nStraining to be heard over the hecklers, Boebert vowed that neither Trump nor his supporters would be gagged. \"President Trump is not going anywhere ... And we are not going anywhere, either.\"\n\nA few minutes later, they were all gone.\n\nBoebert saved her best work for that night back at the Capitol, where the House Oversight Committee held a session to debate contempt charges against Attorney General Merrick Garland. (Originally scheduled for that morning, it had been postponed because so many members were in New York.) Boebert took the opportunity to boast on Trump's behalf about one of his favorite topics: his supreme intelligence-as evidenced by the fact that, as Trump loves to mention, he allegedly once \"aced\" some cognitive test.\n\nBut here's what Boebert actually said: \"President Trump, when he was in office, underwent testing for his cognitive dissonance.\"\n\nI've noticed that for whatever reason, Trump is a magnet for these kinds of mangled phrases, misstatements, and malapropisms. This might be because those who speak excitedly about Trump, including Trump himself, tend to talk fast and off-the-cuff and perhaps have less capacity than most for shame and embarrassment (and grammar). They can be desperate to please and maybe get careless or lapse into Freudian candor. \"We've been waging an all-out war on American democracy,\" Trump announced in Iowa this past December.\n\nBoebert's \"cognitive dissonance\" claim made me think of the early days of COVID, in 2020, when Trump tried to convince everyone that the pandemic would soon disappear. Why? Because you'll develop \"a herd mentality,\" Trump explained at a town hall in Pennsylvania. He presumably meant \"herd immunity,\" but this felt like an apt malapropism, if there is such a thing.\n\nTrump's movement had in fact drawn his followers together as a self-reinforcing herd. They were joined in contempt for a unified enemies list-defined loosely as liberal elites. They also shared the buoyant faith that supporting Trump would be a panacea. \"Four more years, it'll be fixed, it'll be fine, you won't have to vote anymore,\" Trump reassured a gathering of Christian conservatives this past July.\n\n\"What Trump offers is an easy escape from the pain,\" as Vance wrote in this magazine in 2016 . He was a fierce critic of Trump before he became a Republican Senate candidate who saw an obvious path to the front of the herd.\n\nVance was one of several vice-presidential prospects who trekked to New York to audition to be Trump's next Mike Pence. He donned the red tie and nailed his umbrage marks. Vivek Ramaswamy, the super-thirsty former GOP-primary candidate, performed his own star turn at the courthouse, but with one notable hiccup. \"Let's pray for our country being stronger on the other side of this disgusting sham politician,\" Ramaswamy said. He tried to correct himself-\"prosecution\"-but it was too late. The word had escaped. The moment went viral.\n\nCognitive dissonance can be exhausting, and there's a lot of that going around the herd these days. I kept thinking about this as I ambled through the Republican convention. It was such an upbeat and cheerful affair, not characteristic at all of these gatherings since Trump took over the franchise and made it a grievance-filled and even menacing place. Trump was solidly up in the polls. He'd just survived an assassination attempt, which lent a charmed-life quality to the proceedings.\n\nSeveral delegates I spoke with said the near miss proved that Trump either had been touched by God or possessed a superhuman ability to withstand danger. Biden, meanwhile, seemed old and tired, and his campaign appeared terminal (and in fact it was).\n\nYet beneath the Republicans' triumphalist excitement in Milwaukee, I sensed an undercurrent of disbelief. They were projecting confidence, yes, but there was a tight, gritted-teeth quality to this, of a once-serious party that had now been subdued, disoriented, and denuded of whatever their convictions once were. The final scene of The Graduate came to mind: Dustin Hoffman and Katharine Ross were out of breath after catching the bus. They had gotten what they thought they wanted. But what had they really just done-again?\n\nRepublicans had expressed these doubts before, and not so long ago, before they all capitulated. I watched a lot of Trump's biggest former skeptics as they peacocked their way through the arena: Rubio, Cruz, Graham, Vance, DeSantis, Burgum, Ramaswamy, Elise Stefanik, and the rest. They had made their calculations, wore their practiced faces of satisfaction, and had somehow found a way to live with the learned helplessness that Trump had reduced them to. But others who had served Trump had made different judgments. I kept recalling the words of retired Marine Corps General James Mattis, who had been Trump's first secretary of defense. Mattis, who was of course nowhere near this convention, had issued a statement on the night of January 6, 2021, blasting Trump as well as those who enabled him as \"pseudo political leaders whose names will live in infamy as profiles in cowardice.\" In other words: They all knew better.\n\nThat was the nagging dissonance of this spectacle: the gap between what the GOP traditionally believed and what it now allows itself to abide. The party that allegedly reveres the Constitution is going all in on someone who has called for its termination. A party that cherishes freedom is willing to cede authority to a candidate who says he would be a dictator on his first day in office. A party that supposedly venerates law and order is re-upping with an actual felon. A party whose rank and file overwhelmingly wants Russia to defeat Ukraine believes that Biden stole the 2020 election, and that Trump's legal shambles are entirely a Democratic plot. This is now a party whose standard-bearer has not been endorsed by any former Republican president or nominee, or even his own vice president, who barely escaped death by hanging the last time. And to what end, any of it?\n\nOr maybe the dissonance doesn't matter. Trump can do as he pleased, as he predicted. \"Well, I think we've had very weak people,\" he said in 2015. \"I look at some of the people that are running, and I think they're not strong people.\" I remember hearing that as bombast at the time, the kind of casual dismissals Trump tosses around. In retrospect, though, Trump was prospecting, sizing up the Republican \"leaders\" he would be competing against. If nothing else, Trump has a keen eye for finding soft targets: pushovers he can bully, rules he can flout, entire political parties he can raze and remake in his image. He would roll over them.\n\nThis article appears in the October 2024 print edition with the headline \"Hypocrisy, Spinelessness, and the Triumph of Donald Trump.\""

      "text": "The Donald J. Trump Guide to Getting Away With Anything\n\nThe former president has a knack for avoiding consequences for his misbehavior.\n\nWith each new scandal involving Donald Trump, the question arises again: Is this the one that will finally exact some pain on the former president?\n\nThe question is in the air once more following the FBI's seizure of top-secret documents from Mar-a-Lago last week. On the one hand, as both Trump's allies and adversaries have noted, such a warrant on a former president is unprecedented , one of Trump's lawyers reportedly told the government all files were returned prior to the search, and Trump has offered nonsensical defenses, all of which point to the seriousness of the situation. On the other, many cases involving mishandled classified information end without charges-just ask Hillary Clinton-and some experts speculate that the goal of the search may simply have been to recover the documents rather than to build a criminal case against Trump.\n\nBut because this case is only the latest in a string of scandals, the question can't be separated from a broader context: Trump's repeated ability to escape the most serious, and sometimes any, consequences for his serial misbehavior. This skill has birthed memes, including a reappropriation of the \" Teflon Don \" moniker, well-deserved conservative mockery of premature political death warrants , and the immortal \" Ah! Well. Nevertheless \" tweet.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Trump's scandals are never done\n\nThis pattern has created an air of invincibility around Trump that can drive liberals to nihilistic fatalism and conservatives to hubris. In truth, the dichotomy is misleading: Though Trump has evaded the most serious legal consequences so far, he has paid a political price; there's a reason he's the former president and very unpopular with the majority of Americans. Still, as we await more information on the Mar-a-Lago search, the record reveals the maneuvers that have gotten Trump out of jeopardy in the past.\n\nBefore the Presidency\n\nThe Scandal: Too many to summarize, as I chronicled in a running tally before he was elected president, including housing discrimination, a scammy \"university,\" and sexual-assault and -harassment allegations going back decades.\n\nWhen: 1973-2017 How He Got Away With It: You name it, he tried it: connections, luck, running out the clock, endless litigation. But more than anything, a pattern emerged of Trump managing to sidestep serious legal consequences by paying fines to dispose of regulatory headaches, civil lawsuits, and other matters, frequently without having to admit guilt or submit to any other penalties. Many of the cases involved corners cut or laws bent to benefit his business, and the fines tended to represent a sliver of whatever revenue he'd made by way of the infraction.\n\nRussian Collusion\n\nThe Scandal: Although Trump, as well as many people who ought to know better, insists that the story was a hoax, his campaign colluded with Russian agents during the 2016 campaign, hoping for some edge against Hillary Clinton.\n\nWhen: 2016 How He Got Away With It: First, Trump left the dirty work to lieutenants, skipping (for example) the infamous Trump Tower meeting with Russian agents. Second, Trump critics overreached, becoming obsessed with sideshows, such as the Steele dossier or the campaign hanger-on Carter Page , that distracted from the core offense. Third, Special Counsel Robert Mueller was hobbled by a Justice Department policy against charging sitting presidents with crimes, and he seemed so determined to play his investigation by the book that he soft-pedaled the seriousness of his findings.\n\nExtorting Ukraine\n\nThe Scandal: Using congressionally appropriated funds, Trump tried to blackmail Ukraine into assisting his reelection campaign by announcing an investigation into Joe Biden's son Hunter.\n\nWhen: 2019-20 How He Got Away With It: The facts were relatively simple, and the House impeached Trump. But in a pattern that has been central to his enduring impunity, the majority-Republican Senate worked as a bloc to let him off, with only one GOP senator voting to find him guilty on one of two counts-putting the vote well short of the 67 needed to convict.\n\nEmoluments Clause\n\nThe Scandal: Critics argued that Trump violated the emoluments clause of the Constitution because his businesses allowed him to accept money from foreign governments. The Trump International Hotel in Washington, D.C., for example, became a magnet for overseas officials.\n\nWhen: 2017-21\n\nHow He Got Away With It: Two cases were tied up in litigation until after Trump left office, at which point the Supreme Court ruled that they were moot. A federal appeals court rejected a third case, brought by Democratic members of Congress, who judges said didn't have standing to sue under the law. This has been one of Trump's essential insights: Just because a law exists doesn't mean it can be enforced.\n\nEthics Violations\n\nThe Scandal: Trump aides appear to have repeatedly violated the Hatch Act and other laws that prevent civil-service employees from engaging in politics or promoting Trump family businesses.\n\nWhen: 2017-21\n\nHow He Got Away With It: In another demonstration that a law's existence doesn't guarantee that it matters, breaches of many ethics laws are identified by an independent office, but the person responsible for disciplining top appointees is the president . When Trump's aides got in trouble for breaking them for his benefit, he naturally made no effort to levy any punishments.\n\nQuestionable Tax Returns\n\nThe Scandal: Many questions have been raised about Trump's tax returns, including whether he has followed either the spirit or the letter of the law, going back to his refusal to release his returns as customary in 2016. What information has emerged to the public suggests that he has at the very least violated the former. The House Ways and Means Committee has requested his tax returns from the IRS under an existing statute.\n\nWhen: 2016-present\n\nHow He Got Away With It: Delay and stonewalling . The Trump Treasury Department put off a decision as long as possible, then announced that it would not produce the records. Since then, the matter has been tied up in litigation. The House committee still hasn't obtained the records, though it has repeatedly won court cases as it seeks the documents- most recently last week . By now, of course, the matter is ancient and politically neutered.\n\nAttempted Coup\n\nThe Scandal: Trump sought to overturn the 2020 election, pressuring state officials to rig vote totals, trying to engineer alternate slates of electors, and finally inciting a violent mob that disrupted Congress's certification of the count.\n\nWhen: November 2020-January 2021 How He Got Away With It: The House promptly impeached him a second time, but the GOP-led Senate insisted on delaying the trial. By the time it came around, some senators' anger had cooled, they'd had a chance to test the political winds, and they decided that sticking with Trump was prudent. A majority of senators voted to convict, but the total was still short of the necessary 67.\n\nThat isn't the end of the story. The House committee investigating the maneuvers continues to turn up damaging information , which seems to have eroded his standing among Republican politicians and voters. The Justice Department is investigating and could potentially bring charges. A district attorney in Georgia is also investigating Trump's pressure campaign in that state. No one knows whether any of these will lead to charges or other material punishments-but Trump has plenty of battle-tested tactics to try to prevent that or fight them if they happen."

      "text": "The Education of Donald J. Trump\n\nA president with so little knowledge about policy and so few ideological commitments can be pragmatic but also volatile and easily influenced.\n\nIn a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal , President Trump made a remarkable admission. He was describing his conversations with President Xi Jinping of China, whose nation he had insisted could solve the North Korean nuclear standoff easily if only it set its minds to it. Xi argued otherwise, Trump recalled :\n\nHe then went into the history of China and Korea. Not North Korea, Korea. And you know, you're talking about thousands of years ... and many wars. And Korea actually used to be a part of China. And after listening for 10 minutes I realized that not-it's not so easy. You know I felt pretty strongly that they have-that they had a tremendous power over China. I actually do think they do have an economic power, and they have certainly a border power to an extent, but they also-a lot of goods come in. But it's not what you would think.\n\nThe anecdote is telling for a couple reasons. Many people have said Trump is ignorant on policy issues, but in this case Trump himself fessed up to having had no real understanding of the history of the Korean peninsula. In fact, he knew so little that in just 10 minutes, his own view of the conflict was turned around.\n\nThe message this sends to foreign leaders is that Trump is not well-versed in the issues about which he confidently pontificates, but that he can quickly be persuaded to come around to their view-hardly the strength Trump promised he would bring to the White House. The Chinese government seems to have grasped that Trump was a blank slate, pushing for a face-to-face meeting between the two men early in Trump's term so that Xi could help set the agenda and terms for their relationship.\n\nTrump's tendency to take up the position of the last person with whom he spoke on a given issue has been widely noted. Xi's claim that North Korea is an intractable problem is a widely held one, and North Korea bedeviled Presidents Obama, Bush, and Clinton, too, but it's disconcerting that a foreign leader could so quickly dazzle Trump. The combination of little knowledge and practically no ideological commitments also makes the ongoing battle between factions in Trump's White House much higher stakes than they might otherwise be.\n\nTrump's about-face on China and North Korea is just one of several headspinning reversals over the last week. As I wrote today , many of those changes in position seem to reflect a simple transition: Before, Trump didn't know the facts of what he was talking about; now he does. He insisted time and again , over the course of nearly two years, that China was nefariously devaluing its currency, but now he realizes that since 2014 Beijing has actually been spending heavily to prop it up. He used to think the U.S. should avoid engagement in Syria; now that he's seen evidence of chemical-weapons use and barrel bombs, both of which Bashar al-Assad was already using when Trump was against intervention, he has changed his mind. He used to think Russia could help solve the Syrian problem; now he understands that Vladimir Putin is one of Assad's two most important patrons.\n\nThese reversals are notable because, despite common skepticism of campaign promises, politicians usually try to do most of what they said once they enter office. Even in a mass-media era where the winner of most presidential elections is the candidate with the most winning personality, presidents continue to view their mandate as based in their policy priorities-partly because it might be discouraging to think otherwise, and partly because their core supporters demand it.\n\nTake Barack Obama, who expended massive political capital early in his term on passing a huge overhaul of the health-insurance system. As a matter of policy and justice, this may have been wise, but as a matter of politics, it stank: Even as public opinion turned sharply against reform, the White House kept its foot on the gas. The blowback helped doom Democratic control of the House of Representatives, and the resulting law was consistently unpopular-until, that is, Trump tried to repeal it.\n\nVast learning is neither sufficient nor necessary to be a successful president. Some of the commanders-in-chief with the most impressive academic resumes turned out to be mediocre or even bad presidents. Besides, all presidents face some sort of learning curve. Bill Clinton's plans to allow gays to serve openly in the military quickly crashed on the shoals of political reality. George W. Bush's denunciations of \"nationbuilding\" as candidate gave way to two huge nationbuilding efforts after September 11. Obama signed an executive order ordering the closing of the prison at Guantanamo Bay on his first day but never actually followed through. Nonetheless, the scope of Trump's recent reversals, and his frank admission of not knowing the facts, sticks out.\n\nTrump has not reversed all of his major promises, of course. He still continues to promise to build a wall on the Mexican border, though it's increasingly apparent that won't be the 50-foot-high concrete colossus he'd promised. Other priorities, like renegotiating NAFTA, have been quietly shifted over to the back burner.\n\nThe president seems to recognize that in voting for him, supporters were voting for Trump the man-or perhaps more accurately, Trump the brand-rather than for his policy platform, which was spotty, flimsy, and sometimes contradictory. Indeed, when confronted with his ignorance during the campaign, he bragged that he could easily learn everything he needed to know in just a few days.\n\nBut reckoning with his policy ignorance could be liberating for Trump. Freed from any imperative to actually follow through on some of his more ideological but less widely popular promises, Trump might pursue policies that were both more popular and more productive. This is a dynamic already seen on Obamacare repeal , and after all, when voters praised Trump as a \"dealmaker,\" weren't they really saying they wanted a pragmatist rather than an ideologue? The rest was just rhetoric.\n\nBut this also carries clear risks. When you don't know things, you are more likely to make errors. This is even more dangerous when, as Donald Rumsfeld could have taught Trump, you don't know what you don't know. You're easily susceptible to the influence of others, too.\n\nI have argued that the Clinton White House, which struggled through a chaotic start, offers a useful analog for the Trump administration . But the interpersonal feuds within the Clinton administration were largely about jockeying for individual position and proximity to the president. The conflict between various Trump aides-notably, strategist Steve Bannon, Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, and senior adviser Jared Kushner-could matter much more, because the stakes are not simply their own advancement and the ability to nudge the president slightly in one direction or another. Bannon, who is reportedly on the outs at the moment , offers a starkly different worldview, including his espousal of white nationalism and fondness for Putin, than does Kushner, who seems to resemble a corporate Democrat in many ways, or Priebus, a mainstream Republican. With a president this untutored on the issues, today's West Wing intrigue threatens to be tomorrow's major U.S. policy shift."

      "text": "Trump's Impeachment Brief Is a Howl of Rage\n\nThe document released by the president's lawyers reads more like the scream of a wounded animal than a traditional legal filing.\n\nOver the weekend, as the Senate prepared for the impeachment trial of Donald Trump, the newly appointed House impeachment managers and the president's newly appointed legal team both filed their initial legal briefs.\n\nAt least, one of them was a legal brief. The other read more like the scream of a wounded animal.\n\nThe House managers' brief is an organized legal document. It starts with the law, the nature and purposes of Congress's impeachment power, then walks through the evidence regarding the first article of impeachment, which alleges abuse of power, and seeks to show how the evidence establishes the House's claim that President Trump is guilty of this offense. It then proceeds to argue that the offense requires his removal from office.\n\nThe brief then rinses and repeats the exercise with respect to the second article of impeachment, which deals with alleged obstruction of Congress. It concludes: \"President Trump has betrayed the American people and the ideals on which the Nation was founded. Unless he is removed from office, he will continue to endanger our national security, jeopardize the integrity of our elections, and undermine our core constitutional principles.\"\n\nBy contrast, the White House's \" Answer of President Donald J. Trump \" to the articles of impeachment, filed by the president's personal lawyer Jay Sekulow and the White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, does not read like a traditional legal argument at all. It begins with a series of rhetorical flourishes-all of them, to one degree or another, false. The articles of impeachment are \"a dangerous attack on the right of the American people to freely choose their President,\" the president's lawyers write-as though the impeachment power were not a constitutional reality every bit as enshrined in the founding document as the quadrennial election of the president. The articles are \"a brazen and unlawful attempt to overturn the results of the 2016 election and interfere with the 2020 election,\" and are \"constitutionally invalid on their face,\" they write, as though the president's right to extort foreign leaders for political services were so beyond reasonable question, it is outrageous that anyone might object to it.\n\nThis document reads like one of the president's speeches at his campaign rallies. The language is a little more lawyerly, if only a little. In Sekulow and Cipollone's hands, Trump's cries of \"Witch hunt!\" have turned into \"lawless process that violated basic due process and fundamental fairness.\" His allegations that Democrats are a \"disgrace\" have turned into \"an affront to the Constitution.\" And Trump's insistence that there's a plot to destroy his presidency has become a \"highly partisan and reckless obsession with impeaching the president [that] began the day he was inaugurated and continues to this day.\"\n\nBut the message is unchanged. It's not a legal argument. It's a howl of rage.\n\nThere is, to be sure, a lack of parallelism between the purposes of the two documents. The House managers' document is an opening brief that lays out the prosecutors' case at some length, while the president's response is an initial six-page reply to the articles. The White House's first full brief is due this afternoon, so it's possible that the lawyers will sound, well, a little more like lawyers in that document. But don't hold your breath.\n\nIn fact, this is not the first time Cipollone has signed his name to a screed along these lines. In October, shortly after Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi announced the beginning of a formal impeachment inquiry, Cipollone sent the House a rambling eight-page letter that read almost as if it had been dictated by the president-down to the obsessive focus on the moral failings of the House Intelligence Committee chairman, Adam Schiff, which would be familiar to anyone reading the president's Twitter feed. The former White House counsel Bob Bauer decried it as offering \"arguments hopelessly weak in substance, political in both content and tone, and harmful to the credibility of [Cipollone's] office.\"\n\nThe document produced by the White House this weekend is a little more organized, but the arguments and the angry tone are the same. Read together, Cipollone's October letter and this new document written with Sekulow set expectations for the president's defense: barely contained, and barely coherent, rage-a middle finger stuck at the impeachment process, rather than any kind of organized effort to convince senators or the public that the president's conviction would be unmerited, imprudent, or unjust.\n\nConsciously or not, Trump's pick of defense counsel for the Senate trial sends the same message. Along with Sekulow and Cipollone, the president will be represented by the former independent counsels Ken Starr and Robert Ray-Starr's successor in the investigations against Bill Clinton-and the Harvard Law School professor emeritus Alan Dershowitz, among others. This is not the legal team one might expect a president facing the fight of his political life to select. Starr, after all, made robust arguments during the Clinton impeachment against the assertion of executive privilege and made others for the impeachability of a president for obstructing an investigation into his conduct using privilege claims. Dershowitz has made plenty of arguments against impeaching and convicting Trump in recent years, but he has a habit of staking out positions that are not merely iconoclastic-like that the president may be impeached only for violating the criminal code, or that the Supreme Court could overturn an unjust conviction in an impeachment trial-but intellectually sloppy, too.\n\nWere Trump trying to make a traditional legal argument, he'd have picked the wrong legal counsel. But that's not what the president is trying to do. CNN describes the president's merry band as a \"Fox News defense team,\" noting that the main through line among the lawyers representing Trump is that they have all regularly appeared on the president's favorite network. It's not that the president's legal team lacks talent. Starr was, after all, an esteemed appellate lawyer, a judge on the D.C. circuit, and the solicitor general of the United States. And Dershowitz was a Harvard law professor. But the president isn't fundamentally making a legal case here. His arguments are that his phone call was \"perfect,\" that there's a \"deep state\" conspiracy against him, and that impeachment is an effort to overturn an election. You don't need good lawyers to make such silly arguments. You need lawyers who will yell untruths loudly, lawyers whose very presence will argue the us-against-them nature of the president's defense.\n\nAnd this is a group of people who do just that. Just by being there, they will make the president feel good, feel validated. Their presence will give expression to his anger, in the same way that Brett Kavanaugh's tirade against the Senate Judiciary Committee reportedly delighted Trump.\n\nFor this reason, the contradiction of choosing Starr to argue in favor of a hyperaggressive vision of executive privilege and against conviction on the basis of obstruction of justice isn't a problem, just as Dershowitz's lazy argumentation and Cipollone's hyperventilating outrage aren't problems either. They're the whole point. Flaunting the dissonance of having Starr defending a president in an impeachment trial is itself an expression of rage and defiance against the president's critics-including, one must imagine, Hillary Clinton, whom both Starr and Ray investigated. It's a legal team designed to own the libs, and the fact that Dershowitz has been accused of perpetrating misconduct against women (allegations he denies ), and Starr of mishandling an investigation into such allegations, is perhaps no coincidence.\n\nTo the extent that there is an argument in the president's defense, it's that the president's rage is more important than building a systematic legal case. Putting together a legal brief, after all, depends on a system of mutual understanding between the writer and the audience. The goal is to convince a neutral arbiter of the correctness of one's point, within a structure of traditions and constraints. Trump's howl of anger is a declaration that he doesn't need to convince any arbiter, abide by any constraints, or reach any understanding, because his own emotions are the most important thing.\n\nBut the flip side of Trump's insistence on his own preeminence is his grasping need for other people to reaffirm him. And so the president's defense, the argument and the team alike, has another purpose: It's a message to Republican senators. It says to each of them that no, the White House will not make a factual argument on the merits of the case-not a real one, anyway. And no, it will not make a real legal argument either. It, rather, will announce that, per George Orwell, two plus two equals five. And it will demand of the senators that they get in line to endorse that proposition, preferably on television, where the president can see. It will be a failure of loyalty if they are not willing to do this. And they will be subject to retaliation.\n\nIt's not a strategy that would work in court. But the Senate is not, at the end of the day, a court-even when it's sitting as the trial court of an impeachment. The Senate is a body composed of people who, as the past few years of Republicans' willing subjection to Trump have shown, are exquisitely sensitive to this sort of pressure.\n\nAnd the more absurdly bombastic the defense gets, the stronger this message becomes."

      "text": "Inside Manhattan Criminal Court With Donald Trump\n\nThe former president of the United States is officially a defendant.\n\nI n the weeks leading up to today's arraignment in New York, former President Donald Trump was reportedly enamored by the idea of a dramatic \"perp walk.\" He seemed to revel in the power of the word arrested . Perhaps Trump, a noted Godfather fan, wanted this historic day to resemble that of the real-life mafioso John Gotti, the former Gambino-crime-family boss, who famously strutted into the New York State Supreme Court in 1990 as flashing cameras captured his smirk.\n\nTrump's supporters and detractors alike seemed similarly hungry for a spectacle. Hundreds of reporters, photographers, and news cameras lined the area outside Manhattan Criminal Court on this blue-sky morning. Many had waited overnight in the cold in hopes of securing one of the three colors of passes to make it inside. Helicopters hovered overhead. The Fire and Fury author Michael Wolff stood atop a riser for a live-TV hit. Thousands of New York police officers were ready for deployment in case protests turned violent.\n\nUltimately, though, there was no mugshot, no handcuffs. Trump didn't address the crowd on his way into the courthouse or as he left. A pro-Trump demonstration before the arraignment had more reporters than participants-Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia left almost as soon as she arrived.\n\nDavid A. Graham: Unprecedented\n\nStill, it was a historic day-the first time a former American president has been charged with a crime. As we learned when Indictment No. 71543-23-\"The people of the State of New York against Donald J. Trump\"-was unsealed, Trump faces 34 counts of falsifying business records in the first degree, each a Class E felony that carries a four-year maximum sentence.\n\nBut today was just a hearing; the actual trial won't get under way until the first or second quarter of 2024. By then, Trump may well be the Republican nominee for president once again. He may also be indicted in other felony cases.\n\nI made it inside . The defendant's red tie was the first thing I saw coming down the courtroom's center aisle, as I watched the CCTV feed from an overflow room in the courthouse. Trump looked sullen as he found his place at the defense table. He was sitting dead center, flanked on each side by a pair of lawyers. While they ruffled through papers and folders, Trump sat quietly, hands in his lap, shoulders sunk.\n\nJust five photographers were permitted to capture the historic image. They were promptly escorted out of the courtroom before the arraignment began. No TV cameras, laptops, or audio-recording devices were allowed, per a ruling from Judge Juan Manuel Merchan. A scrum of journalists shifted in the long, creaky wooden benches and furiously scribbled notes and quotes on paper.\n\nThe prosecution rattled off the broad contours of its case, paying special attention to the way the alleged crimes, in their view, undermined the 2016 presidential election. How do you plead? Trump leaned into the microphone: \"Not guilty.\" He sounded hoarse.\n\nIn New York, falsifying business records is typically a misdemeanor, unless it's done with the intent to commit or hide a second crime. The Trump indictment and accompanying statement of facts do not specify what that second potential crime may be, although the latter document highlights how the former president allegedly \"orchestrated a scheme with others to influence the 2016 presidential election\" and \"violated election laws.\" In a press conference following the arraignment, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg cited what he says are breaches of New York State election law, tax law, and federal campaign-finance law. The indictment itself lays out charges for each falsely logged payment Trump made to his attorney and fixer Michael Cohen from February to December 2017, reimbursing Cohen for giving hush money to Stormy Daniels, an adult-film actor who claims she had a brief relationship with Trump.\n\nToday's proceeding was, as one longtime city lawyer sitting in the back of the overflow room described it, mostly posturing. Assistant District Attorney Christopher Conroy argued that Trump's recent inflammatory rhetoric was a threat to public safety. He referenced Trump's social-media posts featuring phrases such as \"death and destruction\" and \"World War III.\" He described an image that the former president had shared of himself wielding a baseball bat at Bragg's head. Conroy presented printouts of these posts to the judge and to the defense. Trump handed the papers down the line to his lawyers without looking at them. As the descriptions continued, Trump appeared to ask his lawyer to see one of the papers. The prosecution said threats had been made against not only individuals in the case but also their family members.\n\nTom Nichols: What Trump's indictment reveals\n\nTodd Blanche, the first of Trump's defense lawyers to speak, appeared unprepared for this moment. \"I didn't realize we were going to make opening statements today,\" he told the room. He painted his client as a man under attack who has a First Amendment right to free speech. He lamented the \"leaks galore\" and spoke of the \"grave injustice\" against the former president, who at the moment is campaigning to be the future president. \"I don't share your view that certain language and certain rhetoric is justified by frustration,\" Judge Merchan countered. Rather than issue a gag order, which would have barred Trump from discussing the case publicly, the prosecution is seeking a protective order, which would prevent Trump from posting documents related to the case on social media. Merchan told the two sides that they needed to agree to the terms of the order.\n\nTrump sat back in his chair, arms crossed, looking angry. The prosecution raised the prospect of a potential conflict of interest on Trump's legal team-claiming that Stormy Daniels, who is expected to testify as a witness, once sought the legal counsel of Joe Tacopina. \"First and foremost, I never met Stormy Daniels,\" Tacopina replied. He tripped up on whether he should use her stage name or her legal one, Stephanie Clifford: \"Ms. Daniels ... Ms. Clifford ... whatever her name is.\" Occasional muffled laughter could be heard in the overflow room.\n\nT rump had arrived in New York late yesterday afternoon. Cable-news cameras followed his motorcade's every move from Mar-a-Lago to the tarmac, showing his name-branded plane soaring through the sky and landing at LaGuardia Airport, in his native Queens. His second motorcade drove him to his namesake tower in Midtown Manhattan, where he stepped out, waved at a crowd of reporters and supporters, and entered through a side door.\n\nAs with this morning, yesterday's assembly was mostly media and police. A small group of pro-Trump protesters held colorful banners that read TRUMP 2024 and FINISH THE WALL . Across the street, tourists stood behind metal barricades outside luxury stores such as Bergdorf Goodman and Bulgari. People in Phillies jerseys briefly stopped to take in the scene on their way up to the Bronx for the night's Yankees game. A man walked north on Fifth Avenue yelling \"Witch hunt!\" Trump Tower's windows could have used a wash.\n\nAround 10:30 a.m. today, Marjorie Taylor Greene exited a white SUV and was escorted through throngs of reporters and a small cabal of Trump supporters in Collect Pond Park, across the street from the courthouse. Her congressional colleague George Santos also made a cameo in the park. As Greene spoke, whistles and screams from counterprotesters drowned her out. A man stomped out a beat on a kick drum with the message UNFUCK THE WORLD splayed across the front. Competing chants from the pro- and anti-Trump forces filled the park: \"Fuck Donald Trump!\" \"Fascists go home!\" \"Fuck your feelings!\"\n\nA day earlier, New York Mayor Eric Adams had warned Greene, \"When you're in town, be on your best behavior,\" and had issued a blanket statement to potential pot-stirring Trump supporters: \"New York is our home and not a place for your misplaced anger.\"\n\nSteve Mercyzinski, 56, of Brooklyn, wore red, white, and blue Trump apparel and a handmade SAVE AMERICA scarf, and told me that Trump was being unfairly targeted. \"He's being indicted on 34 counts today? Where were the 33,000 counts against Hillary Clinton for deleting 33,000 emails which were subpoenaed?\" Across the way, Gregory Williams, 57, from the Bronx, held a homemade sign that read LOCK HIM UP in one hand and a cardboard cutout of Clinton in the other. He told me he had saved the prop from a 2016 Election Night party.\n\nThe Daily Show 's Jordan Klepper milled about among the crowd, as did podcast hosts from Barstool Sports . There was a guy dressed as Freddy Krueger, a guy smoking a joint, a guy in an orange prison jumpsuit wearing a demonic rubber Trump mask. But, this being Manhattan, there was also a guy in a baseball hat from the Odeon, the venerable TriBeCa hotspot nearby.\n\nAs Merchan adjourned today's session, Trump stood and straightened the lapels of his navy blazer, doing his best tough-guy, Gotti-coming-out-of-court impression. Merchan announced that December 4 would be the next time the court convened in person.\n\nAfter the hearing, Bragg held a brief press conference. \"These are felony crimes in New York State, no matter who you are,\" he said. \"We cannot and will not normalize serious criminal conduct.\"\n\nThe prosecution loosely proposed a January 2024 trial date; Trump's defense lawyers said they felt spring '24 might be more reasonable. By then, if polls hold, Trump may once again be the Republican nominee for president of the United States, indictment be damned.\n\nMorgan Ome contributed to this report."

      "text": "The Many Failed Vindications of Donald J. Trump\n\nThe Nunes memo is the latest thing that Trump and his allies see as a silver bullet that will clear up his political and legal problems. Don't hold your breath.\n\nThe politics of the Russia investigation increasingly resemble a high-stakes game of capture the flag, with two sides frantically searching for the single item that will hand them victory. For Trump's opponents, that's the smoking gun that will prove all their suspicions about him are true . For Trump and his defenders, the quest is for the silver bullet that will offer him full vindication.\n\nThe latest fixation is the memo prepared by GOP Representative Devin Nunes and House Intelligence Committee staff, which reportedly alleges impropriety by the FBI and Justice Department in seeking a warrant to surveil former Trump campaign foreign-policy aide Carter Page. Thursday morning, CNN reported what has been apparent for days: Trump thinks the Nunes memo \"could discredit the Russia investigation.\" The report says:\n\nIn phone calls last night and over the past days, Trump has told friends he believes the memo would expose bias within the agency's top ranks and make it easier for him to argue the Russia investigations are prejudiced against him, according to two sources.\n\nThe memo is still not public-it could be released as soon as Friday , with the White House close to approving the memo with some redactions-but it's a good bet it won't provide Trump the vindication he seeks. The reasons for that are both specific to the memo, but also endemic to his presidency, in which successive items have been presented as Trump's great hope, only to dissolve upon the slightest scrutiny. There's little doubt pro-Trump media will leap on the memo and argue it clears him, but that will do little to actually change the predicaments he faces. Then it will be on to the next future failed vindication.\n\nThe pattern was set on the second day of the Trump administration, when, humiliated by crowds that were smaller than those that met Barack Obama's 2009 inauguration, the new president called the director of the National Park Service and demanded he produce photos that would prove attendance was actually much stronger. Unsurprisingly, this did not work out .\n\nMore often, however, these failed vindications have concerned Russia. First came his March 4 tweet alleging Obama had improperly surveilled him:\n\nTerrible! Just found out that Obama had my \"wires tapped\" in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\n\nHad it been true that Obama had ordered a presidential candidate surveilled for political reasons, it would have been a huge story. It might have overshadowed all the stories about Russian interference in the election, and changed the focus from Trump's scandals to Obama's. It did not turn out to be true. The president can't simply order surveillance, for one thing; the Justice Department has since said the claim was untrue; and the White House, despite making the claim and demanding that Congress investigate it, refused to produce any evidence to back it up. In fact, as it turned out , the claim had emanated from a Breitbart story that was in turn based on speculation from the radio host Mark Levin.\n\nThe next great Trump hope came later that month, when, in an apparent attempt to show that even if Trump was talking nonsense about being personally surveilled at Trump Tower before the election, there had been improper surveillance of the Trump transition team following the election. Nunes, the chair of the House Intelligence Committee and, perhaps not coincidentally, a former member of the Trump transition team, announced a mysterious set of revelations about improper use of intelligence materials by the Obama White House. Nunes said he couldn't detail them publicly, but he rushed to the White House to inform the president. This turned out to be a charade, because Nunes had derived the original \"revelations\" from coordination with National Security Council staffers-in other words, he was rushing to inform the White House of information that came from the White House. But nearly a year later, there is still no evidence to suggest improper behavior inside the Obama White House.\n\nThe next major installment came in September, when surveillance of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, both before and after the 2016 election, was revealed. Ordinarily, the news that the FBI felt a candidate's campaign chairman was worthy of surveillance would be a blow, but Trump's defenders quickly turned the argument around, arguing it vindicated the president's original \"wiretap\" claim. As I explained in detail at the time, it did not : The timing was off, and Trump was never the target. (Later that year it became clear why Manafort was being surveilled, when Special Counsel Robert Mueller charged Manafort with laundering $75 million in overseas profits.)\n\nNow comes the latest supposed vindication, the Nunes reprise. Perhaps this will turn out differently when the memo itself is released, and it will in fact end Trump's troubles, but there are plenty of reasons to doubt that.\n\nFor one thing, the memo is not even four pages long, which raises questions about how much it can really say. Like the first round of Nunes, this has been a comedy of errors. After Nunes and staffers produced the memo, ranking committee Democrat Adam Schiff said that most of the committee was unfamiliar with the underlying intelligence-an assertion that the Justice Department confirmed in a letter to the White House, saying Nunes himself had not read the materials.  Republicans pushing for the memo's release have argued that the intelligence community is prone to abuse, even as they voted against reforms that might constrain surveillance . Nunes did not directly answer a question about whether he had coordinated with the White House on this memo as well. Republicans have refused to release publicly a Democratic memo replying to Nunes's memo. The release of the memo has also set off an unprecedented conflict between the Justice Department and White House.\n\nThen on Wednesday night, Schiff claimed that Nunes had materially edited the memo between when the House Intelligence Committee voted (along party lines) to send it to the White House to review for release-meaning the committee had voted to send a different memo. Nunes acknowledged the edits but contended they were minor. This is not the sort of handling that fills one with confidence that everything here is being done competently and on the up-and-up.\n\nThese are all second-order considerations, though. What about the memo itself? The central accusation, based on what's known, is that the Justice Department improperly signed off on an application to a Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act judge for a warrant to surveil Page. The application (the memo contends) was based on information from a dossier compiled by Christopher Steele, a former British intelligence agent who was researching Trump for a company paid by the Democratic National Committee.\n\nAs I have reported , and as Orin Kerr also writes , this is dubious. First, it's doubtful that the warrant application would have been based solely on the Steele dossier. American intelligence agencies had long had an eye on Page, who they believed was subject to recruitment as a Russian agent as early as 2013. Second, even if the dossier was part of the application, the fact that it derives from opposition research wouldn't bar the FBI from using it unless the bureau had reason to believe it was false and used it anyway.\n\nStill, imagine for a moment that it is true that the FBI used only the Steele dossier to apply for the Page warrant, and that it acted improperly. Certainly, as I have noted elsewhere , this would not represent the first case of intelligence overreach in American history. That would be great news for Page's defense, but it is hard to see how this would solve Trump's broader problems. Page claims he was a bit player anyway. He also doesn't make for a great political cause , given his peculiar and sometimes contradictory answers to questions from the House Intelligence Committee.\n\nMoreover, the Page warrant has no bearing on the larger questions of whether the Trump campaign, or Trump himself, was colluding with the Russians, and whether Trump obstructed justice by trying to hobble the investigation into collusion. It would not do anything to undermine George Papadopoulos's guilty plea, or his conversations with Russians, or his boasts to an Australian diplomat that the Russians had dirt on Hillary Clinton. It would not invalidate Michael Flynn's guilty plea and cooperation with Mueller. It would not erase the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting, or the questions over a statement about that meeting he dictated in summer 2017. It would not throw out Trump's attempts to pressure James Comey, nor his firing of the FBI director and explanation that he did so because of the Russia probe. It would not efface Donald Trump Jr.'s DMs with Wikileaks .\n\nOf course, actually rebutting this extensive set of stories is not what Trump means when he says he hopes the memo will undermine the Russia probe. When the Mueller probe and the congressional investigations are over, Trump may very well emerge unscathed, or at least neither indicted nor charged. (The political damage has already begun.) The goal of these allegedly vindicating moments, however, is not to actually rebut facts. The goal is simply to spread confusion and create fog that might give the impression that the Justice Department is unreliable and that the investigations into Trump are politically motivated by opponents who inhabit the same moral plane as he does. That's why even if the Nunes memo proves to be a flop, we can expect another supposed vindication for Trump before too long."

      "text": "The Trump Trial's Extraordinary Opening\n\nThe first days of the criminal case against the former president have been mundane, even boring-and that's remarkable.\n\nThis is The Trump Trials by George T. Conway III, a newsletter that chronicles the former president's legal troubles. Sign up here .\n\nThe defendant nodded off a couple of times on Monday. And I have to confess, as a spectator in an overflow courtroom watching on closed-circuit television, so did I.\n\nLegal proceedings can be like that. Mundane, even boring. That's how the first couple of days of the trial in The People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump , Indictment No. 71543-2023, felt much of the time. Ordinary-despite being so extraordinary. And, frankly, that was comforting. The ordinary mechanics of the criminal-litigation process were applied fairly, efficiently, and methodically to a defendant of unparalleled notoriety, one who has devoted himself to undermining the rule of law.\n\nCertainly the setting was ordinary. When the Criminal Courts Building, at 100 Centre Street in Lower Manhattan, first opened in 1941, an architectural critic lamented that the Art Deco structure, a New Deal/Public Works Administration project, was \" uncommunicative .\" Eight decades later, it still has little to say. Raw and spartan, it's a bit of a mystery to people who aren't familiar with it (including me, a civil litigator who, despite having been admitted to the New York state bar some 35 years ago, practiced mostly in federal and Delaware courts). A pool reporter yesterday described the surroundings as \"drab.\"\n\nDrab indeed, but busy-very busy. There's never a want of bustle here, of the sort you would expect. As the former federal prosecutor Andrew Weissmann put it this week, 100 Centre is, \"well, Dickensian-a beehive of activity with miscreants, state prosecutors, judges, defense lawyers, probation officers, court security [and] families-in dark, dingy halls and courtrooms.\" It's a bit like New York City as a whole: How it functions, with the volume it handles, never ceases to amaze.\n\nAnd how the court manages to keep track of things, Lord only knows. In contrast with the federal courts or even New York's civil courts, it has no electronic, publicly accessible docket. The Supreme Court of the State of New York for the County on New York, Criminal Term, is, as one courthouse reporter said last month, \"stuck in the past.\" It's a tribunal \"where the official record is a disorganized and incomplete mass of paper with no accounting of what's inside.\" The records come in brown accordion folders-Redwelds, lawyers call them-and what judges and clerks decide to put in them is the record, and what they don't is not.\n\nBut somehow it works. Somehow the court manages to dispose of thousands of cases a year, involving all manner of defendants and offenses. A calendar emailed to journalists by the Manhattan District Attorney's Office listing the week's anticipated court appearances gives you the flavor. It catalogs names seemingly of many ethnicities, with a couple of corporate entities to boot. A hodgepodge of alleged charges, including the violent and the corrupt: robbery, conspiracy, forgery, criminal mischief, identity theft, enterprise corruption, stalking, murder, attempted murder, sex trafficking, grand larceny, attempted grand larceny, possession of a forged instrument, offering a false statement for filing.\n\nAnd the list contained three cases involving the crime of falsifying business records, one of which was set for trial on Monday, April 15, in Part 59, Courtroom 1530- People v. Trump .\n\nNothing on the calendar, other than the defendant's readily recognizable name, would have told you there was anything special about the case. In that sense, it was ordinary. But the hubbub outside-a handful of protesters, multiple television cameras, and a long line for the press and other spectators-made clear that something somewhat special was afoot. An overflow courtroom down the hall from the main courtroom offered a closed-circuit television feed of the proceedings. Those who had lined up went through an extra set of security screeners and machines-mandated, we were told, by the United States Secret Service.\n\nBut still, so much was ordinary-the stuff of the commencement of a criminal trial, housekeeping of the sort you'd see in virtually any court about to try a criminal case. That began promptly at 10 a.m. on Monday, when Judge Juan Merchan assumed the bench. There were loose ends for the judge to tie up, pending motions to decide. Merchan denied the defendant's motion to recuse, reading, in even tones, an opinion from the bench. The motion was frivolous; the result unsurprising. And then the parties argued some motions in limine-pretrial efforts to exclude evidence.\n\nFor example, would the notorious Access Hollywood tape that rocked the 2016 presidential campaign be played for the jury?  The prosecution said it should be: An assistant district attorney said the tape would elucidate why the defendant and his campaign were so hell-bent, to the point of falsifying business records, on keeping additional instances of the defendant's miscreant conduct with women out of the public eye. The defense, of course, argued that playing the tape would be prejudicial. After all, this wasn't a case about sexual assault.\n\nThe judge allowed that the tape's existence provided context for the business-records charges but ruled that actually showing the tape to the jury would be prejudicial. Instead, the jury would be given a transcript. And speaking of sexual assault, prosecutors tried to get in an excerpt from Trump's deposition in the E. Jean Carroll sexual-assault and defamation cases in which Trump testified that he was a \"star,\" and that stars historically get to do to women what Trump said on the Access Hollywood tape that he liked to do to them. Judge Merchan rightly said no, he would not allow the jury to hear that. It would be too much, too beside the point of what this case (unlike the Carroll cases) is actually about.\n\nBut as unusual and colorful as the factual predicate for the evidentiary motions was, the argument wasn't all that interesting. It was rather low-key, in fact. Perhaps that was because none of the proffered evidence was new. But it was also because the arguing of pretrial evidentiary motions, however crucial they may be (although these, frankly, weren't), is seldom scintillating. I can't imagine that Donald Trump and I were the only ones watching who dozed off.\n\nThen came jury selection, which took the rest of Monday, all of yesterday, and will probably consume tomorrow and Friday as well. (The judge will be handling his other cases today.) That was a bit more interesting, but slow going at first. Again, the ordinary met the extraordinary. Ninety-six potential jurors were brought in. The judge provided an overview of the case in the broadest terms, describing the charges in a few sentences; explained what his role and what the jury's would be; and read the names of the cast of characters (some would be witnesses, others would simply be mentioned, including-full disclosure-my ex-wife). Still, it was mundane. It was pretty much what a judge would say in any big case.\n\nAnd jury selection was a bit tedious; in a case like this, it simply has to be. Jurors were asked to give oral answers-some 42 of them, including a number with multiple subparts-to a written questionnaire. In substance: Where do you live? What do you do? What's your educational background? What news sources do you read? What's your experience with the legal system? Have you ever been to a Trump rally or followed him on social media? Have you belonged to any anti-Trump groups? And on and on and and on. But the most important inquiries came toward the end of the list: questions asking whether the prospective jurors could be fair. Occasionally the judge would interject, when an unusual or unclear answer was given. And once in a while there was a moment of levity: One woman-in response to a question about having relatives or close friends in the legal field-noted that she had once dated a lawyer. \"It ended fine,\" she volunteered, with a flatness of tone that betrayed no hint of nostalgia or loss.\n\nThis process took well over a day, and included brief follow-up questioning-\"voir dire\"-by the lawyers for both sides. But the judge did take a shortcut, one that saved a great deal of effort: After describing the case, but before proceeding to the individual-by-individual, question-by-question process, he asked the entire group the bottom-line question: Do any of you think you couldn't judge the case fairly? Roughly two-thirds of this first batch of potential jurors said they couldn't. That was extraordinary-a reflection of the fact that everyone knows who the defendant is, and that not many people lack a strong opinion about him.\n\nAnd during the lawyers' voir dire, a few interesting moments did occur, mostly when Trump's lawyers pulled out social-media posts that they claimed showed possible bias on the part of the remaining candidates in the jury pool. One man was stricken by the court for cause because he once posted that Trump should be locked up.  The Trump lawyers attempted, but failed, to get the court to strike a woman whose husband had posted some joking commentary about the former president. The judge's response: That's all you have? He allowed the juror to stay, and left it to counsel to decide whether to use their limited number of peremptory strikes.\n\nIn the end, for two days, the extraordinary intertwined with the ordinary, as it should in a case like this one. As one young woman from the Upper East Side, now to be known as Juror No. 2,  put it during the selection process, \"No one is above the law.\" Let's hope that sentiment prevails."

      "text": "Court Upholds Trump's Ban on DEI Programs\n\nAn appeals court has temporarily paused a judge's ruling that had blocked the Trump administration from implementing its ban on diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs.\n\nAn earlier ruling in February found that Trump's attempt to ban DEI initiatives at federal agencies and government contractors, as well as his order that the Department of Justice investigate companies with DEI policies, likely violated the First Amendment. But today's ruling by the Virginia-based 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will allow the Trump administration to continue as planned, pending the final outcome of the administration's appeal.\n\nTrump began attempting to roll back DEI programs across the federal government almost as soon as he entered office back in January, going so far as to place officials working on them on leave one day after his inauguration.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nIn an executive order signed on his first day in office, Trump claimed that he was ending \"illegal and immoral DEI\" by terminating the programs. The ban was implemented quickly; a memo sent by the U.S. Office of Personnel Management on Jan. 21 instructed the heads of federal departments and agencies to place all employees working on DEI programs on leave effective 5 p.m. the next day.\n\nApproximately 55 federal employees in the Education Department were placed on leave as a result, and told that while they would continue to receive their salaries, they could not access their email accounts and would not be expected to come into the office. In addition, at least 14 employees in the Department of Energy whose roles involved recruiting veterans and using data to improve the workplace were placed on leave.\n\nThe temporary block on Trump's ban was the result of a lawsuit brought by the city of Baltimore and three other groups, who sought injunctions against Trump's orders, arguing that they were unlawful and unconstitutional.\n\nThe lawsuit, brought by the city of Baltimore, the National Association of Diversity Officers in Higher Education , the American Association of University Professors, and the Restaurant Opportunities Centers United, read, \"In the United States, there is no king.\"\n\n\"In his crusade to erase diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility from our country, President Trump cannot usurp Congress's exclusive power of the purse, nor can he silence those who disagree with him by threatening them with the loss of federal funds and other enforcement actions,\" the suit continued.\n\n\"CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD.

      "text": "'Trump Chooses Words Carefully': Vance Comes Out With One of His Wildest Takes Yet\n\nReporter\n\nVice President JD Vance has come out with one of his most spurious claims yet, after stating that President Donald Trump \"chooses his words carefully.\"\n\nVance took to Elon Musk's X to make a general point that there is too much talking and not enough action in U.S. politics. \"So much of American diplomacy has become pure performance-an obsession with *saying* this or that,\" he mused.\n\nVance, whose tiny pants recently caused a social media storm , then claimed that Trump is \"hated\" because he is a famously broody do-er. He said: \"The reason the failed establishment hates President Donald J. Trump is because he chooses his words carefully and, more importantly, is much more focused on *doing*.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrump has certainly been busy doing since he took over from the Biden Administration, signing 70 plus executive orders, a 40-year record , as of Feb. 20. However, a traditional criticism of Trump is that he opens his mouth first and thinks later, far from choosing his words carefully as his understudy claimed.\n\nSo much of American diplomacy has become pure performance--an obsession with *saying* this or that. The reason the failed establishment hates President Donald J. Trump is because he chooses his words carefully and, more importantly, is much more focused on *doing*.\n\nBack in Oct. 2016, before his first term as president began, Geoffrey Pullum, a linguist at University of Edinburgh, actually said Trump's communication style was pure chaos.\n\n\"His speech suggests a man with scattered thoughts, a short span of attention, and a lack of intellectual discipline and analytical skills,\" Pullum told Vox .\n\nMore recently, in September last year, linguist John McWhorter said Trump's style of communication made it sound like he had been drinking, despite the 78-year-old being staunchly anti-booze. \"That's rambling, the verbal equivalent of somebody being extremely drunk,\" he said on NPR's Morning Edition podcast.\n\nCNN recently reported that Trump \"lies\" a lot, with both scripted and \"ad-libbed\" fibs. Just yesterday (Monday) he was fact-checked in person by French President Emmanuel Macron during a U.S. visit.\n\nNotable moment in the Oval Office where Trump says \"Europe is loaning the money to Ukraine\" and \"they're getting their money back\" when Macron interrupted to say, \"No, in fact, to be frank, we paid. We paid 60% of the total effort.\" pic.twitter.com/QFzv9WhsIz\n\nTrump was talking about Ukraine aid inside the White House when he said the U.S. provided $350 billion to the country. Macron put his hand on the president's arm and set the record straight. \"No, in fact, to be frank, we paid. We paid 60 percent of the total effort,\" he said, adding that it was \"real money.\"\n\n\"If you believe that, it's OK with me,\" Trump said carefully about the stone cold fact, seemingly suggesting it was a lie or half truth.\n\nMeanwhile, a site set up a section to fact-check Trump's claims and it is positively brimming with evidence that he might not actually always choose his words so carefully.\n\nPolitiFact, by the Poynter Institute, has found Trump to have fallen foul of their 'Truth-O-Meter' twice already this month.\n\nReporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Eagles Won the Super Bowl But Historic Trump Was the Real MVP\n\nChief National Correspondent\n\nThe Super Bowl may have been a blowout for the Philadelphia Eagles and Most Valuable Player Jalen Hurts.\n\nBut the biggest winner wasn't on the field at all.\n\nThe real MVP of Super Bowl LIX was President Donald J. Trump .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLike the TV-savvy pro he is, Trump realized the most watched live show in the country was a massive self-publicity coup hiding in plain sight.\n\nAnd for the four previous Super Bowls, Joe Biden was just plain hiding.\n\nBiden was not alone in ignoring America's prime sporting event. Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama, all ignored it. Well, they watched it with their buddies but they never went. Nor did any president before them.\n\nIncredibly, Trump was the first president in history to attend a Super Bowl.\n\nAnd he quarterbacked the entire event like the master of publicity that he undoubtedly has always been.\n\nIt wouldn't seem such a stretch to think it might be worth dropping into a contest the entire nation is obsessed with.\n\nAdvertisers fight to spend millions for a few minutes of prime, prime television property; an invite to perform at half-time is considered a cherry to top the biggest of musical careers; the audience is a who's who of business leaders, Hollywood stars, and the big-hitting influencers of the moment.\n\nIn 2013, the last time the Super Bowl was held in New Orleans, a power outage delayed the game for 34 minutes. It was the first time the game had suffered for lack of power.\n\nOn Sunday night, all the power was there in the shape of the president. It was Trump in his element, playing to the crowd. Elon Musk can be the power behind the throne but MAGA's emperor knows the world's richest man doesn't have the clothes for this kind of close-up.\n\nThey're both as rich as Croesus but Musk doesn't have Trump's common touch.\n\nMaybe the past presidents were worried about security. Trump's already been shot at and survived. He must feel indestructible.\n\nThe president may be in the posh seats but he knows what the people back home are saying. You don't get to have a monster hit show like The Apprentice without knowing what the public likes.\n\nEven on his way home on Air Force One, Trump was busy on Truth Social. Not setting tariffs, not freezing budgets, or attacking his enemies. He wanted to know why there were still kick-offs in Super Bowls.\n\n\"The worst part of the Super Bowl, by far,\" he wrote , \"was watching the Kickoff where, as the ball is sailing through the air, the entire field is frozen, stiff. College Football does not do it, and won't! Whose idea was it to ruin the Game?\"\n\nAnd he couldn't resist a dig at Taylor Swift . \"The only one that had a tougher night than the Kansas City Chiefs was Taylor Swift. She got BOOED out of the Stadium. MAGA is very unforgiving!\" he posted. From the crowd's boos, he plugged right into the zeitgeist in the stadium.\n\nJust for good measure, he canceled the production of pennies. Not a problem there. Nothing sold for pennies in the Caesars Superdome.\n\nIf Patrick Mahomes had a bad night, then so did Biden. Not that anybody cares anymore.\n\nEven David Axelrod , a loyal Democrat soldier, and Obama's former chief strategist, had to admit it was a massive missed opportunity. \"A year ago, Biden refused the traditional Super Bowl interview and the unparalleled audience it would have yielded. That bewildering decision was a major sign of trouble,\" he posted. \"Trump is all over it today.\"\n\nA year ago, Biden refused the traditional Super Bowl interview and the unparalleled audience it would have yielded.  That bewildering decision was a major sign of trouble. Trump is all over it today.\n\nProtected by his dwindling band of loyalists, Biden was so out of touch as his term progressed that more effort was put into keeping him in cloisters rather than in front of the world's cameras and so it is hardly surprising that he never made it to a Super Bowl.\n\nBut he could have watched and smiled and waved to the crowd. It wasn't like he needed to debate anybody.\n\nThink what you like about Trump's nascent presidency, but he got it right on Sunday night. He has the ball and will hold it tight until someone rips it from his grasp. The end line is still four years off but you can bet your bottom dollar he will be at the next three Super Bowls. His only misstep was picking the Chiefs as the winner.\n\nNext year, he'll know who to back. Himself.\n\nChief National Correspondent\n\nGot a tip?

Donald Trump phoned in with what he considered \"quite an interesting\" question: \"How brilliant is Donald J. Trump?\" Vance laughed hard at this for a full 10 seconds, rocking back and forth on his chair like a suck-up, before conceding that the former president is \"very brilliant\" and telling the audience about the first time Trump met Vance's wife, Usha . Vance had a harder time answering Trump's second question-\"how brilliant is Kamala ?\"-exercising rare restraint in dismissing it as a \"tough one.\" Elsewhere in the program, however, Vance complained that Harris was wasting time on \"petty grievances from years ago\" in addressing Trump's alleged admiration of Hitler . Harris called her opponent a \"fascist,\" echoing recent remarks by former White House chief of staff John Kelly , whom Vance dismissed as a \" disgruntled ex-employee .\"\n\nReporter\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Donald J. Trump has been sworn in as the 47th president of the United States. Chief Justice John Roberts administered the oath of office inside the Capitol after Monday's inaugural proceedings were moved indoors because President Trump said it was too cold outside.\n\nPresident Donald Trump : \"During every single day of the Trump administration, I will, very simply, put America first.\"\n\nCEOs of tech giants were given prime positions at Trump's inauguration, including Tesla, X and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk; Meta's Mark Zuckerberg; Amazon's Jeff Bezos; Apple's Tim Cook; and Google's Sundar Pichai. Vermont independent Senator Bernie Sanders commented, \"When the 3 wealthiest men in America sit behind Trump at his inauguration, everyone understands that the billionaire class now controls our government.\"\n\nDuring his inaugural address, Trump declared a national emergency at the southern border, saying his administration's top priority would be mass deportations of \"millions and millions of criminal aliens.\" Trump also said he would reintroduce his \"Remain in Mexico\" policy for asylum seekers. And he rescinded a Biden-era interagency task force set up to reunite families separated at the border during Trump's first term.\n\nJust moments after Trump took office, the Customs and Border Protection's CBP One smartphone app, which provides a path for people to apply for asylum at the U.S. border, stopped working. All appointments to hear claims for refugee status on the app have been canceled. President Trump also set up a return to his first administration's travel ban on citizens from several predominantly Muslim nations, issuing an order directing a 60-day study to come up with a list of countries.\n\nMeanwhile, on Monday, the Senate approved the Laken Riley Act, a bill to mandate immigration detention for undocumented immigrants charged with crimes, including nonviolent offenses. Twelve Democratic senators joined Republicans voting for the bill; that follows 48 House Democrats who sided with Republican representatives to approve the legislation.\n\nJoe Biden granted clemency Monday to longtime political prisoner and Indigenous activist Leonard Peltier in a surprise move in the final minutes of his presidency. Under terms of his release from federal prison, the 80-year-old Peltier must live under house arrest. We'll have more on this later in the broadcast with the NDN Collective's Nick Tilsen, who helped lead the campaign for Peltier's clemency.\n\nAs he was exiting office, Biden also pardoned five more members of his own family, saying they did nothing wrong but that he feared reprisal by the Trump administration.\n\nDuring his inaugural address Monday, President Trump vowed to declare a \"national energy emergency\" in order to fulfill his campaign pledge to \"drill, baby, drill.\" Trump then proceeded to sign executive orders opening Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife Refuge for oil and gas exploration; lifting a pause on new liquefied natural gas exports; pledging to streamline permitting for energy and mining projects; and revoking a Biden-era goal of transitioning to electric vehicles. And for the second time, President Trump has withdrawn the United States from the United Nations' Paris Climate Agreement. As he signed the order, Trump said, \"The United States will not sabotage our own industries while China pollutes with impunity.\" That prompted this response from China's Foreign Ministry.\n\nGuo Jiakun : \"China is concerned about the U.S. announcement that it will withdraw from the Paris Agreement. Climate change is a common challenge facing all mankind. No country can stay out of it, and no country can be immune to it.\"\n\nTrump's return to power has alarmed climate activists worldwide. On Monday, protesters in London unfurled a 100-meter-wide banner across from the Houses of Parliament.\n\nPhil Thornhill : \"It says, 'Trump: Climate Genocide.' And it's to get over the point that the election of a climate denier to be the most powerful man in the world is going to have dreadful consequences.\"\n\nTrump has ordered the U.S. to withdraw from the U.N.'s World Health Organization, a move health experts say could undermine the global response to the next pandemic.\n\nOther executive orders issued by Trump on day one include a rollback of policies around DEI and LGBTQ rights, reflecting the mounting right-wing attack on transgender communities. One order states, \"Agencies will cease pretending that men can be women and women can be men when enforcing laws that protect against sex discrimination.\"\n\nAnother order seeks to rename the Gulf of Mexico to \"Gulf of America\" and Alaska's Denali, the highest peak in North America, to Mount McKinley - the name it was known by until President Obama changed it in 2015. The order has no bearing on what names are used for the sites internationally.\n\nTrump also reversed a Biden executive order barring the use of deadly chokeholds and no-knock warrants by federal law enforcement, and a Biden order that sought to wind down the Justice Department's use of private prisons.\n\nTrump also revoked Biden's removal last week of Cuba from the U.S. state sponsors of terrorism list.\n\nOn Monday, the Senate unanimously confirmed Marco Rubio as the new secretary of state and Trump's first Cabinet member. He is the first Latino to hold the top diplomatic post. Rubio is a staunch supporter of Israel, defending its devastating assault on Gaza during his confirmation hearing last week. He also repeatedly touted his hawkish position toward China, which has imposed sanctions against Rubio.\n\nRepublicans on the Senate Armed Services Committee on Monday voted to advance Pete Hegseth's nomination for defense secretary to the Senate floor. Massachusetts Democrat Elizabeth Warren, a member of the Armed Services Committee, blasted her Republican colleagues for \"rushing through the most unqualified nominee for U.S. Secretary of Defense in modern history.\" Hegseth has been accused of domestic violence, rape, being drunk on the job, Islamophobia and mismanaging two nonprofits' funds, among other things.\n\nIn Gaza, civil defense workers say they've discovered the bodies of 137 people buried under the ruins of Palestinian homes, schools and businesses in the hours since the ceasefire deal took effect Sunday. The grisly discoveries are only the first of what the Palestinian Civil Defense agency estimates to be 10,000 bodies trapped under the rubble covering Gaza following 15 months of Israeli bombardment. Asem Alnabih is spokesperson for the Gaza Municipality.\n\nAsem Alnabih : \"There are still thousands of bodies trapped under the rubble. Of course, the municipal authorities have been working with other departments to support the cleanup. We hope to uncover the victims' remains in the next few days. However, our success heavily relies on the introduction of heavy equipment. Gaza City is the largest city in the Gaza Strip, but its current engineering machinery is also very limited, making it impossible to carry out the necessary work.\"\n\nIn his first remarks on Gaza since retaking the White House, President Trump said Monday he's \"not confident\" the ceasefire will remain in place. Trump said he plans to lift the Biden administration's pause on U.S. deliveries of 2,000-pound bombs to Israel. And he rescinded Biden-era sanctions on far-right Israeli settlers accused of violence against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank. Trump said Gaza appeared to be a \"massive demolition site\" that should be rebuilt.\n\nPresident Donald Trump : \"You know, Gaza is interesting. It's a phenomenal location: on the sea, the best weather. You know, everything is good. It's like - some beautiful things could be done with it. But it's very interesting. But some fantastic things could be done with Gaza.\"\n\nFormer Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said Monday he will leave his position as co-chair of Trump's incoming Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE , and will mount a campaign to become governor of Ohio. According to Politico, DOGE co-chair Elon Musk made it known in recent days that he wanted Ramaswamy out. Three lawsuits filed in federal court Monday accuse DOGE of violating federal transparency laws. A fourth lawsuit filed by the Center for Biological Diversity seeks DOGE -related records under the Freedom of Information Act.\n\nOn Monday, Elon Musk stoked outrage when he appeared to make a \"sieg heil\" Nazi salute - twice - as he thanked Trump supporters at an inaugural rally in Washington, D.C.'s Capital One Arena.\n\nElon Musk : \"And I just want to say thank you for making it happen. Thank you.\"\n\nIn response, New York Congressmember Jerrold Nadler wrote on Musk's social media platform X, \"I never imagined we would see the day when what appears to be a Heil Hitler salute would be made behind the Presidential seal. This abhorrent gesture has no place in our society and belongs in the darkest chapters of human history. I urge all of my colleagues to unite in condemning this hateful gesture for what it is: antisemitism.\"\n\nCecile Richards, former president of Planned Parenthood and fierce defender of reproductive rights, has died at 67 after a battle with brain cancer. Richards was a labor and voting organizer before leading Planned Parenthood from 2006 to 2018, helping fend off Republican attacks on abortion in red states. In November of last year, Richards was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Joe Biden. She was the daughter of pioneering Texas Democratic Governor Ann Richards. Cecile Richards spoke on Democracy Now! many times, including in July of 2018, after then-President Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court as part of the far-right plan to overturn Roe v. Wade.\n\nCecile Richards : \"Roe v. Wade didn't create the idea of abortion. Abortion existed before it was legal. It was simply unsafe, and young, healthy women died routinely in emergency rooms across this country. I still meet doctors who can tell me they remember doing their residencies and their rotations, seeing women die. So, the point is now, I think, what the president is saying is we're going to actually now say that women may be safe in some states, but in a lot of states they won't be. My home state of Texas, where they actually have basically tried to outlaw abortion almost completely, we're going to go back to a day in which women had to go across the border or take things into their own hands. It's a very scary time for women.\""

Instead, the charity has simply been receiving and donating other people's money-while creating the illusion Trump has been giving himself. In one case, Trump used $20,000 of the foundation money to buy a six-foot-tall painting of himself. The Post also revealed Trump has used the foundation to make political contributions, including giving money to a campaign group for Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, who had threatened to investigate Trump University.

A number of Black lawmakers have spoken at the RNC , including South Carolina Senator Tim Scott and North Carolina Lieutenant Governor Mark Robinson. Lusane says that \"Donald Trump never has anything positive to say about the Black community,\" and that his effort to showcase diversity at the RNC is to \"gaslight the Black community.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, \"War, Peace and the Presidency: Breaking with Convention.\" I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nAs the Republican National Convention enters its third day, we look now at how Donald Trump is trying to increase his appeal with Black voters. During the first presidential debate, Donald Trump slammed President Biden for allowing migrants into the country, claiming they're taking, quote, \"Black jobs.\"\n\nDONALD TRUMP : The fact is that his big kill on the Black people is the millions of people that he's allowed to come in through the border. They're taking Black jobs now. And it could be 18, it could be 19, and even 20 million people. They're taking Black jobs, and they're taking Hispanic jobs. And you haven't seen it yet, but you're going to see something that's going to be the worst in our history.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're joined right now by Howard University political science professor Clarence Lusane. His latest book is titled Twenty Dollars and Change: Harriet Tubman and the Ongoing Fight for Racial Justice and Democracy , also author of The Black History of the White House . His piece in The Nation is headlined \"Don't Believe Trump When He Claims He's Not Racist: Trump does not deserve a single Black or Hispanic vote. Nada . None.\"\n\nProfessor Lusane, thanks for joining us again on Democracy Now! Can you talk about the point that he is making - we just had a long discussion about immigration - President Trump pitting Latinos, immigrants against African Americans in this country, and the significance of this?\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : So, thank you for having me.\n\nSo, as your previous guest just pointed out, it's important to know that this idea of a replacement theory, that whites are being threatened by these cultural invaders, is something that the Donald Trump wing of the party has been using ever since Donald Trump stepped onto the national stage.\n\nThe article I wrote in The Nation was to point out that we don't have to memory hole what Donald Trump's history of racism has been, but, more importantly, also who has supported Donald Trump. Ever since he stepped onto the stage, every avowed racist in the country - Ku Klux Klaners, neo-Nazis, avowed fascists - have backed Donald Trump. And he's been able to get away with that kind of support, because in many ways the media has evaded questioning him about that.\n\nBut this has become the way in which the Republican Party in 2024, a party of grievance, extremism and racism, operates and functions. And so, it's really critical to not let this memory be lost of Donald Trump's policies and behavior over the last number of years, and how that has permeated the Republican Party.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : As you point out, in a recent interview in Time magazine, Trump suggested the problem was really anti-white racism. \"If you look right now, there's absolutely a bias against white [people] and that's a problem,\" Trump said. Your response, Professor Lusane?\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : So, Trump again is leaning in to his base. And what the data is showing is that for at least the last 10 years or so, if not even before then, that a majority of whites, and particularly Republican voters, believe that racism in this country exists against white people, that Black people, that Latinos, that Asians basically do not have issues with institutional or systemic racism, but it's actually whites that are being targeted.\n\nAnd this isn't just kind of rhetoric. This is actually manifesting itself both in the Republican Party platform and Republican Party activists. Stephen Miller, for example, who your earlier guest referenced, heads up America First Legal. Its entire purpose is to go after what they argue are racism, racist attacks against whites. So, America First Legal has filed lawsuit after lawsuit after lawsuit against private sector entities that they claim are discriminating particularly against white males.\n\nAnd so, when Donald Trump says that anti-white racism is actually a thing, he is very serious that his second administration, if he comes to power, will operate on that. He has pledged, for example, that he will end every DEI - diversity, equity and inclusion - program that exists anywhere in the federal government. Now, that's not just talking about specific programs about diversity; that's talking about any effort in any branch of government to recognize that there needs to be inclusive hiring, there needs to be inclusive policies. So, this is a very real tactic on the part of Donald Trump.\n\nThe problem is that it actually conflicts with what they're trying to do and win Black voters. Donald Trump recognizes that in the swing states - in Georgia, in Michigan, in Pennsylvania, in Wisconsin, in all of these key battleground states - the Black vote has been extremely decisive in helping the Democrats. So, they have to figure out a way to either drive down the vote for the Democrats or, if possible, if they can win votes. But that's very difficult to do, given Donald Trump's record and history.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On Monday, Democracy Now! 's Renée Feltz was on the floor of the convention. She spoke to a man wearing a large cowboy hat who was attending the RNC with members of the Florida delegation.\n\nLARRY WILCOXSON : Larry Wilcoxson, from Florida.\n\nRENÉE FELTZ : And are you here as part of the delegation?\n\nLARRY WILCOXSON : I'm just here.\n\nRENÉE FELTZ : All right. Can you say a little bit about why you're here?\n\nLARRY WILCOXSON : I'm here to support the president, Donald J. Trump. That's the only reason why I'll come here.\n\nRENÉE FELTZ : It sounded like he might have even been talking to people like you, his supporters, when he spoke about preserving Black jobs. Can you talk about, you know, what that might have meant to you? And what's the difference between Black jobs and other jobs, for example?\n\nLARRY WILCOXSON : See, I think a lot of stuff be taken out of context. And what he mean was just mid-level jobs. I mean, and that's just the truth, mid-level jobs as far as, like, trades. Those are mid-level jobs to me. And so, that's what he meant. And, yes, a lot of illegals are coming over here, a lot of migrants coming over here, and that's the jobs they're getting, because a lot of our own employees' employers, they're hiring those individuals for cheaper wages. And that's just the truth.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Your response, Professor Clarence Lusane?\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : So, when Donald Trump refers to \"the Black people\" and he refers to \"Black jobs,\" what he said is that his view of where Black people fit in this country, in employment, in culture and otherwise, is always at the bottom. Donald Trump never has anything positive to say about the Black community. He never talks about Black doctors, for example, or Black engineers or Black accountants or Black people who are in many, many different professions up and down the spectrum of employment. He essentially sees, through racist-tinted eyes, Black people at the very, very bottom. And that's how he sees immigrants, or, to be more precise, immigrants of color. And so, that's the conflict that he's trying to pitch.\n\nBut what the data shows, of course, what the Department of Labor shows, is that in every single area of occupation, you have Black people, you have Latinos, you have Asians, kind of across the spectrum. And so, Donald Trump, though, feeds into this narrative among conservatives that there are categories of work for certain people, and that that is how he then seeds attacking immigrants and creating, again, this conflict between the Black community and the immigrant community.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On Tuesday night, Democracy Now! 's Messiah Rhodes caught up with Forgiato Blow, a pro-Trump rapper, who debuted his video, \"Trump Trump Baby,\" featuring Amber Rose, at the RNC , a day after she spoke. This is what he said to Messiah.\n\nFORGIATO BLOW : I've been supporting Trump, like, die-hard since 2015. Before that, I was with Rick Ross, French Montana, a lot of big-name rappers, had a lot of big-name songs, so I was already very successful in that side of the industry, you know, grinding my way in.\n\nBut Donald Trump was like the boss. You know what I mean? He's getting money. He's a rapper's dream, you know? He's out here now dodging bullets, getting indictments. He's a real rapper.\n\nBut, you know, back in 2016, when he came in, it was just about proving people wrong. That's one thing I'm big on. Nobody believed that he would be the president. He knocked that door down, right?\n\nHe's very successful. He's made a lot of money. He's got the beautiful wife, nice cars. So, it was just, you know, being young, trying to chase that dream and be like Trump - you know what I'm saying? - and just have a positive role model to look up to. ...\n\nAnd even though at one time we didn't see eye to eye, I could bring you in. Amber Rose, she spoke yesterday. She's a model. She was big against Trump for years. I have a new video that just came out with her, a song called \"Trump Trump Baby.\" She's on the song. It's number eight on Billboard right now.\n\nBut the thing is, a lot of people don't realize, like, we need new voters. Right? So, when these people - like, you know, we're out here making all this content for Donald Trump and, you know, trying to sell Donald Trump on people, and they're not buying it, and then, when they finally buy it five years later, and we're like, \"Boo! You can't do it,\" that hurts us. We need to get the new voters. We need new voters and to get people equal opportunity.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Soon after they spoke, rapper Forgiato Blow and Amber Rose took the stage of the RNC .\n\nFORGIATO BLOW : Yeah, it's the mayor of Magaville, baby! Amber Rose! Hey, you know who we voting for! We voting Donald Trump, baby. Donald Trump, baby. America needs saving. America needs saving! We voting Trump, Trump, baby. Trump, Trump, baby. November 5th we going crazy. November 5th we going crazy!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's rapper Forgiato Blow and Amber Rose, \"Trump Trump Baby.\" Professor Clarence Lusane, your response to the appeal that President Trump is making right now and what rapper Forgiato Blow is saying?\n\nCLARENCE LUSANE : So, what we see with Forgiato Blow and Amber Rose, as well as the Black congressmembers, Republican congressmembers, that they're bringing on stage is this effort to basically gaslight the Black community on what really has been the Donald Trump record. And so, what we see is this argument that the Democrats have for decades created the circumstances under which Black people are living in the worst conditions possible, and that somehow Donald Trump will be able to overcome that, although there's literally no record of that.\n\nTim Scott, for example, who's the senator from South Carolina, gave a speech on Monday where he argued that racism - America is not a racist country, that, essentially, racial discrimination, systemic and institutional, don't exist. In fact, Tim Scott should look at his own state, South Carolina. South Carolina is one of the poorest states in the country, as are many of the states that are controlled by the Republican Party. In South Carolina, the governor is Republican. The two senators to the Congress are Republicans. Six out of the seven House members are Republican, James Clyburn being the exception. The state Legislature, controlled by Republicans. And what we see is this is a state where poverty is high, is above the national average. But then, when you break it down, about 9% to 10% of whites in the state fall under that poverty line, but almost 25%, almost a quarter, of Black people. How do you explain that? Tim Scott explains it by saying that, essentially, it's those people's fault. It has nothing to do with the policies of the state, has nothing to do with systemic racism.\n\nBut we're talking generations of ways in which people, again, across these Republican states have been mired in poverty, and, again, disproportionately racialized. And if you look at educational attainment, you look at access to healthcare, in all of these situations, racial disparities tend to manifest. But none of this is being addressed by the Tim Scotts, the Ben Carsons, the Amber Roses and the other people of color that they're putting on stage at the Republican convention, because those are inconvenient truths.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Clarence Lusane, I want to thank you for being with us, political science professor at Howard University, director of the International Affairs Program there. His piece in The Nation , we'll link to, headlined \"Don't Believe Trump When He Claims He's Not Racist.\"\n\nComing up, a jury has convicted New Jersey Democratic Senator Bob Menendez. We'll get more.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

The book, \"I Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump's Catastrophic Final Year,\" details how the country's top general, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Mark Milley, feared Trump would wage a coup after losing the November election, among other revelations. We speak with co-authors Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, who say their reporting unearthed \"a lot of things that made our jaws drop to the ground.\" In an interview for the book, Trump said his only regret during his last year in office was not deploying the military against Black Lives Matter protesters. \"He wanted to use active-duty troops on the streets of America's cities to combat American protesters who were exercising their First Amendment rights,\" says Rucker.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I'm Nermeen Shaikh, with Juan González.\n\nWe end today's show with the authors of a new book that debuted last week at number one of the best-seller list, I Alone Can Fix It: Donald J.Trump's Catastrophic Final Year . The book is by two Washington Post reporters: White House bureau chief Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig, a longtime investigative reporter. Their book sheds new light on what happened during the early days of the pandemic, how Trump responded to the deadly January 6th insurrection, and alleges the nation's top general, Mark Milley, feared Trump would wage a coup after losing the November election. Rucker and Leonnig are both Pulitzer Prize winners and also co-authors of the 2020 best-seller, A Very Stable Genius: Donald J. Trump's Testing of America .\n\nWelcome to Democracy Now! Carol, let's begin with you. This is your second book on Trump. You both reported extensively on his administration. Talk about what you found in this book. What was most striking?\n\nCAROL LEONNIG : Yes, there were a lot of things that made our jaws drop to the ground, but I think that the most striking was just the degree to which people who wanted to serve Donald Trump, people that were ardent supporters in his White House, in his Cabinet, in his administration, how much they were nearly in panic about the impulses of the president, the degree to which he was willing to put American lives in peril, and actually how much he was willing to risk the democracy, again, all for his short-term political gain, his own personal profit.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Phil, you write that Trump told you it was his greatest regret that he did not deploy the military to shut down last year's protests over the police killings of George Floyd, saying, quote, \"I think if I had to do it again, I would have brought in the military immediately.\" Could you talk about that?\n\nPHILIP RUCKER : That's right. When Carol and I sat down with President Trump, former President Trump, earlier this spring for an interview, an extensive interview for this book, he said his only regret from that final year as president was how he handled the Black Lives Matter protests and that he wished he had followed his impulse, his gut, to send in the military immediately into Portland and Seattle and Minneapolis, D.C., all these cities where demonstrations were taking place. He wanted to use active-duty troops on the streets of America's cities to combat American protesters who were exercising their First Amendment rights. It was pretty chilling for us to hear him say that.\n\nAnd the book details a lot of reporting, scenes that happened behind closed doors, where the defense secretary and attorney general and the aforementioned chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff were trying to persuade Trump not to send in the military and explaining how that would be so inappropriate and not justified. But Trump said, after the fact, that he regretted not doing so.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And you also report - I guess perhaps the most shocking revelation is how the top generals in the U.S. military were responding to Trump. You say that Joint Chiefs of Staff General Mark Milley was so afraid that Trump would attempt a coup that he and other top officials discussed a plan to resign one by one, rather than carry out orders from Trump that they consider to be illegal. Could you elaborate on that further?\n\nCAROL LEONNIG : You know, this was a very frightening moment for us to learn, as well. Remember, we were covering this administration in real time. So, we thought we did a pretty good job at the first draft of history for The Washington Post . And then, when we excavated this time, we found out there was a lot more fear within the Pentagon and at the highest levels. These were people who had been to combat multiple times, and yet they were quite worried about what Donald Trump might do.\n\nAs Chairman Milley told confidants and colleagues, he became convinced that President Trump was trying to get his hands on the so-called guys with the guns - the agencies like the FBI , the CIA and the Defense Department. And the military leaders that he worked with, the other Joint Chiefs, and he began meeting to talk about how would they block the president from something that was illegal or dangerous for the country, some sort of deployment of the military that they thought was wholly inappropriate. And their plan, or their plot, their counterplot, was to essentially decide that they would resign one by one, a serial reverse Saturday night massacre, if you will, the idea being that each one of them had a legal duty to give the president their best military advice, and if he were to order something, each one of them would request a meeting whereby they could give him their advice and then then resign, almost like in slow motion. Again, they were throwing their bodies in front of something dangerous. That was their plan.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, Carol, I'd like to go to another facet of the last year of Trump's administration that you cover extensively in the book, beginning with this clip from your two-hour interview with former President Trump in which he refers to the, quote, \"loving crowd\" during the deadly January 6th insurrection.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : I would venture to say I think it was the largest crowd I've ever spoken before. It went from that point, which is almost at the White House, to beyond the Washington Monument. It was - and wide. And -\n\nCAROL LEONNIG : But if you could have waved your want -\n\nDONALD TRUMP : And it was a loving crowd, too, by the way. There was a lot of love. I've heard that from everybody. Many, many people have told me. That was a loving crowd.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : When Capitol Police officers testified last week at the first hearing of a House committee investigating the deadly January 6th riots, Capitol Police Sergeant Aquilino Gonell responding to Trump's comment.\n\nSGT . AQUILINO GONELL : If that was hugs and kisses, then we should all go to his house and do the same thing to him. To me, it's insulting and it's demoralizing, because everything that we did was to prevent everyone in the Capitol from getting hurt, and what he was doing, instead of sending the military, instead of sending the support or telling his people, his supporters, to stop this nonsense, he egged them to continue fighting.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And meanwhile, as we reported earlier in headlines, a fourth Washington, D.C.-area police officer who responded to the violent January 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol has now died by suicide. So, Carol, could you respond to this latest news and also what Trump said in his interview with you on the so-called loving crowd?\n\nCAROL LEONNIG : You know, there couldn't be a more stark split screen between officer Gonell, Metropolitan Police officer Fanone, what they actually experienced, what they told the public that medieval combat was like as they tried to protect the lawmakers and the staffers on the Hill who were scrambling for their lives from Donald Trump's supporters, from chants of execution for Vice President Pence - that's one side of the screen. And on the other side of the screen is Donald Trump sitting down with Phil and with me in Mar-a-Lago and explaining that this was a loving crowd, that he was watching them on television and he felt very supported by them, glad that they were going to \"stop the steal,\" that they were going to show their support for the fact that he believed the election was rigged - though there's no evidence for it - and they were going to help him stay in power.\n\nI thought that officer Gonell's remarks about the fact that he's still trying to recover from those hugs and kisses that Donald Trump told us the protesters were giving was really on the mark. There were no Capitol Police officers warmly ushering in these individuals, as President Trump - former President Trump told Phil and me when we were visiting with him. There was no love. There was a threat of death. There were chants for hanging Mike Pence. There were officers who were screaming for their lives, and, as officer Gonell described, literally having a heart attack, having the wherewithal to call out to the people around him, \"Please don't take my gun. Please don't hurt me. I have children.\" Donald Trump was in a room watching television while that was happening.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Phil Rucker, the first section of your book deals with President Trump's response to the biggest crisis of his presidency, clearly: the COVID pandemic.\n\nPHILIP RUCKER : Yeah.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And he told you that \"I think we did a great job on COVID , and it hasn't been recognized.\" Could you talk about his paranoia on believing that the drug manufacturers actually tried to delay the COVID vaccine in order to hurt his election chances?\n\nPHILIP RUCKER : Sure. You know, Trump seemed to think that all of his enemies, his perceived enemies, were out to get him during the COVID pandemic, in part because he saw the pandemic through the prism of his reelection chances. He thought he was on a glide path to winning a second term before COVID arrived and that COVID spoiled his chances of winning the election last November.\n\nHe had particular disdain for pharmaceutical companies, for drugmakers, in part because of some tensions earlier in the administration between the industry and his administration. But during COVID , he thought that they were slow-walking the development of a vaccine. He thought it was imperative that he have a vaccine or multiple vaccines developed, tested and ready to be distributed before Election Day, so that he could get political credit for that. And when that did not become a possibility, he became enraged.\n\nAnd he was especially angry at Pfizer, because Pfizer made their announcement about a week or so after the election, that their first COVID vaccine had met the mark, and Trump thought that was intentionally delayed to hurt him politically. There, of course, is no evidence to support that claim, but it does show you a little bit the paranoia in Trump's mind that he thought individuals, but also companies, industries were plotting to try to undermine his political standing.\n\nJUAN GONZÁLEZ: And, Carol, I wanted to ask you about this, Trump's conviction or clear belief that he was going to win on election night, and his reaction as the numbers came in that night and the days that followed. Also, if you could talk about the role of Rudy Giuliani? I mean, I covered Rudy Giuliani throughout his period when he was mayor of New York, and I always believed back then that there was something not right about him, but most people then didn't agree. But talk about the relationship between Giuliani and Trump, if you can, as well.\n\nCAROL LEONNIG : Of course. You know, the conviction issue that you mention is so interesting, because what Phil and I learned was that in the days before the election, President Trump had been warned multiple times that this was going to be a hard slog and that the odds were not great. You know, people who were paid to tell him that the odds were great were warning him that it didn't look so good, that Biden's poll numbers were quite strong.\n\nAnd, in fact, we learned that, unbeknownst to us when we were reporting in real time, that Bill Barr called the defense secretary the night before the election to say that he had learned from White House sources that the president, whether he won or not, was planning to declare that night, election night, that he had won, before all the ballots were counted, that that was sort of a plan that was being cooked up. And it's unclear where Bill Barr heard this, but it was from inside the White House.\n\nSo, the conviction that President Trump had that he was going to win or had won really started to solidify after he lost. His conviction that it had been stolen from him was what got more calcified as time went on. The reason is, he basically shut out those people, those adults who were explaining to him that he had lost, people he had trusted and had his confidants alongside him for years, people like Hope Hicks, who counseled him that he was ruining his legacy, that he needed to think about graciously and appropriately conceding, people like Kellyanne Conway, who said she really didn't see the evidence and asked the president to either produce it or think about a plan B for stepping away.\n\nAnd what's interesting about Rudy is he represents the group of individuals on that fringe who were spinning increasingly fanatical tales of how this election was stolen, though Bill Barr had a team of Department of Justice prosecutors and also FBI agents, ultimately, underneath him investigating these claims. He warned the president they had looked into all of them, they were nonsense, they were BS. But Rudy kept insisting they were true. On election night, he was the voice who said, \"Just declare victory. Just say you won,\" even as important swing states were coming down for Biden and looked like they were going to go for Biden pretty strongly.\n\nSo, Rudy was warned, actually, and this is sort of the most colossal fall from grace that I think I've seen in covering politicians and government officials. This was \"America's mayor.\" This was one of the strongest, most revered federal prosecutors in the country. Chris Christie, governor of New Jersey, former, warned Rudy in a phone call after the election that he was ruining his legacy and that he was becoming a joke on late-night television. And Rudy hollered back at him and said, you know, \"I'm fighting for now. Who cares about legacy? I'm fighting for today.\" But everything he was fighting for was a mirage.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, speaking of today, let's talk about what prospects Trump has in a possible future  campaign. New federal campaign finance filings show that Trump has raised more funds than other Republicans in online donations during the first half of this year, entering July with more than $100 million from his 2021 political committee. Some say Trump is pursuing a, quote, \"shadow presidency\" as he plans to run again in 2024. On Friday, Mark Meadows, former chief of staff for the Trump White House, told Newsmax Trump is now meeting with people he called cabinet members at his golf resort in New Jersey.\n\nMARK MEADOWS : We met with some of our cabinet members tonight. We actually had a follow-up member - meeting with some of our cabinet members. And as we were looking in that, we're looking at what does come next. I'm not authorized to speak on behalf of the president.\n\nSTEVE CORTES : OK.\n\nMARK MEADOWS : But I can tell you this, Steve: We wouldn't be meeting tonight if we weren't making plans to move forward in a real way with President Trump -\n\nSTEVE CORTES : OK.\n\nMARK MEADOWS : - at the head of that ticket.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Philip Rucker, your response, and on the question, in particular, on continuing Republican support for Trump?\n\nPHILIP RUCKER : Yeah. Well, look, the Republican support continues to be very strong for Donald Trump. He is by far the most popular figure in Republican politics today. He has made no secret about his desire to run for president again in 2024. And when Carol and I sat down with him, it was clear to us that he wanted back in the game, that he sort of had that itch to get into the arena again. He has a lot of time left before he has to make that decision about whether to actually launch a campaign for 2024, but all signs point towards the likely possibility that he does. And if he were to run, you know, barring some change in the political environment, he would almost certainly become the Republican presidential nominee. He is that popular in his party right now.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Thank you so much, Philip Rucker, Carol Leonnig, co-authors of I Alone Can Fix It: Donald J. Trump's Catastrophic Final Year . And that does it for the show. I'm Nermeen Shaikh, with Juan González. Stay safe.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Trump began with a somber recounting of what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania, when a bullet grazed his right ear, and soon went off script to deliver a rambling diatribe against various political enemies and repeatedly demonized immigrants. \"The first three or four days of the convention were pitched as a display of unity,\" says Benjamin Wallace-Wells of The New Yorker , who says the nominee \"got in the way\" of the party's plans. \"Trump was just straightforwardly weird.\" Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Maria Hinojosa, founder of Futuro Media, says the vicious anti-immigrant rhetoric from Trump and almost every other speaker throughout the week is built on lies. \"If everything that he said is true, then our American economy would be tanking, right? And, actually, there would be rampant crime across the streets. That is not the truth. And even Trump supporters ... know that's not the truth,\" says Hinojosa. We also speak with former Ohio state Senator Nina Turner, who says both Trump and his running mate JD Vance are promoting a false populism that does not actually support workers or challenge the power of big money. \"We do need a president that will put the working-class people ahead of corporations. We do need a president that will line up the supposed values of this country with policy. The problem is, President Donald J. Trump is not it, and neither is JD Vance,\" says Turner, a senior fellow at The New School's Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Donald Trump accepted the Republican nomination on Thursday night, just five days after surviving an assassination attempt. Trump gave the longest acceptance speech in convention history, clocking in at over 90 minutes. He began by recounting what happened in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday after a bullet grazed his right ear as he was giving a speech.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : I stand before you in this arena only by the grace of Almighty God. In watching the reports over the last few days, many people say it was a providential moment. Probably was.\n\nWhen I rose, surrounded by Secret Service, the crowd was confused because they thought I was dead. And there was great, great sorrow. I could see that on their faces as I looked out. They didn't know I was looking out. They thought it was over. But I could see it, and I wanted to do something to let them know I was OK. I raised my right arm, looked at the thousands and thousands of people that were breathlessly waiting, and started shouting, \"Fight! Fight! Fight!\"\n\nCROWD : Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight! Fight!\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : During his acceptance speech, Trump repeatedly demonized migrants seeking refuge in the United States. Trump vowed to carry out the largest deportation campaign in U.S. history.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : The greatest invasion in history is taking place right here in our country. They are coming in from every corner of the Earth, not just from South America, but from Africa, Asia, the Middle East. They're coming from everywhere. They're coming at levels that we've never seen before. It is an invasion indeed. And this administration does absolutely nothing to stop them.\n\nThey're coming from prisons. They're coming from jails. They're coming from mental institutions and insane asylums. I - you know, the press is always on me because I say this. Has anyone seen Silence of the Lambs ? The late great Hannibal Lecter, he'd love to have you for dinner. That's insane asylums. They're emptying out their insane asylums. And terrorists are coming in at numbers that we've never seen before. Bad things are going to happen. ...\n\nThat's why, to keep our families safe, the Republican platform promises to launch the largest deportation operation in the history of our country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Donald Trump was introduced by Dana White, chief executive of UFC , Ultimate Fighting Championship. The evening also featured musician Kid Rock and the wrestling legend Hulk Hogan.\n\nHULK HOGAN : But what happened last week, when they took a shot at my hero and they tried to kill the next president of the United States, enough was enough! And I said, \"Let Trumpamania run wild, brother! Let Trumpamania rule again! Let Trumpamania make America great again!\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Hulk Hogan's appearance at the RNC may surprise many, but he actually has something in common with Trump's running mate, JD Vance. Both have ties to the right-wing billionaire tech investor Peter Thiel. Thiel reportedly spent as much as $10 million to help Hulk Hogan sue the website Gawker.com. The successful lawsuit brought down the website. Thiel also spent $10 million to help JD Vance get elected to the Senate in 2022.\n\nTo talk more about Donald Trump and the state of the Republican Party, we're joined by two guests.\n\nBenjamin Wallace-Wells is with us. He's a staff writer at The New Yorker . His most recent piece is headlined \"The Rise of the New Right at the Republican National Convention.\" He's joining us here in Milwaukee, just after the conclusion of the Republican National Convention.\n\nAnd Maria Hinojosa is with us, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist and founder of Futuro Media. She is the host of Latino USA , joining us from New York.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! We're going to begin with Maria. What is stunning, and it's not just last night, Thursday night, when President Trump, the former president, hoping he'll be not only 45 but 47 - which was on everyone's baseball caps - it was not only his longest speech in convention history, but in almost all of the references of speakers throughout the week, if there was a theme, it was attacking immigrants every which way - as murderers, as drug dealers, the assault, the invasion from the border. Can you talk, overall - you were just in Milwaukee - about the significance of what has just taken place here?\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : My god, Amy. You know, if I let it actually get into my heart, I would want to start crying, which I'm not going to do because I'm a seasoned journalist. But when you kind of lay it out that way, Amy, that's the reason why I wasn't tuning in every night, because it is all - and I'm sorry to say - but it is lies. Right? That's ultimately what we're talking about here.\n\nWhat we do know is that the Republican platform under Donald Trump is very clear. It is, over and over and over, about attacking immigrants, refugees, migrants and travelers. What we don't have on the other side, in terms of the Democratic Party, is a response to that, right? There isn't a response to \"build the wall,\" which is precisely what we need.\n\nIn the case of the Republican National Convention, you know, having been in Milwaukee - which, by the way, is a hugely immigrant city. Milwaukee - I don't know you, you probably haven't had the opportunity - has an extraordinary street food culture of tacos, very particularly tacos. They love their tacos in Milwaukee. And so, this notion that you have a Republican convention in a city that has a huge immigration population, undocumented and documented, but somehow everybody's safe in Milwaukee, it does not jibe with the narrative, the constant narrative of what Donald Trump says about who we are.\n\nAnd again, Amy, what we know - it's not me. Of course, I travel across the country. I'm at the border. I talk to immigrants and refugees every single day of my life. But we know what the Justice Department has said. We know what the FBI has said, that crime over the past three decades has decreased by 49% in the United States. And meanwhile, what the Congressional Budget Office has said is that immigration and immigrants are going to grow the American economy by $7 trillion over the next decade. You cannot have it both ways.\n\nThe role of the journalist is to not repeat the lies of an authoritarian. That's why what's happened at this Republican National Convention is so problematic for me as a journalist, because we cannot be the ones who are repeating these claims and then not doing the work of constantly doing the fact-checking. It's impossible to do, with a convention that we have now seen is, essentially, specifically on the question of immigration, lying over and over and over again.\n\nIt's - again, I'm sorry I got emotional. I hate when that happens. But when you kind of hear it one by one by one - and I'm just like, \"Where do I live? What country do I live in?\" Because if everything that he said is true, then our American economy would be tanking, right? And, actually, there would be rampant crime across the streets. That is not the truth. And even Trump supporters can say that, because if they just open their eyes, they know that's not the truth.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And, Maria, could you explain what you think the effects of and the influence of JD Vance, the selection that Trump made as his running mate, his vice president?\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : Well, I actually think - I actually think it's a really smart choice. I'm trying to understand JD Vance's motivations behind his decision to push to become Trump's vice president, considering that he was a Never Trumper for a chunk of his earlier political career. I think he is an attractive person. You know, when people talk about, you know, once Trump dies, what's going to happen with the MAGA movement, actually, you can see it following under someone like JD Vance. So, it's a good choice if you believe in that entire rhetoric.\n\nThe problem with JD Vance is that he's been on the record so many times, right? And the record does not forget when you say things about Donald Trump and how much you can't stand him and how much he's a problem for the country and how you don't trust him and how, on the question of immigration, he's wrong. And then, now you have JD Vance fawning over Donald Trump. So, there's definitely some interest on his part. And, of course, I would love to speak with his wife, who is an immigrant, to understand just how she's putting this all together.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : So, Benjamin, could you talk about -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : His wife's parents are immigrants.\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : Thank you for the correction.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Ben, if you could talk about the - your reflections on the convention last night? You also covered the 2016 convention.\n\nBENJAMIN WALLACE - WELLS : Yes.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And you were there last night when Trump - you were on the convention floor when Trump gave his over-90-minute speech. Your response?\n\nBENJAMIN WALLACE - WELLS : Well, it was a very interesting turn. The first three or four days of the convention were pitched as a display of unity, you know, and, to a degree, normality. You know, in 2016, there had been tremendous protests, counterprotests, both outside of the hall from activists who opposed Trump, but also inside of it from delegates and other candidates. You know, Ted Cruz famously gave a speech in which he declined to endorse Trump. And it was really a very contested and tense, menacing sort of event. This was supposed to be the smooth, you know, made-for-TV, everybody's-on-the-same-team Republican Party. And for a while, for a while, for the first two, two-and-a-half days, it kind of looked that way. You know, there wasn't so much difference between the MAGA wing of the party and the traditional Republican small-government conservative wing. People seemed to accept JD Vance, who had been seen previously as maybe a little bit of a populist insurgent, as, you know, Trump's heir and a central part of this movement.\n\nI think last night threw a lot of that into question. Trump was just straightforwardly weird. You know, he began with this kind of odd but interesting account of his shooting - I mean, just a horrifying event and, you know, in some ways, sort of historic to get a first-person account of it. But he went on for another hour. He, you know, had no clear message to deliver. He was supposed to be talking to swing voters. He didn't offer them very much. And so, you know, there's a way in which the whole party seemed to set up this convention as a way to declare, \"We're done with 2016. We're done with all of that internal and external conflict. We're about to win a big victory,\" they thought, you know. And Trump sort of got in the way.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to stick with Peter Thiel. You know, at the beginning of this, we talked about Hulk Hogan's appearance. You have Hulk Hogan. You have Kid Rock grabbing his crotch. You know, you have [ UFC ] - right? - the head, Dana White, introducing Trump. And he talked about how important that was. But what isn't so obvious, as we said, this whole issue of Peter Thiel's connection, the billionaire's connection to Hulk Hogan, that he is the right-wing billionaire who reportedly spent as much as $10 million to help Hulk Hogan sue the website Gawker.com, ultimately taking down the website. That was the same amount of money that Thiel spent to help get Vance elected to the Senate in 2022. Talk about who Peter Thiel is and why this matters.\n\nBENJAMIN WALLACE - WELLS : It's a really important question, and I think, you know, the money in Silicon Valley and sort of this kind of dissident right money in Silicon Valley is moving through a lot right now, including at this event, this convention.\n\nYou know, Thiel is a billionaire. He was one of the founders of PayPal and then one of the most influential investors in other technology companies in Silicon Valley. He's, you know, quite right-wing. He came from a sort of libertarian politics. And, you know, in 2016, he spoke at the Republican National Convention, and his support of Trump was, at the time, crucial to grounding him as sort of, you know, not just a TV star or an extremist, but somebody who had support within the business community.\n\nYou know, Vance's career, I think, would not be possible without Peter Thiel. That $10 million in the 2022 Senate election pushed -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In Ohio.\n\nBENJAMIN WALLACE - WELLS : In Ohio - pushed him up into a - to make him a sort of legitimate candidate, at a time when the Republican establishment in Ohio, though there wasn't one particular candidate it was behind, didn't know him very well and wasn't backing him.\n\nI think it's important to dwell not just on Thiel here, but on the question of sort of Silicon Valley money. Elon Musk this week pledged $45 million a month to support a Trump super PAC from here until the election.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, we're talking almost $200 million.\n\nBENJAMIN WALLACE - WELLS : Just an - a fifth of what the whole 2016 campaign for Trump cost. You know, just an astonishing amount of money. And up until fairly recently, one of the big dramas around Trump's campaign was whether he could actually raise any money. Donors had backed away from him, you know, in part because of his many trials and the questions about whether he'd continue through the election. And so, you know, this is a situation where you have a relatively few people who have been able to sort of bail out both of the men at the top of the Republican ticket.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : On Peter Thiel, people talk about in some of his crazier other ideas. What are those ideas?\n\nBENJAMIN WALLACE - WELLS : You know, this is a little bit outside of my immediate memory, so I don't know how much I can give you here. But he has, you know, talked in very sort of sweeping terms about his pessimism that American society as a democracy can continue to exist. He's promoted seasteading and, you know, other efforts to build alternate colonies. It gets into pretty weird stuff pretty quickly.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to go back to Maria Hinojosa, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist, joining us from Bethlehem, Connecticut, though she was recently here in Milwaukee. About JD Vance, this quote - you know, you talked about him being a Never Trumper and then becoming a - I don't know if it's a Forever Trumper or at least a Trumper for Now, now the vice-presidential nominee. You have his comments back in 2016, where JD Vance said, \"Trump makes people I care about afraid. Immigrants, Muslims, etc. Because of this, I find him reprehensible. God wants better of us,\" Vance wrote. Maria?\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : Right. And that is on the record, so you can't walk away from that, JD Vance. Again, it's almost as if JD Vance -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What is - by the way, I should say - Maria, what I should say, when we ask all about, you know, the fact that he called Trump \"America's Hitler,\" etc., I'm asking senators about this, I'm asking delegates about this. What did, for example, Ron Johnson say, the Wisconsin senator, when I said, \"What do you say, that he says 'America's Hitler'?\" There is a talking point on this: \"Then he met him.\" That's what they say. He changed.\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : Right. But, actually, what I was going to say is the opposite of that, that it wasn't that moment when he met him, but, rather, that JD Vance began to believe all of the mis- and disinformation that has been repeated over and over and over by this candidate and the party, and that he somehow - because, Amy, the biggest problem that I have with this moment in our country is the disconnect between what we are being told by Trump and the Republican Party and MAGA versus what is real life. Yes, there is no denying that inflation is a real issue. No doubt. But when he talks about the question of immigration and crime and the economy and the stealing of jobs, you know, it's just not jibing with what we see.\n\nYou're right: I am in Bethlehem, Connecticut. It's actually - where I am right now is a red part of the state. And what I see in my little community - right? - are people who have never been to the border, never very much interacted with anyone who speaks Spanish, let's just say. But we are here, immigrants, in this community, in Bethlehem. We are working. You can see us, actually, through the diner, that doesn't have a wall, where you can actually see who's cooking and cleaning. So, they're actually here. You see them. They're making your food. They're cleaning your lawns. They're in the hospitals, you know, as clinicians, as doctors, etc. This does not jibe with the rhetoric of our country is being overwhelmed by a criminal immigrant element.\n\nSo, that is where JD Vance, you know, who once was considered something of an ally to immigrants because of the way he spoke, because of this kind of Midwest kind of certainty about the presence of immigrants and refugees, now goes in complete opposition to what he was saying before.\n\nThe problem, Amy, is that you and I are New Yorkers, right? We have been in New York for decades. And so, the notion of Donald Trump is actually - I mean, again, I hate to say this, but we all know that he's a con man. You understand this as a New Yorker. He's the guy who's doing the three-card monte. And so, what we have to understand is that the rest of the country actually falls for the three-card monte, as many of them do when they come to New York. And they're just like, \"Wait, what just happened? I lost 20 bucks.\" It's like, yeah, you have to have your wits about you.\n\nSo, for me, again, it's a smart choice, actually, for JD Vance. And I think you're exactly right. He's a For Now Trumper. I don't know about the Forever Trumper, but he is absolutely a good continuation for what Donald Trump has started. Where he will go, who knows? Maybe that's his play. I have a hard time kind of believing that. But nonetheless, I still think it was a smart choice.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Maria, let's just go to some of the claims that Trump made last night. You have, unlike most, direct knowledge of what the situation is at the border, having been several times in the last four months. So, if you could explain what you saw, as against the things that Trump said, and then also explain how Trump's policies, what he's proposing now, are different or similar to what he pursued in his first term?\n\nMARIA HINOJOSA : Well, so, I just got back. I was only there once in the last four months. And we were on the border just south of Tucson, in the Tucson sector, at a place called Sasabe.\n\nI mean, the important thing for people to know - and I know they're kind of like, \"Wait, what is\" - where we were, it was 21 miles of wall with 19 openings. And you're like, \"Wait, what did she just say?\" So, this \"wall\" that Trump built - and, of course, as you know, it was Bill Clinton who started the wall, just to be clear. This was not a Trump wall that he built. He made reparations. He increased the height from 15 feet to 30 feet, which is actually very important, because when you go up to 30 feet, if you're trying to climb the wall, that's at the point where you develop vertigo. So the number of traumatic brain injuries from people actually trying to climb now a 30-foot wall has increased by pretty extraordinary percentages. But you have these openings through the wall. It doesn't make sense. That's why I'm trying to explain to people. They're like, \"Wait, wait. There's a wall, 21 miles, but you have 19 openings.\" Therefore, if you are a migrant or a refugee, you're getting a mixed message. And as the Border Patrol told me when we were there, this is but a speed bump. It does not keep people out.\n\nSo, when I was there, on the day that I was there, in the height of the invasion, I saw three people? Two people. Two people who actually crossed across the wall and then knelt - they were kneeling down and praying once they had gotten onto the U.S. side of the wall. They were not running from the Border Patrol. They were not escaping. They were not carrying drugs or weapons or anything. They were praying. And they were transported by good Samaritans to a now-makeshift refugee camp that exists on the U.S. side of the border, where migrants and refugees will wait for the Border Patrol to come to pick them up.\n\nSo, the reality of the border has changed, yes, because people understand you can no longer run from the Border Patrol. You know, actually, the Border Patrol is going to try to disperse you. Usually, you get injured when that happens. And so, now you cross, and you just sit down. It's kind of like this peaceful protest, of nonviolent protest, of just like, \"I'm just going to sit and wait.\" So, this goes completely differently to what we are being told is happening on the border.\n\nAnd why are there large numbers of people when they do come is because of Title 42 and precisely the \"Remain in Mexico\" policy, which force people to stay. So, this country's policies created that stopgap. There are always people coming and going. And again, if it was true, what Donald Trump says, that immigrants are destroying the American economy, then we would not have factual information that says the American economy is growing, right? So we have to put that into perspective.\n\nNow, what Donald Trump is saying about the greatest mass deportation ever seen in American history, what does that look like? You know, we've already lived through this. We lived through this, actually, during the middle of the George W. Bush administration, which was the uptick, post-9/11, of the immigration-detention-and-deportation-mass-industrial complex, starts around 2003, 2004. We see it increase with Barack Obama - his biggest mistake, that he should apologize for, because if he had done immigration reform, we would not be in this position with Donald Trump. So, I'm sorry, Barack Obama, but you need to accept responsibility for that reality. It increases under Donald Trump, to a point where, yeah, it's about taking children away from parents. So, that is where we have gone. It's not just building the wall. It's that we're going to take children away from parents. So, I think it is going to be - it's going to be an attempt to do this on steroids.\n\nLet me just finish by saying more money is spent on immigration detention and deportation in terms of law enforcement than all federal law enforcement agencies combined. And the Border Patrol is the largest law enforcement agency in the country. So we are facing a reality where people are like, \"Oh, it's just going to affect immigrants.\" No. And I say this: If you are an American citizen of any sort, you're going to need to figure out how you're going to show your papers to a Border Patrol agent, because it can happen. That's kind of where we're going. I think people are like, \"Oh, it's just never going to touch me. It's just them.\" It will touch you.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : Well, I want to bring into this conversation, in Cleveland, Ohio, the home state of Trump's vice-presidential running mate, JD Vance, Nina Turner, former Ohio state senator. She's a senior fellow at the Institute on Race, Power and Political Economy. She was a national surrogate for Bernie Sanders in 2016 and the national co-chair of his 2020 presidential campaign.\n\nNina Turner, welcome back to Democracy Now! If you could begin by responding to Trump's speech at the Republican National Convention last night?\n\nNINA TURNER : Well, it was really Trump being Trump, his bluster. The way he - I mean, there was not a whole lot of vision there. It was him complaining, as he does, and taking credit for \"every wonderful thing\" - I put that in air quotes - that has ever happened in America, and blaming every terrible thing on the Democrats. No surprise that he walked his crowd through minute by minute almost of the assassination attempt, to get his crowd riled up. So, it was Trump in rare form, doing what he does, which is to be able to be a faux populist, lying through his teeth in terms of his exaggerations. And quite frankly, any of the working-class people in that crowd should be afraid. They should be very afraid.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I wanted to play for you, state Senator - former state Senator Turner, a part of JD Vance's speech Wednesday night at the RNC .\n\nSEN . JD VANCE : Now, my work taught me that there is still so much talent and grit in the American heartland. There really is. But for these places to thrive, my friends, we need a leader who fights for the people who built this country. We need a leader who's not in the pocket of big business but answers to the workingman, union and nonunion alike, a leader who won't sell out to multinational corporations but will stand up for American companies and American industry, a leader who rejects Joe Biden and Kamala Harris's Green New Scam and fights to bring back our great American factories. We need President Donald J. Trump.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that was JD Vance on Wednesday night. Nina Turner, if you can talk about everything from the - what they're calling now, and it's a buzzword here - \"Green New Scam,\" instead of the \"Green New Deal\"? He was talking about the Teamsters president, Sean O'Brien, addressing the Republican convention. Last night, President Trump wasn't naming many names, but he definitely named Shawn Fain's name, the head of the UAW , attacking him viciously. If you can explain the significance of what both JD Vance and Trump are getting at?\n\nNINA TURNER : Yeah, President Trump is picking the wrong fight with President Shawn Fain. As we know, the Summer of Solidarity was a spectacular success. President Fain and other unions are calling for a national strike to happen in 2028. And I hope that that is the case, where workers from all backgrounds, all walks of life unite in solidarity to push back against the billionaire class and the corporate interests in this country that don't want to see working-class people live a good life.\n\nNow, JD Vance, Amy, in some of that speech, I was shaking my head. Yeah, we do need a president that will put the working-class people ahead of corporations. We do need a president that will line up the supposed values of this countries with policy. The problem is, President Donald J. Trump is not it, and neither is JD Vance.\n\nI'm old enough to remember when he came to - JD Vance - the \"he\" being JD Vance - went to the picket line of one of the UAW sites here in Ohio and was greeted by Congresswoman - none other than Congresswoman Marcy Kaptur, and she quipped at him, \"Is this your first time here?\" And he nervously shook his head, yeah, it was his first time here. She exposed him, in very few words, that he came to that picket line for show. He did not come to that picket line to stand in solidarity with working-class people, particularly those of the UAW .\n\nAnd then we see that President Donald J. Trump is slamming the UAW . I want him to know - and he has to know this - that President Shawn Fain is a street fighter. So, I can't wait to see how this unfolds. The UAW is already out on social media making it very clear that President Donald J. Trump is a - he's a scab, that he will not stand up for working-class people.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ben Wallace-Wells, we can't finish this conversation without talking about what's happening outside the Republican National Convention, and that's on the Democratic side.\n\nBENJAMIN WALLACE - WELLS : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This latest news of, you know, President Biden now has COVID . He's in isolation. Enormous pressure from the centrist Democrats and many others - although the progressive Squad and Bernie Sanders have still embraced him - saying he's got to pull out of the race.\n\nBENJAMIN WALLACE - WELLS : Yes, not only that, but he's been struggling to raise any money at all right now. I think when we look at what happened in the Republican convention - and some of your viewers may be thinking, you know, \"How is this going unchecked?\" You know, the reason it's going unchecked is that Biden has been in such decline. He has been unable to prosecute a case against the Republicans, against what's happening in the convention, for a while. And some of that is because he is, you know, caught up in this drama over his own campaign and whether it will survive. But some of it is also because he just lacks the energy and political coherence that he had even a few months ago.\n\nAnd so, all of this, you know, all of these dynamics that we're talking about around the convention, around its anti-immigrant aggression, around the populism, the natural counterpoint to that should be an aggressive Democratic pushback. Right now we're not getting it. And that is why there's such a strong push from the Democratic Party, from many, many in the Democratic Party, to convince Biden to step down.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : And very quickly, just to go back to the Republicans and what they were saying, your recent piece is \"The Rise of the New Right\" -\n\nBENJAMIN WALLACE - WELLS : Yeah.\n\nNERMEEN SHAIKH : - \"at the Republican National Convention.\" All of the issues we've been discussing, if you could just put them in the context of this wider ideology that's being formed?\n\nBENJAMIN WALLACE - WELLS : I think it's a retreat to nationalism, is the big theme, you know. And there are strains in it that are more libertarian. There are strains that are more protectionist. But in policy towards immigrants, in policy towards - in foreign policy and trade policy, the big theme is a kind of theorizing of Trumpism and a retreat to nationalism.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We want to thank you all for being with us. Benjamin Wallace-Wells writes for The New Yorker magazine. Nina Turner is a former Ohio state senator. And we have been joined by Maria Hinojosa, the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist.\n\nNext up, protesters marched in Milwaukee to call for justice for two Black men who have just been killed in the last two weeks, Samuel Sharpe and D'Vontaye Mitchell. Back in 20 seconds.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nOn Thursday, former President Donald Trump pleaded not guilty to trying to overturn the results of his 2020 election loss. Trump appeared before a magistrate judge in Washington's federal courthouse two days after he was indicted. A key part of the election interference charges Trump faces relates to a Civil War-era rights law that protects the right of citizens to have their vote counted. We speak with Carol Anderson, author of One Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression Is Destroying Our Democracy and White Rage: The Unspoken Truth of Our Racial Divide , about Trump's attempt to wipe out the votes of Americans of color and the intimidation of Black voters and election workers. \"This is the kind of terror that is reminiscent of what happened during Reconstruction that led to the KKK Act that Trump is charged with,\" says Anderson. \"That kind of terror was the intimidation of Black people who were exercising the right to vote.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Former President Donald Trump has pleaded not guilty to four felony charges over his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election. Trump entered the plea Thursday in the same federal district court in Washington, D.C., where more than a thousand of his supporters have faced criminal charges over the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nProsecutors led by special counsel Jack Smith requested a speedy trial, while Trump's legal team asked the magistrate judge for more time to review documents and evidence in the case. It's part of Trump's legal strategy to delay the criminal cases against him until after the 2024 election, which he hopes he'll win and then could pardon himself. Trump's first pretrial hearing is set for August 28th.\n\nTrump spoke after the arraignment.\n\nDONALD TRUMP : When you look at what's happening, this is a persecution of a political opponent. This was never supposed to happen in America. This is the persecution of the person that's leading by very, very substantial numbers in the Republican primary and leading Biden by a lot. So, if you can't beat him, you persecute him or you prosecute him. We can't let this happen in America.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Going forward, the legal proceedings in this case will be presided over by U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, an Obama appointee who has issued some of the toughest sentences for the January 6 rioters, often going beyond what the prosecutors asked for. Judge Chutkan is Black, as are many of those now prosecuting Trump - Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, New York Attorney General Letitia James, Fulton County DA Fani Willis. They've all received racist threats.\n\nMeanwhile, the Fulton County Sheriff Patrick Labat, who's also Black, said Tuesday the former president would not receive any special treatment if Trump is indicted in Georgia, where he's being investigated for election interference. Labat said, quote, \"It doesn't matter your status, we have mugshots ready for you.\"\n\nA key part of the election interference charges Trump faces relate to a Civil War-era rights law that protects the right of citizens to have their votes counted.\n\nFor more, we go to Atlanta, where we're joined by Carol Anderson, professor at Emory University, author of many books, including One Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression Is Destroying Our Democracy .\n\nProfessor, welcome back to Democracy Now! It's great to have you with us. First of all, why don't you just respond to the overall indictment and President Trump's appearance yesterday in the Washington, D.C., court, pleading not guilty?\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : The indictment was a long time coming, and it reaffirmed the belief in the rule of law, which it looked like for so long that he would be able to once again skate through, escape the consequences, being held accountable, for his assault on American democracy. And so, seeing him there, watching the sketches as they were coming through, listening to the journalists talking about what was happening in that courtroom, it was like, \"Finally, finally, finally.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And so, talk about what legal analysts are now describing as a very elegant, streamlined series of charges, only four. They don't, by the way, include seditious conspiracy or insurrection. Talk about the significance of each one.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : So, what Jack Smith has laid out is the conspiracy to defraud the U.S. government, the conspiracy to basically subvert a political legal process for the United States. And the one that really attracts me is the conspiracy against rights, which is the right to vote, because underlying the Big Lie was the big lie of voter fraud. And that big lie of voter fraud was targeted at communities, at cities that have sizable Black and minority populations, and it was trying to delegitimize the votes of those American citizens.\n\nAnd so, this is so streamlined because there are six - in that indictment, there are six unindicted co-conspirators, but they're not on the charge itself. It is the United States of America v. Donald J. Trump . And so, that's to make sure that this thing is clean, it's smooth. There are none of these pieces like we have with Mar-a-Lago with multiple defendants, with classified documents, that this thing can go through. So, the defense's claims of \"we're having an inordinate amount of discovery that we have to go through, of the documents and the witness testimonies that the prosecutor has amassed,\" so much of that they already have from the January 6th committee hearings. What's new, for instance, is Mike Pence, who went before the grand jury and told about his conversations with Trump.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to talk about Georgia, where you are. You're a professor at Emory University in Atlanta. It was mentioned something like 48 times. Now, I'm talking about this federal indictment, not what's happening right now. I mean, a grand jury is meeting today once again in Atlanta, and those charges might come down anytime from the DA, Fani Willis. But Georgia being mentioned 48 times in the federal indictment, and then, of course, Michigan mentioned scores of times, as well. Talk about the significance of what happened in Georgia and how that relates to the federal issue.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : Yes. So, Georgia was targeted - targeted hot, heavy and hard - by the Trump regime. So, you have that infamous phone call from Trump to Brad Raffensperger, who was the secretary of state, where Trump is saying, \"All I need is 11,780 votes. Just find me 11,000 votes,\" and Raffensperger pushing back, saying, \"The data don't support that. We don't have those numbers.\" And Trump is just demanding that Raffensperger overturn the will of the voters here in Georgia and just conjure up some votes and plug a number in there that says that Trump won the 16 Electoral College votes out of Georgia.\n\nWhen that didn't work, they also had the fake elector scheme, where you have - the legal electors are already meeting in the statehouse, as the law requires. Then, the fake electors then sneak into the statehouse on December 14th, and they're meeting there, and they actually sign a document that says that they are the electors from the state of Georgia and that they then cast their 16 Electoral College votes for Donald J. Trump. And then they send that document to the federal judge, to the president of the Senate and to the head of the National Archives, giving the aura that this is legitimate, when it is actually illegitimate.\n\nAnd then you have Mark Meadows coming into Georgia at a counting center as a recount is happening over absentee ballots. I mean, hard, hot and heavy pressure on Georgia to overturn the will of the voters.\n\nAnd let me be really clear about the will of the voters. Ninety percent of Black voters in Georgia voted for Joseph Biden. Almost 70% of Hispanic voters in Georgia voted for Joseph Biden. And more than 60% of Asian American voters in Georgia voted for Joseph Biden. So this attempt to wipe out those votes is wiping out the votes of sizable blocs of minority voters, who did not vote for Donald J. Trump.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to talk about the issue of violence, because Donald Trump's defenders are continually saying - I'm thinking of people like Kevin McCarthy - right? - the House speaker - saying, \"He's just being accused of thought crimes, things he thought or said, and anyone can say or think things.\"\n\nBut this is The Atlantic journalist Adam Serwer, who was pointing out on social media, \"The indictment makes clear that Donald Trump and his accomplices planned to seize power by force and then maintain that power through the mass murder of American citizens by their own military.\"\n\nThe indictment says this: \"Also on January 4, when Co-Conspirator 2 acknowledged to the Defendant's Senior Advisor that no court would support his proposal, the Senior Advisor told Co-Conspirator 2, '[Y]ou're going to cause riots in the streets.' Co-Conspirator 2 responded that there had previously been points in the nation's history where violence was necessary to protect the republic.\"\n\nIf you could respond to that, Professor Anderson, and also the significance, of course, of Mark Meadows, the chief of staff, who you just mentioned, who might well have flipped right now and be working with Jack Smith?\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : Absolutely. So, you have not only Eastman, but you also have Jeffrey Clark of the Department of Justice being warned that this attempt to override the election, overturn the will of the voters, would lead to folks being out in the streets, would lead to riots. And the response was, \"Well, that's what the Insurrection Act is for.\" So, there was a willingness to use the U.S. military against American citizens who were protesting for their rights, protesting, fighting for this democracy, protesting because the will of the voters had been overturned by a cabal of co-conspirators, a cabal who were in league with Donald J. Trump. And so, that willingness to use violence to overturn democracy is - it just tells you how deeply embedded this drive was to keep him in power, and the disregard they had for the lives of American citizens, who withstood a pandemic, a deadly pandemic, to go and vote, who understood that democracy was on the line and were willing to do what they needed to do.\n\nSo, in terms of violence, I also have to talk about Rudy Giuliani coming down here to Georgia for three legislative hearings, where he spews - he and his team spew a bevy of lies about dead people voting, but particularly about Shaye Moss and Ruby Freeman, two Black poll workers in Fulton County at State Farm Arena, that Rudy Giuliani equated, made equivalent, with drug dealers, passing around USB ports as if they were heroin, as if it was heroin and cocaine, so linking election workers, Black election workers, with drug dealers. And then those two women receive enormous death threats, death threats that are so horrific that it causes Ruby Freeman to - the FBI warns her that she has to leave her home for protection. That's the kind of violence that this kind of cabal was willing to generate in order to keep Donald Trump in power against the will of the voters. That's why Georgia is so prominent in this discussion.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to talk about what's just happened, the latest news with Rudy Giuliani, Professor Anderson. In recent weeks, Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, said he will not contest, so he's admitting that he lied, that he will not contest that he made, quote, \"false statements\" about those two Georgia election workers in the aftermath of the 2020 election. I want to go through exactly what you're talking about. Ruby Freeman and Shaye Moss, a mother and daughter, are suing Giuliani for defamation for accusing them of manipulating ballots in Fulton County, Georgia, on Election Day 2020. The Georgia elections board found Giuliani's statements to be false and unsubstantiated, according to an investigation by the Georgia elections board. This is California Congressmember Adam Schiff introducing video of Giuliani's remarks during that hearing in the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the Capitol.\n\nREP . ADAM SCHIFF : I'd like to show you some of the statements that Rudy Giuliani made in a second hearing before the Georgia state legislators, a week after that video clip from State Farm Arena was first circulated by Mr. Giuliani and President Trump. I want to advise viewers that these statements are completely false and also deeply disturbing.\n\nRUDY GIULIANI : Tape earlier in the day of Ruby Freeman and Shaye Freeman Moss and one other gentleman quite obviously surreptitiously passing around USB ports as if they are vials of heroin or cocaine. I mean, it's our - it's obvious to anyone who's a criminal investigator or prosecutor they are engaged in surreptitious illegal activity, again, that day. And that's a week ago, and they're still walking around Georgia lying.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The Black former Georgia state election worker that Giuliani is referring to also testified before the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack. This is Shaye Moss being questioned by California Congressmember Adam Schiff.\n\nREP . ADAM SCHIFF : How did you first become aware that Rudy Giuliani, the president's lawyer, was accusing you and your mother of a crime?\n\nSHAYE MOSS : I was at work, like always, and the former chief, Mr. Jones, asked me to come to his office. And when I went to his office, the former director, Mr. Barron, was in there, and they showed me a video on their computer. It was just like a very short clip of us working at State Farm, and it had someone on the video, like, talking over the video, just saying that we were doing things that we weren't supposed to do, just lying throughout the video. And that's when I first found out about it. ...\n\nREP . ADAM SCHIFF : In one of the videos we just watched, Mr. Giuliani accused you and your mother of passing some sort of USB drive to each other. What was your mom actually handing you on that video?\n\nSHAYE MOSS : A ginger mint.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, there you have Shaye Moss. And the way their lives were turned upside down, Professor Anderson, I mean, men coming to their homes demanding they come out, talk about the significance of this. And now it's shown that the tape is doctored, and Giuliani is admitting that he lied.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : Right. And this is - and so, this is the kind of terror that is reminiscent of what happened during Reconstruction that led to the KKK Act that Trump is charged with, because that kind of terror was the intimidation of Black people who were exercising their right to vote, the intimidation of Black people who believed that they were American citizens, the intimidation of Black people who were engaged in the electoral process. This is what was happening based on a lie, where Giuliani admits that he lied.\n\nEven worse, I have to say, is that these lies about election fraud, about massive rampant voter fraud, becomes the basis for the voter suppression laws that many states, like Georgia, then put in place. So, you've got an incredible array of laws in place, pieces of those laws dealing with absentee ballots, dealing with drop boxes, dealing with mobile voting units, dealing with places like State Farm, that Fulton County was able to use to deal with the fact that it had to close 90 polling places, and so this was a way to provide a way for people to be able to vote. So, the state using Rudy Giuliani's big lie and Donald Trump's big lie to justify shutting down access to the ballot box to minority communities, because the vast number of drop boxes that were shut down after the passage of S.B. 202 were in the Atlanta metropolitan area. So it went from over a hundred drop boxes to fewer than 25 drop boxes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And I wanted to ask you about the people involved in these cases, those who are bringing them, judging them. The judge in the new D.C. case is Black. That's U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan, Jamaican American. Now many of those prosecuting Trump are Black. Manhattan DA Alvin Bragg, New York AG Letitia James, Fulton County DA Fani Willis have all received racist threats. And then you have Patrick Labat, the Fulton County sheriff, saying, \"He's going to get a mugshot if he's charged in our courts.\" Can you talk about the significance of this, and then particularly Fani Willis and Labat, who they are, since you're in Atlanta?\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : So, this is why you have this - also this kind of massive pushback about Trump can't get a fair trial in D.C., he can't get a fair trial in Manhattan, he can't get a fair trial in Fulton County, because of the Blackness of those spaces and because Black people and Black elected officials are seen as illegitimate. Think about Trump with birtherism, with Obama. That was an attack on Obama's legitimacy, legitimacy as an American citizen, legitimacy as an elected political official.\n\nWhen Blackness becomes illegitimate - so, I think about Mo Brooks, the congressman out of Alabama, who said that if we only count the legal votes, then Trump would be in his second term. So, those legal votes are white people's votes. The illegal votes are those from African Americans. And so, therefore, folks like Fani Willis, folks like Judge Chutkan, folks like Tish James, folks like Alvin Bragg, they're not legal, they're not legitimate, so they can be discounted.\n\nSo, when you get a charge that says, \"I want a change of venue from D.C. to West Virginia,\" that is sending the signal about the illegitimacy of Black people as American citizens. This, again, is what happened after the Civil War, where the Ku Klux Klan rose up and said, \"These aren't American citizens. The 14th Amendment does not apply to them. The 15th Amendment does not apply to them. We can do to them whatever we want.\" And that's what you're seeing replicated here in the 21st century.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, now, Professor Anderson, there's a lot being made of: All Trump wants to do at this point - I mean, he's made history every time here, and now the third indictment, and we're expecting to see the fourth any day now in Atlanta - is delay these trials, so that if he were to become president, or he had an ally who became president, he could be pardoned. But a president can only pardon on federal crimes.\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : Right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You've got Fani Willis in Atlanta. That is not federal; that's state. So, if you can talk about what we're about to see in Atlanta, the grand jury now meeting today?\n\nCAROL ANDERSON : Yeah. So, one of the things that Fani Willis has been really clear on, she's like, \"We're ready to go.\" And so, that means, for me, that an indictment is coming soon. And Fani Willis doesn't play. She does not play. And so, you can expect to see a really crisp, clean trial, with locked-in evidence. And if he is convicted here in Georgia, if an indictment comes down and he is convicted, then it means that he won't be able to pardon himself.\n\nAnd so, part of what I also want to push back on is the assumption that Trump will win the next election. I saw a recent poll that 63% of Americans do not like Donald Trump. And what that means then is that we have the power as American citizens to make sure that this man, who attacked American democracy, who attacked the foundations of the rule of law, does not regain power and have the ability to insert himself in a place where we have an autocracy, where even the memory of a democracy will be abolished. We have the power to stop this thing by registering to vote and by getting out to vote and ensuring that Donald Trump is not the next president of the United States.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Carol Anderson, I want to thank you for being with us, professor at Emory University, author of many books, including One Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression Is Destroying Our Democracy .\n\nComing up, we look at Niger, a week after a military coup ousted the country's president. One of the coup leaders in Niger has received U.S. military training, had met with a top U.S. officer at the U.S. drone base in Niger just last month. U.S.-trained officers involved with something like 11 coups in Africa over the last decade or so. Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

      "text": "You turn to us for voices you won't hear anywhere else.\n\nSign up for Democracy Now!'s Daily Digest to get our latest headlines and stories delivered to your inbox every day.\n\nTuesday's hearing of the House committee investigating the January 6 attack included evidence of how then-President Trump and his campaign \"were directly involved\" in a plot to replace Biden electors with fake electors for Trump in states where he had lost. Investigators displayed fake certifications manufactured by the Trump campaign and said that one group of fake electors even asked for a promise that the campaign would pay their legal fees if they got sued or charged with a crime. The committee also revealed that just minutes before the joint session on January 6, a staffer for Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson told Mike Pence he wished to hand deliver to the vice president the fake electors' votes from Michigan and Wisconsin - which Pence's aide unambiguously refused. We feature a video presented to the January 6 committee as evidence that features Casey Lucier, an investigative counsel, describing the plan to organize fake electors for Trump in states where he had lost, with testimony of former Trump staffers, lawyers and other Republican officials.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nDuring Tuesday's hearing of the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the U.S. Capitol, members laid out the argument that then-President Trump and his campaign \"were directly involved in advancing and coordinating the plot to replace Biden electors with fake electors not chosen by the voters.\"\n\nThis is a video presented as evidence that features Casey Lucier, an investigative counsel for the committee, describing the plan to organize fake electors for Trump in states where he had lost. It includes testimony of former Trump staffers who were involved in or aware of the plot, and lawyers and Republican officials who warned against it.\n\nCASEY LUCIER : My name is Casey Lucier. I'm an investigative counsel for the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol.\n\nOn November 18th, a lawyer working with the Trump campaign, named Kenneth Chesebro, wrote a memo arguing that the Trump campaign should organize its own electors in the swing states that President Trump had lost. The select committee received testimony that those close to President Trump began planning to organize fake electors for Trump in states that Biden won in the weeks after the election.\n\nINVESTIGATOR : Who do you remember being involved in those early discussions around the Thanksgiving time regarding having alternate electors meet?\n\nCASSIDY HUTCHINSON : Mr. Giuliani, several of Mr. Giuliani's associates, Mr. Meadows, members of Congress - although it's difficult to distinguish if the members I'm thinking of were involved during Thanksgiving or if they were involved as we progressed through December.\n\nCASEY LUCIER : At the president's direct request, the RNC assisted the campaign in coordinating this effort.\n\nINVESTIGATOR : What did the president say when he called you?\n\nRONNA ROMNEY McDANIEL: Essentially, he turned the call over to Mr. Eastman, who then proceeded to talk about the importance of the RNC helping the campaign gather these contingent electors in case any of the legal challenges that were ongoing changed the result of any of the states. I think more just helping them reach out and assemble them, but that - my understanding is the campaign did take the lead, and we just were helping them in that - in that role.\n\nCASEY LUCIER : As President Trump and his supporters continued to lose lawsuits, some campaign lawyers became convinced that convening electors in states that Trump lost was no longer appropriate.\n\nJUSTIN CLARK : I just remember I either replied or called somebody, saying, \"Unless we have litigation pending that's, like, in these states, like, I don't think this is appropriate, or, you know, this isn't the right thing to do.\" I don't remember how I phrased it, but I got into a little bit of a back-and-forth, and I think it was with Ken Chesebro, where I said, \"All right, you know, you just get after it. Like, I'm out.\"\n\nMATT MORGAN : At that point, I had Josh Finley email Mr. Chesebro politely to say, \"This is your task. You are responsible for the Electoral College issues moving forward.\" And this was my way of taking that responsibility to zero.\n\nCASEY LUCIER : The committee learned the White House Counsel's Office also felt the plan was potentially illegal.\n\nINVESTIGATOR : And so to be clear, did you hear the White House Counsel's Office say that this plan to have alternate electors meet and cast votes for Donald Trump in states that he had lost was not legally sound?\n\nCASSIDY HUTCHINSON : Yes, sir.\n\nINVESTIGATOR : And who was present for that meeting, that you remember?\n\nCASSIDY HUTCHINSON : It was in our office, so it was Mr. Meadows, Mr. Giuliani and a few of Mr. Giuliani's associates.\n\nCASEY LUCIER : The select committee interviewed several of the individual fake electors, as well as Trump campaign staff who helped organize the effort.\n\nROBERT SINNERS : We were just, you know, kind of - kind of useful idiots or rubes at that point. You know, a strong part of me really feels that it's just kind of as the road continued and as that was failure, failure, failure, that that got formulated as \"What do we have on the table? Let's just do it.\"\n\nCASEY LUCIER : And now, after what we've told you today about the select committee's investigation about the conclusion of the professional lawyers on the campaign staff, Justin Clark, Matt Morgan and Josh Finley, about their unwillingness to participate in the convening of these electors, how does that contribute to your understanding of these issues?\n\nROBERT SINNERS : I'm angry. I'm angry, because I think - I think, in a sense, you know, no one really cared if - if people were potentially putting themselves in jeopardy.\n\nCASEY LUCIER : Would you have not wanted to participate in this any further, as well?\n\nROBERT SINNERS : I absolutely would not have, had I known that the three main lawyers for the campaign that I'd spoken to in the past and were leading up were not on board. Yeah.\n\nANDREW HITT : I was told that these would only count if a court ruled in our favor. So, that would have been using our electors - well, it would have been using our electors in ways that we weren't told about, and we wouldn't have supported.\n\nCASEY LUCIER : Documents obtained by the select committee indicate that instructions were given to the electors in several states that they needed to cast their ballots in complete secrecy. Because this scheme involved fake electors, those participating in certain states had no way to comply with state election laws, like where the electors were supposed to meet. One group of fake electors even considered hiding overnight to ensure that they could access the state Capitol, as required in Michigan.\n\nINVESTIGATOR : Did Mr. Norton say who he was working with at all on this effort to have electors meet?\n\nLAURA COX : He said he was working with the president's campaign. He told me that the Michigan Republican electors were planning to meet in the Capitol and hide overnight so that they could fulfill the role of casting their vote in - per law, in the Michigan chambers. And I told him in no uncertain terms that that was insane and inappropriate.\n\nCASEY LUCIER : In one state, the fake electors even asked for a promise that the campaign would pay their legal fees if they got sued or charged with a crime. Ultimately, fake electors did meet on December 14th, 2020, in Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, Nevada and Wisconsin. At the request of the Trump campaign, the electors from these battleground states signed documents falsely asserting that they were the, quote, \"duly elected electors\" from their state, and submitted them to the National Archives and to Vice President Pence in his capacity as president of the Senate. Here is what some of the fake electors' certificates look like as compared to the real ones. But these ballots had no legal effect.\n\nIn an email produced to the select committee, Dr. Eastman told a Trump campaign representative that it did not matter that the electors had not been approved by a state authority: quote, \"The fact that we have multiple slates of electors demonstrates the uncertainty of either. That should be enough.\" He urged that Pence act boldly and be challenged.\n\nDocuments produced to the select committee show that the Trump campaign took steps to ensure that the physical copies of the fake electors' electoral votes from two states were delivered to Washington for January 6th. Text messages exchanged between Republican Party officials in Wisconsin show that on January 4th, the Trump campaign asked for someone to fly their fake electors' documents to Washington. A staffer for Wisconsin Senator Ron Johnson texted a staffer for Vice President Pence just minutes before the beginning of the joint session. This staffer stated that Senator Johnson wished to hand-deliver to the vice president the fake electors' votes from Michigan and Wisconsin. The vice president's aide unambiguously instructed them not to deliver the fake votes to the vice president.\n\nEven though the fake electors' slates were transmitted to Congress and the executive branch, the vice president held firm in his position that his role was to count lawfully submitted electoral votes.\n\nVICE PRESIDENT MIKE PENCE : Joseph R. Biden Jr. of the state of Delaware has received 306 votes. Donald J. Trump of the state of Florida has received 232 votes.\n\nCASEY LUCIER : Which is what he did when the joint session resumed on January 6th after the attack on the Capitol.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's a video narrated by Casey Lucier, an investigative counsel for the January 6th committee, presented as evidence during Tuesday's hearing. One of the witnesses who testified live was the Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. The January 6th committee member Congressman Adam Schiff refers to a call between Trump and Georgia investigator Frances Watson in his questioning of Raffensperger.\n\nREP . ADAM SCHIFF : Mr. Raffensperger, I know you weren't on this call, but that you have listened to it. President Trump didn't win by hundreds of thousands of votes in Georgia, did he?\n\nSECRETARY OF STATE BRAD RAFFENSPERGER : No, he did not. I've been traveling through the state of Georgia for a year now. And simply put, in a nutshell, what happened in the fall of 2020 is that 28,000 Georgians skipped the presidential race, and yet they voted down ballot in other races, and the Republican congressman ended up getting 33,000 more votes than President Trump. And that's why President Trump came up short.\n\nREP . ADAM SCHIFF : Thank you, Mr. Secretary. The president, on this call, doesn't stop here. Let's listen to another part of the conversation between President Trump and Ms. Watson.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Anyway, but whatever you can do, Frances, it would be - it's a great thing. It's an important thing for the country, so important. You have no idea, it's so important -\n\nFRANCES WATSON : Well, Mr. -\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : And I very much appreciate it.\n\nREP . ADAM SCHIFF : \"Whatever you can do, Frances.\" This is the president of the United States calling an investigator looking into the election in which he is a candidate and asking her to do \"whatever you can do.\" Mr. Secretary, he placed this call to your chief investigator on September 23rd, 2020. The select committee has received text messages indicating that Mark Meadows wanted to send some of the investigators in her office, in the words of one White House aide, a \"[bleep] load of POTUS stuff,\" including coins, actual autographed MAGA hats, etc. White House staff intervened to make sure that didn't happen. It was clear at the time of this call that the former president had his sights set on January 6th. Listen to this portion, when he told Frances Watson about a very important date.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Do you think they'll be working after Christmas, to keep it going fast? Because, you know, we have that date of the 6th, which is a very important date.\n\nREP . ADAM SCHIFF : That important date, of course, was the joint session of Congress, where Georgia's electoral votes would be counted for Joe Biden. A little - a little over a week after this call to Frances Watson, the president was finally able to speak with you, Secretary Raffensperger. Bear in mind, as we discuss this call today, that by this point in time, early January, the election in Georgia had already been certified. But perhaps more important, the president of the United States had already been told repeatedly by his own top Justice Department officials that the claims he was about to make to you about massive fraud in Georgia were completely false.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's committee Congressmember Adam Schiff questioning Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger.\n\nWhen we come back, we'll hear testimony to the January 6th committee from a Black election worker and her mother in Georgia whose lives were forever changed when Trump claimed the women helped to rig the vote when he lost Georgia.

      "text": "Trump Foundation cannot dissolve amid investigation into charity spending\n\nNew York state prosecutors are looking into 2015 tax filing that reveals the president-elect used charity to settle lawsuits and make personal purchases\n\nDonald Trump cannot move ahead with his plan to dismantle his charitable foundation because state prosecutors are investigating whether the president-elect personally benefited from its spending, the New York attorney general's office said on Tuesday.\n\n\"The Trump Foundation is still under investigation by this office and cannot legally dissolve until that investigation is complete,\" said Amy Spitalnick, spokeswoman for the state attorney general, Eric Schneiderman.\n\nThe statement came after Trump announced that he wanted to dissolve the Donald J Trump Foundation , part of what his presidential transition team says is an effort to erase any potential conflicts of interest before he takes office on 20 January.\n\nBut the foundation's inner workings have been the subject of Schneiderman's investigation for months and could remain a thorny issue for Trump's incoming administration. Democrats nationally have said they are ready to raise any legal or ethical issues from Trump's global business empire during his presidency.\n\nThe foundation had long been a political football during the campaign. It was reported then that Trump used $258,000 of the foundation's money to pay for personal legal settlements. The president also spent charitable funds on multiple portraits of himself as well as an autographed football helmet.\n\nTrump's charity has admitted that it violated IRS regulations barring it from using its money or assets to benefit Trump, his family, his companies or substantial contributors to the foundation.\n\nThe admissions by the Donald J Trump Foundation were in a 2015 tax filing made public after the presidential election in which it was revealed that Trump has used the charity to settle lawsuits, make a $25,000 political contribution and purchase items, such as a painting of himself, that was displayed at one of his properties.\n\nThe 2015 tax filing was posted on the non-profit monitoring website GuideStar on 18 November by someone using an email address from the foundation's law firm, Morgan, Lewis & Bockius, said a GuideStar spokeswoman, Jackie Enterline Fekeci.\n\nIn the tax filing, the foundation acknowledged that it used money or assets in violation of the regulations not only during 2015, but in prior years. But the tax filing does not provide details on the violations.\n\nDespite bearing Trump's name, the president-elect had not donated to it since 2008. Instead, the charity relied on donations from other Trump associates, most notably professional wrestling magnates Vince and Linda McMahon, who gave $5m to the Trump Foundation. Linda McMahon has since been announced as Trump's nominee to lead the Small Business Administration.\n\nSchneiderman, a Democrat, launched his investigation into the charity after reporting by the Washington Post drew attention to some of the foundation's purchases.\n\nTrump asserted on Twitter late on Monday that his foundation was run efficiently.\n\n\"The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses,\" the president-elect tweeted. \"100% of the money goes to wonderful charities.\"\n\nWhen asked for comment, a transition spokesperson simply referred back to a passage from the president-elect's statement on Saturday that read \"president-elect Trump has directed his counsel to take the necessary steps to effectuate the dissolution\"."

      "text": "Trump cries 'treason' as senior official attacks president in anonymous NYT op-ed\n\nUnidentified official claims 'resistance' within administration is working in opposition to president's impulses\n\nDonald Trump has reacted with fury to an anonymous account written by a current Trump administration official claiming an internal White House resistance is working to \"frustrate parts of his agenda and his worst inclinations\" until he leaves - or can be removed from - office.\n\nThe op-ed, published in the New York Times on Wednesday, represents a shocking critique of Trump and is without precedent in modern American history. The anonymous author describes Trump as amoral, \"anti-trade and anti-democratic\" and prone to making \"half-baked, ill-informed and occasionally reckless decisions\".\n\nThe writer claims aides had explored the possibility of removing Trump from office via the 25th amendment , a complex constitutional mechanism to allow for the replacement of a president who is \"unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office\", but had decided against it.\n\n\"So we will do what we can to steer the administration in the right direction until - one way or another - it's over,\" the author writes.\n\nTrump responded to the article at the White House late on Wednesday, deriding it as \"anonymous, meaning gutless\" and describing the author as \"some anonymous source within the administration probably who is failing and probably here for all the wrong reasons\".\n\nHe went on to call the New York Times \"failing\" and insisted \"they don't like Donald Trump and I don't like them because they're very dishonest people\".\n\nIn a tweet on Wednesday evening , Trump went further and simply asked \"TREASON?\" In a follow up tweet, he insisted : \"If the GUTLESS anonymous person does indeed exist, the Times must, for National Security purposes, turn him/her over to government at once!\"\n\nWriting an op-ed for the New York Times does not violate any statute in the United States legal code.\n\nIn contrast to Trump's Democratic critics, the author makes clear that \"ours is not the popular 'resistance' of the left\", but a coalition that wants the administration to flourish.\n\n\"We want the administration to succeed and think that many of its policies have already made America safer and more prosperous,\" the author writes. However, they describe a cabal of \"Trump appointees [who] have vowed to do what we can to preserve our democratic institutions while thwarting Mr. Trump's more misguided impulses until he is out of office\".\n\nThe author praises their efforts as \"heroic\" as they attempt to \"keep bad decisions contained to the West Wing\" and thwart Trump's \"erratic behavior\". They also claimed the administration's achievements had included some \"bright spots\" such as \"effective deregulation, historic tax reform, a more robust military and more\".\n\nAn official statement from the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said: \"Nearly 62 million people voted for president Donald J Trump in 2016, earning him 306 Electoral College votes - versus 232 for his opponent. None of them voted for a gutless, anonymous source to the failing New York Times. We are disappointed, but not surprised, that the paper chose to publish this pathetic, reckless, and selfish op-ed ... This is just another example of the liberal media's concerted effort to discredit the president.\"\n\nSanders went on to add: \"The individual behind this piece has chosen to deceive, rather than support, the duly elected president of the United States. He is not putting country first, but putting himself and his ego ahead of the will of the American people. This coward should do the right thing and resign.\"\n\nOne former White House official said they were flabbergasted by the op-ed. \"I used to laugh when certain Trump supporters would fret about anti-Trump 'sleeper cells' within the government,\" said the former White House aide. \"But I can't come up with a better term than that to describe the author of the NYT op-ed.\"\n\nSebastian Gorka, the controversial former White House aide, told the Guardian: \"If this were 1917 or 1944 this would count as treason of the highest order.\"\n\nIn an interview on CNN, John Kasich, governor of Ohio, said of Trump and his administration: \"It's just chaos all the time. And he's the commander of the chaos ... I'm concerned that things aren't getting done.\"\n\nThe op-ed comes only a day after excerpts from the veteran journalist Bob Woodward's book Fear were published in the Washington Post, detailing stinging criticisms from a number of current and former senior administration officials against Trump.\n\nHowever, in contrast to Woodward, whose books peeling back the curtain into White House decisions have been a fixture of American politics for decades, the op-ed represents a direct challenge to Trump from within his own administration.\n\nThe op-ed was unusually published as an anonymous submission by the New York Times, which described the author as \"a senior official in the Trump administration whose identity is known to us and whose job would be jeopardized by its disclosure\".\n\nA spokesperson for the New York Times referred the Guardian to the editor's note published with the piece and declined to comment further."

Go get it!\" Donald J Trump\n\nThe far-right former White House adviser and Breitbart writer is not only concerned about people ganging up on Trump but the threats to Judaeo-Christian civilisation posed by jihadists, communists, China or \"tomorrow's unknown threat\".\n\nThe reviews:\n\n\"A very talented man who I got to know well while he was working at the White House, has just written an excellent book ... much will be learned from this very good read!\" Donald J Trump\n\nObjectionable conservative historian and regular Fox contributor promises \"the true story of how Donald Trump has become one of the most successful presidents in history - and why America needs him now more than ever\". He has claimed America suffers little overt racism from white people; he has also warned about the dangers of Spanish-speaking immigrants. Ta-Nehisi Coates accused him of \"stupidity and racism\" .\n\nThe reviews:\n\n\"He wrote a highly touted book called 'The Second World Wars' and a new book will soon be coming out called 'The Case For Trump.' Recommend both.\" Donald J Trump\n\nFox News commentator Sean Hannity writes the foreword to this book, whose author claims to have scientific evidence that Trump is \"the most sound-minded person to ever occupy the White House\". Her claim to have a PhD in psychology has been questioned .\n\nThe reviews:\n\n\"Go out and get your copy today - a great read!\" Donald J Trump\n\nYet another Fox news commentator - with a shorter tome, but a wider set of foes in his sights, targeting a \"selfish ruling class\" that draws in Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell, Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos of Amazon. He suggests Trump is \"vulgar and ignorant\" (maybe the president didn't finish this one) but was elected as the inevitable result of the elites ignoring conservative populist anger. White nationalists love him and Trump picks up talking points from his Fox diatribes.\n\nThe reviews:\n\n\"Congratulations to Tucker Carlson on the great success of his book, 'Ship of Fools.' It just went to NUMBER ONE! \" Donald J Trump\n\nThis one is actually a real book, with on-the-ground reporting and data analysis. The authors are a conservative reporter and a Republican campaign strategist, but they have gone deep to try to understand how Trump upset the odds.\n\nThe reviews:\n\n\"Does much to tell the story of our great Election victory. The Forgotten Men & Women are forgotten no longer!\" Donald J Trump\n\nThe former White House press secretary owns up to the reality of life in the White House with a president prone to outbursts and tweet storms, where backstabbing and leaks were commonplace.\n\nThe reviews:\n\n\"Sounds like a family member seeking to whitewash an abusive relationship.\" The Guardian\n\n\"A story told with both heart and knowledge. Really good, go get it!\" Donald J Trump"

      "text": "Trump announces plan to acquire a book - about himself\n\nPresident said Thursday - while announcing a rollback of environmental regulations - that he plans to read Donald J Trump: An Environmental Hero\n\nDonald Trump is going to acquire a book.\n\nThe book in question, as Gizmodo reported on Thursday, is titled Donald J Trump: An Environmental Hero, by Edward Russo. And the shocking news emerged as the president announced a rollback of environmental regulations at the White House, taking an axe to the environmental review process required for infrastructure projects. The move, which he pitched as a way around \"endless delays\" to various projects, poses a new threat to the climate and is likely to face legal challenges.\n\nThe president's war on the environment is nothing new. His plan to bury his nose in a book is.\n\nTrump isn't known for his literary bona fides. Though the bestseller The Art of the Deal helped make his name, it was ghostwritten by Tony Schwartz - who deeply regrets his work on the book . Ghostwriters have been involved in most, if not all, of his many other volumes. \"He doesn't read books and he doesn't write them,\" Schwartz told the Independent in 2018. (The late-night host Samantha Bee has developed a conspiracy theory that Trump can't read at all .)\n\nBut one subject fascinates the president so much that he's willing to invest in a volume of prose. That subject is, of course, himself.\n\nThe president highlighted Russo's volume in his own defense after a question over whether he feels the climate crisis is made-up. \"The environment is very important to me. Somebody wrote a book that I'm an environmentalist - it's actually called The Environmentalist ... I'd like to get it,\" he said, before apparently contradicting himself and suggesting he already had it \"in the other office\".\n\nRusso, who has advised Trump, describes himself as a lifelong advocate for the planet. His self-published work claims to offer \"a personal picture of a man who doesn't just care about success but the impact of his success on the world\".\n\nTrump, the book's blurb says, offered Russo a job to ensure that Trump's business developments wouldn't \"negatively affect habitats\", conjuring an image of a concerned Trump nodding thoughtfully as Russo warns of the toll his latest golf course could take on the local squirrel population.\n\nThe book seeks to counter a narrative - supported by robust evidence, including Trump's decision to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement, his assault on Obama-era environmental rules, and his complaints about excessive toilet flushing due to low water pressure - that the president actually doesn't care very much about the planet.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on Thursday, Trump sought to paint a very different picture of himself. Asked about the climate crisis, he said, according to the pool report : \"Nothing's a hoax about that. It's a very serious subject ... I'm a big believer in that word, the environment.\" That would seem to run counter to his previous claims that the climate emergency is a Chinese hoax and casting doubt on global warming during a snowstorm .\n\nAs for Russo, his own brand of environmentalism seems a little shaky. He has hailed proposed EPA budget cuts , suggesting they will increase the agency's \"focus\". \"Every time there's lightning or thunder that, oh, it's climate change,\" he told the energy news site E&E News in 2017. \"Climate change is a natural change in balance of the Earth, it happens all the time.\"\n\nWhether the book's claims of environmental heroism are accurate or not, the president appears to have developed an interest in the written word. We can only hope his newfound passion means a little less TV time ."

      "text": "I visited Donald Trump's state park and it's not a park\n\nIt turns out his taxes are not the only thing that appear a little different in real life from what you'd expect\n\nW e've just learned Donald Trump paid virtually no income tax in 10 of the last 15 years. While the fragments of Trump's finances are still being investigated, there's one unusually large relic of his dealings just an hour's drive north of New York City.\n\nLast week, I went to Donald J Trump state park, which few people know exists, because it's not really a park. In fact, it's two tracts of muddy, overgrown land between New York's Putnam and Westchester counties that Trump purchased in 1998 for $2.75m , hoping to build a golf course. Neighborhood officials halted the plan, citing environmental concerns, and the land was abandoned. In an alternate timeline, the story would just end here.\n\nBut we're living in Trump's universe. In 2006, the reality TV mogul donated the undeveloped land to New York state, claiming it was worth $100m - an amount that, if claimed as a qualified conservation contribution , could have saved him a fortune in income tax, potentially carried forward for years. (Confusingly, Trump's 2016 campaign valued the land at $26.1m in his public list of charitable contributions.)\n\nThe lucrative donation deal was approved by Bernadette Castro, a friend of Trump's and former CEO of Castro Convertibles, a pullout sofa company, who was appointed New York parks commissioner by the then Republican governor, George Pataki. At an elaborate ceremony that year - reportedly complete with a catering tent, bottles of Trump-branded ice water, and TV crew - Castro lavished praise on Trump's \"magnificent donation\", and Pataki boasted the park would \"provide recreational opportunities for families and visitors\". Trump declared: \"I hope that these 436 acres of property will turn into one of the most beautiful parks anywhere in the world.\"\n\nHaving visited the park, it all feels like a big joke. The site is surprisingly hard to find - beyond a garish sign on the nearby Taconic State Parkway, there are no clear markers to guide potential visitors - as if the state hopes you won't actually go. It's not listed on New York parks' website , either, although it is labelled a \"passive park\", which means it is not maintained and has no amenities.\n\nUpon arrival, you are greeted with nothing. The \"parking lot\" is an empty gravel patch with a noticeboard that warns visitors to beware of ticks. There are no restrooms, trash cans, or places to sit. The remainder is basically bramble bushes and an empty field with bits of trash. This, I guess, is what $100m looks like under late capitalism.\n\nTo be fair, Donald J Trump state park has gone through its own trials and tribulations. The \"park\" was officially closed in 2010 after budget cuts, saving the state just $2,500 in annual expenses. A subsequent attempt by local residents to turn part of the land into a dog park was scrapped when it was found that some of the site's decaying structures contained asbestos .\n\nSince Trump's presidency, lawmakers have tried to rename the abandoned property. Last year, the New York state senator Brad Hoylman introduced two bills - one to name the state park after Heather Heyer, the 31-year-old woman who was killed by a white supremacist during the 2017 Charlottesville protests, and another that would hand the renaming process to local residents. But both efforts have stalled, in part due to Trump's sole demand in the donation contract : that the parklands would \"bear a name which includes Mr. Trump's name ... prominently displayed at least at each entrance to each property\".\n\nPerhaps that is why New York doesn't seem so keen to show the place off. It also makes Donald J Trump state park strangely peaceful: a good place to go for a walk and ponder the president's remarkable grift."

      "text": "From the personal diary of DONALD J. TRUMP\n\nPolitical Blogger\n\nSo the Brits don't want me to come. Who the hell cares? I didn't want to go anyway. An effete country. Cold and wet. And I don't care for May. What a bore. She's weak, not like Merkel. Or Thatcher! Now, there was a gal you could talk to! Ugly as a stick, but smart. Course, if I went, I could always get in a round or two at St. Andrews, which would be nice. But Bedminster's great, and their kitchen makes me the Best. Fried. Chicken. Ever! So screw England.\n\nStill, it would be good to get away for a while. Too much heat over here lately, and I don't mean the weather! Sarah wants me to go to Africa to make nice. I told Kelly to look into it, but he just gave me one of those looks-you know, where he rolls his eyes-and then he said, \"Mister President, I don't think an African trip is a good idea right now.\"\n\nI mentioned it to Melania at dinner. \"Darling, you can go wherever you want. You're Mister President. But please, don't make me go with you.\" Mel hates these trips, unless it's Paris or Rome, where she can shop. To be perfectly honest, she's happy watching T.V. at home, in her Snuggly-Buggly, and lunching at Jean-Georges. People think she's some kind of glamor-puss, but she's really just a regular American mom.\n\nThings were a little tense because of this Stormy Daniels crap. I mean, Melania doesn't ask me about my private life. That was the deal when I married her. Pre-nup clause #3b[1). I remember she said, \"Donald, darling, you can do whatever you want. But please, be discrete, and don't let me hear about it.\" Sometimes I get the feeling she wants to ask me about the rumors. But she's got a couple billion reasons not to.\n\nI wondered what Jared thought about an African trip. As usual, I found him in the White House gym. \"Pops, I think you should go,\" he said between crunches. \"You could always stop by Lagos and see about that hotel deal.\" Jared's a good kid. Not much of a sense of humor, but Ivanka likes him.\n\nOkay, Sarah's in favor, Jared's in favor, Kelly's against, and Melania's, like, \"whatever.\" What does The Base have to say? That's when I wished I could call up Bannon, but Cohen, my Jewish lawyer, tells me I have to put, like, a billion miles between me and Steve. So I tweeted. \"Thinking of going to Africa on State Visit. The Coloreds love me over there. They know that #FakeNews lies.\" Sixty thousand \"Likes\" within 15 minutes! Forty thousand retweets! Those are ratings, folks. America loves Trump! To tell you the truth, I don't know much about Africa, except for the animals and the huts, but McMaster tells me we need those shithole countries for national security reasons. Speaking of shitholes, Tillerson called last night to say that all the leaders over there are \"going ape\" over my comment, which I didn't make in the first place-that Durbin is such a liar, I call him \"Deceivin' Dick\"-and that I'm going to have to do some \"fence mending.\" I was about to ask him if he really thought I should go, but before he could answer I realized I didn't care what he thinks so I hung up on him.\n\nFence-mending. What the hell does that mean, anyhow? Do I put on a grass skirt and dance around a fire with the Mucketymuck of Botswana? I don't mind having these people to the White House, when I have to, but I shouldn't have to travel ten thousand miles to some mosquito-infested swamp and eat fried termites just to \"fence-mend.\" On the other hand, it's a lot easier for the Secret Service to smuggle porn stars into my bedroom overseas than it is here. That's my biggest complaint about being POTUS. Cramps my style! Everywhere I go that damned press pool follows me around like rats, sniffing for scandals. I haven't grabbed any decent pussy since before the Inauguration! Why doesn't the press cut me some slack, the way they did for Kennedy? Because he was a Democrat, that's why.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "J. Ann Selzer, Des Moines Register Call For Dismissal Of Trump Lawsuit Over Iowa Poll\n\nBreaking News Reporter, HuffPost\n\nLawyers for the Des Moines Register on Monday described Donald Trump as a \"sore winner\" in a court filing calling for the dismissal of a lawsuit the president brought over a pre-election poll conducted by veteran pollster J. Ann Selzer that showed him trailing his rival, former Vice President Kamala Harris in Iowa.\n\nThe brief, filed by lawyers for the Register and its parent company, Gannett - two of the defendants in the case - described Trump's case against them as meritless.\n\n\"The President of the United States, Donald J. Trump, brings this lawsuit ostensibly to 'seek [ ] accountability' for alleged 'election interference'; but instead, his lawsuit only confirms that President Trump is a sore winner,\" the brief states.\n\nTrump's lawsuit against the newspaper stemmed from a Nov. 2 poll conducted by Selzer and published in the Register, which showed Harris 3 percentage points ahead of him in Iowa - a state he ended up winning comfortably three days later by over 13 percentage points. Trump claimed the outlier poll amounted to \"brazen election interference,\" claiming that Selzer and the newspaper orchestrated the result to benefit his Democratic rival.\n\nBut lawyers for the Register and Gannett argued that \"there is no legal basis for President Trump to obtain the relief he seeks; indeed, such relief would violate free speech principles.\"\n\n\"President Trump attempts to punish press coverage of which he disapproves through tortured application of the Iowa Consumer Fraud Act, as well as through frivolous tort claims for fraudulent misrepresentation and negligent misrepresentation,\" the brief states.\n\n\"If he had his way, such claims would become weapons for any political candidate to challenge any press coverage they do not like,\" it continues.\n\nTrump's lawsuit, which was filed in December, over a month after he won the 2024 presidential race, names the Register, Gannett, Selzer and her polling firm, Selzer & Company, as defendants.\n\nSeparately, lawyers for Selzer and her polling company also called for the lawsuit to be dismissed in a brief filed Friday, describing the complaint as \"fatally flawed on every level.\"\n\n\"In the United States there is no such thing as a claim for 'fraudulent news,'\" the filing states. \"No court in any jurisdiction has ever held such a cause of action might be valid, and few plaintiffs have ever attempted to bring such outlandish claims. Those who have were promptly dismissed.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Donald J. Trump: One Person's King is Another One's Clown\n\nTranslational Neuroscientist/Psychologist\n\nBy Seth Davin Norrholm, Ph.D. and David M. Reiss, M.D.\n\nIn this week's commentary, the authors discuss the issues, dynamics, and motivations behind the making of a sycophant and its relevancy to this President\n\nIn a recent article, I posed the somewhat tongue-in-cheek question, \"How is the President's Approval Rating Not Zero?\" - a reference to the observation that despite sweeping measures seeking to strip Americans of numerous rights, protections, and benefits (in addition to the ongoing cloud of the Trump/Russia investigation), the President maintains a sizeable following (reflected by an approval rating of approximately 35 - 40% of the polled population) among U.S. citizens.\n\nIn the aforementioned article, I characterized these ardent followers as falling into one of three camps:\n\n(1) those that were largely ignorant (either passively due to lack of access to public sources of sociopolitical information or actively through narrow-minded media intake) of the President's controversial, unethical, and potentially criminal behavior\n\n(2) those who maintain unwavering support of their political affiliation (in this case GOP) and this group included both private citizens and elected Republican officials alike, or\n\n(3) individuals who endorsed the message of the President and his Administration as a whole including the \"super-rich\" who stand to benefit from large tax cuts and those whose behaviors suggest that they are isolationists, ultra-nationalists, jingoists, racist, misogynistic, or bigoted in some way.\n\nIn today's column, we delve deeper into the issues, dynamics, and motivations that underlie the syncophantic (or \"yes-man\") mentality expressed by the President's supporters.\n\nOn June 12, 2017, the President met with his Cabinet members and several of them took the opportunity to lavish praise on the embattled President.\n\nMore specifically, we will do so using our existing framework that operates according to the observations and principles that encompass the extreme narcissist and those within his orbit. Recent public events have illustrated that these dynamics manifest themselves across population classes including the President's appointed Cabinet, GOP Congressional leaders and members, as well as the support staff that works within the White House.\n\nLet us first ask some basic questions relevant to undying support and service from the followers of a leader, in general.\n\nHow are Sycophants Created?\n\nStructure is inherent to social organizations. One might theoretically wish to have a \"true democracy\" free of any leadership, but practically, that is hardly possible in a partnership of (or relationship between) even a handful of people. Whenever a social organization needs to take actions based upon decisions (formally or informally), positions of leadership will be designated by the group or some group members will naturally evolve into a leadership role.\n\nPersons with certain traits and abilities, whether socially acceptable or not, will take on a position of leadership or will be designated to carry out specific group-centered responsibilities.\n\nOf course, there can be no positions of leadership, formal or informal, if there are not others who will follow or at least agree to follow . If all group members have the same \"leadership\" responsibilities and if all members are totally equal in decision-making power, then there truly is no leadership.\n\nIt is important to note that the unequal division of decision-making responsibilities within a group does not necessarily imply an inequality in other important \"human factors\" or in other aspects of interpersonal relationships. In addition, an unequal division of decision-making responsibility (i.e., one member is elected to preside when others are not) also does not imply that others must or should follow without questioning .\n\nA position of leadership implies some distribution of power but not any one specific model of leading/governing/directing.\n\nDue to recent events related to this Presidency and the clear division between supporters and resistors, several follow-up questions have arisen:\n\n· Why is it, then, that even in social organizations (structured to be democratic and egalitarian in nature), from individual families to large - scale civic governments, that there must be a constant vigilance against authoritarianism?\n\n· Why is it that even so many become willfully oppressed or devoted sycophants (\"yes-people\") - even against their own interests and against their stated belief system (e.g., moral compass, religious beliefs, true conservatism)?\n\n· Why does there tend to be a \"nested\" substructure of authoritarianism among the most powerful \"leadership\" (think Speaker of the House or Senate Majority Leader) as well as among those who have little control beyond their immediate circle of relationships (think lower tier government officials and conservative/alt-right pundits)?\n\nLet's revisit Group 1 (Aptitude/Knowledge vs. Lack of Sophistication/Ignorance) described in the introduction.\n\nIn the most benign situation, those who are truly more capable of making informed and logical decisions will rise into positions of leadership; while those who are less talented will recognize that respecting knowledge and aptitude is best for all concerned. This need not confer any more power than is inherent to the task at hand or Office in play in order to allow the most talented to lead the way.\n\nAt times, the followers will not necessarily fully or specifically appreciate the gap of knowledge or aptitude as much as simply recognizing that they are not qualified or able to effectively perform the tasks at hand. They may sincerely attempt to determine who will be best to lead or they may passively go along with suggestions or prompting.\n\nNow let's consider Group 2 or those who perceive Social Pressure to maintain group (i.e., party) affiliation. In these circumstances, while leadership may be theoretically based upon meritocracy (those who perform at an exceptional level are rewarded), other forces are at work within the social structure that pressure people to follow leaders, even if the gap in aptitude or knowledge is questionable, illusory, mistaken, or malevolently promoted (e.g., seniority alone)\n\nThere may be a group of GOP supporters who look to Mitch McConnell, Senate Majority Leader, for leadership more so due to his age and experience over other relevant factors to his position.\n\nThe followers may recognize that they are as capable of leading, or at least contributing to decision-making, as those in power but there is an explicit risk, danger or threat to challenge the existing order . This can consist of \"simple\" peer pressure, wherein one does not want to \"go against the tide.\"\n\nAt times, the risk and consequences of alienating friends, family, or larger social groups is truly \"not worth\" the potential gain; or in overtly authoritarian structures, there is a true danger or threat and one must \"pick your battles\" or be inevitably defeated.\n\nHowever, in a supposed democratic structure or government based in equality, the situations and interpersonal dynamics thus far discussed do not explain why intellectually and/or practically able and/or talented people fall into blind allegiance, cult-like worship, or subservient sycophancy (i.e., becoming yes-people) to persons whom the followers have every ability to recognize as less able, less informed, less effective and very often, of extremely questionable moral standing .\n\nInitially, H.R. McMaster was appointed as National Security Advisor to serve as a potential \"voice of reason\" for an Administration that could use \"good advice\" after the departure of Michael Flynn. In the aftermath of the President's leaking of classified intelligence to Russians visiting the White House, McMaster appeared to take a more \"sycophantic\" position.\n\nIn other words, why do the more qualified individuals in, say government, fall into party line and not speak out against the less qualified leader?\n\nObviously, it is this latter situation that has marked the rise to political power - and (to this time) maintenance of political power of Donald Trump .\n\nHow can this imbalance in qualifications and regression into sycophancy be explained?\n\nWe suggest that one possibility is the search for \"Shared Omnipotence.\"\n\nBefore we further define what this phenomenon is in the sense of leadership, we must first better understand the process by which personal maturity develops, including the personality traits and the interpersonal dynamics that lead to authoritarian leadership and sycophantic obedience (if not worship).\n\nFor these purposes, this process can be divided into five Stages of normal psychological/characterological development (i.e., every person passes through these Stages). These are not discrete and separate phases of development.\n\nThese stages form a continuum that begins with an infantile state (as an infant or toddler) and moves towards mature adulthood - keeping in mind that there is always a risk of stagnation/fixation (getting stuck in a Stage) or regression (falling back to a previous Stage).\n\nFor the purposes of this article, we will discuss the nature of this phenomenon without going too deeply into the reasons why development to emotional maturity may fail.\n\nStage 1) Infantile Dependency\n\nPersons functioning on a level of infantile or childish dependency perceive themselves as extremely vulnerable, lacking an ability for autonomy or even an idea of what being autonomous or independent is like. Therefore, they must rely upon powerful figures in their environment for care, sustenance, and nurturing. This reliance is often blind, unquestioning, and without the ability or luxury of considering whether the controlling power is ethical, \"good\" or malignant - as long as the basic needs for survival are provided.\n\nStage 2) Paranoid/Fearful Stage\n\nAt this level of development, a person does recognize him or herself as an individual who is capable of autonomy and independent decision making, but they perceive an outside entity as so powerful, so dangerous, or so threatening that they have no reasonable choice but to consciously suppress or unconsciously repress any disagreements or doubts and reject any effort to be independent or think independently.\n\nThis may reach the point wherein of internally accepting and following a belief system that the source of the power merits or deserves the power and worship (i.e., a cult-like relationship) or they may appreciate that \"something is wrong\" but feel that it is too dangerous to do anything but to pretend that they are willfully accepting the status quo . The closer a person approaches to \"true belief\", the more likely they are to believe, against all logic, rationality or reason , that they will inevitably benefit from the magnificence of the leader (with \"the ends justifying the means\").\n\nThe closer a person approaches to \"true belief\", the more likely they are to believe, against all logic, rationality or reason , that they will inevitably benefit from the magnificence of the leader (with \"the ends justifying the means\"). This may explain why this woman chose to wear this T-shirt in support of Trump although many would consider this to be misogynistic and offensive.\n\nWithin our society and government, there is a portion of the population that is functioning at this level and within overtly totalitarian systems, there is explicit reinforcement for fixation at this state.\n\nBut this still does not explain the sycophancy of either the members of the public or the members of our government who truly \"know better\" and who, if asked, will steadfastly deny that they are authoritarians.\n\nStage 3) The Stage of Shared Omnipotence\n\nThis brings us to what we believe is the central developmental Stage of our culture , the Stage of \"Shared Omnipotence.\" At this stage of emotional development, it is cognitively-intellectually recognized that other persons, even those in positions of leadership or power, are not super-human, are not endowed with unimaginable power or magnificence - they are essentially equal human beings, capable of having strengths and weaknesses, with areas of expertise and areas of incompetence.\n\nHowever, the childhood fantasy remains that under the proper circumstances - if I find the \"right\" relationship; if we accept the \"right\" leader; if the leader forms the \"right\" circle of advisers (and \"drains the swamp\"), if we form the \"right\" alliance - then we will fulfill the greatest lie ever told to children, \"And so, they lived happily ever after...\"\n\nOne need not go very deep into popular culture (literature, music, drama - and of course, \"advertising\" in different forms) of recent years and generations; the relatively recent past (e.g., Romeo and Juliet) or the distant past (e.g. Helen of Troy) to find explicit or implicit promise that \"if all goes well\", a relationship will be formed that conveys upon the participant a state of \"shared omnipotence\" - the promise of \"living happily ever after.\"\n\nWhile this dynamic is most often portrayed (and on an individual basis, acted out) within romantic relationships, the exact same dynamics apply to political relationships.\n\nLook around you. Look at different levels of social organization. We submit that you will unfailingly find that given enough time, the organization stagnates at, or regresses, to a phase of seeing Shared Omnipotence.\n\nThe basic theme of this fantasy is, \"Together, we can do ANYTHING!\" ( we can even \"Make America Great Again\"). However, if you, the American citizen, reject me/my leadership/our leadership; if you do not ignore all of the blemishes and faults to maintain this relationship - it is not just that we will be apart, but we will be broken .\n\nThe idea of Shared Omnipotence, or \"everyone lives happily ever after,\" influences Trump's campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again\"\n\nIn other words, we will be pathetic, inept, powerless, and vulnerable individuals who not only will never \"life happily ever after\" - but we will be lucky to maintain above a level of chaotic minimal sustenance.\n\nRemember, in his Inaugural Address, the President described the American state of affairs as \"carnage\" that he would work to fix.\n\nExploring aspects of early childhood relationships and how the relationship and the personality is affected by even normal frustration or feelings of deprivation, let alone situations of dysfunction or overt abuse, leads to a deeper appreciation of the emotions and thought processes that promote fixation at the stage of Shared Omnipotence and discourage a higher level of maturity. That discussion is beyond the scope of this article.\n\nYet even without needing to understand the full pathway to emotional stagnation, we can clearly observe the effects.\n\nSimply put, we highly doubt that all (or even most or many) of those who continue to support Donald J. Trump, whether members of the general population, cabinet members/advisers or politicians of the highest level, are paranoid authoritarians, no more mature than infants or young children or are \"merely\" succumbing to social pressure.\n\nRather, dig deep enough, and you will find the unrequited fantasy that aligning with Donald J. Trump - again, despite all logic, rationality or reason , will lead to a shared sense of Greatness and Shared Omnipotence and \"living happily ever after.\"\n\nJust this past week, VP Mike Pence described his role in the Trump Administration as the \"greatest privilege of my life\" and WH Chief of Staff Reince Priebus declared this :\n\n\"On behalf of the entire senior staff around you, Mr. President, we thank you for the opportunity and the blessing that you've given us to serve your agenda and the American people,\"\n\nWH Chief of Staff Reince Priebus was effusive in his praise for the President during a recent Cabinet meeting.\n\nWe note that this dynamic is not unique to Donald Trump. In fact, there is nary a reasonably-high level politician who does not engender this type of allegiance to at least a subtle degree (listen to \"spin\" for ten minutes) and there are few political organizations that do not at least implicitly gravitate toward trying to obtain this unspoken fantasy.\n\nRather, what is unique about Trump is that the personality he portrays in public (whether that is \"truly who he is\" or whether it is to some extent an intentional or evolved \"act\") is so grandiose, so pompous - so narcissistic - that rather than subtly and implicitly playing into the public's wish for Shared Omnipotence, as is the case of most politicians (on both sides of the aisle, as well as the backbone of the message of non-political advertising), Trump openly, unashamedly, and without compunction, empathy or concern, encourages all around him to join him in (what is probably his own constantly-active) fantasy of gaining sufficient power, allegiance, loyalty and worship so as to effect Shared Omnipotence and the (realistically ridiculous, futile and eventually tragic) expectation that he/we will \"live happily ever after.\"\n\nStage 4) Acceptance\n\nFor the sake of completeness, we will note (but not discuss) that the fourth stage of development is that of Acceptance. Simply put, accepting that fairy tales are just that - fairy tales. There is no magic. There is no omnipotence, personal or shared. As individuals and as groups of individuals, we are imperfect. We can strive for \"the best\" but only intermittently and for brief periods of time do we reach an optimal level of success.\n\nStabilizing at this level requires a process of grief and mourning for losing the fantasy we all took part in during our early years: that there can be a magical ending; that we can \"live happily ever after.\"\n\nIt might be asked, \"How can you grieve or mourn a fantasy that never actually existed?\" Perhaps the easiest answer is to observe and talk to a child who just found out that there is no Santa Claus.\n\n5) Mutuality\n\nThis stage involves developing the ability to form relationships with other imperfect people, to allow for social structures and positions of leadership - but to do so as equals, without relinquishing the ability to question, doubt and challenge. In other words, to become responsible mature adult citizens rather than chasing after childish fantasies.\n\nWe are not there. And we are therefore vulnerable and at risk. Perhaps someday we will get there. But then, that, too, might only be a \"meta\" unrealistic fantasy that eventually, we will live \"happily ever after.\"\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\nIn the meantime, we have no alternative than to be satisfied with putting on our boots, wading through the shit, and making the best of it that we can - by courageously embracing logic, rationality, ethics and empathy (i.e., to soundly reject the dangerously fantastical world view of Donald Trump).\n\nRejecting the world view of Trump is totally independent of agreeing with or disagreeing with specific policies or political philosophies he may spread through his prepared speeches, Tweets, or WH statements - policies and \"political philosophies\" that are objectively fluid and inconsistent in that their goal is establishing a state of immature and magical Shared Omnipotence as opposed to mature and realistic Mutuality.\n\nAbout the Authors:\n\nSeth Davin Norrholm, PhD is an Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences at Emory University School of Medicine, a full-time faculty member in the Emory Neuroscience Graduate Program, and a member of the Emory Clinical Psychology Graduate Program.

      "text": "Donald J. Trump Is the Greatest Threat the US Has Ever Faced\n\nMediator, Family Law Attorney, Collaborative Law Practitioner, and Conflict Resolution Coach\n\nOn August 26, 2017, President Trump pardoned Arizona Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who had been convicted of \" criminal contempt for violating a federal court order to stop racially profiling Latinos.\"\n\nAt his Phoenix rally on Tuesday, Trump hinted that he may pardon Arpaio because he was convicted for \" doing his job .\"\n\nUnfortunately, none of this surprised me after having engaged in a discussion on the subject with a friend of mine, who happens to be a Deputy Sheriff and whose worldview differs greatly from mine, politically and otherwise.\n\nDuring that conversation, he said that Arpaio had done nothing wrong and that his conviction was merely political in nature . He described Arpaio as old fashioned in his approach and opined that many of the problems in our society today stem from the fact that such an approach to law enforcement is no longer acceptable. Among other things, he mentioned that Arpaio had inmates wear pink underwear , which clearly impressed him.\n\nDuring our long discussion, he commented that while he's aware that some law enforcement officers are bad apples, he's never met any of those bad apples in his entire career .\n\nIt bears mentioning that he's only a few years away from retirement , so I'm not referring to a rookie. Interestingly enough, he also works for the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. Lee Baca, the former Sheriff of that Department, was recently sentenced to \" three years in federal prison for his role in a scheme to obstruct an FBI investigation of abuses in county jails, marking an end to a corruption scandal that has roiled the Sheriff's Department for several years.\"\n\nThe following is an excerpt from an article by Alison Taylor titled What Do Corrupt Firms Have in Common? Red Flags of Corruption in Organizational Culture that was published by the Center for the Advancement of Public Integrity:\n\nBy no means am I questioning whether my friend has ever engaged in corruption during his career in law enforcement. However, what I am saying is that the reason he claims never to have met any law enforcement officers who would qualify as bad apples likely stems from his personal background and life experiences, including having worked in a Department whose leader from 1998 through 2014 was later convicted for his role in a corruption scandal.\n\nIn fact, at some point, we began discussing how parents might unintentionally raise children who later find themselves on the wrong side of the law.\n\nFor example, I told him about a study that had been released in 2016 regarding the risks of harm from spanking children.\n\nI read him the following excerpt from an article titled Risks of Harm from Spanking Confirmed by Analysis of Five Decades of Research :\n\nHaving never before heard of the Study and knowing nothing other that what I read him, my friend said he disagreed with it.\n\nIt didn't matter to him that this was based upon a meta-analysis, which means that it considered the findings from numerous, large scale studies over 5 decades, involving over 160,000 children. Such a large sample size makes it incredibly difficult to challenge the results; yet, he did just that, offering absolutely no support for his opinion other than his personal beliefs.\n\nMind you, the Study found that \"there is no clear evidence of positive effects from spanking and ample evidence that it poses a risk of harm to children's behavior and development.\" Some children are more resilient than others. However, if there is no upside and only serious potential downsides, why take the risk?\n\nThen, considering the fact that my friend had no problem whatsoever with Arpaio forcing his inmates to wear pink underwear, I brought up social science researcher Brene' Brown's shame research.\n\nAccording to Brene' Brown, Ph.D., \"shame is very correlated with addiction , depression , suicide , aggression, violence, bullying , and eating disorders .\"\n\nDo we really want our law enforcement officers doing things that will have no positive upside and such potential downsides?\n\nAgain, my friend disagreed with such research and offered absolutely no support for his opinion other than his beliefs.\n\nI could be mistaken; however, I've come to the belief that the differences in our worldviews relate to our respective parents' parenting style, by which I don't mean to imply that my parents deserve any awards or accolades for their parenting. For that matter, I really like my friend's parents and am very aware of his very close relationship with them. I do; however, know that my friend praises the benefits of authoritarianism in both parenting and otherwise.\n\nGwen Dewar, Ph.D. describes authoritarian parenting as follows in her article titled The authoritarian parenting style :\n\nDewar explains the potential consequences of authoritarian parenting in Authoritarian parenting: What happens to the kids? , which provides in part as follows:\n\nPutting this into context with regard to my friend's perception of Arpaio and his \"old fashioned approach\", the Phoenix New Times Tweeted as follows after learning of the pardon :\n\nAmong many other things, Phoenix New Times failed to mention that he forced his inmates to wear pink underwear.\n\nIs my Deputy Sheriff friend correct that Arpaio's conviction was entirely political and that he did nothing wrong?\n\nTo reach such a conclusion requires a complete disregard for the rule of law.\n\nCriminal \" contempt of court generally refers to conduct that defies, disrespects or insults the authority or dignity of a court.\"\n\nThe court order that Arpaio violated was an order that he cease and desist from racially profiling Latinos, in violation of the rule of law.\n\nRegardless of your personal beliefs regarding racial profiling, in 1996, the United States Supreme Court found that \" searches or arrests motivated by race are 'unreasonable' under the Fourth Amendment\" and therefore unconstitutional. For what it's worth, it was a unanimous decision.\n\nIn 2003, the Department of Justice under the George W. Bush administration issued a fact sheet regarding racial profiling which stated that \" Racial Profiling Is Wrong and Will Not Be Tolerated .\"\n\nHow then is racial profiling in violation of the law and then violating a court order demanding that Arpaio cease and desist from violating the law his job?\n\nSheriffs and other law enforcement officers are responsible for enforcing the laws, which is why they're called law enforcement officers.\n\nWhat is Rule of Law?\n\n\" The principle is intended to be a safeguard against arbitrary governance, whether by a totalitarian leader or by mob rule. Thus, the rule of law is hostile both to dictatorship and to anarchy.\"\n\nPlacing Trump's pardon of Arpaio into proper perspective, Donald J. Trump is the President of the United States of America. As such, he is the head of the Executive Branch of our government , which is responsible for carrying out the laws - enforcing them.\n\nBy pardoning Arpaio and saying that he was convicted merely for doing his job, Trump has made it crystal clear that he doesn't believe in the Rule of Law and has no intention of carrying out the laws.\n\n\" Before he enter on the Execution of his Office , he shall take the following Oath or Affirmation:-'I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.'\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Donald J. Trump As A 'Morbid Symptom'\n\nWorrell Professor of Anglo-American Studies, Wake Forest University\n\nThe great Italian revolutionary, Antonio Gramsci, when struggling to understand the rise to power of Benito Mussolini, once wrote this of Italy's interwar crisis: that it \"consists precisely in the fact that the old order is dying and the new cannot be born; in this interregnum, a great variety of morbid symptoms appear.\" For Gramsci, the bombastic and narcissistic Mussolini was one such morbid symptom; and it is tempting - given the obvious parallels that could be drawn - to understand Donald J. Trump as his modern-day equivalent. Indeed, that parallel has been drawn , and drawing it can be a source of both comfort and enlightenment. But if full comfort and enlightenment are what we really seek, there is much to be gained by focusing instead on the first half of that quotation rather than on the second.\n\nFor if Gramsci was right, you get a Mussolini, or a Donald J. Trump, or for that matter the UK's Nigel Farage, only in the gaps between broad periods of economic stability and social order; and the fact that we now have a president like Donald J. Trump is yet more evidence that - around him and us - an old order is dying and a new one cannot yet be born. If Gramsci was right, understanding the present in this manner, as an interregnum, is in that sense potentially both enlightening and comforting. It is enlightening, in that it underscores the impossibility of finding a new order by relenting pursing the old, in the manner of the Republican Party here and the Conservatives in London; and it is comforting, in that creating that new order gives an overwhelming purpose to the politics of those most opposed to those conservatives - namely the Democrats and the British Labour Party.\n\nI\n\nThe \"old order\" - the one that \"is dying\" - is the neoliberal one called into existence in the United States by Ronald Reagan and in the United Kingdom by Margaret Thatcher. It was an \"order\" based on the deregulation of business, the curtailment of welfare spending, and the generation of economic growth through the weakening of labor movements and the easing of taxation on the rich. In that \"order,\" the steady pursuit of trickle-down economics left wages stagnant for the mass and generality of workers for an entire generation, obliging working families to maintain or increase their standard of life only by extending the length of the working day, by sending every available member of the family out to paid work, and by taking on higher and higher levels of personal debt. It was that debt-based order that came crashing down in spectacular fashion in September 2008; and which conservative forces on both sides of the Atlantic have been trying to revive ever since by pressing for yet more of the same - more austerity, more tax cuts for the rich, and more deregulation. The Trump budget, and the looming fight over the debt ceiling here in the United States, indicate very clearly that the old order, though dying, is not yet dead. That Trump budget also indicates that the adverse social consequences of now nearly four decades of neoliberalism are poised to become even worse.\n\nThat \"old order,\" of course, was itself once \"new\" - a reaction in the 1980s to the failure of the New Deal, Keynesian-based order that Democrats in the US, and the Labour Party in the UK, had created in the 1940s: a social compact built on linking wages to productivity that had generated rises in both for a quarter century before running into the buffer of stagflation in the 1970s. Like the 2010s, the 1970s as a decade were full of \"morbid symptoms;\" but unlike the 2010s, the 1970s were a decade of crisis not for conservatives - they had never bought into the New Deal - but for progressives in both the US and the UK who most definitely had. The Center-Left \"owned\" the New Deal settlement, just as now the Center-Right \"owns\" the neoliberal one. The 1970s collapse of the New Deal settlement gave the Center-Right its chance to build a new order, more empathetic to its values and interests. The collapse of their neo-liberal order gives contemporary progressives their chance to do the same. The question therefore becomes: will that chance be taken?\n\nII\n\nIt could be. I hope it will be; but it will be only if several things occur.\n\n· The first is that key players - in the Democratic Party here, and their equivalents in the British Labour Party - recognize this as the agenda that is now before them. The temptation - in both parties - to play safe and negative is huge, but will need to be avoided. It will not be enough to place the political focus on the morbid symptoms themselves. That vital critique will have to be supplemented by the clear articulation of a bigger thing: a coherent and more progressive way of organizing both the economy and its social rewards. What is at stake here - and the Center-Left must both realize it, and educate its supporters in that realization - is the creation of a new period of stability based on progressive values and sustained by progressive policies. Since those policies, as well as those values, will be vehemently opposed by conservative forces and their privileged backers, it is all the more vital that the Center-Left spends creative time now mapping out in detail what those policies should be, and what kind of economic and social order they will generate.\n\n· The second is that, in the process of that mapping, both leaders and activists in the Democratic Party and the Labour Party must make a sharp break with their parties' own recent accommodation to neoliberalism. There can be no going back to Clinton-style triangulation, or to Blairite enthusiasms for lightly-regulated financial institutions and weakened trade unionism. The biggest struggle the Center-Left currently faces is this internal one: the resistance, within its own leadership ranks, to this rupture with the past and this move towards a new progressive settlement. For too many leading figures in both parties right now, making that move involves admitting their own past errors of judgment; but that admission is vital, if center-left parties are ever going to speak with one voice as they educate their own supporters in the scale of change needed to bring the interregnum to a rapid and a progressive end.\n\nThere is no escaping the fact, however, that if these are the changes that are required in the politics of the Democratic Left, then meeting them will be enormously difficult. The problem of agency here is a huge one, and the major barrier to success that the Left faces on both sides of the Atlantic is ultimately itself! But there are small hopeful signs of progress on this front, not least away from these shores, in the growing strength and sophistication of the leadership of the Labour Party by Jeremy Corbyn and his allies. There is even some movement in the desired direction back here in the United States: with a slightly more radical set of policy proposals beginning to emerge at last from the Democratic Party leadership in the Senate, and with a raft of more progressive proposals now emerging from individual members of Congress (some well-known, some just starting out) and from well-established progressive legislative groups within the Democratic Party as a whole. But the creation of an all- embracing progressive consensus on both next steps and long-term goals is, as yet, far from complete and long overdue in both countries. For until and unless that creation happens, the danger is very real that one Donald. J. Trump presidency will be followed - not by the dawn of a new progressive era - but by a second Trump presidency, or by something worse! Donald J. Trump may not be the only morbid symptom we have yet to endure. But let us hope that he is - and let us call the Democratic Left to its epoch-making task!\n\nFirst posted, with full citations, at www.davidcoates.net .\n\nThe arguments developed here are explored further in David Coates (editor), Reflections on the Future of the Left, to be published in September in the UK by Agenda Publishing and in the US in November by Columbia University Press.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Donald Trump Orders Freeze On All Federal Grants And Loans In Huge Power Grab\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nSenior National Correspondent, HuffPost\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday issued a sweeping memo ordering a halt to all grant, loan and other financial assistance programs disbursed by the federal government, a massive policy change that could affect a huge range of services across the country.\n\nMatthew J. Vaeth, the acting director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, writes in the memo that federal agencies should temporarily pause grant and loan programs until Trump's administration can ensure they are consistent with the president's agenda, including bans on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives, and limits on clean energy spending.\n\n\"The American people elected Donald J. Trump to be President of the United States and gave him a mandate to increase the impact of every federal tax dollar,\" Vaeth wrote . \"The use of Federal resources to advance Marxist equity, transgenderism, and green new deal social engineering policies is a waste of taxpayer dollars that does not improve the day-to-day lives of those we serve.\"\n\nThe memo states the order, which goes into effect Tuesday, does not affect Social Security or Medicare recipients and that financial assistance put on hold \"does not include assistance provided directly to individuals,\" according to The Washington Post .\n\nDemocrats warned that Trump's latest directive could significantly harm programs used by millions of Americans, including food and rent assistance, early childhood programs, nonprofit organizations and children's health insurance, among many others.\n\n\"They say this is only temporary, but no one should believe that,\" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said in a statement on Monday. \"Donald Trump must direct his Administration to reverse course immediately and the taxpayers' money should be distributed to the people.\"\n\n\"These grants help people in red states and blue states, support families, help parents raise kids, and lead to stronger communities,\" the senator added, warning the spending freeze will \"mean missed payrolls and rent payments and everything in between: chaos for everything from universities to non-profit charities.\"\n\nMonday's proclamation is only the latest Trump attempt to freeze federal government functions. Last week, Trump ordered government agencies to pause other funds appropriated by Congress - including key climate investments, money for infrastructure projects and nearly all U.S. assistance to foreign nations - challenging the constitutional role of Congress and its power of the purse.\n\nAnd over the weekend, Trump fired at least 18 inspectors general whose job is to root out corruption in government agencies. He did it without notifying Congress, a move critics denounced as a \"chilling purge.\"\n\nTrump's executive orders are likely to face legal challenges, but his intention is not difficult to grasp: an unprecedented effort to seize power, from a president far more unbound this time than during his first presidential term.\n\n\"This is what we were worried about ― some enormous, broad thing that would stop funding for huge swaths of the government that he simply doesn't like and doesn't agree with,\" Bobby Kogan, senior director of federal budget policy at the liberal Center for American Progress, told HuffPost.\n\n\"He says he's going after grants, loans and federal financial assistance, and he calls it three out of ten trillion dollars, so theoretically he's pausing like a third of government funding ― which is illegal and massive,\" Kogan added.\n\nTrump and his allies have long opposed the Impoundment Control Act, which sets limits on how much a president can restrict money that's been approved by Congress. This latest order may be designed to spark a legal battle and ensure the Impoundment Control Act is reviewed by the U.S. Supreme Court, where conservatives hold a 6-3 majority.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "The Rise Of Donald J. Trump And The Return Of The Tournament Male\n\nVitality Innovator and Organizational Trainer\n\nPresident-Elect Donald J. Trump has been pegged by some as a bully , pathological liar , sociopath , narcissist , sexual predator and demagogue. Even children whose social and emotional intelligence is not fully realized can recognize him as a man with great psychological flaws or \"crazy\" as my 9-year-old daughter found a word to make sense of his behavior.\n\nThere is another moniker for the President-elect that ties all of Trump's political and business shenanigans into a coherent image. Donald Trump is a Tournament Male , and his political rise signifies a return of the tournament male in American society.\n\nWithin the geeky corridors of evolutionary biology , a tournament male finds power and reproductive opportunity through competition. Mating is proceeded by winning the blood-sport, more or less. Tournament Females have to endure the power of the tournament males whose bodies tend to be significantly larger and stronger, yet they benefit by having more competent offspring. When it comes to rearing the young, they are left to it on their own. These are the social realities of life as a Tournament Species .\n\nPair Bonding is the other genetically wired mating approach in species. Pair Bonding Species court, mate, and rear their young as relative equals. The journey is much more a cooperative venture that involves the time and energy contribution of both sexes. Though it is always noted that cuckoldry is part and parcel of pair bonding relationships.\n\nAs it has turned out, human genes carry a mix of both tournament and pair bonding behaviors. This simple biological truth is at the core of humanity's long history to survive and sort out how we should live. It doesn't take much to see that the history of the world has been an immense elaboration on the reproductive pros and cons of being a species of power or a species of reciprocity.\n\nIf we view our American infatuation with Donald Trump through the lens of behavioral genetics, suddenly the pattern becomes clear. His constant effort to expose the weaknesses of others and fabricate his own imagined prowess- tournament male. His shameless act of grabbing \" pussy \"- tournament male. The use of the term \"cuck\" by the hardcore \"Red Hats\" to denigrate Hillary supporters - tournament male.\n\nEven Trump's campaign promise to \"Make America Great Again\" is an argument for the power of the tournament male. While Hillary Clinton's \"Stronger Together\" on the other hand is a clear invocation of pair bonding values. In the end, each campaign was essentially acting as a voice for this ancient dilemna of how to live out our genetic instincts.\n\nWe can see that Trump's appeal has been his total commitment to embody the principles of the tournament male, which heretofore wasn't acceptable in presidential politics. The tournament male engaged American Politics like an overt blood-sport. Display, threats, social-humiliation, deception, sexual conquest worked together to create an appearance not of recklessness but of strength.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

If they don't have a healthy place to express themselves, they can always reappear in places we never would have imagined...places like the Oval Office.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Rigged: The Acquittal of Donald J. Trump\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nSens. Jeff Merkley and Brian Schatz join Mehdi Hasan to discuss the implications of Wednesday's Senate vote finding the president not guilty on both articles of impeachment.\n\nAs predicted, the Republican-controlled Senate voted on Wednesday to find President Donald Trump not guilty on both articles of impeachment brought by the House of Representatives. It was a party-line vote, with one notable exception: Utah Sen. Mitt Romney became the first senator in U.S. history to vote to remove a president of his own party. Democratic Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Brian Schatz of Hawaii, who both voted to remove the president, joined Mehdi Hasan by phone shortly after the vote to discuss the implications of Trump's acquittal for the future of the Senate.\n\nMehdi Hasan: Hello, this is Mehdi Hasan - a quick announcement before we start the show today: if you're in LA this coming Monday, February 10th, we're recording a special episode of Deconstructed on the massive issue of criminal justice reform and mass incarceration and racism in front of a live audience at the Writers Guild Theater, and with special, oh very special guests John Legend, yeah, that John Legend, and Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors. Go to the Intercept website or to my Twitter feed for details on how to buy tickets, before they're all gone - and if you're NOT in LA, well make sure you tell your friends and family in LA about it. You do not want to miss this show. Now, on to the show.\n\nJeff Merkley: I don't believe you can truly be acquitted if you haven't had a fair and full trial. This is the first time in the history of the United States of America that the majority leader conspired to ensure there was not a fair trial.\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nMH: Welcome to a special early edition of Deconstructed at the end of the Senate impeachment trial. I'm Mehdi Hasan.\n\nDonald Trump is in the clear. He may be an impeached president - only the third in American history - but he wasn't convicted or removed from office on Wednesday. No, he was acquitted by the United States Senate - or, I should say, by every single Republican senator bar Mitt Romney.\n\nBrian Schatz: Mitt Romney changed the equation. This is now the first instance of a United States senator voting to convict a president of his or her own party.\n\nMH: That was the voice of Democratic Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, who is one of my guests on the show today, as is the Democratic Senator from Oregon, Jeff Merkeley, both of whom, like every other Democrat voted to remove the president from office. But they failed. And Trump lives to fight another day. So now what? What does this all mean?\n\nJohn Roberts: The Senate having tried Donald john Trump, President of the United States, upon two articles of impeachment, exhibited against him by the House of Representatives, and two thirds of the senators present not having found him guilty of the charges contained therein, it is therefore ordered and adjudged that the said Donald John Trump be, and he is hereby acquitted of the charges in said articles.\n\nMH: There you have it. The Senate voting to acquit Donald John Trump, 45th president of the United States, on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, charges for which he was impeached in the House of Representatives.\n\nIn the Senate though, it wasn't really a trial. I mean, have you ever heard of a trial with no witnesses in it? None. Nada. Zero. In fact, it was the first Senate impeachment trial in American history not to feature any witnesses. Even though one potential witness, John Bolton, the president's own former national security adviser, one-time hero of the Republican Party, volunteered to testify in the Senate, and even has a book coming out filled with his eye-witness testimony. He, by the way, says in that book, yeah Trump did do what the Democrats accuse him of doing, of holding up aid to Ukraine in order to get the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens - ergo he was not called by Republican senators. They didn't wanna know. You remember that old saying: \"See no evil, hear no evil and then do...lots of evil.\"\n\nRepublicans bent over backwards to try and defend Trump or justify keeping him in office: yeah he did bad things, but they're not impeachable. They're not crimes - and you have to commit a crime to be impeached and removed - a position, by the way, shared by no constitutional scholars or legal experts on this subject with the exception of former Jeffrey Epstein lawyer Alan Dershowitz.\n\nMeanwhile, House Democrats, who I criticized on this show for not going bigger on impeachment -not going after Trump for all his other high crimes and misdemeanors, from his corruption and violation of the Emoluments Clause, to his obstruction of justice over the Russia investigation, to his kidnapping of migrant children from their parents at the border - those House Democrats, to be fair to them, led by Adam Schiff, did make a pretty strong case for convicting Trump over abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in relation to his attempt to extort and pressure the president of Ukraine, to use U.S. aid money to try and trigger a bogus corruption investigation into a domestic political rival.\n\nAdam Schiff: Donald Trump has betrayed his oath to protect and defend the Constitution but it's not too late for us to honor ours, to wield our power to defend our democracy.\n\nMH: But the whole thing was rigged from the get-go. Not just in terms of no witnesses, even when John Bolton was volunteering in the midst of the Senate trial to testify, and dodgy Trump donor and indicted Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas was producing secret recordings of Trump ordering the taking out of the US ambassador to Ukraine, but also in terms of the trial itself and the \"jurors\" themselves. Because that's what senators were supposed to be: independent and impartial jurors, they took an oath to that effect, and yet before it even began you had Senate Majority Leader Republican Mitch McConnell saying:\n\nMitch McConnell: Everything I do during this, I'm coordinating with White House Counsel. There will be no difference between the president's position and our position.\n\nMH: And Republican Senator Lindsey Graham saying:\n\nLindsey Graham: I am trying to give a pretty clear signal I've made up my mind. I am not pretending to be a fair juror here.\n\nMH: Got that? Jurors, on tape, bragging that they have no intention of being fair or impartial and that they're openly coordinating with the defendant. That's the \"trial\" we just had in the Senate - surely a low point in the modern history of that body. I mean, first confirming Brett Kavanaugh and now acquitting Donald Trump.\n\nSo what happens now? Well, giving leaders impunity, especially reckless power-hungry rulers like Trump, has consequences and they tend not to be good ones. Do you remember what happened the day after Robert Mueller testified in Congress last July and then... nothing happened? There were no consequences for Trump, no impeachment of the president. Well, the next day, the very next day, an emboldened Trump made his \"perfect\" phone call to the Ukrainian president asking him to investigate the Bidens. One can only imagine what the acquitted yet still very corrupt and crooked president will be doing on Thursday, the morning after he's acquitted: who he'll be calling, what he'll be demanding.\n\nIt is not an overstatement, it's not hyperbole, to say that American politics, American democracy, is in crisis. I mean: How can a presidential system like America's survive when you have a president who isn't constrained by any constitutional checks or balances? When his own party says he can do what he likes and he won't be stopped, he won't be touched?\n\nListen to presidential history Jon Meacham speaking the other day on television:\n\nJon Meachem: President Trump is functionally a monarch at this point. If the king does it, it's okay that's what we're seeing unfold in Washington right now.\n\nMH: But, with this shameful vote, the Republicans have decided, and announced to the world, that their party is officially the Trump Party, the Trump Cult, that the constitution doesn't matter, that Congress doesn't matter, checks and balances don't matter, foreign policy and national security doesn't matter.\n\nWell, Republicans with the exception of Mitt Romney. On Wednesday, the junior Republican senator from Utah, former Republican presidential candidate, decided to do the right thing and voted to convict and remove Donald Trump becoming the first senator in U.S. history to vote to remove a president of his own party from office:\n\nMitt Romney: Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine. With my vote, I will tell my children, their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability believing that my country expected it of me.\n\nMH: I want to say a couple of things about Mitt Romney. First off, and I never thought I'd say this: but respect to Romney. It's not easy to go against your own friends, colleagues, many of your own constituents, your own political party, especially one as intolerant and cultish as the modern Republican Party. I've been a massive and long-standing critic of Romney. I thought he ran an awful campaign against Obama in 2012, and I thought he was a bit of a hypocrite for taking money and an endorsement from Trump in 2012, then attacking Trump in 2016, then trying to get a job in the Trump administration after Trump won, and getting Trump's endorsement when he ran for the Senate in Utah. But, credit where credit's due, he did the right thing today. He voted with his conscience - the only Republican to do so.\n\nSecondly, though, what's so ironic about the Romney vote is that almost immediately Don Jr, the president's failson, took to Twitter, demanding Romney be expelled from the GOP. And yet, just a week ago, Republicans were clutching their pearls and pretending to be outraged when Adam Schiff referred to a CBS News report saying they were too afraid of voting against Trump because they'd been told \"your head will be on a pike.\"\n\nJames Landford: One of the most remarkable moments of the entire day was when Adam Schiff ended the night by saying \"Republicans have been told their head will be on a pike by the president if they vote against him.\" That is completely, totally false and all of us were shaking our heads like where in the world did that story come from?\n\nMH: Well, turns out Trump and co do indeed want Romney's head on a pike. They can't tolerate the fact that even one Republican senator voted against the absolute monarch. Voted against King Trump.\n\nLook, I know it's fashionable to say that Americans don't care about impeachment, it's all very technical, it's not a kitchen table issue, it's too complicated, and it's too distant from ordinary people's lives, but let me be clear: if you care about democracy in this country, if you care about accountability, the rule of law, checks and balances, the constitution, if you care about the ongoing slide into full blown authoritarianism and open criminality, then you need to care about what happened today, you need to be angry and outraged that this trial was rigged by a Republican Party who wanted to impeach Hillary Clinton over Benghazi but give Donald Trump, who's a thousand times more lawless and a million times more corrupt, a complete pass. So yes, please, get angry.\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nMH: Joining me now to discuss this, from Capitol Hill, where the Senate trial of Donald Trump has just ended, is Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon. Senator, great to have you back on the show, shame it's under these circumstances.\n\nJM: Yes, yes. Well, I'm feeling the weight of this dark and tragic day.\n\nMH: I'm looking at a screen in front of me saying Donald Trump Acquitted is the banner headline on all the new sites. You've just come out of that trial and the voting. How do you feel about that?\n\nJM: Well, I don't believe you can truly be acquitted if you haven't had a fair and full trial. And certainly, this is a tragic day because this is the first time in the history of the United States of America that the majority leader conspired, as he put it, hand in glove to work with the defendant to ensure there was not a fair trial. This is not doing impartial justice. And as every American knows a trial is not a trial if it does not have witnesses and documents. So, this was a cover up and it should be considered nothing more than that.\n\nMH: Completely agree with you on your analysis of the cover up. But here's a question for you as someone who deals with Republican senators, they're your colleagues on Capitol Hill every day, even if they'd voted for witnesses, let's say John Bolton had turned up and said, \"Yes, the President told me last summer hold back the aid until we get the investigations into the Bidens,\" do you think that they still wouldn't have voted to acquit him?\n\nJM: I believe that once the door was open to all of the machinations that were going inside, among the cabinet secretaries, among the Office of Management and Budget, we would have seen the profile of a much more extensive scandal, something that would have persuaded much of America that indeed, this was a crime against the Constitution, and that would have had a big impact on the vote.\n\nMH: Now I understand what you're saying and you might be right. I'm just looking at the polling which shows you know, half of Americans already so supported conviction and removal. Three quarters of Americans supported witnesses. The evidence the House managers brought forward from Trump employees, from members of you know, the administration was pretty damning. And yet you couldn't get more than one Republican senator to join you in the vote today. That's how they've doubled down behind Donald Trump, the Republicans in the Senate.\n\nJM: Well, think about it this way: the more the scandal penetrated various departments of President Trump's administration, the Secretary of State or the State Department, the Department of Defense, you of course, had the Foreign Service engaged in this. You had the Department of Energy engaged in this, the more determination of this administration to apply pressure to make sure that the lid was not lifted on this can of worms. And that pressure in this very partisan age, won out over the oath to do impartial justice and the oath to honor the constitution and of course, the constitution in calling for the Senate to hold a trial envisioned all of the protections of a trial for full justice, and that is witnesses and documents. So, people violated their oath to the constitution and violated their oath of impartial justice because of that pressure, and that's what makes this a very tragic day in America.\n\nMH: One person who says he had to break with his party because of his oath to the Constitution, he said, because of his conscience, because of his faith was former Republican presidential candidate, the Senator from Utah, Mitt Romney. What did you make of his vote today to convict and remove a president from his own party?\n\nJM: It was a powerful statement that he delivered. I happened to be walking by a television as he came on to the screen. So, I heard at least a share of his statement and this is extraordinarily difficult to do. Remember you have the combined force of Mitch McConnell, who said he'd work hand in glove with the president to produce exoneration, you had all of these officials that serve the president, you have this extraordinary pressure to show that you are a member of the team, not the American team, not the team of senators assigned to do impartial justice but the Republican team assigned to defend the president. And that individual, Mitt Romney, did something remarkable that will be remembered through the decades to come as an act of extraordinary courage and fidelity to an oath that he took as he put it, not just to the Constitution and not just impartial justice, but to do so before God.\n\nMH: And just on the House Democrats who brought the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate, do you think there's anything they could have done differently either in the House or in terms of making their arguments in the Senate? What do you think about the Democratic approach to this whole thing?\n\nJM: I don't believe there's anything else that they could have done that would have made a difference. Would I suggest to them that they had brought in Emoluments Clause? Yes. Would I suggest to them they should have brought forth an article of impeachment that addressed the four cases in the Mueller report, in which Muller found substantial evidence on all three key points of the law for obstruction of justice, including one obstruction of justice that included witness tampering? Absolutely. In fact, on those four cases, we received a letter from over 1,000 former federal prosecutors who said anyone else America would be indicted. I really disagreed with their decision not to lay out that set of cases. I would have liked to seen the House absolutely lay out the criminal issues. It is a crime to solicit foreign interference in an election. If that interference is worth over $25,000, it is a felony and if you're holding up over $300 million of aid, you can anticipate the value of that contribution you're seeking is over $25,000. This was a felony act. The House did not make that clear. I do not believe any of those things would have changed the outcome. But I do believe it would have been a much fuller exploration addressing the criminal conduct of Donald Trump.\n\nMH: Do you think Democrats now should let go or there's talk of actually expanding investigations back in the House, subpoenaing John Bolton, do you support that?\n\nJM: That's a decision for the House to make. I do feel that the window to explore this effort has from my perspective, closed. And that now we turn to the court of judgment that will occur in November with the election in the United States of America.\n\nMH: And in that election, that's coming up. We saw the Iowa caucuses. A little bit of a disaster for your party this week. What did you make of the fallout from Iowa?\n\nJM: You know, time and again, I've seen software rolled out when it hadn't been fully tested, and create a fiasco. The City of Portland, Oregon, had a water billing system that was a complete disaster. The State of Oregon was not prepared for a clean roll-out of the Affordable Care Act and we had to resort to paper because the website was such a mess. In this case, had we not - It's just frustrating that they hadn't learned the lessons of that, that you have to do a full test. It's great to run a pilot project. It's great to make the use optional, but be prepared for it not to work. I know that those who are evaluating this right now are going to make sure that it runs like clockwork four years from now. I don't consider this a major flaw in the course, think of this is the first lap of a 50-lap race. And the track was messed up on that first track, on that first loop around the track, but it will be in good shape for the next 49.\n\nMH: Senator, last time you were on the show back in 2018, you said you were considering running for president yourself you ended up deciding not to run? Do you have a candidate? Do you have a favorite? Have you picked anyone yet?\n\nJM: No, I decided not to endorse, at least for now in the near future. And I must say it's partly to celebrate the tremendous number of folks who are bringing their talents to bear who have so much to say about putting our nation back on track, about taking on the challenge of carbon pollution that's destroying our planet. We see the ramifications all over my home state of Oregon, about taking on equality of opportunity for every American and certainly for the LGBTQ community and passing Equality Act, for taking on the fundamentals for families to thrive, because there's four foundations, there's healthcare, there's education, there's housing, and there's good paying jobs, and there's so much work to be done. And so I celebrate the many ideas that have been put forward, the dialogue that's happened in this primary.\n\nMH: That group that you're celebrating, do you include in that former Republican mayor of New York, former George W. Bush supporter, Michael Bloomberg?\n\nJM: Well, he will soon be entering the contest. And I do have reservations about the fact that we've reached the point in the extraordinary maldistribution of wealth, where a few individuals who have benefited so much from the infrastructure laid down by the preceding generation are in a position to essentially take a shortcut to prominence in the election. I don't want to see a country and basically where you have to be a mega-millionaire to to run for office because we will not get the view of ordinary Americans expressed. I live in a blue collar community. I grew up in that blue collar community. My dad was a mechanic. We need more people who live in communities where families are experiencing the challenges of the shortcomings of government over the last four decades.\n\nMH: One last question before I let you go, just circling back to the president and impeachment, now that he's been \"acquitted,\" are we going to see an even more emboldened and reckless Trump who thinks \"I can get away with anything?\" Is he going to do even more crazier, more criminal things between now and November because he believes there are no constraints on him?\n\nJM: Well, I do think that those around him will try to constrain the craziest acts he might embark on. But that's never worked to date. In fact the lesson that he can take from this is not that be wary about abusing your office, but that if you abuse your office, you have a partisan team that will make sure that neither the judicial process nor the impeachment process can hold you accountable. That is a horrific lesson. That's another reason today is a very dark and tragic day.\n\nMH: On that note Senator Jeff Merkley. Thanks for joining me on deconstructed You're welcome. Thank you.\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nMH: That was Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregan, speaking to me from the Senate. One of the most fascinating and depressing things about watching this trial has been the way in which Republicans and their enablers in the media have been gaslighting us on a near daily basis, making demonstrably false claims, about how Republicans weren't allowed to question witnesses in the House, which is a lie, or how the impeachment process itself is a violation of the Constitution, which is of course a lie.\n\nOne of the Democrats who has been best at calling at Republican hypocrisy, mendacity and gaslighting, and calling at the media's failure to fully hold Trump and Co. to account is Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, who I would add is a very amusing politician to follow on Twitter. He joins me now on his way out of Capitol Hill, on the phone, after the vote:\n\nSenator Brian Schatz thanks for joining me on Deconstructed.\n\nBS: Happy to be here.\n\nMH: You've just come out of the Senate vote. Donald Trump has been acquitted. What's your first reaction?\n\nBS: Well, it's mixed feelings and I'll tell you why. This was horrifying for American democracy. And partly because of the Dershowitz arguments that were being made over the final week. It became even more worrisome not just for Trump, but for any president and the idea that undergirds their theory of executive power is really dangerous for our constitutional order. So, that's one thing. The other thing is that just on a personal level, I was deeply disappointed in some of my Republican colleagues, with whom I, by necessity have a functional working relationship, but to see them through this process, disappoint me and not be willing to even vote for something that would resemble a fair trial had gotten me down.\n\nNow, let me tell you the good news. The good news is that Mitt Romney changed the equation. This is now the first instance of a United States senator voting to convict a president of his or her own party and that was an extraordinary act of courage. I worked really hard for Barack Obama and against Mitt Romney but Mitt has become my friend. Mitt is an example of the Republican Party of the 70s and 80s and 90s, with which I disagreed vehemently, but they were not doing the institutional damage that that Trump's party is doing. So, it was just personally gratifying for me to see that and I think it's got political implications too because they now have a bipartisan guilty vote. And also Doug Jones, who represents Alabama, Joe Manchin, who represents West Virginia, Kyrsten Sinema, who represents Arizona they all voted guilty on both counts.\n\nMH: All Democrats in swing states.\n\nBS: All democrats in swing states, all did the right thing and did it for the right reasons. And so perhaps unusually, but perhaps auguring well for unity and moral clarity, all of the Democrats were together, and the Republicans were at least ever so slightly split because I think what Adam Schiff tried to attempt to do was really smart. He knew he wasn't going to win a conviction, but he just wanted to prick the consciences not just of the nation, but of individual senators and I thought it was extraordinary. And I was, for the first time in probably several weeks, I was, again, proud to be part of this institution.\n\nMH: So let me just pick up you made a couple of points there. I'll come back to Mitt Romney in a moment and that was a fascinating vote by him. But just in terms of you mentioned, kind of the implications for presidential power. You also mentioned your Republican colleagues. Let's just start with the Republican colleagues, you said you were disappointed. Isn't that a bit of an understatement given, it's not just that all of them but Romney voted to clear the president. But they spent the last week or two and you saw this up close and personal, not just saying \"Oh, we're going to defend the president, we're not going to vote to convict him,\" but just lying and not just like gaslighting on a daily basis saying things like there's no new evidence and there's no need for witnesses and there are no witnesses and just the number of sheer lies they told over the last couple of weeks.\n\nBS: Sure, but those are not the ones that disappointed me. I know Tom Cotton and Marsha Blackburn and all of these folks who make a living in that sort of fever swamp universe. They're not capable of disappointing me.\n\nMH: Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, they're still capable of disappointing even now?\n\nBS: Susan did not disappoint me and I will just leave it there. But Lisa and I are friends and she was there on the Brent Kavanaugh vote and she was there on the Affordable Care Act vote and she was personally not sure what to do all the way to the end. That was a personal disappointment to me. But I think you're right that the behavior, to characterize what happened as disappointing is to understate the sort of venal, craven dishonest thing that's going on right now and to underestimate the potential impact. Now, the silver lining on the Dershowitz theory of the case is that I mean, even the President's Counsel basically benched him after he had that riff late at night. It was sort of, I likened it to a, you know, a sort of a self indulgent guitar solo, which starts out kind of interesting, but then sort of takes the song in a direction and everyone wants him to stop. I mean, that was about Alan Dershowitz.\n\nMH: Just to clarify for our listeners, you're referring to when Alan Dershowitz said, basically, if the president does something because he thinks he's gonna get reelected, it's in the public interest, whatever the President thinks is good for him is good for the country.\n\nBS: Yeah, well, there were actually two arguments. That was sort of so outrageous that I don't know that anybody really embraced it. But the other one is a little more insidious because what they're basically saying is the president possesses power. And if he uses that power lawfully then it can't be impeachable, and that is exactly upside down because the reason you give the impeachment authorities in Congress is because you're giving a president this extraordinary Constitutional power. So let me give you an example. If a president decided to use the pardon power, which is total, which is plenary, which is sort of unquestioned as a matter of law, if he decided to pardon in people only in blue states or red states are only people who were for him or punish those who are against them, no one could say that he was unlawfully using his power. What we would say is he's abusing the authority in his possession and therefore must be impeached. And what Dershowitz does is turn that whole thing on its head and say no, as long as it's an Article Two power, it cannot be abused and that is terrifying.\n\nMH: It's terrifying also amusing. Of course, as you know, once there's a Democratic president in office, they won't be pushing these legal theories at all. It's only lots of executive power if you're a Republican president.\n\nBS: Well, fair enough. I think that's absolutely right. And, you know, one of our structural disadvantages is they are able to accomplish a lot of their goals, destroying the government's - Doing everything they can to deregulate industries, getting a lot of federal judges through. They don't need institutions to work in order to get what they want. We need institutions to work in order to pass our agenda. So the kind of maximalist sort of game theory, you know, the kind of internet strategist that says, \"Why don't you guys kick more ass and be more tough?\" Fair enough, I think sometimes we are a little bit too focused on decorum and stability, but we do have to remember that we need these institutions and these guys don't. They have what they need just as long as they can stack the federal judiciary and gut -\n\nMH: But you don't need, for example, a filibuster, which, you know, Republican behavior in recent days is another reminder of why candidates like Elizabeth Warren who say get rid of the filibuster probably are more practical about what needs to be done under a Democratic president than maybe other candidates who think I could still work with the Republicans.\n\nBS: Yeah, I think, you know, listen, I think that we'll see whose theory of the case ends up being right, but I have a strong, strong suspicion that the moment we have a Democratic president whether it's anywhere anywhere from Joe Biden to Elizabeth to Amy Klobuchar to Bernie that they will treat them the same which is to block everything and then we'll have some decisions to make.\n\nMH: And let me just circle back to Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney. You mentioned that you know, you were disappointed, what happened. One of the things Lisa Murkowski said, \"I was was very upset when Adam Schiff mentioned -\" You know, a lot of these senators came out and said \"We're horrified that Adam Schiff could say that we're being threatened by the White House, that our heads will be on pikes,\" was a CBS News report. The irony is today after Mitt Romney voted to convict and remove Donald Trump, Donald Trump's failson, Don Jr. took to Twitter to say he should be expelled from the GOP. Oh, the irony.\n\nBS: Yeah, well, I mean, look, it was, yes, of course, they have heads on pikes. And by the way, I don't know. I work in politics. Heads on pikes is not an uncommon phrase. I hate to say it when you're talking about consequences politically, electorally, that's one of the things people say maybe they shouldn't, but it's not so beyond the pale to imagine that a White House political advisor, whether it's Eric Ueland or Rahm Emanuel, frankly, would talk like that. So, that's number one. But I think the broader point is, remember, it was first that Nancy Pelosi used too many signing pens, right?\n\nAnd then it was Jerry Nadler used the word treachery and then it was heads on pikes, and then it was Elizabeth Warren, asked the question of the Chief Justice that got someone's nose out of joint. And my friend Sheldon Whitehouse, you know, we were sort of ruminating on what they do here because certainly you don't want to give them any openings to claim grievances and outrage but in the end, you can't execute perfectly and give them the aperture for outrage because they're looking for one.\n\nAnd especially in that moment, when Adam Schiff had the room and I could feel their guilt emanating almost had a physical sensation of how they were experiencing their conscience for that moment. And then he quoted the heads on pikes thing, and then Tom Cotton started shouting and James Lankford, you know, and what they found was, what Sheldon Whitehouse called the \"outrage offramp\". That whatever Trump is doing, it is only just as bad as whatever the Democrats did.\n\nMH: That's their get out, obviously. And one the reasons I enjoy following you on Twitter, Senator, is you're one of the few high profile Democrats who's willing to basically call out the fact that the Republicans now, the vast majority of them, are bad faith actors, you can't really take seriously a lot of what they say and their media enablers.\n\nBS: Yeah, I mean, it's  sad for me to say but there are no moderates. You know, now the Cable News World characterizes the moderate as someone who doesn't decide instantly the most right wing thing, but eventually comes around. Pat Toomey's a moderate. Rob Portman's a moderate. Pat Roberts is a moderate. I mean, they're not. I mean, that doesn't mean I'm never able to work with any of them. But the idea that you get your moderate card by not immediately racing to the Ted Cruz position is a sign of how much we've lowered the bar and I certainly hope that people who used to find themselves attracted to conservative principles understand that it's not really a small-c Conservative Party, this is a corporatist party and they are Trump's party.\n\nMH: It's a Trump party indeed. Just before we finish on Trump himself, now that he's got this acquittal from his party, with the exception of Mitt Romney, what does this mean politically for him? Is this good for him? Is he emboldened? Can he kind of do a victory lap? Or is he going to do more reckless, crazy criminal stuff, like he did after the Mueller report failed to land a blow?\n\nBS: I have a hard time seeing around too many corners right now. I think there are a lot of variables here both in terms of his behavior and what he believes to be his political imperatives. I mean, the one thing that I think is worth remembering, you know, there's a lot of retrospective analysis of the 2016 race. But one of the things that people forget is that - I don't want to, I'm not sure whether it's three or five weeks or even less, I don't know, I don't remember. But at the end of the race, Donald Trump stuck to a script. And so I think when he needs to, he's going to contain his worst political instincts and do poll-tested stuff and look plausible for just long enough to try to capture back, you know, high income white women and the suburbs. So, I don't think we should, I really believe that our strategy cannot depend on Donald Trump doing insane things because while that may happen, he may pull it together for seven weeks that he knows his political life and possibly his freedom depends on it.\n\nMH: And you have no regrets about anything to do with his impeachment, how it was handled by the Democrats?\n\nBS: No, I mean, I think in the big picture, we got everything right. I think the House managers did really well. You know, everybody who's a lawyer or like an amateur lawyer, like me, has an idea of what should have been included in the articles like, my hobby horse was always the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution because I think there's such a clear violation but I think part of what what ended up in the articles was a function of what could get a majority in the House, and I don't think that those moderate Democrats who were just elected lots of with national security credentials were ready to impeach on emoluments. They were particularly offended by this because it had foreign policy and national security implications and it's a Democratic process so you know, I lost out on that, but overall I thought manager Schiff, Jefferies, Zoe Lofgren, the whole team was extraordinary and I'm proud to be a Democrat and I would just say we just have to go win this election.\n\nMH: And on that note, last last question, who's gonna win the election for you? Do you have a candidate?\n\nBS: I have no candidate and that's just me being careful. I don't have a candidate. I like a lot of them personally. I work with a lot of them personally. I would be thrilled to charge up the mountain for any of the major frontrunners.\n\nMH: Including Bernie?\n\nBS: Yes.\n\nMH: Okay, Senator Brian Schatz, thanks so much for joining me on Deconstructed.\n\nBS: Thank you very much.\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nMH: That was Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii. Reminding us that this impeachment trial has not just been about Ukraine or foreign policy or national security or the Bidens, but it's also reminded us of the importance of having checks and balances of having limits on presidential power, so that you have an elected president bound by the Constitution, not a functional monarch, and that you have a party in Congress that stands up for the country, and isn't just a Trump cult.\n\nAnyways, next week, we won't be talking impeachment, but we will be talking law and order, crime and punishment, mass incarceration, and the crisis in America's prison system. How do you fix the criminal injustice system in the United States? That's the question I'll be asking my special guests: John legend, musician, activist, philanthropist, and Patrisse Cullors, activist, co-founder of Black Lives Matter.

      "text": "Jan. 6 Hearings Point Finger at Donald Trump. But Federal Prosecutors Haven't Gone That Far.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Justice Department's handling of January 6 contrasts sharply with prosecutions of racial justice protesters and international extremists.\n\nLast week, the House committee investigating the January 6, 2021, siege of the Capitol began public hearings to disclose its findings. During the hearings, the committee alleged that former President Donald Trump led and encouraged the attack on the Capitol in an effort to overturn the 2020 election results. This week on Intercepted, investigative reporter Trevor Aaronson is joined by Margot Williams, research editor for The Intercept, and Michael Loadenthal, founder and executive director of the Prosecution Project, to discuss the ongoing arrests and prosecutions of those linked to the January 6 assault. Aaronson, Williams, and Loadenthal discuss their findings from the prosecutions, along with how the legal actions against Capitol rioters contrast with people arrested during the racial justice demonstrations in 2020 and those arrested for terror-related crimes.\n\n[Intercepted theme song.]\n\nJeremy Scahill: This is Intercepted\n\nTrevor Aaronson: I'm Trevor Aaronson, a contributing writer at The Intercept.\n\n[Steady, upbeat percussive rhythm plays.]\n\nTA: Nearly 18 months ago, on January 6, 2021, an angry, violent mob of Donald Trump's supporters stormed the U.S. Capitol in an effort to stop the peaceful transfer of power to Joe Biden, the clear winner of the 2020 presidential election.\n\n[Clips of shouting, sirens, pounding, chants of \"USA! USA! USA!\" as the rioters come together.]\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump: I hope Mike is going to do the right thing. I hope so. Because if Mike Pence does the right thing, we win the election.\n\nRioter: Whatever it takes. I'll lay my life down if it takes.\n\nRioter: Absolutely. That's why we showed up today.\n\nTA: The rioters attacked police officers defending the U.S. Capitol. A Capitol Police Officer died on January 7, the day after the mob attacked him. Two other police officers who responded to the riot committed suicide in the days following. Four Trump supporters also died during the melee at the Capitol.\n\nIt was ... an insurrection. I saw it. You saw it. We all saw it live on television. But Trump and his supporters have tried to convince us since then that we can't believe our lying eyes. Trump has tried to bend reality to his will claiming, absurdly, that the crowd we all saw live on our screens wasn't full of violence - but instead, full of love.\n\nDJT: Boy, there was a lot of love. I've heard that from everybody. Many, many people have told me. That was a loving crowd.\n\n[Low humming music.]\n\nTA: Tucker Carlson, who hosts the top-rated show on Fox News, has promoted a ridiculous conspiracy theory that January 6 was a false-flag attack secretly organized by Trump's shadowy enemies inside the FBI.\n\nTucker Carlson: Strangely, some of the key people who participated in January 6 have not been charged. Look at the document. The government calls those people unindicted co-conspirators. What does that mean? Well, it means that in potentially every single case they were FBI operatives.\n\nTA: To be clear, the government doesn't call FBI agents or informants unindicted co-conspirators in court filings. And there's no evidence - zero - to support this FBI-did-it theory.\n\nIn our very divided America, we now can't agree about what happened on January 6. A Pew Research Center poll from February found that more than half of all Republicans believe Trump had no responsibility for the violence at the Capitol.\n\nWhat's unclear as I record this is whether public hearings about January 6 can break through in such a polarized America, as the Watergate hearings did nearly 50 years ago, ultimately shifting public opinion against President Richard Nixon.\n\nJohn Dean: I began by telling the president that there was a cancer growing on the presidency. And if the cancer was not removed, the president himself would be killed by it.\n\nTA: Last week, the House Select Committee to Investigate the January 6 Attack began its public hearings to interview witnesses and release the results of its nearly year-long investigation.\n\nThe first hearing was held on June 9, live on television, in primetime.\n\nRep. Bennie Thompson: I'm Bennie Thompson, chairman of the January 6 2021 committee.\n\nI was born, raised, and still live in Bolton, Mississippi, a town with a population of 521, which is midway between Jackson and Vicksburg, Mississippi, and the Mississippi River.\n\nI'm from a part of the country where people justify the actions of slavery, the Ku Klux Klan, and lynching. I'm reminded of that dark history as I hear voices today try and justify the actions of the insurrectionists on January 6, 2021.\n\nTA: Every major American news channel aired the first hearing live, with the notable exception of Fox News, whose evening shows have shamelessly promoted the preposterous lie that the 2020 election was stolen from Trump.\n\nThe members of the January 6 committee - which includes two Republicans, Rep. Liz Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger - have made it clear that they intend to present evidence that they believe shows that January 6 was a violent attempted coup organized and led by President Trump.\n\nHere's Representative Cheney during the first hearing:\n\nRep. Liz Cheney: As you will see in the hearings to come, President Trump believed his supporters at the Capitol - and I quote - \"were doing what they should be doing.\" This is what he told his staff as they pleaded with him to call off the mob, to instruct his supporters to leave.\n\nThe goal of the House Select Committee appears to be to make a public case that Trump is a would-be autocrat who's personally - and perhaps criminally - responsible for unleashing a violent mob whose aim was to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nUsing testimony from former Trump officials and campaign staff, the January 6 committee revealed how Trump had been told, in no uncertain terms, that there wasn't significant evidence to support claims of voter fraud, including by his attorney general, Bill Barr.\n\nBill Barr: I told him that the stuff his people were shoveling out to the public was bullshit. I mean, that the claims of fraud were bullshit.\n\n[Ominous music.]\n\nTA: Yet the Trump campaign raised more than $250 million in donations by leveraging false claims of voter fraud, under the moniker the Official Election Defense Fund. But, as House investigators have revealed, there was no such fund. The money went into a political action committee Trump controlled.\n\nHere's California Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a member of the House Select Committee.\n\nRep. Zoe Lofgren: President Trump used the lies he told to raise millions of dollars from the American people. These fundraising schemes were also part of the effort to disseminate the false claims of election fraud.\n\nTA: But happening in parallel to this House Select Committee probe is an investigation by the Justice Department - the largest in the department's history.\n\nThat investigation has happened as self-appointed internet sleuths, such as the organization Sedition Hunters, have taken it upon themselves to find and republish videos and photos from the Capitol riot and attempt to identify alleged rioters. These volunteers think they're doing good, but they're participating in a strange form of internet vigilantism that, in some ways, has shaped the Justice Department's response to the Capitol riot.\n\nSo far, the Justice Department has charged more than 800 people with criminal charges for their alleged roles in the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Federal prosecutors appear to be grouping the defendants into two buckets.\n\nThe first includes Trump supporters who were there that day, appear to have been swept up in the hysteria and violence of the moment, and entered the U.S. Capitol spontaneously. Many of these defendants face only misdemeanor charges.\n\nThe second includes members of the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, two violent domestic extremist groups who support Trump. Recently, prosecutors have charged 16 members of these two groups with seditious conspiracy, alleging that they had planned their attacks on the Capitol as part of an organized effort to help Trump hold onto power.\n\nToday on Intercepted, I'm joined by two people who have closely followed and tracked the January 6 prosecutions:\n\nMargot Williams - my colleague here at The Intercept - and Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of The Prosecution Project, which tracks criminal prosecutions involving political violence.\n\nAs pundits have speculated endlessly on cable news about January 6 and its fallout, Williams and Loadenthal are among those you haven't heard from yet. They are among the researchers at news organization, think tanks, and universities who have been keeping their heads down - collecting court records about the January 6 prosecutions, entering the information into databases, and trying to answer a question: What do the prosecutions tell us about what happened on January 6, and what can they tell us about how the Justice Department, one of our nation's most important institutions, investigates and prosecutes a crime that, some argue, may lead back to Donald Trump?\n\nI started by asking Margot to explain a bit about the databases she has been working on throughout her career, and how she's been following the January 6 prosecutions:\n\nMargot Williams: I have been working on databases for many years. I am the research editor at The Intercept. But before that, I was at The Washington Post and The New York Times, where I created The Guantánamo Docket database of the Guantánamo detainees. Starting in 2002, I started collecting names and then in 2007, I believe, it went up online at The New York Times, and it's still there.\n\nAt The Intercept, Trevor, you and I work together on the Trial and Terror database , which is also an ongoing database that's downloadable of all the prosecutions since 9/11 in the War on Terror in the U.S.\n\nSo it's just natural for me when this event happened on January 6, and while I was watching, I immediately thought to start collecting the names of the people who would be arrested, later charged, tried, and sentenced. And I've been working with Michael on it. We share our data together. I've only seen him in Zoom a couple of times in my life, and we chat every day, multiple times. And my database at The Intercept is not public yet, because it's a work in progress, but Michael's is available to the public.\n\nTA: Yeah, Michael, could you tell us how this database fits into your mission at The Prosecution Project?\n\nMichael Loadenthal: Sure.\n\nSo The Prosecution Project, just for a bit of background, began in 2017 as part of a, I guess you'd call it, an extracurricular engagement for, at the time, mainly undergraduate students at Miami University of Oxford, Ohio. And at the time, we were trying to kind of explain the discrepancy between two large criminal cases. One was the so-called J20 Case, which is the arrest of 200-plus anarchists and anti-fascists who were disrupting the inauguration of Donald Trump in Washington, D.C. and comparing those to a recent slate of white nationalist violent crimes, including a few murders.\n\nAnd so we were trying to kind of explain the sentencing discrepancies between the two of these. We started collecting data on political prosecutions, and received so much success from student engagement that we decided to continue it now five years later.\n\nAnd so generally The Prosecution Project seeks to collect data on any political violence, so we would define that as terrorism, extremism, hate crimes, bias crimes, and political protest. So any form of political violence which has been prosecuted in the United States since 1990 at the felony level, so that's a rather large pool of cases. So we, like a funnel, suck in hundreds of cases a month, test those for whether or not they meet our inclusion criteria, and then code them on the basis of about 55 variables. Now, this is done with a core team of about 40 volunteers, many of whom are students, but not all of whom, and all of our work is verified, we independently code things and we could go into all the methodology stuff if folks are interested, but the Capitol cases fit into a growing portfolio we have of what I guess we would call event-driven datasets.\n\nSo we have the wider dataset of nearly 10,000 cases in which we're looking at, but within that wider pool, we have some event-driven datasets. So we have, as Margot said, a public dataset on the Capitol rioters , we have a public dataset on the summer 2020 George Floyd uprising arrests , and then the rest of our sub-datasets we provide on request to whomever. And we've provided those to everyone ranging from individual attorneys representing clients in our dataset, to the Department of Defense, to most mainstream large media outlets at this point, as well as a host of governmental and non-governmental bodies, social movement organizations, etc.\n\nTA: What I'd like to ask both of you to start with is, you know, if we're to take a kind of bird's-eye view of the January 6 prosecution's, we know that there are about 800 defendants. And so starting with you, Margot, what are some of the highlights that you see in this database so far?\n\nMW: Not from the database, particularly, but from reading the charging documents and the statements of the defendants and the FBI agents who investigated the cases, I'm just amazed at the number of resources that the U.S. government has devoted to pursuing these people and that, to some extent, half of the cases just about are just misdemeanor charges, the others being the felony charges, and to the extent in which they pursued people on these minor charges. I mean, they did walk into the Capitol, and they did cause disruption and destruction, but many of the charges are misdemeanors, for which I believe my opinion is that if they had arrested these folks on that day, as they did with the J-20 people and sorted it out when they were all being held, it would be a much more effective and economic way of pursuing people who had done these deeds.\n\nInstead, they're charging, after a year and a half, people just were arrested yesterday, in this case, they've been hunted down and chased down and interviewed and all kinds of stuff going on, which wouldn't have been needed at all if they had just grabbed them in the building. So that's what I'm noting, the number of misdemeanor cases, and also Michael had another in his data set, he also had the people who were arrested that day, just by the Metropolitan Police Department, I'm not even keeping track of those, they just arrested them and let them go, and that adds another 80 people to the case, and I don't know what happened to those people, either. We haven't been able to follow up on it, I don't think at all.\n\nML: Exactly. Yeah, I can speak to that from the kind of bird's-eye view at present. And as Margot said, Margot, and I have been sharing court-related event data literally every day for the past year-plus. So, you know, there's always a bit of a delay in us catching up to things. But as of today, as of right now, The Prosecution Project is tracking 829 federal cases, which includes three cases of defendants who are named, but seemingly never charged. So if you want to be real precise, we're looking at 826 federal cases, and 80 non-federal cases, again, as Margot referenced, by the Metropolitan Police Department.\n\nSo that's, you know, a lot. We're looking at quite a number of cases. Again, zooming out real broadly, looking at across the federal and non-federal cases, so looking across - what is that - 909 cases, we see that on average, people are about 40 years old, the exact median age that we're showing in our data is 40.5. So you can say 40, you can say 41. Majoritively male: 773 men, 126 women, and nine people who, at least at this point, we can't determine their gender. And then race - again, this is not going to be a super-surprise to anyone, but - it's a majority white, we're looking at 745 white defendants; 107 defendants whose race, at least at this point, we cannot identify because it's not in the record and we have no photographic evidence of them; 27 individuals who are Latino; 11 individuals who are Black or African-American, and 7 individuals who are Asian. So, again, zoomed out, if we're looking for the patterns, most of the things we're tracking are federal cases involving 40-year-old white men.\n\nTA: One of the things I'd like to talk about with both of you is this question of the disparity in treatment between the January 6 defendants and defendants in other types of prosecutions. And so Margot, as you mentioned earlier, you and I work on this database at The Intercept called Trial and Terror , where we track international terrorism prosecutions and, you know, federal prosecutions of people alleged to have literal or ideological connections to al Qaeda, ISIS, and other groups. And what we see in those is something very different than what we see in the January 6 cases. And this relates specifically to what you mentioned earlier, where we're seeing a large number, if not half of the total, in January 6, being charged with misdemeanors, which is not at all a common charge and terrorism prosecutions. And what we're also not seeing in the January 6 data compared to terrorism prosecutions are a common charge that prosecutors bring known as \"making false statements\" or otherwise known colloquially as lying to the FBI.\n\nAnd I was wondering what your thoughts are on this disparity and treatment, given that I think we might be seeing something very different if it was a group of alleged ISIS associates who stormed the Capitol, or maybe even a group of Black and brown Black Lives Matter demonstrators.\n\nMW: Well, another difference that I see is that in the charges against the terrorists, the international terrorists, there are so many sting cases. And here there are no stings. And also, here, in the few cases that have gone to a conclusion, we see people who have actually had weapons with them, and weapons of mass destruction is one of the terrorism charges that could be brought, but it wasn't in this case. So there are differences.\n\nI believe that, in these cases, the similarities are in the rounding up of people who seemingly have little connection to many other things. And that both have kind of charges that now, looking at our cases in the Trial and Terror , they would have been considered misdemeanors, except that the extra allegation that people were somehow involved with an overseas group, even though they didn't go overseas, makes it a much tougher charge than being engaged with Oath Keepers or Proud Boys, although it looks like this week that Oath Keepers and Proud Boys, more prosecutions will be involved with belonging to those groups, even though they're not known as terrorist groups. But, in the hearings, they started to make it sound like they're similar to what would be called a terrorist group.\n\nTA: Yeah.\n\nSimilarly, Michael, I mean, are you seeing disparities in the January 6 prosecutions compared to your research on J20 or the summer of 2020 prosecutions?\n\nML: Yeah, I mean, the comparison between the Floyd prosecutions is, I think, apt, because they're both somewhat constrained events. But they couldn't have been prosecuted in different ways. The summer of 2020 Floyd cases really followed some pretty clear patterns of overcharging in an attempt to get plea bargains. We certainly had a lot of cases that were dropped, especially at the non-federal level, but even at the federal level. In the Floyd cases - and not in all cases, but in many cases - seemingly minor crimes, which were sort of saddled with a much larger political ongoing. So, for example, you'd have a statement of facts document or an affidavit, which would talk about all of the destruction given to the Portland courthouse, and then when you got to the actual actions of that particular defendant, it was relatively minor. So you had this kind of individual saddled with a much larger and, in a sense, scarier political context. Here, you have something different, in the Capitol cases where, as Margot said, about a half of the people are charged with relatively minor crimes, and will never expect to see the inside of a jail cell, let alone a prison sentence. So most of these people haven't been sentenced yet, but I just did a quick calculation on our length-of-prison-sentence variable, and there are so many people that got no prison time that the mathematical average is zero at this point. [Laughs.] Because most people received no prison time.\n\nSo I think that that's certainly a major difference is that we have a handful of cases in which people have the potential of having multi-year sentences, whereas in the Floyd cases, if you look just at the summer ones, most of those were pretty steep charges. And again, a lot of them had been pled down. But I think the vigor, if I can say, through which the Department of Justice and the United States Attorney's Office pursued those cases, seems to have been pretty high.\n\nAnd as Margot said, the kind of investigative complexity of some of the summer 2020 cases was really quite impressive. Whereas, in the Capitol cases, most of these things are a combination of monitoring people's own social media, people being snitched on by their friends and relatives, which is by far the most common way people seem to have been caught, and simple geofencing of their phones and things like that. So the kind of broad-stroke, investigative approach of the Capitol cases, partially because everyone's constrained in the same physical area, versus the deep-dive investigations of the summer 2020 cases stands out to me as a really odd kind of uneven allocation of resources.\n\nTA: I mean, that gets at one of the interesting aspects of the Capitol riot, which is in many ways, it was perhaps the most-watched crime ever, in that all of these Americans and everyone around the world was watching this. But not only that, the people who allegedly stormed into the Capitol often provided much of the evidence against them, right? By recording themselves or being recorded by others.\n\n[Sounds of people talking.]\n\nRioter: We are in the halls of Congress. We don't want war. But we are prepared to fight for our liberty.\n\nTA: And so in some ways, this becomes this enormous forensic investigation, right, that these authorities have to take on? Is that what you're finding in most of the prosecutions?\n\nML: Yeah, I mean, the evidentiary record, often provided in the FBI affidavits, most of the time rely on media that the defendants produce themselves, so their own text messages, their own Facebook posts, their own alt-tech platform usage. And then the FBI is often just surveilling that through open-source intelligence methods, or you know, and I don't have a quantification of this, but I can tell you that in a lot of cases, the way people were identified from the BOLO lists, or from the please-help-us-ID-these-people lists is from their family and friends. And Margot can speak to this, it's so common to read these evidentiary statements. And it says: So-and-so knew the defendant for two years as a co-worker, or at school, or at church, or whatever. And people are just being turned in en masse by their friends, family, and colleagues - which again, stands in pretty stark contrast to the way the Floyd summer 2020 cases have been investigated. A lot of that was much more of this typical kind of CSI-style forensic work. For example, I have not seen the word fingerprint in any of the Capitol cases. It doesn't seem like that sort of police work was really done, because they had these other investigative tools like the geofence, and cellphone beacons, and WiFi beacons, and all the things because people are in the same area\n\nTA: That so much of this material and evidence was in the public record, right, was on social media and elsewhere, it really allowed a lot of these kinds of vigilante groups investigating the January 6 Capitol riot to kind of engage in a big way, right? Like Sedition Hunters being an example, where they find videos online, repost them, and for people that they can't name, unknown defendants, for example, they come up with cute nicknames for them based on their appearance. Like #BubbaTwoHat was a guy who had a hat on, and then, for some reason, another hat on top of it.\n\nAnd I have to admit that there's a certain uneasiness that I feel about the kinds of vigilante investigations that have happened and perhaps the way it may have influenced how the Justice Department has handled these prosecutions. And I was curious what your thoughts are on that?\n\nML: Yes. I am very much uncomfortable by it. And I want to be really clear: The Prosecution Project uses open-source data to track how political violence is prosecuted in U.S. courts. We are in no way whatsoever involved with identifying defendants.\n\nI have, in my academic work over the past year, been thinking a lot about this question, writing a lot about this exact question. As many academics do, I have a paper about to come out about this exact question. So what I'm looking at are people who are identifying far-right individuals, what we would call anti-fascist intelligence folks, and people in involved with something like Sedition Hunters, which I would call crowd-sourced policing. I find it really exceptional and wildly uncomfortable, that kind of unaccountable, untrained, self-appointed folks have just begun identifying people on the internet, based on, oftentimes, not super-great evidence. We've seen misidentifications, we've seen just other other ways in which this was done.\n\nAnd for me, the larger point is that identifying someone on the Internet in that way does not make you accountable to a community. The difference between that and people who work to deplatform far-right people is that that's done in conjunction with activists on the ground, and a community approach to keeping one's community safe. And so I do think this kind of proliferation of Sedition Hunters-type things is really problematic for a variety of reasons, but one of the reasons is that it's blurring this line between people who are trying to destabilize and deter far-right activity, and people who are basically doing free unpaid internships for the FBI. And I think if that's what people want to do, that's OK, but I think people need to be honest with themselves that that's what they're doing. They're doing free work for the police. And if they think they're doing something else, then they're a bit delusional.\n\nMW: Yeah, I also noticed that in the criminal complaint statements, so often the FBI just credits and uses the vigilante groups' work. I mean, and it is true that there is some good work being done, but the FBI statements include those nicknames that were given by the vigilante groups. And it just seems very just weird that the FBI would use this as their evidence in the case and put it into the charging statements. It's quite unusual. Because also, most of those people who are the Sedition Hunters are, for no reason, anonymous as well. And maybe we could make up some little names for them, too, like that are on their Twitter handles. But it's more anonymous sourcing that is public. It's a quandary in my mind of how to approach it, but it makes me really uncomfortable.\n\nML: I have to say that one of the footnotes, I mean, I would say untold stories, but we're telling it at this moment, so maybe it's not an untold story, but one of the untold stories of the Capitol riot is how so much of this mass data collection has occurred, or has been carried out by what we can call early-career professionals, or non-trained individuals, or students. So, for the case of The Prosecution Project, most of this data has been done by undergraduate students. In the case of GW's program on extremism, who is doing a lot of the tracking too, that's, again, student interns. The people doing Sedition Hunters, I imagine a lot of those are younger people or not necessarily well-trained individuals in intelligence. And so there is a bit of an untold story about through crowdsource policing, through platforms like The Prosecution Project who are tracking this, how much of the knowledge that we currently have about January 6 has come from these kinds of all-volunteer groups.\n\nTA: I guess, to me, that raises this question of law enforcement and investigative resources for January 6. I mean, obviously, like any organization, the FBI and the Justice Department have a finite amount of resources and time and agents. And what's happening, obviously, is that the Justice Department seems to be sending a clear message that there were two rough groups on January 6, right? They're the ones who showed up and kind of acted more spontaneously, and perhaps were swept up in the moment, as people might say. And then there were other groups, as we're beginning to know more about, such as the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys that are alleged to have been involved in a kind of conspiracy that took planning and a very organized effort to attack the Capitol. And I guess I wonder to what degree these volunteer efforts to find people including mainly the more spontaneous actors, are putting pressure on federal law enforcement to use a lot of the resources that might otherwise be put to kind of piecing together the puzzle of this seditious conspiracy, but instead they're running down somebody from Kentucky who stepped into the Capitol. And I wonder to what extent you have opinions on how that might be shaping the law enforcement response?\n\nML: I mean, I think, you know, programs like Sedition Hunters - and again, we're giving them a lot of airtime, and they are one of them, but there are a lot of these projects that are tracking them, and we can talk about the differences between them. But one of the things they're doing is identifying, even if they're not naming, they're identifying a large pool of individuals to identify. So they basically created a task list for law enforcement. And, again, I think historically, that's relatively new, where people come up and they say: Hey, here's 800 unknown individuals who committed this crime. And in a sense, it puts the pressure, then, on the FBI to identify those individuals. You know, I don't know of any other case in history, where civilians came out and said: Here's this giant pool of people that we're looking to identify. So I do think that the proliferation of those sorts of platforms does put the pressure on law enforcement to then identify the people who were singled out.\n\nBut I think there's also another ethical gray area here, which is: Does showing up at a protest such as January 6 - and I would consider that a riot but is still a political act - to simply being in that presence mean that you'd end up on a website like Sedition Hunters? Again, there's a low degree of accountability there.\n\nDifferent people have different levels of culpability, like you said. We have people who engaged in extreme violence, and we have people who did not. And I'm not sure that that distinction is properly made by crowdsourced policing efforts. And so I do think it's putting some people on the FBI's radar, who may otherwise not deserve to be there. And I do think it's spreading law enforcement resources very wide.\n\nAnd again, there's just so many different groups doing this from ones likes Sedition Hunters who have gotten a lot of press, and were kind of seen as more legitimate to I remember this early one - I don't know if it still exists - called detrumpify.org, which was doing something very similar of crowdsourcing. And there was another one, the U.S. Capitol Attack Facial Recognition Project that was trying to do it using facial recognition software. So I think there's a lot of these efforts going on and I do think they have to be having an aggregately negative effect on the police's ability to focus their investigative work.\n\nTA: In watching the recent January 6 committee hearing, one of the key things that the committee appears to be highlighting is that the Oath Keepers and the Proud Boys, two extremist groups that were supporting Trump, played a critical role in the Capitol riot. And we also know that obviously from federal prosecutors who have charged the leaders of both of these groups and some of their members with seditious conspiracy. The January 6 committee was particularly interested and focused on a meeting the night before between Enrique Tarrio, the head of the Proud Boys, and Stewart Rhodes, the head of the Oath Keepers in kind of framing this idea that there was perhaps some sort of conspiracy between them, or at least alliances of some sort going forward into January 6.\n\nAt the same time, though, Liz Cheney, and the members of the committee also seem to be pointing directly at Donald Trump, saying Donald Trump was leading, and organizing, and basically was the mastermind of this conspiracy, this so-called attempted coup on January 6.\n\nRep. Liz Cheney: On this point, there is no room for debate. Those who invaded our capitol and battled law enforcement for hours, were motivated by what President Trump had told them: That the election was stolen, and that he was the rightful president.\n\nTA: But that isn't as far as the prosecutors have so far taken this case. And I was wondering your thoughts on the disparity between what we know in the criminal record and what the select committee seems to be suggesting so far in its hearings?\n\nMW: Well, it seems to me that they may have, or are trying to convince the public, that they have some more information that is going to make that connection apparent. And I don't think I've seen anything in the charging documents or any of the documents so far, even the most recent seditious conspiracy charges against the Proud Boys, that in any way connects that to government officials who are in office at the time.\n\nML: Yeah, I don't think so as well. And, again, one of the patterns that I think is interesting is that if you would have asked me on January 6, before we had done any of the tracking, what percentage of the people who entered the building of the 800 or so people that entered the building, are part of an organized group, or kind of came with an affinity group or coordination, I would have thought a relatively large number. But we're actually not seeing that accusation as much as I would have expected.\n\nI was just doing some quick calculations when Margot was talking but, at least in The Prosecution Project, as the record stands today, we're only tracking 52 Proud boys, 32 Oath Keepers, and 15 Three Percenters - there's a couple other small groups in there, there's a couple members of Patriot Front and Aryan Nations and whatnot. But that's less than 100, right? And that's less than I would have expected. I would have expected a larger representation from organized unlawful paramilitaries or militias, from organized far-right hate groups. So that, to me, is surprising. And at this point, we know if prosecutors had evidence that these individuals were part of groups, they would have put that out by now. So I think it's safe to say that the majority of people are not group affiliated, which, I think is a bit of a shock when you talk about the kind of larger conspiracy narrative. Certainly, it seems that there was coordination and conspiracy within those groups, so within the Three Percenters, within the Oath Keepers, within the Proud Boys, and coordination amongst those groups, but as far the kind of wider day's events, there doesn't appear to me at this point to be much coordination beyond those kind of three core groups, which is probably why those are the groups which are receiving seditious conspiracy charges.\n\nTA: Certainly this has been going on for awhile, but I think where it reached kind of a fever pitch was during the Mueller investigation, where you have a lot of people online and on Twitter reading the tea leaves and suggesting what's going to happen next, and where this investigation leads. And the people doing that for January 6, some at least, you'll hear kind of talk of how this is kind of a slow-moving investigation that, like any kind of investigation of organized crime, is flipping lower-level people in order to kind of move up the ladder and eventually get to the top, right? And perhaps what we're seeing now with the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers, and the seditious conspiracy charges, is not the end, but simply part of moving up that ladder.\n\nAnd I was wondering what your take on that is given your analysis of these cases?\n\nML: I mean, yeah, I think that makes sense. I think that some people, by the charging documents, are not going to be privy to any sort of useful information, right? There's just a lot of people that clearly just walked in, wandered around, didn't know anyone, and left. So I think getting some of those cases out of the way, flipping some lower-level defendants, I think is most likely the strategy - and is almost always the strategy. And so, you've already had some folks who have pled guilty to the seditious conspiracy charges, you already have Proud Boys - chapter, regional leaders - who have pled guilty. So I think that that's part of the strategy, part of getting some of those dominoes to start falling.\n\nI have to assume that the hope is that it pushes pressure up the ladder to people like Tarrio or Rhodes, but we're not going to know that for quite a bit of time.\n\nMW: Well, one thing, as far as the charges and the folks who have been convicted, for example - where five have been convicted at trial, one acquittal, that's it - but those cases, for the most part involved what was the most brutal part of the takeover, which was we watched cops getting beaten and nearly killed, and cops have committed suicide thereafter. And I would have thought that - so far, there's like five convicted of that. I assume that some of the guilty pleas are that. But that doesn't seem to really be the focus of what the hearings are about. And I don't think that those people who really did a violent crime on law enforcement officers, that doesn't seem to be the focus of most of the investigation and criminal prosecution - and these were the ones brought to trial.\n\nTA: Yeah. I may be guilty here of asking you to be pundits for a moment, but I'm curious what your take is on the likely effectiveness of the House Select Committee. Right now, we're kind of living in this America where a good portion seems to believe that Donald Trump played a role in instigating the violence, another portion that believes he had really no responsibility for what happened. And, like everything divided in America, we've got these two competing narratives. And it appears that by hiring a television consultant, the House Select Committee is trying to package its committee hearings in a way that will have some currency among media bubbles, and in social media, and in our very divided culture. And I'm curious, your take, given the hearings so far, of how effective you think it will be, or has been?\n\nML: I mean, I think - again, I'll take the kind of academic position - I think you'd first have to clarify what your goals are. I think if your goals are seeing Donald Trump in a prison cell, then it's ineffective. Like, I don't think that anyone believes that that's where this is headed. I think if the goal is to create a somewhat transparent public repository of known findings and knowledge on the events of the day, I think it's going to go well to meet that goal.\n\nI've submitted testimony; many people I know have submitted testimony; there's thousands of experts who have been asked and have put their thoughts down on record about everything from the role of specific extremist groups, or technologies, or individuals, so unearthing this kind of subterranean knowledge and putting it all in one place to have a historical record about the day and the context, I think it's gonna be very successful in that. If people want to see it as a way to incarcerate the former president, I think they're foolish, because I don't think our justice system is set up to accomplish that, nor do I think that's really in the interest of a lot of people.\n\nMW: Well, in my mind, the question comes up of why these hearings are in no way related to there being increased charges for domestic terrorism. Somehow, in my imagination, I kind of thought that's what this was going to be about, because that was such a topic of discussion for so long, but I guess the House bill failed and that seems kind of off the table. So we're still going to have this disparity of wacky charges for jihad people and no real domestic terrorism crimes being put into law.\n\nI do have one point. And it's not broad, bird's-eye-view; it's really, really narrow. And it's something I feel very strongly about, and that is making the court records that are public free. And we pay for those court records. And there is a group called the Free Law Project that is actively trying to do something about it by creating a tool that allows people to share the court records that they have downloaded from the federal court system. And it's a stopgap kind of way, because it requires that one of us download it, and then it's available for everyone.\n\nIn this case, almost everything is available, because Seamus Hughes at, and Michael, and I, and I'm sure The New York Times and The Washington Post and USA Today, everyone that's in the media and studying this are downloading these documents. And then if you use the tool called RECAP that comes from the Free Law Project, then it's free. And it's just an example of why it should be free.\n\nAnd I know that there are some changes taking place in the Administrative Office of the Courts to make the searching free, but then not the documents free. So I feel that it's really important that this point is being made. And maybe it's coming across now to people like: Oh, look, we had to pay for these documents that have actually been paid for because we pay taxes, and it's a federal document. I'm very strongly in favor of changing those rules and supporting the Free Law Project.\n\nML: I would agree with that. I mean, The Prosecution Project couldn't effectively function without the use of court records, and specifically through the use of RECAP. It really makes a lot of our work possible. That being said, we've filed multi-court exemptions, so we're exempt from a lot of court fees. But even with those exemptions, we still, as a totally unfunded, volunteer project, spend thousands of dollars a year to access court records, which as a taxpaying American citizen I've already paid for. So it is always very frustrating that court records are resold to us to the tune of 10 cents a page and 10 cents a search. That is certainly a barrier to creating public knowledge and public scholarship about the way in which the federal court system operates. And there's a public interest in us understanding how the federal court system operates. And so moving that legislation through and making PACER fee-less and making PACER free, I think should certainly be a priority of anyone who's engaged in criminal justice, or public policy, or legal research in the United States. And the fact that it's not, every time I explain how court records function in the United States to someone who doesn't know, they're kind of aghast. So yeah, anything we can do to make that more accessible, I think, is in the public interest.\n\nTA: Yeah, I would agree. I mean, I tend to view it as an example of whatever revenue PACER and ECF bring to the government, it's got to be largely inconsequential. And so the fees are mainly just a way to kind of keep a tighter lid on government information, right?\n\nAnd so, as a journalist, I've been reporting on agencies like the FBI, and with the FOIA system being broken, one of the few areas that we have to kind of look into these agencies are things like court records by looking at the cases they bring. And to me it's kind of humorous that they're making you pay for these things, not so much because I don't think they need the money to keep the system in place, they certainly don't, it's just that they want fewer and fewer people looking at these records.\n\n[Contemplative piano music.]\n\nTA: That was Margot Williams, my colleague here at The Intercept, and Michael Loadenthal, the executive director of The Prosecution Project.\n\n[End credits music.]\n\nTA: And that's it for this episode of Intercepted.

      "text": "What We May Never Know About Jan. 6\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe January 6 hearings have provided no shortage of juicy details about Trump and his accomplices. But will they lead anywhere?\n\nThis week's hearing of the House Select Committee on the January 6, 2021, attack revealed embarrassing new details about President Donald Trump and his supporters, including footage of Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., fleeing the U.S. Capitol moments after encouraging the rioters. The hearings have undoubtedly been good TV, but what have they added to our substantive understanding of the legal questions surrounding Trump's conduct? Washington Editor Nausicaa Renner talks with Intercept reporters Ken Klippenstein and Rob Mackey about the hearings.\n\n[Deconstructed theme music.]\n\nNausicaa Renner: Welcome to Deconstructed.\n\nI'm Nausicaa Renner, Washington editor for The Intercept, filling in for Ryan Grim.\n\nThe January 6 hearings are coming to a pause for the August recess. So far they've been described as explosive blockbuster hearings that bring into focus an attempt at a coup by Donald Trump.\n\nThursday's hearing was full of revelations about what Trump himself was doing that day as a mob infiltrated the Capitol. The committee obtained footage of President Trump filming his infamous statement to the protesters the following day. The video shows him editing out of the script on the fly the statement that: \"the election is over.\"\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump: OK, I'll do this. I'm gonna do this. Let's go.\n\n\"But this election is now over. Congress has certified the results.\" I don't want to say the election is over. I just want to say Congress has certified the results, without saying the election is over, OK?\n\nNR: The hearings have added countless details and testimonies under oath, and they've captured the attention of the nation. But I wanted to use today's episode to ask a few questions: What are they really adding to what we already know? And what might we never know about what happened on January 6?\n\nLet's go back in time for a moment to January 7, 2021.\n\nAfter the Capitol was breached, Rep. Cori Bush tweeted: \"As a member of\n\n@HouseJudiciary, I am calling for the immediate impeachment of Donald Trump & his removal from office. I'm also calling for the expulsion of @GOP members of Congress complicit in inciting the attack on our nation's Capitol.\n\nTheir actions must have consequences.\"\n\nOn January 7, she introduced a petition to have members of Congress expelled who attempted to overturn the election results. Just five days after the attack, she introduced a bill asking the ethics committee to investigate whether those elected officials had violated their oath of office. The big picture has been clear since the very beginning. How much of the hearings changed what we knew back then? And what are the barriers to uncovering what President Trump did that day?\n\nTo answer those questions, I'll be joined on the show today by Robert Mackey, senior writer for The Intercept, and by Ken Klippenstein, investigative reporter for The Intercept.\n\n[Musical sting.]\n\nNR: Rob, I wanted to start by asking you what moments jumped out at you in yesterday's hearing?\n\nRobert Mackey: So obviously, I think the standout moments in terms of the impact on the internet at least, which is the way a lot of people were following this, was first of all the attack on Josh Hawley, which seemed to some extent to be gratuitous. I mean, I think, obviously, members of the public who are outraged by January 6, to call these encouragement of the pro Trump mob, it'd be a very important, significant and upsetting thing.\n\nWhat we learned from the hearing was that at least one member of the Capitol Police who was helping to protect him and give him what they called \"the safe space\" from which to encourage them up was also outraged and upset by it.\n\nRep. Elaine Luria: She told us that Sen. Hawley's gesture riled up the crowd. And it bothered her greatly, because he was doing it in a safe space, protected by the officers and the barriers.\n\nRB: So the footage of Hawley then running away from the mob, through the halls of the Capitol, down the stairs, and even maybe upsetting his supporters - he was wearing a mask as he did it - was obviously calculated to embarrass Hawley and maybe upset his supporters.\n\nIt was kind of an odd moment, because it seems so calculated by the committee, and by the television producers they worked with to produce this hearing and the other hearings, to the extent that one of the producers was even in the hearing room, and filmed the reaction of the crowd on his phone, posted it on social media, where it's racked up four-to-five million views already.\n\nSo it's kind of a strange moment. If you think of it as a television entertainment, as an episode of Colbert or something, that would make perfect sense. It's a little odd and sort of discordant with the idea that this is to produce a record for history of what happened on that day.\n\nHawley's role in pushing forward the idea that the election could be overturned and should be overturned, is clearly important. But it was a bit of a strange political moment to take a timeout to go after him.\n\nAnd I think similarly, obviously, any footage of what Trump was actually doing that day is very valuable. It seems unfortunate that they didn't get, reportedly, there were two outtakes - at least two outtakes, I think - of his statement directly to the protesters on January 6, which his aides and staff thought were too inflammatory to release. His statement that they actually did release was also inflammatory because he praised them and said he loved them, and that's what happens when an election is stolen. So it's a shame they didn't get those.\n\nBut they did get his statement, as you mentioned, the next day, on January 7, to the nation. They got outtakes, where they showed that he didn't want to say the election was over. And clearly he doesn't even think now the election is over. Because we know that just last week he was on the phone to the Speaker of the Wisconsin House trying to get him to decertify Wisconsin's results from two years ago.\n\nMatt Smith: And what was that conversation like?\n\nSpeaker Robin Vos: It was one of those that it's very consistent. He makes his case, which I respect. He would like us to do something different in Wisconsin. I explained that it's not allowed under the Constitution. He has a different opinion. And then put the tweet out. So that's it. Yeah.\n\nRM: But again, there was an aspect of that, I'm all for exposing how utterly incompetent and preposterous a President Donald Trump was. But there was something a bit strange in just including outtakes where he fumbled words - we all fumble words. I've done it earlier in this recording, which, luckily, will be edited out. It seemed a little bit gratuitous to me.\n\nBut you did hear, the only thing of interest to me, was that you heard that the person behind the teleprompter as Trump was editing his speech on January 7 on the fly during the recording and asking for advice, seemed to be Ivanka Trump, and that perhaps gives a role of how actually central her part in the White House was. It was always kind of a mystery what she was actually doing there. But I suppose she was doing things like that.\n\nAnd one of the moments that was interesting from that outtake was where Trump said - he was referring to the heinous attack on the Capitol on January 6 - he stumbled over the word yesterday a couple of times and cut that out, saying that yesterday was a hard word for him to say.\n\nDJT: I would like to begin by addressing the heinous attack yesterday - yesterday is a hard word for me!\n\nProducers: Just take that, the heinous attack.\n\nDJT: Ah, good. Take the word yesterday, because it doesn't work with - heinous attack.\n\nDM: But more interestingly, I think he then, on the fly, thought to change the text to the attack on our country.\n\nDJT: On our country, say on our country. Wanna say that?\n\nProducers: No.\n\nDM: And he said to the people recording the video: I'll say the attack on our country. And they all said: No. Don't say that.\n\nSo he didn't.\n\nNR: You mean rather than: the attack on the Capitol?\n\nDM: Exactly. Yeah. I mean, he's calling it \"the heinous attack\" there. He was, at that moment, trying to dissociate himself from the violence, saying that anyone who broke the law would be prosecuted, that you don't represent our movement. But it's interesting that it even occurred to him to describe it as an attack on our country. And all of his aides, including Ivanka Trump, told him not to say that.\n\nNR: Ken, I saw you nodding along to Rob talking about the footage of Hawley being a bit gratuitous?\n\nKen Klippenstein: Yeah, I'm not going to pretend like I didn't find the outtakes of Trump funny and the Hawley-running-away thing amusing. But like Rob said, that does sort of take away from this idea that we are undertaking this solemn task of informing the public in the historical record about what exactly happened.\n\nThat being said, I'm glad we're having the hearings. We'd certainly be worse off without them. But I think the concern that I have, and that certainly my sources in the national security community have, is that not all of it is going to come out. Because as we get closer to the events that unfolded, this becomes a very sensitive national security matter in the sense that protection of the President and of the chain of command at the very top touches on a lot of sensitive and highly classified information that I'm concerned Congress is not going to have the guts to disclose in any sort of way that the public can understand.\n\nI mean, we're a long way away from where we were when, I believe it was Sen. Gravel, who was reading top-secret information from the Pentagon Papers in the Senate. We have a very different Congress now that I don't think he's going to do something like that. If you look at the composition of the January 6 committee, the staff director is himself a former CIA, and there's a certain culture - and this is reflected in the conversations I've had with people from the national security community - there's a culture wherein there are certain things you just don't talk about. And unless Congress is going to be willing to, at least for the time being, rupture or transgress or at least question a little bit that norm and disclose some of these things - you know, there are, for example, protocols for protecting the president that President Trump might have been able to abuse. There's questions of just classified information that the Secret Service is privy to, that the Capitol Police are privy to. If they're not willing to disclose some of that it's really going to, I think, limit the public's understanding of what it was that happened.\n\nNR: Yeah, and we should say that the committee did say that the dam is - I think, Liz Cheney's word was the dam is now \"opening,\" and there will be more hearings in September. But that was my impression, too, was that their entire argument at the moment seems to be focused on dereliction of duty, like what Trump didn't do.\n\nKK: Right.\n\nNR: And to me like that seems like a much harder thing to sell to the American people than Trump actively did something.\n\nAnd there are such big holes in what we know, even in the very detailed timeline that they laid out last night. I mean, they mentioned that Trump was calling multiple senators; we have no idea who the senators are. We have no idea who else he was calling. And yeah, without being too speculative, some of that information may never come out.\n\nSo I guess in light of that, I wanted to know what you guys think the difference is that the congressional hearings are really making. To pose the question that I asked at the top of the show: What do we know now that we didn't know then, in a broad sense? And what are the American people getting from it?\n\nDM: Can I just jump in for a second to say that I think Ken's reporting is so important. And what's kind of fascinating about this is that the hearings have really brought into focus how important this moment where Pence refused to get in the car that the Secret Service asked him to get in in the basement of the Capitol, because he didn't trust them to not spirit him away.\n\nAnd there were conversations between his aides and the Secret Service about this. And they've been reported in testimony, but the fact that we don't have the records of their exchanges during that time, I mean, it's really just astounding. In any other case, if this was a question of police accountability in some other sort of setting, I mean, the loss of those records is just incredible - if they are indeed lost. I mean, we're being told that they don't exist, but I'm not sure we even know that for sure.\n\nThere absolutely must have been communication among the Secret Service that day, and the White House, and this sort of person who is in this unclear dual role, Tony Ornato, between the agency and the White House. It's kind of an incredible scandal that that's lost. And also, of course, the fact that Pence isn't himself testifying and just telling us what happened, that's quite a loss.\n\nBut it is kind of astounding that Congress with all its powers can't - has failed - to be able to get those records. They're still being concealed. Because if there was a plot - it's speculative because they're hiding something from us - but if there was plotting or discussion about taking him out of there, so that he couldn't continue to go ahead with the electoral count, I mean, that's extremely important information. And it's like it's just being given up on.\n\nNR: Ken, what do you know now about the status of those text messages by the Secret Service? What's come out since your story?\n\nKK: Well, the timeline was kind of interesting. When I first reported it, the Secret Service spokesperson denied it in really unusually strong language, saying: We categorically deny all of this, and it's a complete mischaracterization, and so on and so forth.\n\nAnd then about a day or two later, they ended up walking a lot of that back. It was found to be true that they deleted a lot of these messages. And then they said: OK, well, Congress, we're going to get you the messages that you've requested, just give us a day or two.\n\nAnd then time rolls around. They end up producing one text message from both January 5 and 6 concerning two dozen Secret Service agents that were involved in the January 6 events.\n\nAnd first of all, I just want to say that's like the funniest number you could have, because I feel like zero would almost make more sense, because then it's like you lost everything. [Laughs.] But no, they had one message.\n\nAnd so now the discussion, as I understand it, from folks in the national security community, what the Secret Service is saying is that they had a device update program. But there's so much information that is of intelligence importance, perhaps for criminal investigations, things like that, in Secret Service phones generally, that the idea that they would just potentially throw out evidence doesn't make a whole lot of sense, or the idea that they could. One would think that you can have forensics go into the discarded phones and pull these messages out. And so this is essentially what the Congress is trying to find out.\n\nAnd one more thing I'll say is that these messages were deleted after the DHS inspector general, that's the parent agency of the Secret Service requested them. And what's more, the Secret Service initially disputed that timeline, but it turns out multiple committees in Congress had also requested it prior to their deletion. So there were, from both the executive and the legislative branch, requests for these records prior to their deletion.\n\nNR: And what's your understanding? I mean, the Secret Service is such a weird group. Can you just talk a little bit about who they report to and what their role is?\n\nKK: Yeah, so Tony Ornato, who Rob mentioned before, was detailed to the White House. And in conversations with the Secret Service agents that I know, that was extraordinarily unusual, apparently no precedent for that, to detail a Secret Service agent - that doesn't just mean to protect someone in the White House, it means to work for the White House. It's essentially like you're a political appointee.\n\nAnd a lot of people in the Secret Service who, many of them are conservative, they found that - my understanding is - distasteful and kind of beneath what the office is supposed to be. Because while that might be partially conservative, a lot of them do define themselves as - they want to feel as though they're carrying out their work with integrity, and that it's above the fray of partisan politics. And so when that happened, a lot of people thought that that was sort of gross, and weird.\n\nAnd it's still unclear, first of all, why Trump did that, and it's unclear what Ornato's role was in this because he was apparently in the White House, having a conversation with, I think it was Deputy National Security Adviser Gen. Keith Kellogg, discussing the vice presidential limo coming up to Pence and trying to whisk him away. And if you just think through that, logically, you remove Pence from the Capitol, put him in a secure facility, he's not going to be able to certify the results of the election. And so that was something that Gen. Kellogg was urging Ornato not to do. Now, Ornato disputes parts of that. But again, there's just a lot that we don't know about this, because the committee hasn't looked at it.\n\nAnd going back to the concerns that I have with this investigation, I think that there's a general attitude that because the January 6 committee is staffed and led primarily by Democrats, that they're going to go real hard. But it's a little more complicated than that. I think they're going to go hard in the sense that Rob was talking about before and take advantage of these sort of funny, partisan-friendly bloopers, like the Trump outtakes and Hawley running away. That doesn't mean that they're going to want to disclose classified information that they're going to want to embarrass the Secret Service as an institution where by the way, Tony Ornato still serves now as assistant director, he hasn't been removed, he's still at the very top of leadership. I think he runs the training division.\n\nAnd so I think that an aspect to this that's not always appreciated is that when you have a new administration in office, they generally want to uphold the legitimacy of the agencies which they are tasked with running now. They don't want to deal with a crisis of confidence in these kinds of things that now belong to them and are in their care. And so my fear is that that is going to keep them from being as aggressive as they need to be to find out answers to the questions that I'm talking about now and that Rob brought up.\n\nRM: It's almost like there's a deeper version of the state that exists between administrations that we can't trust.\n\nKK: [Laughs.]\n\nNR: Yeah, also this brings up for me also the question of timing, because it feels to me like it's taken a really long time to turn the lens on the executive branch, like, for a long time we were focused on: OK, who are the rioters? Charging them with federal crimes, and the Proud Boys and getting all of that out of our system? And it just seems to me like it's taken a really long time to look at: OK, who was in the White House that day? Who was talking to Trump?\n\nKK: Exactly. And if you look at J6, that subpoena to the Secret Service, that's the first subpoena the J6 committee has served to an executive branch agency, which is at the center of this entire scandal. It's clear as day what the crowd was up to. But again, the operative question is: To what extent was the executive branch using that or aware in advance of the unrest?\n\nThese sorts of questions have been very scarcely examined. And I just want to say: It's kind of shocking to me, there's an entire army of beat reporters for J6 that I think should have picked up on what I reported, the Secret Service angle, months ago, because this has been a problem that has existed for a certain period of time, I know for a fact that Congress didn't disclose it as soon as as soon as they were aware of it. And so the question is: Well, why didn't anyone follow this?\n\nAgain, I think there's just a timidity to go after the executive branch, because the guy in charge of it now has a D next to his name.\n\nNR: And also, the DOJ is even farther behind.\n\nJim Risen, for The Intercept, wrote a column - I mean, we don't know anything about DOJ active investigations, but it's really reading the tea leaves into it seems like they're just now starting to get warrants to search people's phones. And now they've sort of indicated that they wouldn't be done with an investigation for quite a long time.\n\nRob, did you have anything to add on the timing of it? Especially if you think that there's like a political angle in running these before the midterms? That's something that I've heard as a big critique of the hearings.\n\nRM: Running them this close to the midterms?\n\nNR : Yeah, like I think that there's a slight theory on the left that they've delayed doing some of the more explosive stuff until now, because it reflects well on Democrats. I don't know how accurate that is.\n\nRM: Yeah. I mean, Congress seems to be so slow in doing everything and it's hard to say - and the DOJ.\n\nI do think that it's valuable. I think that there is stuff on the historical record now that wasn't before.\n\nAnother interesting aspect that's a bit odd for people that have actually paid attention to the huge amounts of footage and what was already in public. I know plenty of people who told me that they were kind of astounded to be reminded of the violence of that day and what was happening that day. And it's sort of like a greatest hits, if you've been a reporter covering this, and look through all this stuff, it's kind of funny to see sort of the greatest hits of that footage now be in a kind of primetime setting. I guess it's good for educating people who haven't fully paid attention. I mean, I find it hard to believe that people who already made their minds up that it was an Antifa plot and that Trump is totally innocent will be swayed by this. But I guess in a way, in general, for reminding people of how atrocious that day was, I guess it's good. It's kind of amazing that it's so quickly forgotten.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nNR: One of the more impressive moments for me was when they were playing the tape of the rioters who were doing, like very close readings of the Trump tweets. I mean, they were really reading everything into those tweets that I think everyone was concerned that there were.\n\nLike, he's saying, like: Don't go after the Capitol police officers.\n\nWell, that means he's not saying don't go after Congress people, which means he is saying go after Congress people.\n\nThat was just very explicit in a way that I was surprised to hear.\n\nRM: It is amazing. There were other pieces of footage where people were reading out his texts directly to the crowd in the middle of the Capitol mob. And when he said: We should go home, people started going home.\n\nThat's an incredible moment. Earlier on, they read the Mike-Pence-betrayed-us thing out and people continue to riot. And then there is somebody standing outside the Capitol with a megaphone saying: He says we should leave.\n\nAnd they're like: OK, we should leave.\n\nRioter: I'm here delivering the president's message. Donald Trump has asked that everybody go home.\n\nRioter: He says go home!\n\nRioter: Yeah, he said to go home.\n\nRM: That's kind of incredible, really. He did have a lot of power over the crowd.\n\nNR: Rob, I wanted to ask you a little bit about how the hearings have been covered in the right-wing media, like on Fox News.\n\nIt's funny to me, it's sort of an awkward situation, where Sean Hannity and Laura Ingram have been revealed to have been texting White House officials that day trying to get Trump to respond. And now for instance, last night, Sean Hannity called the hearing \"a cheap, selectively edited political ad.\"\n\nYou've been watching the right-wing media more closely than anyone. What do you make of it?\n\nRM: Well, yeah, I mean, it's an awkward moment for Fox, if you think of it as a journalistic endeavor. But I mean, it's kind of a Potemkin news channel. It's not really trying to get the truth, even if that might embarrass the political side that it's on. I mean, it's obviously effectively opposition research political advertising in the guise of a news organization. And so when you have a situation where it's revealed that Laura Ingraham and Sean Hannity were texting the White House, or texting Mark Meadows, in the middle of all this stuff, that would be terribly embarrassing if those were coming from a news organization. But for them, it's not really any different than what Kevin McCarthy said, if Kevin McCarthy was also texting and calling frantically, and now he doesn't want to mention that. But they're all in the Republican Party, basically. They're all in this sort of pro-Trump media operation. So that's not that surprising.\n\nI mean, I think what's also interesting is the way that that more mainstream part of the conservative media echo chamber has also, during this time, since January 6, started to absorb a lot of the more far-right conspiracy theory, fringe ideas.\n\nLike, for instance, Tucker Carlson recently referred, as if it was a matter of fact, to this kind of crazy idea that Ashli Babbitt, in the middle of the riot, was trying to stop the rioters and help the police like 15 seconds before she was shot. And I've actually gone back through the publicly available footage, and that's clearly not true. Her hand grazed one of the other rioters' faces as she was pushing past to get to the window, to jump through it; it was the last barricade to the House floor. But then that's been re-edited. It was originally Infowars footage, which even Infowars didn't make anything out of. Another right wing activist/journalist, re-edited it and said: Look, this proves that Ashli Babbitt punched this rioter because she was so upset by what he was doing.\n\nShe was clearly part of the mob, screaming invectives at the police, wanting to get by there, and jump through, and was shot. But what I do think that the committee has kind of missed, so far at least, missed an opportunity in terms of putting everything into historical record, by essentially barely referring to the killing of Ashli Babbitt, which for people on the right is like the central thing that happened that day and part of their animating feeling that they're being hard done by and this is a cover-up, I feel like it would be much more useful if they recognized, and explained, and contextualized what happened with her killing.\n\nAnd actually, in yesterday's hearing, there was a kind of strange bit of editing where they showed footage from the House chamber recorded by, I think it was Rep. Kildee from the balcony. And I know from having gone back through that footage and from having communicated with the congressman's staff, that that footage, just a few seconds later, you could hear the gunshot nearby that killed Ashli Babbitt. And it was put in kind of a jumble. And it was cut together as if it was just sort of this general mayhem, but they actually had and they still have an opportunity to explain and present what exactly happened with the killing of Ashli Babbitt.\n\nAnd there's very likely security camera footage surrounding that that would make it more clear that we haven't haven't seen yet. One reason is that there are active trials involving other people who were storming that same door. But I do think that that would be actually - it's not going to really convince many of these people who don't really want to be convinced - but I think it'd be useful for the historical record for the rest of us to have a more clear accounting of exactly what happened there.\n\nNR: Could you explain a bit more like what's at stake for them in the killing of Ashli Babbitt? What does it imply if she was - I mean, it sounds like she absolutely wasn't on the side of the police - but what would it mean if she was? Why do they care about that?\n\nRM: Well, there's a constant grievance that they're the victims in all this. And so there's a sense in which they've kind of seen Ashli Babbitt as a martyr, and that she was set up somehow; there's one idea that she was set up. I don't even know where that ends up, what the idea is, that she was put in a position to be killed. There's all kinds of weird, very difficult to parse, conspiracy theories.\n\nBut there's a simpler one, which is the idea that this is a wrongful death. It's essentially a police shooting of an unarmed woman. And they're obsessed with the idea that she was unarmed. I mean, she was wearing a backpack at the front of a mob breaking into - to leap across the last barricade to - the House chamber where there were members of Congress still sheltering. I think if you change the situation so that a member of a left-wing mob was storming the White House and someone was jumping through a window that led to a passageway to the Oval Office and was shot, I think those same people would think that was totally fine. Obviously everything is through this political lens.\n\nIt's part of that broader sense. And it's actually part of Trump's statement on January 6, where he says you see how other people are treated, who are evil people. And what he's talking about were left-wing protesters, who at certain times during Black Lives Matter protests the previous year, had fought with the police. And he's saying somehow, in this fever dream of the right, that what was happening is that they're favored and let off, and it's all fine for them, but poor us, we're assaulted and killed. And so it plays directly into that. He was saying that on the day of the attack, just after she was killed.\n\nSo yeah, I personally think, having looked at all that footage, there's a better, more coherent record of what happened in the moments leading up to her death - and I suppose just after she was shot - that would be very helpful to have actually clearly explained. But it's kind of weird, it does seem like in a partisan way, maybe the committee just doesn't want to refer to that because they feel like it somehow hurts their cause that the real victims are American democracy and down. Anyway, I think that they're missing something by not doing everything they can to clearly explain that moment. There's definitely parts of that that have not been well explained.\n\nNR: Well, one thing that has been a lingering question in my mind, which sort of relates to what you're saying, is that the hearings are, in some way, hyper-focused on this defense of Congress and preserving American democracy. There was a moment in Thursday's hearing, where the deputy national security adviser who testified, Pottinger, he was basically just asked to introduce himself and his role in the White House, and what he was doing on the day of January 6, and he used the opportunity to say: Look, I resigned my position on January 6, but I'm really proud of all the work that I did for Trump.\n\nMatthew Pottinger: I felt then, as I do now, that it was a privilege to serve in the White House. I'm also very proud of President Trump's foreign policy accomplishments. We were able to finally compete with China. We were also -\n\nNR: And he sort of went on with it for a little while. And it was this striking moment because he was at once saying: Yes, I did resign on January 6 for a reason, but I'm still totally loyal to Trump.\n\nAnd he didn't really want to elaborate at all on why he felt he had to resign, which brought into light for me how much it feels like now this is a train that all of these Trump officials are jumping on in order to kind of exonerate their own reputations and images. And yeah, I guess I wonder if you two had the same impression?\n\nRM: I would say absolutely. And I think an interesting person to look at in this context is Pat Cipollone, who had to be dragged into testify or given an interview, very much refused to describe any conversation you have with Trump, as though that's protected by attorney-client privilege, which there are good arguments is not because he was never Trump's lawyer, he was the White House lawyer, the people's lawyer in that sense. And also, if Trump was doing something that was criminal, it's not covered by that, but he just wouldn't do that.\n\nAnd Cipollone, when you look at him, his background, he has 10 children. He's a far-right conservative, pro-life Catholic. He's associated with Opus Dei, this kind of right-wing sect. Like Barr, he's just a conservative Catholic, he wanted the administration to do certain things, he was there to get three conservative radicals onto the Supreme Court. He achieved that. Abortion - Roe - has been overturned. These people got what they wanted. And they think that that's a perfectly fine way to operate. They can just put any completely incompetent, dangerous person in charge, and they feel like they can steer the ship.\n\nIt's interesting that in the previous hearing, Cipollone was pressed on whether Sidney Powell had actually been appointed special counsel by Trump during this kind of previous December, crazy meeting in the Oval Office. And he basically said that he told the president that he did have the power to appoint Sidney Powell to be special prosecutor, and then just didn't do the work of giving Trump the documents that he had to fill out to make it official. And so then he considered that she wasn't the special prosecutor afterwards. And they just could ignore her.\n\nSo it's obviously true that they were fully aware of how the levers of power worked. And when they didn't want to let Trump do something, they just didn't let him do it. And so I do think it's all reputation laundering at this stage. But they got what they wanted. And they'll probably want to be back in power and get some more people on the Supreme Court and get some more right-wing fever dreams enacted.\n\nNR: I guess we should end on this.\n\nOne open question is whether this congressional investigation will eventually feed into a criminal investigation. And one development that happened this week was a letter from Merrick Garland that was sent to DOJ employees on how they're supposed to remain neutral in election years. It reads in part that: \"partisan politics must play no role in the decisions of federal investigators or prosecutors regarding any investigations or criminal charges.\"\n\nApparently, this is not dissimilar from memos that have been sent in the past. But I guess I found it really striking thinking back to the Comey era. And I wondered if you two read anything into it in terms of the January 6 investigation and what we should expect?\n\nKK: Well, that's a routine reminder and a policy that the DOJ has in place, generally. But I do think people that are concerned, as I'm seeing many liberals are, about the willingness of holding high-level Trump officials accountable, I don't see how you can call that an unreasonable concern, given our history and the way that executive privileges are understood.\n\nWhat did surprise me was that people in the White House tend to be deferrant to the argument that people in the White House have special privileges. So I don't pretend to know what DOJ is doing in secret, which those types of criminal investigations, if they exist, at a high level, would be very tightly held. They treat them as what's called special investigative matters, SIMs, and they lock those things down so that very few people have access to them, because they don't want it to leak. And so it is true that perhaps something's happening in a very discreet way.\n\nBut again, presidents tend to like presidential privileges once they come into the White House. And that's a tendency that I've always seen, and I think that the only way that there'll be a deviation from that is if there's sufficient public pressure to hold to account a past president. And I guess that that remains to be seen.\n\nNR: Well, and the implication of that, I think, is that DOJ and other agencies, I mean, the Secret Service, and DHS, and all of these agencies that have knowledge of what went on, if anything is really going to happen, they are going to have to make the choice to do something political, right?\n\nKK: Yeah, absolutely. And particularly DOJ, the culture is inimical to that. If you talk to the former FBI at DOJ, they hate to think of themselves as that - even though sometimes it can't be avoided, as you're saying. So I do think that there's a lot of cultural bulwarks to prevent things from moving in that direction. But again, these are really unprecedented circumstances. So we'll see.\n\nRM: I would say that outside of Washington, there's another aspect to this, which is that I think that the investigation in Fulton County of Trump's attempt to pressure officials into overturning the results there, in Georgia, in the presidential election, if Trump were to be indicted there, the key defense, I think, for that insane phone call, which if we didn't have January 6, that phone call that he made to Raffensperger and the fact that it's recorded, is an incredible, singularly disturbing and amazing evidence of malpractice, malfeasance by the sitting president, that he was asking the people who counted the votes to just give a different result. I mean, the whole thing is amazing.\n\nAnd I think, as far as I understand it, the legal defense that Trump could offer, if he was to be indicted there, was that he was basically just doing his job. That he believed these crazy conspiracy theories that there had been all these things wrong with the election. And he was pressing the local officials to take care of them, even though they told him those things weren't true.\n\nI think that what I've noticed is that I think that the hearings have presented a lot of evidence that Trump had very, very good reason - a lot of people around him were telling him that those conspiracy theories were not true. That all of these things that he thought went wrong in Georgia did not go wrong. And he had enough information that he should have known, if he didn't know, that those things weren't true, by the time he made that call to Raffensberger, very late, just before January 6, a few days before January 6, that weekend.\n\nSo it's potentially a possibility that if that grand jury decided to go ahead, and the prosecutor decided to indict him, then it goes to a jury in Georgia, and Georgia itself has been resistant to Trump's charms, obviously. So this could play a role in that way in educating the public, and giving people information - and prosecutors information - that could cut against this argument that he didn't know.\n\nAnd then you get back to this somewhat funny but revealing and maybe important thing that Liz Cheney said where she said that this defense of Trump is that poor him, he couldn't have known. And she said: He's a 76-year-old man. He's not an impressionable child. He had every reason to know that the election was not stolen, and yet he persisted right up to demanding that the Georgia Secretary of State give him one more vote than he needed.\n\nNR: Also, the clip of Steve Bannon in October 2020, saying that this was actually their plan to push back from the very beginning, even before the election.\n\nSteve Bannon: And what Trump's gonna do is declare victory, right? He's gonna declare victory. But that doesn't mean he's the winner. He's just going to say he's the winner. [Cross-talk.] Also, if Trump is losing by 10 or 11 o'clock at night, it's going to be even crazier. No, because he's gonna sit right down and say they stole it. If Biden is winning, Trump is going to do some crazy show.\n\nRM: Absolutely. And I mean, actually, it was somebody's plan in 2016. Roger Stone came up with the idea of \"stop the steal\" in 2016 when they expected Trump to lose and they were talking about it.\n\nI mean, Don, Jr. has a direct message conversation with WikiLeaks where he's being encouraged to challenge results in 2016. This was a long, long time coming.\n\nNR: Amazing.

      "text": "Part Six: The Looting of the Nation\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTrump has served as the Pied Piper for the most radical GOP agenda on the economy, workers, and the poor.\n\nDonald Trump has run the White House like his family business with one primary aim: to enrich his brand, his family, and his cronies. In part six of \" American Mythology ,\" we examine how Trump and the GOP - at times with help from the Democrats - have opened the gates to the federal feeding trough for corporate greed and unaccountability. Throughout the 2016 campaign Trump claimed that, unlike Hillary Clinton, he was not beholden to corporate or special interests and that he would uplift the working class. Once in power, he appointed record numbers of Goldman Sachs veterans to his administration, passed sweeping tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, attacked organized labor, and chiseled away at an already abysmal health care system. Unprecedented inequality and stagnant wages have persisted. Fewer Americans currently have health insurance than when Trump was sworn into office. These sharp economic injustices have come into clear focus during the Covid-19 pandemic: Corporate robber barons like Jeff Bezos have increased their wealth by billions while 40 percent of Americans say they couldn't withdraw $400 in the event of an unexpected emergency. In America, eight million more people have descended into poverty in recent months, as the wealth of billionaires grew by $845 billion.\n\nJeremy Scahill: This is Intercepted.\n\nI'm Jeremy Scahill coming to you from New York City and this is part six of an Intercepted special, \"American Mythology: The Presidency of Donald Trump.\"\n\nDonald J. Trump: This is the most important election in the history of our country. And people have to get out and vote because what they want to do is crazy. We will never allow this country to become a socialist nation, and that's what they're trying to do.\n\nJS: During the 2016 election, Donald Trump regularly criticized Hillary Clinton for her relationship with Wall Street, and in particular, her paid speeches to the investment bank, Goldman Sachs.\n\nDJT: I know the guys at Goldman Sachs. They have total, total, total control over him, just like they have total control over Hillary Clinton, they have total. But they have no control, they have no control over Donald Trump. I don't want their money, I don't need their money.\n\nJS: While many progressives, including Clinton's Democratic primary opponent Bernie Sanders also blasted her Wall Street ties, Trump's attacks often utilized some unsavory tactics. He claimed, in one of his many antisemtic dog whistles, that Clinton's past support of trade agreements like NAFTA and the TPP proved she was a \"globalist.\"\n\nDJT: Hillary Clinton is merely a vessel for those global special interests trying to strip our country of its wealth, its jobs, its status as a sovereign nation. And we have been stripped, folks. We don't make anything anymore. We don't make anything. We're gonna start making things. We're not going to let countries like China devalue their currency and have trade deficits of $400 billion and $500 billion a year. We're not going to let it happen. She's a globalist who makes a living taking jobs from our country and giving them to foreign countries.\n\nJS: Trump claimed that unlike Clinton he was not beholden to corporate or special interests, and that he'd wouldn't abandon the working class.\n\nDJT : You have one magnificent chance to deliver justice for every forgotten man, woman, and child in this nation. The arrogance of Washington D.C. will soon come face to face with the righteous verdict of the American voter. Believe me, it's enough.\n\nJS: Fast forward to that gray day in January 2017, when Trump took the oath of office.\n\nJohn Roberts : Preserve, protect, and defend -\n\nDJT: Preserve, protect, and defend -\n\nJR: The Constitution of the United States -\n\nDJT: The Constitution of the United States -\n\nJR: So help me God.\n\nDJT: So help me God.\n\nJR: Congratulations\n\n[Cheers, claps, trumpets]\n\nJS: In his inaugural address, reportedly written by Steve Bannon, Trump described an economic hellscape that, for many Americans, was a reality.\n\nDJT: Mothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation. ...\n\nThis American carnage stops right here, and stops right now. ...\n\nAmerica will start winning again, winning like never before. We will bring back our jobs. We will bring back our borders. We will bring back our wealth. And we will bring back our dreams. We will build new roads, and highways, and bridges, and airports, and tunnels, and railways all across our wonderful nation. We will get our people off of welfare and back to work - rebuilding our country with American hands and American labor.\n\nJS: Claiming he would spur economic growth and bring back manufacturing jobs, Trump promised to end NAFTA, pull out of TPP, close trade deficits, pass a massive tax cut, and invest in the nation's crumbling infrastructure. That is what he said. But my colleague Naomi Klein warned early on that in examining Trump's business dealings, we would get a glimpse into what he might actually do with the U.S. economy.\n\nNaomi Klein : What Donald Trump has done as a businessman. You know, how he has run his incredibly opaque company, the number of bankruptcies, the number of ripped off workers and contractors. I mean, he so consistently sacrifices his own investors, his - you know, his own partners, and just looks out for number one.\n\nWhen there are problems, and there are very often problems with Trump developments, whether - if it's not on time; if it's - if people aren't able to - these are often revenue properties. If they feel that they've been lied to, whatever happens - and there have been several collapses - Trump is not responsible, right? The liabilities are held by these business partners to whom he's just leased his name. So, if the U.S. government is run anything like the Trump organization: Expect to be looted.\n\nJS: The looting began on day one. Trump appointed Gary Cohn, the president of Goldman Sachs, to be his chief economic adviser. Contrary to Trump's beratement of Clinton during the primary about the bank, there were more Goldman Sachs alumni working for Donald Trump than any other previous administration.\n\nDJT: This is the president of Goldman Sachs. Smart. Having him represent us, he went from massive to paydays, to peanuts, to little tiny - I'm waiting for them to accuse him of wanting that little amount of money. But these are people that are great brilliant business minds and that's what we need. That's what we have to have so the world doesn't take advantage of us. We can't have the world taking advantage of us anymore.\n\nJS: Reporter Gary Rivlin also described Trump's early moves that not only didn't benefit ordinary people, they enriched the very players he accused Hillary Clinton of cozying up to.\n\nGary Rivlin: You know, they talk about a different approach to infrastructure, the $1 trillion dollar infrastructure plan, it's kind of left, right, middle. Everyone understands that we need to be dealing with our infrastructure problem in this country, but the Goldman Sachs plan, the plan that Gary Cohn gave President-elect Donald Trump when he was just Goldman Sachs's president meeting with Donald Trump, before he was named to the White House, he said, \"You know, why don't we put up a little bit of money, in this case a couple hundred billion dollars of government money, and the rest will be private financing from Wall Street firms.\" And guess what firm is among the three or four largest in the public infrastructure business? Goldman Sachs.\n\nGoldman Sachs is huge in IPOs. When Gary Cohn was president of Goldman Sachs, he was lobbying to loosen the initial public offering laws. Well, six months into the administration, the SEC has loosened the IPO rules, which is worth hundreds of millions of dollars to Goldman Sachs alone. And so here was a president who said, \"I'm going to represent you, little guy, because it's the big firms like Goldman Sachs that are draining the economy, that are enriching themselves at your expense.\" And in the position as, to head his economic policy team, is a guy who, down the line, you look at every policy, is trying to perpetuate the Goldman Sachs's of the world. The Wall Street firms draining the economy at the expense of the little guy.\n\nIf you voted for Trump because, \"Wow! Someone's going to finally fight for the little guy.\" And it's not just like the president of Goldman Sachs is the chief economic advisor, but one of the main villains in the subprime meltdown, is now your guy? To help turn around the economy? I actually think one of the reasons Donald Trump won is because there are a lot of Tea Party people on the right, who are really angry at Wall Street for what happened in 2008. So taking one of those main villains and putting him to top your economic team, I think it really infuriates people.\n\nDJT: And I love all people: rich or poor. But in those particular positions, I just don't want a poor person. Does that make sense? Does that sense? [laughter and applause] If you insist, I'll do it. But I like it better this way. Right?\n\nJS: Indeed. Here is former Goldman Sachs executive turned whistleblower Nomi Prins:\n\nNomi Prins : If tax cuts go through for companies, it will help those people who are already stashing money, not to bring it back, and to basically enrich themselves. It will help, you know, people with wealthy estates preserve it for their families. And, the point is, those are the people that are actually affecting the tax code and are in the offices and are in the dinners and are in the meetings and are at the golf courses with the individuals who are trying to push on to everybody else the idea that their plans will be beneficial to them.\n\nJS: Despite Donald Trump's promotion of himself as a billionaire and business genius, he was never really accepted into the club of New York's financial elite. As filmmaker Michael Moore observed, Trump was sort of seen as an ostentatious and tacky wannabe.\n\nMichael Moore: Trump was always treated very poorly by the uber-rich of New York City. Wall Street didn't like him. The big banks didn't like him and he always felt slighted by them. They treated him as if he was like the trailer trash of millionaires, from Queens, still talked like he was from Queens, you know, the whole thing. And they certainly were not that excited about him running.\n\nThey immediately figured out how he could be a useful tool for them, for capitalism. And that's why not only has there not been a peep out of them since he gave them their tax cut and it's done all the other things in terms of gutting EPA regulations, and things that we don't even know about that happen on a daily basis in each federal government department. Because you just could never keep up with it. If you actually knew what was going on every day.\n\nTwo weeks ago, you got rid of the department at the EPA that's responsible for the environmental health of children. Fired the woman, got rid of the people. That's it. Gone. Hardly anything on it in the news. You have no idea how many millions of acres of land he gave away today to the oil and gas companies. This happens every single day and he is doing the work now of Wall Street and the big banks in corporate America and they are the main beneficiaries of what he's doing to dismantle from inside the federal government.\n\nJS: In November of 2017, Trump signed into law the innocuously-named Tax Cut and Jobs Act, which was the largest tax overhaul in over three decades. It cut the corporate tax rate from 35 to 21 percent. While Republicans claimed that this $1.9 trillion cut would \"pay for itself,\" the Congressional Research Service found that it had \"a relatively small (if any) first-year effect on the economy\".\n\nMitch McConnell: I love the tax bill. I think the tax bill had an important impact on the economy.\n\nDJT: It's the largest - I always say the most massive, but it's the largest tax cut in the history of our country, and reform, but tax cut, really something special. When you think you haven't heard this expression but: We are making America great again. You haven't heard that, have you?\n\nJS: Unsurprisingly, these tax cuts are projected to worsen economic inequality, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Job and wage growth have plateaued. When some cuts expire in 2025, the poorest Americans will see an increase in their taxes. Meanwhile, 91 of the top Fortune 500 companies paid $0 in corporate income tax in 2018.\n\nThis growing inequality ultimately undermines democracy, says economist and former Bernie Sanders adviser, Stephanie Kelton.\n\nStephanie Kelton: Income but also wealth inequality in this country is at dangerously high, and essentially, historically high levels. And that this is not just bad for the way our economy functions, it's extremely dangerous when it comes to the way our democracy functions. Even though it's a progressive tax system, that is you pay a higher share of taxes as your income increases. Even though we have a progressive income tax system, it's not nearly progressive enough and we ought to be doing more to correct those imbalances that allow the people at the very top to become so extraordinarily rich that those riches then hinder the working of the economy and undermine the functioning of our democracy.\n\nJS: While 8 million more people have slipped into poverty during this pandemic, the wealth of billionaires grew by $845 billion dollars.\n\nDJT: Under my leadership prosperity will surge. What we've done in the last three and a half years has been incredible. Nobody has ever done what we've done. There's no administration that's accomplished what we've accomplished in the first three and a half years. Not even close.\n\nJS: Donald Trump has presided over the worst job losses in U.S. history. A 50-year low in unemployment has vaporized. Only about half of the 22 million jobs lost because of coronavirus have returned. As of September, nearly 3.8 million people have been classified as permanently unemployed. About 26 million people are collecting unemployment. Trump's trusty advisors at Fox and Friends have told Trump focus on the pre-pandemic economy.\n\nSteve Doocy : Essentially the best message is President Trump built a great economy then Covid screwed things up and President Trump is better at reubuilding than Joe Biden. That's the message they would like to see.\n\nJS: But here's the thing, countries that were better able to control their outbreaks have not suffered as much economic pain, according to analysis by the Financial Times. Unprecedented inequality and stagnant wages have persisted. Fewer Americans currently have health insurance than when Trump first became president.\n\nThese sharp economic injustices have come into clear focus during the Coronavirus pandemic as corporate robber barons like Jeff Bezoses have become much wealthier while 40 percent of Americans couldn't withdraw $400 right now if they had to. Filmmaker, author, and organizer Astra Taylor underscores the consequences of a government captured by minority interests.\n\nAstra Taylor: I mean, it's interesting because you can have a conversation that's like this is going to be difficult given the American political system and the number of veto points and the way that it's structured and the way that money is a form of political speech, and the fact that we essentially have a system, an electoral system where bribery is legalized in terms of campaign contributions, right? You could say, there are lots of obstacles in the way of this. That's not how they're framing this. So I mean, I think there probably is something deeper. There's a threat to their authority, right, and to the system that helped them rise to power and stay in power.\n\nThinking about democracy writ large, I mean, there's a bigger thing they're afraid of though because what this means, to have universal health care is to decommodify this huge industry, and it's to connect decommodification with democratization.\n\nMaybe there are huge areas of social life that should not be not just subjected to the market extremes but actually taken off the market completely, right? And that's very threatening to the status quo because once you start decommodifying one area, well why not others?\n\nJS: Despite the brazen economic disparities in the U.S., the obscene profits being reaped by the richest corporations and people, and the avalanches of so-called stimulus cash rained down on the already wealthy, Trump continually reassured the American public to just look at the stock market as proof of our collective prosperity.\n\nDJT: The stock market is hitting an all-time high record, for another, and think of this, 86 times since Election Day. 86 times it hit a record. 86 times. And we're going to keep it going.\n\nJS: Only roughly half of American's own stock, while the richest 1 percent own 50 percent of stocks. Again former Goldman Sachs executive Nomi Prins:\n\nNP: Trump connects everything to the stock market because it is the one thing that you can objectively look at that has a number that has gone up. You can't do that with wages. You can't do that with job quality. You can't do that job longevity. You can't do that with your health coverage. You can't do that with lots of other things that most people count on for their day-to-day lives and to make the day to day payments and money that they need to survive them. But what the stock market shows is not, not the expectation that there was going to be a tax cut. What the stock - which is what he's saying, what the stock market shows is that for all of this period, and it happened during Obama as well, and yes it's continued under Trump, there's been a situation where companies have been able to receive very cheap money, because our rates are close to zero and they have been since the financial crisis, in order to subsidize the money that was lacking at the time for the banking system, that money has gone to banks, banks have bought back their own shares, banks pay themselves dividends on their own shares that they bought. That pumps the stock market up. That's a significant set of buyers for their own stock which enriches the top level of the firms, and it also pushes the stock market up. And then they also get dividends on their own stock.\n\nSo all of that is more why the stock market has continued to rise throughout Obama's administration as well as with Trump in there now. Because nothing has been done to effectively change that.\n\nJS: Proponents of the 2017 tax cut promised that companies would have more money to invest in workers and capital improvements that would, in turn, spark greater economic activity. Instead the corporate tax cut went mainly to stock buybacks, rewarding shareholders and investors. Recent data from the Census Bureau suggests that the pre-pandemic economy under Trump was growing above two percent annually, but disproportionately benefitting wealthier Americans. The data also reveals that even before the global pandemic inequality reached its highest level in 50 years. But, as journalist Chris Hedges points out, it's a trend that has been moving in that direction for decades.\n\nChris Hedges: The fundamental engines of oligarchic global corporate power are advanced by both parties and one attempts to present that in a kind of multicultural, inclusive way. The other is, you know, it kind of embraced by troglodytes. But there's no way within the American political system you can in any way tame or challenge the war machine or Goldman Sachs or ExxonMobil.\n\nAnd this is now where we've ended up, in the greatest income inequality in American history, the seizure of power by, and they're not even traditional capitalist, they don't make anything. They're all speculators - global speculators. That's what Goldman Sachs does. They've seized control of our economy and most economies.\n\nThe breakdown that we experience has been bipartisan. Clinton was, of course, the poster child for this. Clinton understood that if he did corporate bidding, he would get corporate money. And of course, by the 1990s, fundraising parity with the Republicans was equal. And when Barack Obama first ran 2008, he got more.\n\nSo, we've got to look at the structural issues. I mean, I find Trump as repugnant and repulsive as everyone else. But our problem is not embodied in the personality of Donald Trump.\n\nJS: Coronavirus laid bare the precariousness of the lives of so many people in the U.S. When the first known person in this country died from the disease on February 29th of this year, nearly 60 percent of Americans had less than a thousand dollars in savings. Half of Americans over 55 had zero retirement savings. Medical debt contributes to millions of bankruptcies every year. One in four Americans were defaulting on their student loans.\n\nA month after the first known U.S. Coronavirus death, Donald Trump signed into law the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act, better known as CARES.\n\nDJT : Now I'm gonna sign this. And it's a great honor. $6.2 trillion. I've never signed anything with a \"T\" on it. I don't know if I can handle this one, Mitch. We can't chicken out at this point. I don't think so.\n\nJS: It was the largest economic stimulus in U.S. History.\n\nDJT: We also have a lot of money set aside for big businesses, you know, the big, powerful companies that were powerful four weeks ago. We have to save some of these great companies.\n\nJS: Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was the only Democrat to say publicly she voted against the bill, which was done via voice vote. Speaking on the House floor, she described how the GOP used poor and working people as hostages to free hundreds of billions of dollars for the richest corporations.\n\nAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez: What did the Senate majority fight for? One of the largest corporate bailouts with as few strings as possible in American history. Shameful. The greed of that fight is wrong for crumbs for our families. And the option that we have is to either let them suffer with nothing or to allow this greed and billions of dollars which will be leveraged into trillions of dollars to contribute to the largest income inequality gap in our future. There should be shame about what was fought for in this bill and the choices that we have to make.\n\nJS: The poorest Americans were essentially expected to survive on $1,200 for six months during the pandemic. Congress and Trump also allowed the enhanced unemployment payment of $600 to expire in July, slashing aid during the pandemic to about $330 a week.\n\nOf the $350 bil­lion earmarked for small busi­ness­es in the Paycheck Protection Program, 70 percent of it went to large corporations, including Boeing whose stock is owned by at least 15 mem­bers of Con­gress (or their spous­es). Most notably, the airline companies that received a $25 billion bail out, have recently announced that they are laying off tens of thousands of workers.\n\nHuffPost senior reporter Zach Carter specializes in U.S. economic policy:\n\nZach Carter: The trick is, when you look at what they've done in the overall coronavirus bailout package, they have been extremely, extremely generous with the wealthiest people in the world. The feature provision of the major piece of legislation that has already passed is $4.5 trillion to large corporations with almost no strings attached. That is money that goes straight to shareholders and executives. That is money that is going to the richest people in the world. And there's really no kind of guardrails that Congress put on that funding to make sure that it's used responsibly. So on the one hand, they talk a lot about means testing, making sure that ordinary people - you know, we don't have too many lucky duckies who are making like $70,000 a year accidentally getting a $1,200 check. But the richest people in the world, if they get a multimillion-dollar dividend payout, that's just fine.\n\nAstra Taylor: There's broad majoritarian support for progressive social policy. This is what the people - the Demos - want. And we've entered a phase where that is sort of undeniable, if you just look at the numbers.\n\nJS: But as Astra Taylor explains, it doesn't have to be this way.\n\nAT: The problem is actually that we're living in the age of minoritarian politics, minoritarian control. You see that very strongly with the GOP and the fact that they want a politics of hierarchy, basically a return to aristocracy, right? They're willing to gerrymander and disenfranchise voters - they absolutely don't want people to go out and vote. But we see it with the Democrats as well, right? We see that they want to tell their constituencies, sorry, you can't have these things that are not only popular, but actually pretty commonplace in other industrial democracies.\n\nPeople's complaints are pretty universal: it's like corruption, massive inequality, the lack of workers rights, a lack of concern for the environment, just a lack of basic dignity.\n\nAnd to go back to democracy. This is the motor of democracy. This is what, democracy is not just procedures and elections, it is this moment where people come together as a kind of politicized philosophical public and are like what kind of world do we want to live in?\n\nJS: From the very beginning, Donald Trump's entire schtick about standing up for the downtrodden, the hard workers, the ordinary people of this country was a scam. One nonstop four-year grift. Trump has used his political career and his time as president to enrich himself and his cronies. But more than that, he has served as a Pied Piper for the most extreme anti-worker, anti-poor agendas of the Republican Party. And he dug deep into the well of the most vile aspects of U.S. politics and history to win power. It was this weaponizing of hate that allowed Trump and his allies to manufacture the state of grave danger that so many poor and working people now find themselves in in this country. The extreme economic injustices of the past four years were produced on the rhetoric of white nationalism, xenophobia, racism, sexism.\n\nBut simply voting Trump out of office will not wipe any of this away. Many of these factors, while intensified during this administration, have persisted through both Democratic and Republican administrations. Both parties are beholden to corporate interests, even if one is more brazen and successful at producing dividends for the ultra-rich. The hard truth we must all face is that the political and economic system Trump has exploited and utilized will continue on in perpetuity unless the people of this country bravely muster the collective will to challenge its very existence.\n\nThis has been part six of an Intercepted limited documentary series, American Mythology: The Presidency of Donald Trump.

      "text": "Donald Trump Keeps Saying He Won't Accept the Election Result. Are People Finally Starting to Listen?\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nGeorgetown law professor Joshua Geltzer talks about the threat Trump poses to our electoral system.\n\nFears are growing, stoked by the president's own comments, that he will refuse to peacefully leave office should he lose the election in November. How concerned should we be, and what can we do to make sure we're prepared? Joshua Geltzer, visiting law professor at Georgetown University and a former member of Barack Obama's National Security Council, joins Mehdi Hasan to discuss.\n\nWhite House Reporter: Will you commit here to a peaceful transfer of power?\n\nPresident Donald J. Trump: Well we'll have to see... There won't be a transfer, frankly. There'll be a continuation.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nMehdi Hasan: Welcome to Deconstructed. I'm Mehdi Hasan.\n\nThe polls suggest Joe Biden is on course for victory in November. But if he loses, is Donald Trump really going to leave without a fight?\n\nJG: I think we need to have these conversations ahead of time, which can help inoculate against all that stuff that Donald Trump will say, potentially starting November 3, November 4, and for weeks to come.\n\nMH: That's my guest today, Joshua Geltzer, Georgetown law professor and a former member of President Obama's National Security Council.\n\nSo, how worried should we be that Trump won't accept the result? That he won't leave without violence or chaos? Is democracy itself really on the ballot this November?\n\nPicture the scene: It's the morning of November 4, 2020, the morning after the election, and it's become clear that Donald Trump has lost both in the Electoral College and in the popular vote to the Democratic candidate, Joe Biden.\n\nThe president, however, rather than calling his Democratic opponent to concede, holds a rally with his supporters at which he declares himself the winner of the election and tells the crowd not to believe what they're seeing or hearing in the news, because it's fake news. And he tells them that the election was rigged, it was a deep state coup, and millions and millions of people voted illegally for the Democrats, using fake mail-in ballots. He tells them to take to the streets because their Second Amendment rights are at stake.\n\nPicture that scene. It's a scene I first wrote about back in March 2019, in a column for The Intercept, headlined: \"Yes, Let's Defeat or Impeach Donald Trump. But What If He Refuses to Leave the White House?\"\n\nI concluded that piece, saying: \"This is not a drill, and there is no reason to believe Trump will go quietly if he is defeated. There is every reason, however, to believe he and his allies will incite hysteria and even violence. Those who assume otherwise haven't been paying attention.\"\n\nNow, a lot of people at the time thought that was hyperbole, that I was exaggerating the risk, the threat; they poo-pooed the scenario that I outlined there. This doesn't happen in America. We have checks and balances. Yeah - American exceptionalism! Hubris, more like it.\n\nSo what prompted me to write that piece then? Well, at the time, two things: number one, one of Trump's closest confidantes, his former personal lawyer and fixer Michael Cohen had just told Congress:\n\nMichael Cohen: Given my experience working for Mr. Trump, I fear that if he loses the election in 2020, that there will never be a peaceful transition of power.\n\nMH: And, number two: Trump himself made it clear in 2016 he wouldn't accept the election result. So why would it be any different in 2020? In fact, even after winning in 2016, he'd publicly and falsely claimed that Hillary Clinton had only got more votes than him because \"illegals\" voted for her. This man is a bad winner; of course he's going to be a bad loser!\n\nOver the past 18 months, thankfully, more and more people have come 'round to my way of thinking. Now, it's almost conventional wisdom that Trump won't accept the result; that there's a risk of violence, even.\n\nIn fact, the former head of the National Counterterrorism Center said just this month that he would not be surprised if far-right domestic terrorist groups launch attacks across the U.S., \"particularly if the administration loses.\"\n\nPeople can no longer deny that this is where we're headed, because Trump keeps telling us this is where we're headed. Asked by Fox News's Chris Wallace whether he'd accept the election result, he refused to say yes:\n\nChris Wallace: Can you give a direct answer? You will accept the election?\n\nDJT: I have to see. Look, I have to see. No, I'm not going to just say yes. I'm not going to say - and I didn't last time, either.\n\nMH: At a recent rally, the narcissist-in-chief said he wouldn't accept as legitimate any election result that didn't show him as the winner:\n\nDJT: The only way we're going to lose this election is if the election is rigged. Remember that. That's the only way we're going to lose this election.\n\nMH: And let's not forget his dangerous, dangerous tweets earlier this year:\n\n@realDonaldTrump: \"LIBERATE MINNESOTA\"\n\n@realDonaldTrump: \"LIBERATE MICHIGAN!\"\n\n@realDonaldTrump: \"LIBERATE VIRGINIA, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege.\"\n\nTweets that were welcomed by both far-right extremists online and armed right-wing militias on the streets of Michigan, Virginia, and beyond.\n\nSo what happens if November sees Trump refusing to concede, contesting the results, urging violence, urging an uprising by his cultish and armed followers? Are the Democrats ready for that? Is Joe Biden? Is the media? Are we ready?\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nMH: Who better to ask about all of this than my guest today, Joshua Geltzer, who is a visiting law professor at Georgetown University and was a senior director for Counterterrorism at the National Security Council during president Obama's second term?\n\nNow, I may have been one of the first people in the U.S. media to write about this subject back in March 2019, but he beat even me. In February 2019, he penned an op-ed for the CNN website, headlined: \"What If Trump Refuses to Accept Defeat in 2020?\"\n\nAnd he joins me now from his home in Washington D.C..\n\nJoshua Geltzer, thanks for coming on Deconstructed.\n\nJG: Thanks for the invitation.\n\nMH: You wrote your piece in February 2019. I wrote a very similar piece a month later, in March 2019, making the same warning: What happens if Trump won't go?\n\nIt's been 18 months since then. More and more people - politicians, pundits, voters - are now warning about a scenario where Trump refuses to go. Why do you think it took so long for so many people to recognize the clear and present danger here? Why was it dismissed out of hand a year and a half ago? I remember people poo-pooed me when I wrote my column for The Intercept. But now it's the subject of much ongoing debate, much hand-wringing.\n\nJG: I think this is the Trump dynamic that we've seen where he says something so outrageous, first as a candidate, then as president, that initially the reaction of people, almost understandably, is to say: \"He can't actually do that. He can't actually deliver on that promise. He can't actually mean what he says.\"\n\nBut then when he does, it takes people aback. They're caught unsure how to respond, because he's actually gone and done it. And that was my goal - I suspect it was your goal - in providing this warning, which is we need to accept this as a possibility so that we can be ahead of him for once.\n\nMH: Yes.\n\nAnd one of the reasons I wrote my piece was Michael Cohen, his, at the time, former lawyer - but had just been his lawyer until very recently, at that time - had gone in front of Congress and said: I don't think there'll be a peaceful transfer of power. He's not the kind of guy who's gonna do it.\n\nAnd I remember the 2016 result and, you know, the guy won, and still complained about illegal voters and being stolen. He was a bad winner; of course, he's gonna be a bad loser. There's no debate about it - let's just look at the personality of this man that we're learning more and more about, thanks to even family members now, in recent days.\n\nAnd what's interesting, Josh, is in recent days people are even going further than you and I did a year and a half ago in terms of dire warnings. You now have very serious people warning of major violence. The former head of the National Counterterrorism Center, Ross Travers, said the other week that he wouldn't be surprised if far-right domestic terrorist groups launch attacks around the country if Trump loses. I mean, you and I didn't go that far.\n\nJG: No, we didn't. But someone like Ross, with whom I worked closely when I was in government, he is not prone to hyperventilating. But he is putting together, I think, some strands of the Trump presidency and Trump's rhetoric. In particular, he's taking not only what you and I focused on, the idea of refusing to accept the legitimacy of any election in which he loses, but also this - at times tacit, at times rather explicit -encouragement, acceptance, exhortation even, of private militia groups.\n\nNow, Trump hasn't said to do exactly what Ross, and apparently others who are still in government, are worrying about, but he's accepted that they might provide security for him at campaign events. He hasn't denounced them going all the way back to Charlottesville, of course, in August 2017. So it's those strands that come together in at least potentially worrisome ways that require us to get ahead of it, rather than to find ourselves in undesirable, rather frightening circumstances.\n\nMH: Yeah. And we've even seen him embrace QAnon, which the FBI considers to be a potential domestic radicalization, a domestic extremist group which has also been behind acts of violence. And even if you go beyond terror attacks, we do know that Trump supporters, armed Trump supporters will take to the streets if he tells them to. That's not a guess. They've done it already. In Michigan we saw right-wing militias turn up at the statehouse earlier this year as part of the anti-lockdown protests, burning effigies of Democratic governors. Was that all a warm-up, do you think, for November?\n\nJG: It at least feels like it could be - it feels like it could be a warm-up from groups that go into this election cycle thinking that the system is somehow rigged - in part, of course, because Donald Trump told them way back in 2016 -\n\nMH: Yes!\n\nJG: - that they should see it as rigged, until he kind of dropped that language once he won, but -\n\nMH: - although, he said the other day - I should just remind our listeners - he said the other day: The only way I lose is if it's rigged. So he made it very clear he's not accepting the result.\n\nJG: Right. That's the sort of resuscitation of a claim that was hard to resuscitate once, in fact, he won. And yet Trump has found a way to keep alive the notion that the system is stacked against him. That's how he phrases the Flynn matter; that's how he phrases Mueller's investigation. He somehow manages to take these pieces and use them to keep alive the notion that he's the one being treated unfairly, when in fact, to the chagrin of some of us, he nonetheless emerged the victor in the system as we have it in 2016. And he's re-injecting that now as 2020 approaches.\n\nMH: So we have these warnings coming out, more and more people worried about this scenario. And yet, overall, despite, you know, Nancy Pelosi is coming out saying we need to win big in order to avoid this happening - we've heard Facebook say recently they're gonna crack down on misinformation about the result, or about Trump falsely claiming victory on the night, there's been books published on this topic of whether he'll go quietly. But I still feel, Josh, overall - big picture - politicians and journalists, neither of them are prepared really, fully for what could be coming down the track.\n\nDo you think enough preparations have been made? For example, I can speak as a journalist, I look at my colleagues in the media, and I do not think enough preparations have been made for what happens on election night: What are the anchors going to be saying? How are the newspapers going to be framing it if Trump does not accept the result, or if he claims victory when all the votes aren't in? Do you think people in your world, in the national security world, in the government bureaucracy, on the Democratic side have taken it seriously enough?\n\nJG: I'll say a couple of positive things, and then a couple of things I'm still concerned about.\n\nHere's where I'm positive: I think some of your colleagues in the media have begun to help the public understand some important things. Those include the idea that there is nothing illegitimate about not knowing the results on election night, that ballots still may need to be counted, that potentially there will even be court cases. That's a peaceful way to resolve things; that's okay. It happened in 2000. It was unsettling, but, ultimately it was, of course, peaceful - that there are ways in which we might not know the night of and that is just fine. That's not a rigged election; that's not illegitimate.\n\nAnd explaining not only that as a notion, but, in particular, what some of those steps could be after election day, but before January 20, I think there are at least some signs that that is infiltrating the public discussion in a helpful way. But I'm also still concerned, and some of those steps that I urged in the piece early last year, that you were nice enough to reference earlier, I wish there was more action being taken on them - the idea that governors who are not up for reelection could all commit to honoring the results of the presidential election, regardless of what those results are; the idea that members of Congress who are not up for reelection on the Senate side or even those who are up could commit to approaching their duty on January 6 of holding a joint session and certifying results, and not being deterred by a single candidate's claim of illegitimacy, there's still time to take those steps. But they haven't been taken yet, unfortunately,\n\nMH: Josh, you mentioned a moment ago the governors and the role that they can play. And in your original CNN piece, I think there were four groups - four actors - where pressure could be brought to bear, in your view: the electoral college, Congress, the governors, and the military. I wonder if you have confidence in all of those actors, 18 months later?\n\nI mean, Congress remains a partisan, dysfunctional joke. And, as for the military, we just saw a few weeks ago, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Mark Milley, disgraced himself by going in full combat fatigues on a walkabout with President Trump around Lafayette Square after Trump had cleared it out with tear gas.\n\nJG: So that scene was horrifying, I think, to many across America. And as people talk about that and other recent disturbing developments as something of a test run for how Trump might behave in November, I guess I, as an optimist, hope that it's also a lesson learned. Because Chairman Milley came out afterwards and released a video that he knew would be public and, in particular, he knew Donald Trump would see, in which he said he made a mistake.\n\nNow, it's better to know something is a mistake before you do it rather than after, but at least realizing after is better than not realizing it at all. And for him to have realized that what he did there, as someone in uniform with others in uniform, was inappropriate, was contrary to the norms and ideals of American democracy and civilian military relations, the idea that that was a test run from which he learned before November, that's what the optimist in me wants to take away from that.\n\nMH: Okay. And in your list of groups, you didn't mention the courts as playing a potential role. Is that because you believe they're so stuffed with Trump appointees, and so partisan, including the Supreme Court, that the U.S. judiciary can no longer be relied upon to prevent or adjudicate a potential constitutional crisis of this magnitude? I mean, not just no longer - back in 2000, many would argue it was a biased Supreme Court that helped Bush defeat Gore.\n\nJG: So, I'm not a fan of the Bush v. Gore decision and I'm not a fan of every decision I see from the federal courts, but I still see them as a place where peaceful resolution, appropriate resolution of disputes, including electoral disputes can play out. I didn't mention them in the piece, in part because I was trying to identify actors who could act now - who, in advance, could make certain commitments, certain pledges, that would help ensure a peaceful transfer of power.\n\nCourts, of course, tend to work when there's a concrete case or controversy upon them. And I think they will find - at least, some of them, around the country - that they're asked to do just that. But if they do it consistent with the way our courts operate in channeling what otherwise could be hard to resolve disputes into peaceful adjudication, I think that's still an important role.\n\nI also think there are things states can do to try to avoid, for example, the Bush v. Gore problem. And we could talk about Bush v. Gore at length but real quickly, part of the problem there was that it wasn't wholly clear exactly what the different pieces of the Florida system thought should happen in terms of ballot counting, if it wasn't resolved past a certain date on the calendar. Dates could make that totally clear - unmistakably clear - today, before we get to November, and that would leave less wiggle room for a Supreme Court or, frankly, even a lower federal court, to come along and make the sort of decision that many of us thought was a mistake back in 2000.\n\nMH: So you're not just a former senior government official, you're also a law professor at Georgetown; just legally and constitutionally, just to be clear, what we're worried about here is the period between November 3, 2020 - Election Day - and January 20, 2021 - the inauguration of a new president. Right? There's no chance, is there, that a defeated Trump could hold on to office past January 20, or could he, if there's shenanigans or dirty tricks when it comes to certifying Electoral College results, for example, in December? What's the process?\n\nJG: So the Constitution is clear that on January 20, the term of a current president ends. And it's also clear that if there isn't someone whose votes have been certified by Congress as the new president, then the line of succession kicks in. Which means if there has been such a deadlocked Congress, for example, that they don't certify the right results, or they don't reach the necessary thresholds, it actually moves past the president and vice president, whose term will end, one way or another, at noon on January 20, and go to the next person, who happens to be the Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi. So, if you reach that point, it's not clear that that's an outcome Donald Trump loves.\n\nMH: Or that the Republicans in Congress love, and they might put pressure on him to avoid that. Although, I read somewhere that it's not Nancy Pelosi, because it would be the Senate Pro Tempore, Chuck Grassley. I saw someone claiming that.\n\nJG: That's a - it is an extreme hypothetical. I think what you may have seen was some people who said: Look, if there really were no federal elections held at all, which is something, to be totally clear, that Donald Trump does not have the power unilaterally to do -\n\nMH: Yes, yes, OK, yes. We're mixing up the different constitutional crises that Donald Trump has broached here. Fair enough.\n\nJG: They're coming at us too quickly to keep track of.\n\nMH: Yeah. In the scenario where there's no elections, and yes, Pelosi wouldn't be in Congress, either, that's not on the table. But in the scenario where Trump is contesting the result, suggesting that he's the president, has some electors in the Electoral College who switched to him on partisan terms, then Pelosi would be president on January 21.\n\nJG: That's right. But as you pointed out before, there is a process. It's a surprisingly convoluted process that unfolds before we ever get to that point that would hopefully head it off - and zooming out here, you go from the states to the meeting of the Electoral College. But the really crucial step occurs on January 6, when the new Congress - presided over, as it were, by Mike Pence, at this point - certifies results.\n\nAnd it has happened, in our nation's history, that states have had competing slates of electors, different actors that the states have sent. There's a process - there's even a statute - that specifies how Congress debates and resolves that sort of contest: They break into the House and Senate; they come back together. And ultimately, even if there are really hard questions, really tense questions, there's still a process for sorting that out before we get to a January 20 that is a nightmare scenario.\n\nMH : But there has never been a contested election result in U.S. history, has there?\n\nJG: Well, I mean, there have been times where Congress has played the role you and I are talking about with a lot of argument and contestation. So, listeners may be familiar with the epic drama that Alexander Hamilton played some role in - maybe not quite as much as the musical suggests, but some role in - resolving where you had basically a tie, ballot after ballot in Congress, you had a tie until an abstention actually broke that tie.\n\nYou even had, in a much later election, a commission set up with some Supreme Court justices as part of it, to try to resolve a contested election. That was later in the 19th century. You had at one point, Richard Nixon, he was vice president, he was outgoing because he had lost to John Kennedy, having to preside over a session in which he allowed a slate of electors to go against him. It wasn't determinative.\n\nMH: But to be fair to Nixon, he did go out of his way to say: I accept the result - even though there were dirty tricks on the Democratic side, and our country is all about peaceful transfer of power. Even Nixon was able to say something that Trump isn't.\n\nWhat's interesting as a Brit, watching all of this here in the U.S., is, as you know, in the UK, Election Day, the Prime Minister leaves the following morning, the moving van is in Downing Street, ready to go. The problem you have is that you have this weird, you know, nearly three-month period where Trump is still the president and can cause a lot of damage just from the bully pulpit. People say: Oh, the Secret Service will get rid of him on January 20. But it's the period before January 20, where so much constitutional chaos can happen, and so much violence - God forbid - could happen.\n\nIsn't the problem here, Josh, there's a kind of arrogant U.S. exceptionalism at play here This idea which has been around in some liberal - even centrist - circles since before 2016, even, that Trump cannot do long-term or major damage to the U.S., because the U.S. isn't some developing country, some banana republic! It has strong institutions! It has strong democratic norms! What happens in other countries can't happen here! That was the mindset for a lot of people, until very recently.\n\nJG: I think there's something to that. And I think that's where having conversations like the one you and I are having right now, where we take something that, frankly, appeared unthinkable 10 years ago, 20 years ago, even as polarized as American politics was then, felt then, but still seemed unthinkable - and now, we think about it because Donald Trump has forced us to think about it. And then we take the next step of trying to figure out out the actors who can try to take Trump's abnormal rhetoric, abnormal approach to such things and sideline it, and get us back to where normal is. I think that's why we need to have these conversations ahead of time and why the public education function, which can help inoculate against that - all those tweets, all that stuff Donald Trump will say, potentially starting November 3/November 4, and for weeks to come, I think that's critical ahead of time.\n\nMH: So last question then, on that note, just throwing forward: If we managed to dodge this bullet - if Biden wins so clearly, that it's not even an issue - and if he takes office with a unified government, with a Democratic-controlled Senate and House, too, are there steps that he and his party can take, in your view, to fix things, to reform the way elections are run, results are counted, slates are approved, to prevent such a scary potential scenario from ever being on the horizon again in the future?\n\nJG: I think the answer to that is yes and no.\n\nI think there are things that can be done, from abolishing the outdated Electoral College -\n\nMH: Oh, yes.\n\nJG: - which, in some ways, is this whole mess in the first place, to clarifying statutes like the Electoral Count Act, the one I mentioned before that Congress used to specify how it should resolve certain election disputes, but is, in fact, very hard to read and interpret. So yes, they could do some cleanup there.\n\nAnd, at the same time, I don't want to succumb to the hubris, the American exceptionalism you rightly mentioned a few minutes ago, in which, at some level, this is about human beings, and the choices they make, and their willingness to abide by a system of rules in a system of law. And I think we both need to shore up our laws where we can, but we also need to use this Trump experience as a reminder that there are those who will come along and try, potentially, to break our systems, our institutions, our norms, and we need to stay eyes wide open and aware and resist that when it happens.\n\nMH: Joshua Geltzer, we'll have to leave it there. Thank you so much for joining us on Deconstructed. Thanks for your insight!\n\nJG: Thank you.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nMH: That was Joshua Geltzer, law professor and former member of Barack Obama's National Security Council, sounding the alarm bell, but also sending a signal of hope - what still can be done to prevent an absolute disaster come Election Day and beyond? However, since we recorded that interview, Donald Trump said this on Wednesday.\n\nReporter: Will you commit to making sure that there is a peaceful transferal of power after the election?\n\nDJT: Well, we're going to have to see what happens.  You know that. I've been complaining very strongly about the ballots. And the ballots are a disaster. And - and -\n\nReporter: I understand that, but people are rioting. Do you commit to making sure that -\n\nDJT: Oh, I know. I know. Yeah, no, we want -\n\nReporter: - there's a peaceful transferal of power?\n\nDJT: We want to have - get rid of the ballots and you'll have a very trans- - we'll have a very peaceful - there won't be a transfer, frankly; there'll be a continuation.\n\nThe ballots are out of control. You know it. And you know who knows it better than -\n\nReporter: No, sir. I don't know that.\n\nDJT: - anybody else? The Democrats know it better than anybody else.\n\nReporter: No, sir.  Mr. President, the second question is, will you also -\n\nMH: The President of the United States refusing, unlike his 44 predecessors, to guarantee a peaceful transition of power and suggesting he's going to win if you get rid of all the votes that go to the Democrats.\n\nI'm joined now to discuss this latest aspect of the crisis that we're already in by The Intercept's D.C. bureau chief, friend of the show, who's been hosting the show in recent weeks while I've been away, Ryan Grim. Ryan, welcome.\n\nRG: Thanks for having me here, Mehdi.\n\nMH: Ryan, when you listen, you've been covering presidents and American politics for many, many years now. Not that I'm saying you're old. But when you listen to a president say that in the White House to a reporter 40, 41 days out from an election, it's chilling, isn't it?\n\nRG: It really was. And far beyond his refusal to promise this peaceful transition was the part that you highlighted where he said, \"Well, look, you know, I have this problem with the ballots. You know, you get rid of the ballots. You're not even going to need to have a transition, because I'm just staying in office.\"\n\nAnd, you know, you could have The Washington Post fact checker dig into that statement, and you'd say, yes! No Pinocchios. If you do away with the election, then yes, the dictator stays in office.\n\nBut to have him so brazenly put that out there is certainly unlike, you know, anything we've seen in, you know, 200-plus years.\n\nMH: Yes, the Republicans have perfected the art of voter suppression for many years now. But this is the first time I've heard a sitting president for the Republican Party say, \"Just don't count lots of votes. Those votes don't count.\" And it's going to be a real problem, because on election night, he might be leading. Of course, when the rest of the votes come in, he won't be leading. And that is the crisis we're in right now, which I've been trying to sound the alarm bell about for 18 months now.\n\nJoshua Geltzer was very strong on it earlier in the show, Bernie Sanders, this week, also gave a speech saying this is a nightmare scenario, Democrats need to take it seriously. Do you think the Democrats have what it takes to kind of really be ready for this and fight back? If he tries to steal the result? As he says he will?\n\nRG: It depends on what you mean by Democrats.\n\nIf you mean some of the Democratic leaders in Washington? Probably not. But if you mean -\n\nMH: The Party's presidential candidate. The candidate himself, Mr. Biden?\n\nRG: No. No. But if you mean kind of Democrats nationally, then I think you are going to see a furious response. And I think the protests we saw in June, in the wake of George Floyd's murder, were partly related to a general anger at the system more broadly. And that system includes, you know, people who are stuck at home and angry but also angry at Donald Trump, angry at all of the kind of racial and gender inequities that he has exacerbated. And he's become a focal point for a lot of that fury. And so I do think that Democrats across the country will take to the street if they believe that he's trying to steal the election.\n\nNow, the way to prevent that, of course, is a landslide by the win. But absent that, I think the answer to the question is, Democrats themselves might be ready for it;  Democratic leaders might not be.\n\nMH: Crazy times ahead. A crazy election coming. It is a very rare, you know, there's that old Chinese curse, which isn't really a Chinese curse that says, \"May you live in interesting times.\" We definitely do live in interesting and, in many ways, depressing times.\n\nRyan, thanks so much for joining me on Deconstructed.\n\nRG: Well, thank you for having me.\n\n[Musical interlude.]\n\nMH: That's our show.\n\nDeconstructed is a production of First Look Media and The Intercept.

      "text": "With His Latest Lunacy, Trump Has Moved Into Nixon Territory - and Perhaps Beyond\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTrump's berserk claim about Martin Gugino, a protester shoved to the ground by police, recalls Nixon's musings about a horrific photo from the Vietnam War.\n\nIt's tough to determine the most bizarre thing President Donald Trump has ever said. But what he tweeted on Tuesday morning is definitely in the running:\n\nBuffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur. 75 year old Martin Gugino was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment. @OANN I watched, he fell harder than was pushed. Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up?\n\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2020\n\nThis appears to be based on a segment on One America News Network, the cable channel for people who find Fox News unbearably liberal. The segment is narrated by OANN reporter Kristian Rouz, a Russian who speaks in a delightful, heavy accent; Martin Gugino, he says, was \"show-vd\" by the police.\n\nRouz goes on to declare that Gugino \"has been referred to as an agitator\" and \"now reports say police departments across the nations must not repeat the mistakes of the Buffalo PD, falling for far-left tricks.\"\n\nHere's the first half of the batshit OANN segment Trump just tweeted. It alleges the 75 year old man assaulted by Buffalo police officers was an antifa operative, based on a report from Conservative Treehouse. pic.twitter.com/CeMVyJcoh8\n\n- Matthew Gertz (@MattGertz) June 9, 2020\n\nIt's tempting to dive into the details to demonstrate that the president of the United States was wrong to claim the sky is green. But it may be more useful to ask what this says about Trump's current psychological state, and how it compares to other Americans who've wielded the power of life and death.\n\nOn June 8, 1972, South Vietnamese troops dropped napalm on the village of Trang Bang. As Phan Thi Kim Phuc, a 9-year-old girl, fled naked down a road - her clothes had been burned off by the 2,000-degree jellied gasoline - an Associated Press photographer took a picture . The photograph went around the world, and immediately became a symbol of the war's berserk cruelty.\n\nFour days later, on June 12, President Richard Nixon mused about the picture in a conversation captured by his Oval Office taping system. \"I wonder if that was a fix,\" he said to his chief of staff H.R. Haldeman. \"Could have been,\" Haldeman replied. \"Because they got that picture of the little girl without any clothes ... Napalm bothers people.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nWhat we see here is the people at the summit of power as they actually are - not supervillains delighting in their barbarism, but regular human beings who, like many, can't bear to face the reality of what they do to others. So the immediate instinct of Nixon was to escape into a fantasy world.\n\nWilliam Westmoreland, a general who'd served as the U.S. commander in Vietnam, displayed the same predilection for psychological self-preservation. In a 1986 speech to Florida businesspeople, he learnedly explained that \"an investigation determined that Kim Phuc had been burned in an accident involving a hibachi.\" No such investigation ever occurred.\n\nIt wasn't just Vietnam, of course. In 2011, U.S. Apache gunships staged an attack in Afghanistan's Ghaziabad District. The administration of Hamid Karzai, then the Afghan president, received reports that 50 civilians had been killed, including numerous women and children, and many children had survived with burns. In a meeting with Afghan officials, David Petraeus, the U.S. commander in Afghanistan, shocked them by suggesting that the children had been burned by their own parents, in order to pressure the U.S. and its allies to cease operations in the area.\n\nRelated Buffalo Police Said Protester With Head Wound \"Tripped and Fell.\" Video Shows They Lied.\n\nAnd this behavior is obviously not unique to American officials. During Saddam Hussein's interrogation by the FBI, he was repeatedly shown evidence of his brutal actions. He generally did not attempt to justify what he'd done; instead, he simply refused to accept that he'd done it. \"Stories and tales have been woven\" about Iraq's treatment of Kuwaiti prisoners of wars after the 1991 Gulf War, he said . When the FBI screened a documentary about his suppression of the post-Gulf War insurrection, he declared it to be a \"propaganda film.\"\n\nBut the connection leaders have to reality can wax and wane. According to Haldeman's diaries, Nixon called him on Easter in 1973 to commiserate about the metastasizing Watergate scandal. \"Just remember you're doing the right thing,\" Nixon told him . \"That's what I used to think when I killed some innocent children in Hanoi.\" In other words, at this point Nixon was not telling himself fairy tales about his enemies hurting children to make him look bad. Instead, he took the more psychological healthy route of believing that he was responsible for mass murder, but that it was necessary.\n\nKim Phuc suffered grievous third-degree burns across her body. When the AP photographer took her to a Saigon hospital, doctors did not expect her to survive. She did live, however - and it appears that Martin Gugino will. Like Gugino, she has spent her life as a peace activist. So it's no surprise that Trump is desperately grasping for any explanation that his \"side\" does not casually hurt people like this. As the poet T.S. Eliot said , \"human kind cannot bear very much reality.\" Those who run the world can bear the least.\n\nWAIT! BEFORE YOU GO on about your day, ask yourself: How likely is it that the story you just read would have been produced by a different news outlet if The Intercept hadn't done it?\n\nConsider what the world of media would look like without The Intercept.

      "text": "The Espionage Axe: Donald Trump and the War Against a Free Press\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nFreedom of the Press Foundation's Trevor Timm, organizer Bill Fletcher Jr., and Dr. Krystal Redman are this week's podcast guests.\n\nAnother alleged whistleblower has been charged with espionage. This week on Intercepted: Donald Trump is set to shatter Barack Obama's record of prosecuting journalistic sources under the 1917 Espionage Act. Trevor Timm, executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation, talks about the weaponization of this law for use in stopping investigative journalism and the case of Air Force veteran Daniel Hale, who is facing 50 years in prison. Jeremy Scahill tells the story of the prosecution of Socialist leader Eugene Debs in 1918 and its echoes in the modern era. Organizer Bill Fletcher Jr. discusses the Trump administration's intensifying military threats against Iran, the ongoing coup attempt in Venezuela, and offers strategic thoughts on how to view the 2020 Democratic primary field. The anti-choice movement is making its most intense push to abolish Roe v. Wade in years and with Trump's new Supreme Court justices, the threat could become reality. Dr. Krystal Redman, executive director of SPARK Reproductive Justice Now in Georgia, talks about the spate of new laws being implemented in several states that seek to criminalize abortion and women's health care providers.\n\nQueen: I'm the Invisible Man.\n\n\"The Invisible Man\" (1933): He's invisible. That's what's the matter with him. If he gets the rest of them clothes off, we'll never catch him in a thousand years.\n\nDonald J. Trump: There was nobody that was in the history of our country more transparent than me. There has never been anybody so transparent.\n\n\"The Invisible Man\" (1933): Help! Help! He's here. It's the Invisible Man.\n\nDJT: I was transparent. I was totally transparent. But I've been the most transparent president in history.\n\n\"The Invisible Man\" (1933): He's here. The Invisible Man!\n\nDJT: I can't imagine being more transparent. There has never been a president that's been more transparent than me or the Trump administration. I have been the most transparent president in the history of our country by far.\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nJeremy Scahill: This is Intercepted.\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nJS: I'm Jeremy Scahill, coming to you from the offices of The Intercept in New York City. And this is episode 93 of Intercepted.\n\nMark Ruffalo [reading Eugene Debs' speech]: For in every age it has been the tyrant, the oppressor and the exploiter who has wrapped himself in the cloak of patriotism or religion or both to deceive and overawe the people.\n\nJS: On June 16, 1918, the prominent Socialist labor leader Eugene Debs delivered a speech in Canton, Ohio. In the speech, Debs argued against U.S. involvement in World War I and he praised activists who had been organizing against the military draft or had been convicted of sedition. At the time, Debs was one of the most prominent socialists in the United States and his speech came on the heels of the Russian Revolution and the rise of global socialist and communist movements. Eugene Debs had run for president four times as of the day of that speech. Here is actor Mark Ruffalo reading part of that speech.\n\nMR [reading Eugene Debs' speech]: The working class who fight all the battles, the working calls who make the supreme sacrifices, the working class who freely shed their blood and furnish their corpses had never yet had a voice in either declaring war or making peace. It is the ruling class that invariably does both. They alone declare war and they alone make peace. Yours not to reason why. Yours but to do and die. That is their motto.\n\nJS: Soon after that speech, Eugene Debs was arrested and he was charged under a new law in the U.S. that had passed just a year earlier. It was called The Espionage Act. Debs and his lawyers argued that his anti-war speech was protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution. And they lost. And Debs was sentenced to ten years in prison. The case eventually went to the U.S. Supreme Court where the justices voted unanimously to uphold the conviction of Eugene Debs. \"I believe in free speech, in war as well as in peace,\" Debs told the jury during his trial. \"If the Espionage Law stands, then the Constitution of the United States is dead.\"\n\nFrom his prison cell, Debs ran for a 5th time for president of the United States on the Socialist Party ticket. He got nearly a million votes, almost three and a half percent - the most ever won by a Socialist at that time. In 1921, President Warren Harding commuted Eugene Debs sentence, but he did not pardon him. Though he did invite Debs to meet him at the White House.\n\nCongress ultimately amended parts of the Espionage Act, but the thrust of the law has remained in effect to this day. Anarchist Emma Goldman was also prosecuted under the act. Julius and Ethel Rosenberg were executed after being convicted under the law.\n\nNewscaster: One of the greatest peace-time spy dramas in the nation's history reaches its climax as Julius Rosenberg and Morton Sobell, convicted of revealing atomic secrets to the Russians, entered a federal building in New York to hear their doom. Another of the spy ring, Mrs. Ethel Rosenberg, who with her husband was convicted of actually transmitting the secrets to Russia through Soviet diplomatic channels.\n\nJS: Throughout its history, the Espionage Act has been used as a weapon to attack free speech and dissent. And then decades later came the Pentagon Papers case where the U.S. government charged the whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg under the Espionage Act. He faced 115 years in prison.\n\nDaniel Ellsberg: How can you measure the jeopardy that I'm in whether it's 10 years, 20 years, 115 years, rather ludicrous amounts like that to the penalty that has been paid already by 50,000 American families here and hundreds of thousands of Vietnamese families. It would be absolutely presumptuous of me to pity myself in that context and I certainly don't and I'd be ashamed of myself.\n\nJS: The charges were all dismissed in 1973, mostly because of rampant misconduct and illegal surveillance by the Nixon administration. But it was this model, developed by Nixon's Justice Department that would be passionately adopted decades later as the weapon of choice of President Barack Obama to wage attacks on journalistic sources and journalism.\n\nBarack Obama: Since I've been in office, my attitude has been zero tolerance for these kinds of leaks and speculation.\n\nJS: Obama's Justice Department indicted eight journalistic sources under the Espionage Act, more than all U.S. presidents before him combined. Among these cases was U.S. Army whistleblower Chelsea Manning, former CIA officer Jeffrey Sterling,  National Security Agency whistleblower Thomas Drake, and NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden. In some of these cases, people were sentenced to lengthy prison terms. In others, the government ruined the lives of the targets.\n\nDJT: We're going to find the leakers. We're going to find the leakers. They're going to pay a big price for leaking.\n\nJS: Then Donald Trump takes power and immediately begins using the playbook refined and sharpened by his predecessor, President Obama. Donald Trump is now surpassing Obama's eight year record in just over two years in office. The first case Trump brought was against Reality Winner, who was accused of leaking a top secret document to a news organization. That NSA document related to alleged Russian intelligence operations aimed at breaching software systems used in some U.S. voting systems. Then FBI agent Terry Allbury was indicted for allegedly leaking information about FBI surveillance and informant operations to a news organization.\n\nThe government did not name the news organization in these cases, but other media outlets attributed the reporting to The Intercept. And then, last week, came the arrest of another alleged whistleblower, Daniel Everett Hale. The Justice Department is accusing Hale of leaking documents on the global assassination program and drone programs run by the Obama administration. This indictment also does not name a news organization but Trump administration officials - in leaks to news organizations - have claimed that it's The Intercept.\n\nI want to be clear here: Nothing I say here should be understood as discussing the specifics of the Hale case. And The Intercept does not discuss alleged confidential sources whoever they are. But I do want to state the following: Whoever provided documents for The Intercept's reporting on U.S. assassination operations should be viewed as a hero who did a major public service at immense personal risk. This whistleblower provided the most detailed account ever published of what amounts to a secret legal system wherein the president of the United States and his advisors make lists of people to kill, including U.S. citizens who have not been charged with crimes.\n\nThe documents published by The Intercept showed that at times as many as 9 out of 10 people that the U.S. killed in its so-called targeted assassinations were not the intended target. These documents revealed how the watchlisting system has spiraled out of control and how U.S. citizens have no right to know if or why they are on watch lists or kill lists. This was an extremely important and brave moment in the history of the post-9/11 secrecy and mass killing operations and the fight against them. Back in 2015, I discussed this on Democracy Now!.\n\nJS [on Democracy Now!]: Our source is an incredibly principled brave individual and you know, I worry because the government is, this government has been relentless in its pursuit of people of conscience who blow the whistle and has characterized them as traitors and spies and in the process has criminalized the ability to do independent journalism that is meant to hold them accountable, the government accountable without fear that your sources, or in some cases the journalists themselves are going to be put in the cross hairs of the so-called justice system.\n\nJS: We are at an extremely dangerous moment in the history of this country. Donald Trump is using the same rhetoric used by Nazi officials in the 1930s and 40s to attack the press. He has said that he wants to jail journalists who publish stories he doesn't like. And he is wielding the Espionage Act like a chainsaw against journalistic sources. What makes it all so much worse is that it was the Constitutional law scholar and Trump predecessor Barack Obama who teed Trump up, who laid the groundwork, who blazed the trail for this extremely deranged and dangerous man currently occupying 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.\n\nBut look at the way these stories are covered in the broader media. With a few notable exceptions, the lack of solidarity or just basic understanding of how dangerous these cases are is just largely absent. Instead there are attacks on the news organizations or the reporters. And for all of the talk of how dangerous Trump is to a free press, why hasn't the Reality Winner case been covered more extensively? Why is a CNN reporter who lost his credentials a national scandal and threatening alleged whistleblowers with 50 years in prison is a non-story? My colleague James Risen knows a lot about the Espionage Act. When he was a reporter at the New York Times, he fought the Bush and Obama administrations for some 7 odd years when they tried to force Jim to testify against an alleged source of his being prosecuted under the Espionage Act. Last week, Jim Risen discussed how many media organizations are covering these cases when he talked to Amy Goodman on Democracy Now!\n\nJames Risen [on Democracy Now!]: It's as if they're joining in with the Justice Department and the prosecutor in hunting down a bank robber or something. And so I think that's a fundamental flaw in the way the press covers these things is that they look at it as a crime rather than as an attack by the Justice Department on the press in the United States which is what this is.\n\nJS: Daniel Everett Hale is facing a half a century in prison for his alleged crime of blowing the whistle on a secret assassination program that regularly resulted in the killing of civilians, including an American teenager. None of this is about espionage. And it should be clear to every journalist in this country, to every person of conscience that what this prosecution is about is threatening anyone who even thinks of leaking, say, a Trump tax return. This is about criminalizing journalism. It is about increasing the secrecy and decreasing the transparency. It is an assault on the very idea of a democratic society. At these moments, silence is complicity. Everyone should care about what happened to Reality Winner and what's happening again to Chelsea Manning and what has happened to Edward Snowden and, yes, Julian Assange. And we should all care what happens to Daniel Everett Hale.\n\nThis is a precedent setting moment, not just legally, but morally. Because this is not the end. This is the beginning and they will eventually come for other news organizations. Or they will scare news outlets from doing high stakes national security reporting. It doesn't matter what you think of any of these individual whistleblowers. It doesn't matter what you think of The Intercept. But it does matter that we all recognize that this is an attack on our basic rights to information about what the U.S. government does in our names and with our tax dollars. It matters that people who blow the whistle on crimes and war crimes be defended and not abandoned or portrayed as violent criminals or traitors. All of us must ask ourselves where we stand. History will remember our answers.\n\nJS: Joining me now is Trevor Timm. He is the executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. Trevor, welcome to Intercepted.\n\nTrevor Timm: Thanks for having me.\n\nJS: Let's just start, your general thoughts about the latest indictment, the indictment of Daniel Everett Hale.\n\nTT: Well, first of all, this is the seventh prosecution of a source of a journalist in just a little over two years in the Trump administration. The Trump administration right now, is on pace to shatter the Obama administration's records for prosecution of journalists' sources. This is a huge threat to press freedom. Even if journalists themselves aren't getting prosecuted, this creates a massive chilling effect across the government bureaucracy when journalism in many cases has never been more important in holding our government to account. The fact that the Trump administration is targeting sources who have allegedly provided journalists with really important documents and stories that have been cited dozens of times by other news organizations, which have forced both the Obama and Trump administration to be more transparent about issues of foreign policy and national security.\n\nThe American public should be quite disturbed that they are taking it to this level and you can almost guarantee that this is not the last leak investigation or the last leak indictment. The Trump administration has talked about how they have dozens of other cases opened and virtually every major news organization in this country likely has sources that are under investigation now and it's possible that surveillance is being done on both the sources and the journalists. And this has far-reaching implications for press freedom in the United States. And I think it should worry everybody.\n\nJS: The charges against Daniel Hale could bring up to 50 years in prison.\n\nTT: Yeah, the Espionage Act is this Draconian statute from literally World War I. So, it's over a hundred years old. It was originally passed by Congress to go after spies and saboteurs.\n\nNewscaster: The Wilson administration under criticism as soft on pro-Germans, seeks and gets tough new laws suppressing freedom of speech and opinion.\n\nTT: And yet in the past few decades has been morphed and warped into this statute that ends up going after the sources of journalists. It was never used for this purpose in its first 50 or 60 years. In fact, the first Espionage Act case was Pentagon Papers whistleblower Daniel Ellsberg who faced over 100 years in jail.\n\nReporter: The latest indictment says, 115-year prison term and a $120,000 fine, the maximum. Are your thoughts still the same that you're willing to accept any consequences?\n\nDE: I have two thoughts about that. I go back to my earlier answer. How can you measure the jeopardy that I'm in whether it's 10 years, 20 years, 115 years, rather ludicrous -\n\nTT: But it's really just been in the past decade or so, which it started with the Bush administration then expanded to the Obama administration and now is really being used as a regular weapon by the Trump administration to go after whistleblowers who come forward to the press. The real disturbing aspect of this law is that it virtually offers no defenses to the alleged sources who are prosecuted.\n\nJS: What do you mean by that?\n\nTT: If you are a source and bring something to a journalist, maybe you think it is showing government corruption or illegality and the U.S. government considers it classified, it may be your only option to go to the press to get some accountability. Yet, when these sources go to trial they're not allowed to talk about the public benefits to these leaks. They're not allowed to argue that actually, this leak did not harm national security at all and it was a huge benefit for the public to know this information. They aren't allowed to talk about their motives for leaking. So you can imagine a whistleblower going to a journalist because they feel the American public wants to know this information. That is far far different than a government official selling information to a foreign adversary for profit yet these things are treated one in the same by the Justice Department. There's a famous story of Daniel Ellsberg when he gets on the stand during the Pentagon papers case, you know him and his lawyer had prepared for months to tell the jury exactly why he came forward with the Pentagon Papers and all the lies he had been seeing from the Nixon and Johnson administration.\n\nDE: Nixon is trying to throw the book at us. He continues to lie. The three areas in which he's lying today, this very day: Number one, he says the war is winding down. He says he hasn't bombed the dikes. That's a blatant lie. The Vietnamese dikes have been bombed.\n\nTT: And his lawyer asked why did you do this? The prosecution objects. The judge quickly sustains the objection and Daniel Ellsberg is sitting there speechless thinking I'm not allowed to tell the jury why I did this and so, this is what has happened with every leak case since. These sources and whistleblowers are not allowed to tell their story to the jury. The only thing that matters is did you have access to information and did you give it to a journalist? And if that's the case, you face decades in jail for some of these charges. And so, it's impossible for these people to get a fair trial. So, what happens is now almost all of these cases in the Trump administration end in plea deals because they basically have their hands tied behind their back. And so this process keeps repeating over and over again where the Trump administration can bring more and more of these cases.\n\nJS: One pattern that I've noticed emerging is that there is virtual silence from many important news organizations on these prosecutions. When Chelsea Manning was put on trial in front of a military court, The New York Times and CNN basically had to be shamed into coming to cover the trial by independent journalists like Alexa O'Brien, Kevin Gosztola, other people who were covering it. And The New York Times was one of the major publishers of Chelsea Manning's leaks through all phases of it: the diplomatic cables, the war logs, etcetera, and they had to sort of be shamed into even covering her trial. And then you have these cases where Reality Winner or Terry Albury or now Daniel Hale and you have this lionization of the Pentagon papers leak now, but those same publications who are happy to engage in the kind of historical celebration of their bravery seem to be completely missing what I think clearly is an absolute assault on journalistic sources and ultimately, journalism.\n\nTT: You're exactly right and it's infuriating and depressing, both the same time. Press freedom, in some cases, this is a good thing, has been in the public eye more than ever in the last two years because Trump is constantly going out there disparaging journalists and talking about how they're the enemy of the people. And while you know taking Trump's tweets and statements all together is a bit alarming this has much more dire consequences for journalists than anything Trump can tweet. He is using the awesome power of the Justice Department to go after journalists sources, to get their communications, in some cases, directly spy on journalists, and it gets barely a mention from a lot of journalists who often claim to care about these issues of press freedom.\n\nJS: It's so transparent and clear that with William Barr as attorney general, the Trump administration has a strategy now that seems aimed at blocking any attempt to leak about this administration. They don't want his tax returns leaked. They want nothing leaked. So, they dig up this case, they dig up from five years ago and clearly the Obama administration had decided not to prosecute it. It's not even that they care so much about what let's say, Daniel Hale did specifically, it does seem to be a weaponization of the Justice Department and these prosecutions aimed at stopping anyone else from leaking because hey, we're going to throw the book at you. You get 50 years in prison if you leak about Trump.\n\nTT: Right, exactly. I mean, you really only have to listen to what Trump says. I mean, you know, everybody is furious when Trump starts tweeting about journalists as enemy of the people. But look what he says around that. He talks about how he is furious with leakers. The FBI and [the] Justice Department have figured out that they can use technology to basically track everything that every government employee does. You know, we talk a lot about surveillance of the American people which is incredibly important, but the government is actually surveilling its own employees much more than anybody else.\n\nAnd when you know, you see these indictments and how they are able to track somebody's every move, what they looked at, what they printed, cameras following them around. It's quite scary, especially when we're dealing with a president as unhinged as Trump. You know, we want journalists talking to these people and journalists are talking to them all the time. So the idea that we should just you know, kind of poo-poo these indictments and use them to kind of take shots at the news organizations or journalists who are involved in them, it's just quite depressing because you know, we're not seeing the forest and the trees here. This is a direct attack on press freedom. We should be up in arms about it.\n\nJS: You read the indictment of Daniel Hale, I assume?\n\nTT: Yes.\n\nJS: Seventeen-page indictment. There have been media organizations that have reported that I am the reporter in question. And that The Intercept is the publication in question. And of course, we're not going to make any comment whatsoever about anything specific regarding this case and it's our general policy to not talk about any confidential or anonymous sources, but based on what the government is alleging in the indictment, what was it exactly that Daniel Hale did or that the government is accusing him of having leaked? What kinds of documents?\n\nTT: So it looks like from the indictment that they are accusing Daniel Hale of leaking to an unnamed news organization and reporter which seems to be The Intercept.\n\nAmy Goodman: In 2015, The Intercept published a special report called The Drone Papers exposing the inner workings of the U.S. military's assassination program in Afghanistan, Yemen and Somalia. The publication's findings were later turned into a book called \"The Assassination Complex: Inside the Government's Secret Drone Warfare Program.\"\n\nTT: And also the investigation into the government's terrorist watch list, which has caused all sorts of controversy over the past 15 or 20 years since 9/11, which has led to dozens of lawsuits where the ACLU in many cases has represented people who have been wrongly put on this list, whether it's the no-fly list or other terrorist watch lists where there is virtually no due process. Everything is kept secret and the people who are affected are kept in the absolute dark. And both of these investigations were incredibly important to understand the vast secretive national security apparatus of the United States and how it is ripping due process rights away from both Americans and people abroad. You know, nobody is arguing that this stuff shouldn't be public and that the government isn't over-classifying information and this isn't information that the American public should have access to.\n\nThese are really important stories. And this is actually, this is what all national security reporters do. They uncover things that the government is doing behind closed doors the American public deserves to know about. I mean, when we think about the classification system virtually everything that the U.S. government does in both the realm of foreign policy and national security, they consider secret. They consider classified and so they can use this Espionage Act as a weapon to wield. Then there's a leak that they don't like, they can go after that source, and then they can feel free to leak information that they so choose that is also considered classified to basically shape the narrative for how people see what the U.S. government is doing. And it's you know, not only just grossly unfair and even un-American to the sources that are affected but it really negatively affects, you know, the hundreds of millions of people in the American public who have no idea what their government is doing.\n\nJS: You know, I also think it's important to remind people how powerful leakers or powerful people who are sloppy with their \"operational security\" are treated. I'm thinking specifically of General David Petraeus who as far as we know was showing sensitive and classified material to someone he was having an affair with and, you know, he got off with barely even a slap on the on the wrist and it hasn't affected his livelihood. Hillary Clinton had a private email server where she had thousands of emails, some of which the government said should have been classified. Nothing, nothing ever happens as a result of that criminally, whatsoever. And then you have Reality Winner doing five years in prison for allegedly leaking one piece of paper about the 2016 elections and attempts by the Russian GRU to probe or cyberattack software systems being used in some states for elections. You have Daniel Hale facing half a century in prison for allegedly blowing the whistle on a global assassination program that existed with a parallel justice system where the president decided who could be killed or who lived on any given day. But that juxtaposition between official leakers, powerful people who do this kind of stuff and then whistleblowers of conscience.\n\nTT: Well, that's why these cases are such a total farce. I mean, think back to the Obama administration. They were claiming up until the very end that large portions of the drone strike program were totally classified, that they would barely talk about it on the record -\n\nJS: Obama's first mention was joking that he was going to send a drone to kill one of the Jonas Brothers if they came near his daughters.\n\nBO: Boys, don't get any ideas. I have two words for you: predator drones. You will never see it coming.\n\n[Crowd laughs.]\n\nTT: Right, they can joke about it but then when there's a lawsuit against them, they claim it's a state secret. Yet we read dozens and dozens of articles at the time about the drone strike program, which a lot of that information, the Obama administration wanted out and so they leaked it to the New York Times. They leaked it to the Washington Post or the Wall Street Journal. These classified leaks are in the newspaper all the time. Same thing goes in the Trump administration. There are hundreds and hundreds of stories in every single major paper that contain classified information. At the same time, it is both incredibly important that newspapers can report on this stuff but it allows the government to essentially use the Espionage Act as this weapon as they see fit. They will let the leaks go that they want out there and then they will attack and prosecute the leakers who leaked things that they didn't want leak, that puts them in a bad light, that shows how they may be potentially killing civilians or engaging in illegal profiling. You can go on and on down the list.\n\nJS: What can ordinary people do and what should journalists be doing in response to the weaponization of the Espionage Act and this assault on journalistic sources in journalism?\n\nTT: As we've seen over the past two years, journalists in some cases have brought this issue of press freedom to the front pages of newspapers. Unfortunately, it has largely been about Trump's rhetoric which again, can be dangerous especially when you take it all together when seeing that he for months and months and months, every day attacking journalists. Yet, you know, we have to understand that this is just rhetoric at the same time. These actions that he is pressuring the Justice Department to take in again, in his public tweets, he is talking about how the Justice Department needs to go after leakers. So we know he wants this. But the second thing the public can do more broadly is talk about the Espionage Act with your member of Congress.\n\nSo far, even though we have known that this has been a huge issue for 10 years now virtually no member of Congress is willing to go after the Espionage Act partly because it's called the Espionage Act. They don't want to touch it with a ten-foot pole. But this law is being used against sources of journalists far more than its being used against actual spies and it is in dire need of reform or repeal. So if there are a brave member or two of Congress out there who can introduce a law that actually separates out the actual spies from these patriotic whistleblowers who are coming forward to inform the American people, it is of dire importance. Because if it keeps going this way, you know, you can imagine a situation as the government surveillance capabilities keep growing that it may be virtually impossible for any journalist to talk to a source without them being immediately outed.\n\nJS: What are some organizations that people could contribute to that support whistleblowers and the defense of whistleblowers?\n\nTT: Well, I'm a little biased but I would encourage everybody to check out Freedom of the Press Foundation where I'm executive director. Our URL is freedom.press. We work on these issues day-to-day. We build technology for journalists to communicate more securely with sources. So, for example Secure Drop which is our whistleblower submission system that we have helped over 70 news organizations install and is in use all the time even here at The Intercept. We also give digital security trainings to journalists so that they can have the tools that they need to figure out how they can communicate more closely with journalists. Because when you look at all these indictments, you can see that the government can paint this incredibly detailed picture of everything a government employee does because they have so many avenues to surveil them.\n\nSo, it's more important than ever. There are several other organizations that support whistleblowers that I would encourage everybody to check out. There's a new one called The Signal Networks, actually, that is looking to not only provide advocacy for whistleblowers, but actually the personal support that they need whether it's legal support, financial support or mental health support. You have to understand that even when these people don't go to jail, you know, there are dozens of investigations that don't go to indictment but these people often are bankrupted by legal fees. They are blacklisted from jobs and their lives can be ruined even if they don't go to jail because the government decided to target them for the crime of informing the American public about an important issue.\n\nJS: Trevor Timm, thanks so much for being with us.\n\nTT: Thanks for having me.\n\nJS: Trevor Timm is executive director of the Freedom of the Press Foundation. I should note that FPF has at times received funding from our parent company First Look Media. You can find Trevor on twitter at Trevor Timm. That has two \"M's.\"\n\nJS: For more than a month, activists have been camped out inside the Venezuelan embassy in Washington D.C. They've called themselves \"embassy protectors\" and they are there in an effort to try to stop the Trump administration from illegally invading what is Venezuelan soil, territory under international law.\n\nMedea Benjamin of Code Pink and other activists from Popular Resistance and ANSWER Coalition are leading the demonstration. Outside the embassy, there have been supporters of self-declared U.S.-backed \"president\" Juan Guaido engaged in a counter-protest.\n\nBrian Becker: The Trump administration acting on behalf of the most aggressive element like John Bolton and Mike Pompeo is engaged in brazen -\n\n[Horn.]\n\nUnknown speaker: So as you can see what's going on is the pro-Maduro side tried to hold a press conference since the pro-Guaido people are here to use sound makers, bang on pots and pans and things to basically try to de-platform them so they can't hold their press conference.\n\nJS: The anti-coup activists have remained in the embassy, even after electricity was cut off last week, water was shut down, and activists have been arrested throughout this action for trying to throw food and supplies to those inside. The very few remaining activists say they have enough supplies to continue their action.\n\nOn Monday, law enforcement began a more overt crackdown to remove the activists. A trespassing notice was posted by the D.C. police, and the chains that kept the doors locked shut were removed. Police came in, and a two-hour standoff ensued. The result was that the activists are, essentially, being allowed to stay. Now zip-ties remain on the doors, and threats from the U.S. government and Guaido-appointed \"ambassador\" to the United States, Carlos Vecchio, are mounting. The remaining days for this protest appear to be numbered, as the activists expect an official U.S. Government order for their eviction to be coming imminently. Earlier this week, the activists released a video message from inside the embassy.\n\nActivist: We are expecting the police to come in and violate the Vienna Convention with their fictional government, their non-government claiming that we should leave. It's an unlawful order and it will be found that way in the future. But we have no choice but to obey an unlawful order and so we are going to be prepared to be arrested. We're not going to leave voluntarily. We came here to protect the embassy. We've been here for 34 days. We would stay longer, if necessary. We hope that this still results in an agreement between Venezuela and the United States to protect this embassy from the fake government, the fake coup, non-government that the U.S. is pushing forward.\n\nJS: As the attempted coup in Venezuela continues to unfold, the Trump administration is further intensifying its military threats against Iran. This is a policy being largely spearheaded by National Security Advisor John Bolton, who spent his career advocating war and regime change in Iran. The New York Times reporting this week that the career Boeing executive- currently acting as the defense secretary - Patrick Shanahan presented plans last week for sending 120,000 U.S. troops to the region \"should Iran attack American forces or accelerate work on nuclear weapons.\" On May 5, Bolton announced that the USS Abraham Lincoln and a bomber task force were being deployed near Iran. The administration claims that it has information \"that Iran was building up its proxy forces' readiness to fight and was preparing them to attack American forces in the region.\" That's according to The New York Times.\n\nNow, in addition to all this, Trump is playing an extremely dangerous economic game with China and with the economic health of the United States and its people, workers, families. But the Boeing executive acting as Trump's defense secretary also suggested this week in an interview with Fox News aboard a plane that he views China as a potential military threat.\n\nBrian Kilmeade: It's hard to avoid China, what they're doing in terms of a military build up. Do you look at China as a threat?\n\nPatrick Shanahan: I don't think we can ignore China any longer.\n\nJS: Joining me now to discuss all of this as well as the fight for the Democratic nomination for president is Bill Fletcher Jr. He is the former president of TransAfrica Forum; a senior scholar with the Institute for Policy Studies; editorial board member of BlackCommentator.com; and Bill has worked in union and labor organizing for many years. Bill, thanks for joining me on Intercepted.\n\nBill Fletcher Jr.: Jeremy, it's great to be back online with you.\n\nJS: How do you see this moment that we're in right now in this country?\n\nBFJ: Many progressive people in the United States misestimated Trump and there were even people that described Trump as a closet peace candidate because they took his isolationist rhetoric too seriously. And what we didn't appreciate was that isolationism is not necessarily progressive and behind isolationism can often hide very nefarious right-wing objectives and that's what I think we're seeing playing out. We're seeing Trump playing to his xenophobic base. When they think make America great again, well, part of that is make America white again, but we have to really understand it is make America \"Leave it to Beaver\" again. That is make it back in the 1950s with the predominance of U.S. power.\n\nSo, these threats are not only dangerous, they're completely irrational. The other part though, Jeremy is that dealing with someone like this, it's frequently hard to determine to what extent they're engaged in bluffing. Because when you look at this man's career in business, it has been a series of bluffing and bullying but this time it may go too far. There could be, let's call it an accident, in the Persian Arabian Gulf. There could be an accident in the Formosa Straits, there could be an accident near Korea that will unleash immense terror.\n\nJS: Who's driving this ship right now?\n\nBFJ: I think on foreign policy, Pompeo and Bolton absolutely. What Pompeo and Bolton, I think appreciate, and I use that word carefully is that they need to play into Trump's macho, his self-image. I don't know that Trump actually wants a war but I think that one of the things that he is set on is readjusting the table. So that's what I think we see in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that he's basically made a decision that he will in essence change the situation so that there is no going back. There is no real possibility for two-state solution because he will put things in place that at least in his mind are irreversible and for Bolton, there's never been a war that Bolton hasn't been ready to start. He doesn't seem to appreciate the consequences and frankly, I think the administration totally mis-analyzes Iran. But I also think that they mis-analyze Venezuela.\n\nJS: Of course, we now have seen this week that the people calling themselves the Embassy Protectors, peace activists, anti-war activists and some journalists were inside of the Venezuelan Embassy.\n\n[Protestors chanting.]\n\nJS: They were largely ejected from the embassy and it seems like the Trump administration is trying to essentially take over what is sovereign territory of Venezuela and hand it to their selected leader, the self-declared president of Venezuela Juan Guaido. What's your analysis of this situation right now with Venezuela and the symbolism of what the administration is doing at the Venezuelan Embassy in Washington D.C.?\n\nBFJ: Well, what they're doing is patently illegal according to international law. They have no right to enter into sovereign territory. But what's important, Jeremy, for the listeners to appreciate is that this is an administration that could care less about international law. They are operating in the mode of The Dirty Harry characters of the 1970s and 80s that Clint Eastwood played. The Dirty Harry character, Harry Callahan would point a .44 magnum at someone and say -\n\nClint Eastwood [as Harry Callahan]: You're thinking did he fire six shots or only five? Now, to tell you the truth, I forgot myself in all this excitement. But being this is a .44 magnum, the most powerful handgun in the world and will blow your head clean off, you could ask yourself the question do I feel lucky?\n\nBFJ: And essentially what Trump has been doing is pointing that .44 magnum at the people of the world and asking at different points do they feel lucky? Their pointing it at Iran. Their pointing it at Venezuela. One of the things that we have in our favor is that within the political class in the United States there is absolutely no consensus in favor of a war with Iran. None. This is not like the lead-up to Iraq. And in this situation, this is when mass movements and pressure on elected officials really can make a difference and it's not just about hitting the send button on our emails. It's about people being in the streets. It's about people doing the kind of work that was done as you mentioned with the Venezuelan Embassy. People showing up to make their presence known and to defend Venezuelan sovereignty. We need to be doing that on a much larger scale.\n\nJS: When you have a situation where a criminal like Bashar al-Assad is in power in Syria and is engaged in mass killing and you also have the United States, Russia, Iran, Hezbollah, Emirates, all playing violent at times mass murderous roles, how as an anti-imperialist, do you approach what the best strategic but also moral position is on conflicts where intellectually and in a real sense, we recognize these aren't good people in charge of that country, but at the same time, our hands are not clean? We are not the legitimate brokers of who should be in power around the world in part based on our long bloody track record of interventions for conquest rather than liberation.\n\nBFJ: So, I think in order to answer the question you first have to start with that one of the problems on the left in the United States and in the west as a whole is that after the end of the Cold War we did not have a paradigm or an analysis to properly deal with a very different global situation. In the absence of that paradigm, what was easiest to do for many people was to retreat into the earlier analysis, to act in essence as if nothing really had changed, that instead of recognizing that we were in a multipolar world with various actors, there was a continued belief in many segments of the left that that wasn't the case, that the U.S. was the only player.\n\nThe second thing was a U.S.-centered or centric view that essentially looked at anywhere that the United States showed up, it obviously had to be the main enemy. And this was the failure to do a real analysis. And that's one of the things that we saw play out in Syria that instead of understanding the growth of a popular democratic movement against Assad and the crushing of that movement that was done by Assad in alliance with Iran, with Russia and Hezbollah, there were too many of us that were searching for what's the United States role in that and assuming that the United States was the major player. And I think that that was a misanalysis.\n\nThe second thing is to understand in looking at a situation, you got to figure out who is the principal enemy? That's not a matter of principle. In other words, it's not that one enemy is always the enemy. If that was the case during World War II, there would have been no united front against Nazi Germany, fascist Italy and fascist Japan. It wouldn't have been possible because clearly you were dealing with powers on the west that had not been very positive, that had played a terrible role in the colonial world, but under specific circumstances, alliances change.\n\nThe third thing is that there's been a reorganization of global capitalism. It's fundamentally different. That we've seen since the 1970s the rise of this sort of transnational capitalist class where the interconnections of capitalists through production and finances is unprecedented and this leads to contradictions that exist within that class and between that class and different nation-state actors. Let's take Venezuela for a second. I've had arguments with people on the left who are suggesting that the criticisms of the Maduro administration, many of which I would argue are quite justifiable, for heavy-handedness, for retreating on many of the promises of the Chavez era, for corruption, etcetera, that these criticisms justify some sort of support for the opposition. And that sort of analysis ignores history. It ignores the historic role of the United States in Latin America. It ignores the issue of basic sovereignty.\n\nEvery situation needs to be understood within this post-Cold War global context. And the second piece, is that we have to look at each situation and understand who are the internal and external players and what role is it? Now, this gets complicated, obviously. Let's just look at Iran for a second. The Iran theocracy is the farthest thing one could imagine from democracy. It is not a democratic administration at all. It is highly repressive, repressive of domestic minority groups, of labor, of women, etcetera. It played a terrible role in Syria. And a very complicated but not very good role in Iraq. Now, in that situation the Trump administration is threatening Iran. Now, do we sit back and say because of these reactionary features in the policy of Iran that we either take a pass on the U.S. threatening of Iran or support it as some people actually did in the lead up to the Iraq War? I'd say no, we have to understand the broader feature here. That one can be adamantly opposed to the Iranian regime while not supporting the jingoistic policies of the United States, the provocative policies to the United States.\n\nJS: Hmm, you know, this is something that I think is also being debated in this Trump moment where you have many of the leading Democrats portraying Trump as the greatest threat to American democratic principles that has ever resided in the White House and, you know, on some issues there, I think it's very clearly true. And then on the other hand, you'll have some Democrats supporting Trump getting sweeping executive powers to spy, record-shattering military budgets, support for the Trump-Bolton position on Venezuela coming from none other than Nancy Pelosi. And I think that there is a concern among people who don't believe that the United States government should be the top of the world that the establishment of both political parties that there is nothing that Trump could do that would be too extreme that would take away support for the solid imperial agenda of the United States. It's crazy making sometimes when you say well what, where is the opposition party?\n\nBFJ: One is that we have to see the consistencies in what Trump is doing with prior administrations and one of those things is treating Latin America and the Caribbean as the sphere of influence of the United States. That is a consistent policy through every administration and so, Trump is going forward with that. I think that we can see since the 1970s in the western world, the decreasing parameters for democracy. The rise of anti-terrorism legislation and restrictions, restrictions on freedom of speech, etcetera. So as neoliberal globalization consolidated, we saw an accompanying growth of authoritarianism across the world.\n\nSo when we look at what's happening now and what you're pointing out that at first glance appears to be this inconsistency of Democrats both embracing and attacking Trump, I think we have to understand the consistency since this rise of neoliberal globalization as a whole but also with regard to U.S. policy in Latin America. Having said that, Trump does represent, in my humble opinion, the greatest threat to constitutional democracy we've faced since Nixon. It's not just him and his administration, but it's the support, encouragement that he's giving to a right-wing populist movement that is becoming better organized and in some cases armed.\n\nThe question that exists within the political class and within the economic elites is at what moment do you put the brakes on this guy? For the Republicans, the answer is pretty simple. You don't. That Trump is a blunt force object that they're using to move a broader agenda. For the Democrats, it ends up being more complicated because many of these Democrats remained silent during the Obama administration, during the Clinton administration's when there were undemocratic moves afoot, at a minimum tolerated and in other cases, actively supported. So there is both this consistency, but there are also these contradictions and it's important for us to play on those contradictions.\n\nJS: Lay out how you think progressives, leftists should be thinking about the upcoming election and the Democratic primary.\n\nBFJ: First thing is that we have to understand that what's at stake in 2020 is not just the presidency. I think we have to look at the entire down-ballot situation. The second thing is that Sanders and Elizabeth Warren are the most progressive and that one of the things that I love about this moment is that this is a great moment for debate. So, this is a time when it's important for progressives to get in and to be actively involved in helping to shape the discussion. We've got to get Trump out in 2020, but there have to be also the building of independent political organizations that are progressive, that are operating both inside and outside of the Democratic party in order to influence all of these elections, Jeremy.\n\nFor a number of years, a segment of the Republican party has been moving a very quiet agenda to advance us to a constitutional convention. That is where the U.S. Constitution can in effect be re-written. Now, once upon a time, many progressives thought that this was just simply a conspiracy fantasy, but it's not. Who controls state legislatures is essential for blocking that. So, we on the left side of the aisle have to be looking at all of these elections and in the primary period, what's great about it is where you really can advance a more progressive agenda that talks about vision, talks about where we need to be going and that's what we need to be doing and it necessitates organization. And we have to figure out how to identify and train the kinds of candidates that really represent the will of working people so that we're not simply encumbered by whoever the Democratic party establishment puts before us.\n\nNow, you know, I will say, Jeremy, that in November 2020, I'm prepared to vote for almost whoever on the Democratic side is running against Trump. Four more years will undoubtedly mean at least two more openings for Trump to appoint people to the Supreme Court. And as it is with the majority, the conservative majority of the Supreme Court, we may be talking what 20-30 years in order to reverse that. So, the presidential elections are going to be critically important and sitting back or voting third party, I would argue is simply not an option at this point. It's not about rational arguments with Trump supporters. Rational arguments are going to make no difference. This is a fight about power. On the Democratic side, it's much more complicated. And although both parties are led by pro-capitalist forces, within the Democratic party, the constituency base is completely different from that of the Republicans.\n\nThe problem though is that the progressive forces are insufficiently organized on the Democratic side and frequently are reluctant or unable to make challenges for power. Episodically, yes, but not in a consistent way and that's what makes it so important that at the level of strategy, we're fighting and building independent political organizations in the states where we're actually making challenges. Joe Biden at the level of the presidential primaries should not get a pass any more than Hillary Clinton should have. We should shy away from this issue of electability and recognize that Trump wasn't supposed to be electable. That electability is something about the nature of the moment, the mass following, how energized people are and levels of organization.\n\nSo, now is not the time for premature compromises and going for the okey-doke. Now is the time to build up our forces in order to advance the progressive agenda and to situate progressives were either it is our candidate that ends up at the top of the ticket and our candidates on the down ballot tickets or that we are in significantly influential roles to help to determine the outcome.\n\nJS: I want to thank you very much, Bill for all the work you've done over the course of your life and also for joining us here on Intercepted.\n\nBFJ: This is a pleasure, Jeremy. Thanks so much for asking me.\n\nJS: Bill Fletcher Jr. is the former president of TransAfrica Forum, a senior scholar with the Institute for Policy Studies, long time labor organizer and activist. He is on Twitter at @BillFletcherJr.\n\nSarah Weddington: Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court, the instant case is a direct appeal from a decision of the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The court declared the Texas abortion law to be unconstitutional for two reasons. First, that the law was impermissibly vague and second, that it violated a woman's right to determine to continue or terminate a pregnancy.\n\nNBC News: ...is the decision of the United State Supreme Court, it handed down a historic decision about abortion. The court said in a 7-2 decision that in the first three months of pregnancy, only the woman and her physician may decide whether she may have an abortion.\n\nJS: Attempts to erode and eliminate abortion protections have been unrelenting since the 1973 Supreme Court decision protecting a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy. In the last decade though, about 400 abortion restrictions have been enacted, representing more than a third of all enacted since Roe v. Wade. While many more states are taking steps to protect abortion access, a number of states are passing extreme abortion bans .\n\nAlabama lawmakers would ban the procedure outright. Abortion providers could face f elony charges and up to 99 years in prison. Last week, Georgia passed a similar bill banning abortions as early as six weeks, before many women even know they're pregnant.\n\nJoining me to discuss the implications of the Georgia abortion ban is public health doctor Krystal Redman. She is the executive director of SPARK Reproductive Justice Now an organization defending the full range of family planning options for Georgians.\n\nKrystal Redman, welcome to Intercepted.\n\nKrystal Redman: Absolutely. Thank you for having me.\n\nJS: So last Tuesday, Georgia became the latest state to enact one of these incredibly restrictive abortion laws. Start first by telling us about this bill that passed last week and the implications.\n\nKR: The legislators that pushed this bill were trying to really identify a point of viability which is something that medical professionals do and basically stating that at the point of a heartbeat, that's when a person can no longer receive or seek abortion care services.\n\nMark Strassmann: Georgia's new law shreds the standard set in the landmark 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. The U.S. Supreme Court established a woman's right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb roughly 24 weeks into a pregnancy.\n\nKR: Their definition of when a heartbeat is detected is up to about six weeks when we know at that point, there's no heart. What we're hearing in ultrasound is rhythmic fetal tissue, but it's not a developed heart. So there's all these potential medical concerns when you're speaking specifically about science. Outside of that, other potential implications are the criminalization of not just the person who is pregnant, but also the medical provider. It does not really clarify the difference between a medical abortion and miscarriage meaning if a person was to then have or suffer from a miscarriage is that person now subject to criminalization under the law?\n\nThey made an exception for incest and rape victims. So in that case, if a person suffers through the traumatic experience of their body being violated, now, we're requiring them to report the harm done to their body. We've asked in hearings so if a law enforcement person does not believe this person's story which we know is very common or refuses to report it or what have you because they may accuse this person of just perhaps wanting an abortion. So, like there's all these other types of criminalization that's going to be done to Georgians here that folks are not considering especially in relation to our maternal, child health outcomes as they stand.\n\nJS: Can you describe the existing landscape in Georgia when it comes to access to abortion and reproductive health care in general?\n\nKR: We already have restrictive laws as it pertains to just services in general. But with abortion care services, we have a Woman's Right to Know Act. So, there's already bans put in place that delays a person's ability to access those services as it stands. In addition to the pop up these we call them, crisis pregnancy centers, but they are also known as fake clinics that say that they're here to provide reproductive health services, but they're really put in place to try to deter someone from making that decision about their bodies if it even includes having an abortion. They have no medical license staff. So, there's all these different avenues that are regulating bodies here in Georgia and the government has inserted itself to play in the making of a decision about our own personal bodies and lives.\n\nJS: Is this a backdoor attempt to kind of goad people like you or other supporters of women's reproductive choice into suing so that it goes to an extremely right-wing Supreme Court with the endgame being abolition of Roe v. Wade?\n\nKR: It would be naive of me to think that that's not a strategy. But what we do know is that for every state that has attempted this, they have been sued and has been stopped in the local courts.\n\nDoug Richards: Georgia is one of six states that have passed heartbeat bills. Courts have already struck down two of them. Lawsuits are pending in three more.\n\nKR: Based on what has happened historically with other states that Georgia is any different, I think we will be able to stop this. Of course, we didn't foresee this, what we're going through right now, but I don't think this is a situation where this can carry on to a larger corridor or really just shift the decision of the Supreme Court Roe v. Wade. But our state is very conservative in its policies and its laws so, the hope and the pulse on the ground is that we believe that we'll follow suit after the other states and be able to stop this currently. But again, we are still on the ground. We are still strategizing about other ways to dismantle this, if in fact we're not able to stop it in courts.\n\nJS: And you yourself are a public health doctor and in response to Georgia Governor Brian Kemp signing this bill, you wrote the following: \"It is a forced pregnancy bill that denies a person their right to self-determination and bodily autonomy. This is a critical public health issue and if this ban is put in place, it will become an injurious public health crisis for this state.\" What are the public health implications of this bill?\n\nKR: Well, I would like to give a scenario. So, in Georgia, we have the worst in our nation maternal health outcomes including morbidity outcomes. So, in terms of obesity, in terms of high blood pressure, in terms of birthing outcomes, when carrying a child to term, in terms of all of these different medical implications that a person has just by nature of living in the state of Georgia, it's all high risk. One, we're a state that did not expand Medicaid. So we have folks that fall into the Medicaid gap meaning they don't have any coverage. We have a multitude of different counties here in Georgia that do not have gynecological services and do not have medical services. Some counties that have to travel up to a hundred miles just to receive emergency care services.\n\nSo in addition to that, you have a person that may be underinsured or not insured, who may already have pre-existing medical conditions that they may or may not be aware of because of their limited access to care, who then becomes pregnant and may want to decide an abortion but because of this law - if enacted in January at the top of 2020 - being in place now is being forced into a pregnancy that can cause additional harm to their body and potentially risk their life. This bill does not have any clause to discuss that true living example of a Georgian that what happens to that person then if they choose to decide to have an abortion, what happens to their health care then? So, that's just one scenario of potential health outcomes. But when you think about the landscape of Georgia, we have to think about all of the health outcomes of our state.\n\nJS: Now prior to working at your current organization SPARK, you were at the Georgia Department of Public Health and there you worked on creating a greater health care access for women around the state of Georgia. And ten years ago, Amnesty International, the human rights organization declared a \"maternal health care crisis in the U.S.\" and indicated, Amnesty International did, that Georgia was facing the highest maternal death rate. More recent reports suggest that that rate has not improved and that black women in particular, face alarming rates of maternal mortality and pregnancy complications. What do we know about why maternal mortality rates have risen in general in the U.S. and why these disparities in basic reproductive health care or basic health care for women of color, particularly black women are persisting?\n\nKR: We have to think about the demographics and just the data related to black person's in Georgia. And I won't just say black women because in this legislature, we have made this issue a very cis-centered issue when we know that queer folks, non-binary folks, intersex folks, trans folks also have abortions. Black folks living in Georgia have historically had poorer health care outcomes just because of the nature of their living conditions. You know, we think about social determinants of health and socioeconomic status and how these things directly affect a person's ability to live holistically and have full whole health. You also have to think about systemic ways of oppression that bears down on clearly, like black and brown folks specifically in the southeast.\n\nSo, I think those variables directly play a huge role in health care outcomes in Georgia. As I said before, because all those different dynamics, there's inequitable access to health care as well as inequitable access to health insurance. Now if you don't have access to coverage, how do you get coverage? Like how are you able to take care of your body? How are you able to get the diagnosis that you need to understand what's going on in your body as well as the medication or the treatment necessary for potentially pre-existing medical conditions?\n\nSo, for folks that don't have this access or have limited access to coverage to where they may have an element of coverage but it's too expensive for them to actually go to the doctor because their copay is too much or to actually pick up their prescription because a prescription is $100 plus when they only make $200 to $300 a week and have to live. So those are the dynamics of Georgians, of black Georgians here in the south. And I don't think it's just directly related to just black cis-women having poor health care outcomes. I think you have to look at the whole scale of what's going on in black and brown communities.\n\nJS: What strikes you about the way that abortion and reproductive justice or reproductive health issues are discussed in the broader media, debated in these state legislatures? What and who is missing from the conversation in your view?\n\nKR: I think the people who are centered in this legislation is missing. I think that we have a lot of cis, middle-aged white men having conversations and trying to make decisions about bodies that they are not familiar with, that, you know, they would never be able to carry a child in their body and deliver or become pregnant. But they are leading this narrative and conversation around protecting the lives of children and women in our nation and specifically, in Georgia.\n\nState Sen. PK Martin IV: Arguments about the rights and freedoms of women are compelling and they're not without merit. But they are incomplete and result in injustice and the oppression of the weakest people.\n\nState Rep. Ed Setzler: We've established the child, in utero that has a beating heart is a living distinct person that gets full legal rights under Georgia law.\n\nGov. Brian Kemp: We must protect life at all stages.\n\nKR: The narrative that's missing too is when we're speaking about children, when we're speaking about women, when we're speaking about people in Georgia, we're not thinking about all these other health outcomes that I mentioned before. We're not thinking about children who are in foster care systems that are being abused and under-resourced. When we're speaking about women, we're not speaking about incarcerated women. We're not speaking about how we can implement comprehensive health services behind bars.\n\nWe're not speaking about a multitude of different populations within Georgia. This issue specifically in the south disproportionately affects black folks. I don't see any black folks having these conversations or being brought into the conversation like folks on the ground, folks who have had abortions, folks that are a part of the reproductive health rights and justice movement. This conversation is centered on legislators. It's centered on folks who are creating these policies and laws who never, their lives never intersect here, which is very problematic.\n\nJS: Finally, Dr. Krystal Redman, what can or should people be doing to defend reproductive health care and abortion access and abortion rights? What should people be doing around this country right now?\n\nKR: I urge people to truly get involved at whatever capacity that they have. So, if it's being involved in different direct actions, reaching out to, you know, their local legislators, reaching out to their governor, whatever it may be. Making calls, sending emails, getting other folks galvanized is very important and truly re-engage back into the community so folks can really reactivate that kind of community-built power. Getting connected with advocacy groups such as our group or other groups that are more local to an individual. If you have the means to give financially to organizations that are doing this work on the ground too, as well because of course, with resources builds capacity which builds exposure which builds collective movement and power. So I think those are kind of like the marching orders for folks who may be listening.\n\nJS: Dr. Redman.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nWriter David Roth has been the preeminent chronicler of Donald Trump's presidency. In an interview with Jacobin , Roth talks about four hallucinatory years and what makes the deranged president at the center of them tick.\n\nUS president Donald Trump waves as he walks along the West Wing Colonnade  before departing from the White House on January 13, 2020 in Washington, DC. Mark Wilson / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nFor the past four years, David Roth's writing on the machinations and hallucinations of the forty-fifth president of the United States has been a genre unto itself. Roth, a sportswriter by trade, covers the subject like no one else: I often find myself sending his essays to family members and other panicked acquaintances because in a climate where Trump's every utterance is occasion for a new cycle of alarm, Roth reminds the reader that for all the damage the president is doing, he is not a mastermind, but rather, a television-addicted, attention-seeking moron.\n\nRoth's depiction of Trump's motivations always ring true. As he writes of the president's response to losing the election: \"This is Trump going out exactly as he governed - by telling someone whose name he'd soon forget to fix a problem he didn't care enough about to understand, and then watching television to see how well he was doing.\"\n\nTrump is a nightmarish creature, but a pathetic one, all vanity and ego.\n\nIn this interview, I speak to Roth about the Trump presidency - a combination of theatrically outrageous rhetoric and traditionally conservative policy - the Democratic Party, and the wind down that has followed Trump's loss of the election and subsequent efforts to, kind of, overturn the result.\n\nLet's start with Trump's election. You're a longtime Trump-watcher. But more than that, you seem cursed to have what reads like a direct line to his brain, which makes your writing on this subject so memorable. What did you expect when Trump announced his run, and when he won, how did you think his presidency would go?\n\nI never thought he would run, and that gave me a certain sort of confidence that obviously was not earned or deserved. I grew up in New Jersey, so I saw him on the cover of tabloids throughout my young life. Anytime I was in a store that had the New York Post , whatever divorce he was going through, whatever lady he was feuding with at the time, was the front page splash. His dumb face was the cover.\n\nSo I knew him as this guy who was supposed to be very rich, but was also this local oaf who was always getting into beefs. In retrospect, I think I really underestimated how much his cameos as one of America's richest guys, and then The Apprentic e, changed the way that other people saw him in the rest of the country.\n\nThat's not to say that he wasn't taken seriously, but I thought he was just an asshole clown. Not that he isn't that - he's done nothing to disprove that initial assessment - but when he said he was flirting with running, I thought, sure, he wants to be in the newspaper today, that's what he's always wanted for himself. But when he actually did run - and I remember this feeling especially during the GOP debates - I had this realization of how bad this was, that things could definitely go a way that I don't think even he wanted them to go.\n\nThe story, as I've heard it, was that he was going to run, and then he was going to drop out and say \"I could have won but I wanted to go back to The Apprentice .\" But then the show dropped him because the first thing he said upon announcing his candidacy was racist. At that point, Trump was like the dog that caught the car.\n\nDuring the debates, I remember all these prigs and dweebs, all these weird froggy governors that he was up against. And he was saying all the same stuff that they were saying, but much more clearly and charismatically than them. It's not as if his administration was significantly more disruptive than, say, Ted Cruz's would've been. In a lot of ways Cruz, or whatever goblin from the 2016 field you want to put in, would've done a similar amount of damage, but they were never going to be able to get past the guy because they're stuck saying these cheesy euphemisms and run away from their unpopular policies, and Trump doesn't.\n\nI don't think he understands the policies, but he also isn't capable of the euphemisms. So, there was a sense then that what seemed like it was shaping up as a sad, pantomime election of someone neoliberal and someone pretending not to be reactionary wound up being something significantly darker.\n\nAfter Trump won the GOP nomination, I remember watching one of his debates against Hillary Clinton with some friends. When it ended, I said I thought that Trump had won the debate and everyone got mad at me. This was in Boston, and the people I was with were on the Left. It seemed like it was outrageous to say that the guy who had lied on stage might be winning the election.\n\nIt's definitely not what you want. But I remember having the same feeling. I think I was rationalizing it right through Election Day because if you score it by who was more correct, or lying less, then of course, he didn't win anything, but if you go by who made a bigger impression, or who seemed more comfortable, it was a different story.\n\nSome of it has to do with Clinton, who felt uniquely weak to me. The metaphor is that Hillary was overseeded. It was all there - she was very recognizable and everything - but so many people hated her, and she wasn't offering people anything. That's who Trump can beat, less so in this recent election but in that one, where he was saying that politics is rigged but that he was saying to voters \"I'm going to cut you in, I'm going to help you out.\"\n\nIf you've ever been around someone like that, you'd know he was lying. But even if people could sense that he was lying, they felt that he was offering them something that Hillary wasn't.\n\nSo Trump wins the election in 2016. The past four years have been defined by his egregious rhetoric and policy around immigrants - separating kids from their parents at the borders - and early on, the Muslim ban, paired with traditional GOP policies, such as tax cuts for the rich and deregulation. How do you sum up the past four years?\n\nI've been thinking about this a lot of late because there's been a passive attempt to rehabilitate Mitt Romney, as he's been the most outwardly tremulous every time Trump shits on some norm.\n\nThe story I remember from 2012 is that there was some focus group, and they were telling the undecided voters what Romney's proposed policies were. The voters they were talking to didn't believe these were really his policies because he came across as a decent guy. But his immigration policy was Trump's immigration policy, it was about making life so bad that people left the country on their own. I think the term \"self-deporting\" was used.\n\nThe takeaway from all of this is that while Trump didn't sound like a traditional Republican or act like one - because he is too vain and because he wouldn't speak in that language if he even understood it - he is one. His is a theatrical presentation of a very familiar administrative brutality.\n\nI would think that an opposition party that was opposed to the party that governs like that would have been making hay off of that, and making the point over and over again that when these guys talk to you about \"options\" or, \"restricting immigration flows,\" what that actually means is camps. When they talk about \"creating opportunity,\" what they mean is cutting some rich person's taxes so they can invest it in some bullshit.\n\nBut that's not something that the Democrats have ever shown much interest in doing, at least in my lifetime. That's not a point that they've wanted to make. So I worry about the lesson of this era being lost: that as uniquely gross a figure Trump is, the grossness is mostly aesthetic.\n\nIt's about how he expresses this stuff and how he presents himself. You can look at the set of his face and how he carries himself and it scans as much more authoritarian and cruel than Romney or whoever else, like Tom Cotton or Josh Hawley, these preppy guys. Yet it's not a difference, really, and that's the important part of this.\n\nYou can't vote for somebody that seems more normal who is going to do the same thing. Either you abhor the things that he does, or you abhor the way that he acts. Both are abhorrent, and that's the point to make.\n\nWhat do you think that the GOP's next few years post-Trump will look like? There are competing wings: you mention Romney, who is one wing of the party, and then there's Hawley and Cotton, who are in a different milieu.\n\nIt's interesting that even Marco Rubio can speak the language of right-populism now, the idea of \"the people versus the powerful.\" All this stuff that Democrats used to use in this fairly insincere and facile way, now Republicans use that same language. You have to pin people down on what they mean by \"elites\" before you can know the specific way in which you're being lied to.\n\nBut I don't know where they go from here. In some ways, Trump getting as far as he got - not just becoming president but this movement around him that's far more passionate and devoted to him, not to any particular policy but to him and what he represents - is way more popular success than Republicans have had during my lifetime, or at least since Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe thing that will be challenging for them is that when it comes to Trump's fame and his show-business awareness, none of the other candidates have that. As much as they try, I don't think that Hawley or Cotton can be as aggressive and domineering in the way that Trump is.\n\nThat's central to his appeal as I understand it, that he's always attacking and insulting. He's relentless, he never goes to sleep, he never stops. That's his damage; it isn't a way you could pretend to be. I don't want to speak this into existence, but I don't think even Donald Trump Jr, for example, has that ability either, though he's one of the few people damaged in the same way Trump is, which is why he speaks that language more fluently.\n\nI think they're going to try to speak that language. It's going to sound ridiculous when some seventy-two-year-old millionaires starts saying \"Cry more, libs!\" during the debate, but knowing that something is ridiculous and seeing that it's ridiculous, doesn't means you can dismiss it. Trump was just president.\n\nYou recently wrote a piece with the headline \"How Donald Trump Jr is the future of Trumpism.\"\n\nI think he's the future of Trumpism as something that exists online and is dedicated to triggering libs and never logging off. Trumpism as an approach to doing politics is what Republicans have. It's that or going back to the mealy-mouthed American Enterprise Institute shit where you describe something that is not what you're actually proposing and hope that no one notices it.\n\nBut in the time between when I was assigned that piece and when I wrote it, it became clear that Don Jr is not quite a threat in the sense of running for elected office right now - at least I don't think he is. But I don't think that the future of Trumpism is going to be four years long either.\n\nThis is something that's loose in our politics, it's what conservative politics is going to look and sound like now. In some ways, there's something good about that, because you know what it is. It's saying what it is. But the problem is that you stop it from coming to pass.\n\nIt poses a threat. In the junior leagues, Madison Cawthorn is a great example of the young version of a possible future. But on the other hand, there are limits to how far this populist rhetoric and culture war can go, because the policies don't deliver to working people.\n\nNow, the wrench in that analysis is the conservative media ecosystem. That's an increasingly unhinged, self-enclosed world that is untethered from reality, and a lot of people are exposed to it all the time. Coherence may stop mattering so much in that context. Trump has accelerated that degeneration. Tucker Carlson is an example of this, QAnon is another example of this.\n\nI think that assessment is right. You're right that it's a parallel discourse. But the thing that is most salient, and most clearly explains Trump, is that it's also very abstracted. Trump wouldn't have been nominated, or even thought to run, if our politics worked in the most basic way.\n\nVoters from mainstream liberal Democrats to mainstream conservative Republicans have accepted that they aren't going to get much from the government. What it is then is a television show. This last election played out that way. Trump said, \"it's me, Donald Trump, your president.\"\n\nThen Joe Biden's thing, to the extent that he had one was \"I'm a good guy, I've been sad before, I know what it's like to suffer.\" However true that is or isn't, at that point you're basically picking the person that you want to watch on television for the next four years as they manage whatever version of decline we get.\n\nThe thing that defeats Trumpism and can undo conservative governance as we've known it over the last couple of decades is actual material politics. On the Left, it doesn't mean you don't need a top-to-bottom reimagining of society, but if people feel like the government is working for them, and it is delivering for them, then it's not abstract anymore.\n\nIf they say \"this is where I get my health care,\" or \"when I lost my job, unemployment insurance helped me get through,\" that can be enough to take the abstraction out of the equation and make it look more like what it is, which is choosing what the state is and isn't going to do for you.\n\nThe more perverse conservative government gets, where now the idea is the constitution forbids the government from helping you - which is the Supreme Court's big project now - that's infuriating. It's going to hurt you. And I don't think that's a point most Democrats are very comfortable making. That's one of the biggest reasons why this abstracted parallel discourse of politics is the one that exists in the mainstream.\n\nI wanted to ask you about the Democratic Party. Specifically, how you see the past few years and what you think the next four years with Biden will look like. I think we both agree that the Democrats don't pursue the material politics that you're talking about for the most part.\n\nI really don't know what to make of it. I'm astonished by their inability to do any kind of self-examination. This all comes back to a sense of abstraction. It matters to them because they want to have the presidency, since that kicks this whole patronage system into gear and then they govern to the extent that they're capable of governing, given the other constraints that will last however long.\n\nThere isn't a sense there that any of the lessons have been learned, let alone any urgency in facing the task of remedying it. I think that some of it owes to how old and rich and distant the people in the most powerful positions in the party are. But there's also an element of it that feels completely checked out from the consequences of this. As if it's just another industry and another character in this broad drama. It's infuriating because we're living in the damage that a failed government approach to a crisis can create, in terms of the sickness and suffering and death that surrounds us.\n\nThe answer to that is not to tweet \"believe science.\" You have to act. There has to be an approach that is about action - not just for reasons of winning elections, but because that's obviously what's right. The idea that you know we have no choice but continued decline and widespread cruelty writ large, that the only options are between a version of that which seems excited about it and a version of that which is sad about it, is an incredible abdication of responsibility.\n\nI think there are elected officials at various levels in that party that get it, but the institutional Democratic Party does not seem to be attacking these problems with the requisite level of urgency.\n\nIt's fitting that you used a sports metaphor earlier. There are differences between the two parties but as far as how electoral politics and governance in general are experienced by most people in the United States, it's not so different from sports.\n\nRight, and as with sports, you can care about it a lot too. I see this to some degree online, and to a certain extent within my family - I don't have a lot of conversations with them about their policy positions, but they're Democrats - that they are loyal to their team. They get frustrated when the team is bad, but it's that sort of thing.\n\nIt's like being a Jets fan: you already have all the hats, and you know the team sucks, that the people in charge are stupid and the guys they're putting out there are obviously not ready for primetime, but if you went to the trouble of getting a jersey, you're going to wear it.\n\nThe way sports are now at the professional level is a little bit different than they were when I was a kid. The thing that justifies baseball's antitrust exemption, for example, is the idea that it regulates itself, all the teams are going to be competitive because the strength of the product depends on it. If every team is trying, you're going to get something like a self-cleaning system. That's not the way things work anymore.\n\nNow, there's a third of the league tanking at any given time, another third of the league is so incompetent that it's sort of hard to tell what they're doing, and then there's maybe eight teams that are trying to win a World Series in a given year. The way that fans have come to understand that is that even fans of teams like the Cubs are going to go into this year, if the Cubs succeed in trading a bunch of their stars, and say OK, we're not going to try to win a lot of games this year. We're in a building phase, or we are in year one of a three-year tear down that will eventually yield a championship competitor.\n\nSometimes that works but at some point, like when you're cheering for payroll flexibility and some vision of what the future might be a few years down the road, you've accepted a shittier experience of being a fan.\n\nTo a certain extent, to be a hardcore Democrat now? This is an organization that was trying to win the presidency, but I don't get the sense that they have been competing in a way that suggests that they want to win a World Series. I haven't seen any sense that they're out there to get power, govern, and keep power. But who else are you going to cheer for?\n\nTo the extent that there are any alternative visions, this was one of the suggestions of the Bernie Sanders campaign: you're no longer just a fan, but instead there's the possibility of a state that works for you, you could be a part of building that project.\n\nYou could be a part of making that happen, and then benefit from the work that you put into it. How simple is that? The way in which the Democratic Party mobilized against Sanders is the most impressive mobilization on the part of that party that I have seen.\n\nAfter the Nevada primary, I wrote something for the New Republic about what was happening with Bernie. At that time, places like MSNBC were saying Sanders is the Trump of the Left: \"he's hijacking our party and he's making it seem like something that the party should not be.\" The point that I tried to make was that to the extent that that is true, he's the one candidate that anybody gives a shit about.\n\nThe reason that he's having such an easy time dispatching all of these bright, young things, or visible Democratic Party icons, is because he's expressing a politics that is pitched at voters and designed to improve those voters lives, as opposed to impressing donors or reliving triumphs of a generation or two ago.\n\nI really thought at that point that, in the same way that Trump's rise reflects a vacuum of ideas and energy at the heart of the Republican program, I really believed it was going to happen with Bernie. I supported him very much, and I was really excited for that. I thought OK, this is it; I suppose the Democrats could have prevented this if they did a better job implementing the policies that they supposedly supported, but they didn't.\n\nWhat you get now is someone calling their bluff. Obviously the most heartbreaking part of Sanders's defeat is we all have to pay a bunch of money for health care every month, but the other heartbreaking element was it felt like there was this faction of people who had this idea of what the state could do for you, and what this project was going require to let the country flourish. That faction was just overtaken by more of the same.\n\nBiden's ascendancy means there will be an attempt to put the lid on the political crisis of the past few years, both the growth of the Right with Trump and of the Left with Sanders as well. Democrats can't actually erase the conditions that created that crisis, but they can try to steer things toward a return to what they see as normalcy.\n\nThat's the part of it that I never really understood about the Democrats, as far as a long-term play - and it may not be a long-term play, maybe they aren't making one at all - but the idea that you're just going to turn the clock back to 2015 by having a third term of the Obama-Biden administration with many of your favorite friends administering policies that makes 13 percent better by 2030 for people in certain brackets. 2015 is when Trump came down the escalator. That moment made this one.\n\nTo turn the clock back to that one and then expect it to be different shows a striking lack of insight, and a lack of ideas of how things might be better. If they stay nibbling, and being stymied, and looking ineffectual, then even if it's not Trump himself again - although I do expect him to run again if he's healthy enough - then we're just going to have to do all this shit again.\n\nThe last thing I want to ask you is about the past few months. In your latest column on Trump, you wrote the following:\n\nThis is Trump going out exactly as he governed-by telling someone whose name he'd soon forget to fix a problem he didn't care enough about to understand, and then watching television to see how well he was doing. It's axiomatic that the man doesn't really understand what he's mad about; Trump never really knows anything about anything. As wildly irresponsible as his behavior has been since the election, and as queasy as it is to watch him flail and fume and feint his way through what is either an exceptionally oafish attempted coup or the single most tasteless fundraising gambit in the history of American politics, the spectacle has mostly just been confounding. All these endlessly bruited breakthroughs-to-come and all that clock-killing bluster collapses at some point into a defiant and incoherent sheet of noise. Nothing about Trump ever improves or even changes; the end was always going to be a parodic reprise of the beginning.\n\nSo there are, first, the efforts to change the election outcome, to discard votes in certain places while adding votes in others, with these efforts being led by the likes of Rudy Giuliani. These are earnest attempts to overturn the election but in a half-assed way, led by incompetent people.\n\nHow do you make sense of all this when combined with the fact that Trump didn't push to send out a new round of checks before the election, which would have possibly won him the election?\n\nI think it would have won him the election too. This is a lesson that you literally have to be a high-ranking member of the DNC not to get: when people got checks from the government with the stupid letter that said, basically, \"From Donald J. Trump, don't spend it all in one place,\" that's governing, it's giving people what they need. That really did help people, and it was understood as coming from Trump.\n\nHim not pushing on the checks may be because the institutional Republican Party thought they were out of luck at that point; as a general rule, they air on the side of not giving people money, as a general principle. They might have felt they'd gotten as much from Trump as they could, or they were simply exhausted by all of it, much like a majority of American voters were.\n\nThat's why this attempt to overturn the election is being run by weirdos, Giuliani and so on. If they were close enough, if this was the sort of thing where they could've done something like Bush vs. Gore - if it was about changing the outcome in one state, getting one thing to happen - the guys the GOP has dispatched to win cases like that in the past would've tried it.\n\nIn this case, because Trump didn't run strong enough, the things they were asking for were contradictory: in one state, you want to stop the vote, in another you want to audit it, you want to disqualify votes and add votes. It's an incoherent argument, and I don't think the long-time lions of reactionary lawfare want to pursue that, because they'd lose.\n\nGiuliani and the true believers who have slotted in below him in that hierarchy just want to be on television, which is an appropriate end to this moment. The big takeaway for Democrats about Trump is how coarse his approach was, personally and politically, and what a bad guy he was. And none of that is exactly wrong: it was a hugely corrupt administration and they looted and subverted institutions for four years. But that corruption was never a point that the Democrats seemed especially inclined to make.\n\nBut that's how you wind up here: everyone bailed on it, while Giuliani continues receiving his billable hours. They never believed in anything beyond enriching themselves and at this point, everyone but Trump has realized that they've gotten as much out of it as they're going to get right now.\n\nDavid Roth is a cofounder and co-owner of Defector Media.\n\nAlex N.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOne of Karl Marx's most persistent points, from \"On the Jewish Question\" forward, is that despite the formal freedoms that we enjoy in a liberal state - the right to freedom of speech, for example, or freedom of religion - we are socially and in fact unfree. (As Bruno Leipold reports in his Citizen Marx , a lot of Marx's evidence for this claim, particularly about religion, came from travelers' reports to America, which Marx read assiduously.) That is what it means to live in a liberal society, says Marx: formally free, actually unfree.\n\nBut lately I've been wondering whether we are not living in the reverse. Despite the efforts of right-wingers to bend the state in a repressive, less free direction, society seems more and more resistant to these efforts. Producing a situation that is, in some sense, the mirror image of what Marx described.\n\nWhen I compare the current moment, since Donald Trump first rose to power, to previous moments of political repression and coercion and intimidation, it's hard not to conclude that, at both the national and the state and local levels, this may be the weakest, most flailing effort to control society and individual and collective behavior in American history.\n\nThere are, of course, a lot of crosscutting tendencies in the current moment, with facts pointing in contradictory directions and eliciting multiple interpretations. But any full account of the right-wing mobilization of the last ten years has to take into account facts such as these (and there are others one could point to):\n\nAnd now, this morning, this , from the New York Times :\n\nDespite book bans and other forms of pressure from policymakers and politically engaged parents, there are signs that many teachers are able to ignore - or subtly complicate - mandates to address race, gender and U.S. history in proscribed ways. Only a quarter of teachers have reported that restrictive laws influenced their choice of curriculum materials or instructional practices, according to RAND.\n\nBut the experiences of Mr. Collins and Mr. Gallegos show how difficult it can be for politicians to control public school curriculums. The American education system is \"radically decentralized\" in the words of one historian. Local schools and even individual teachers are often left to work independently, choosing their own curriculum materials and writing their own lesson plans - a structure that could restrain President Donald J. Trump in his second term.\n\nI've obviously taken a strong position over the last eight years in the various debates about fascism and authoritarianism and Trump. But one persistent issue that I've not seen addressed in these debates, one that transcends a lot of the discussion and its terms, is how state capacity and political capacity have been transformed during the last half-century (mostly by the forces of neoliberalism, but also by various cultural shifts) that make the kind of older projects of political repression and state coercion a bit more complicated and variegated than they might once have been. There are exceptions to this rule: the most obvious ones being the suppression of the debate over Palestine and the mobilization against trans people. These all need to be part of our analysis. But the resulting portrait may be more complicated than many of the recent accounts suggest.\n\nOr, as Marx says in The Civil War in France , \"[I]t is generally the fate of completely new historical creations to be mistaken for the counterpart of older and even defunct forms of social life.\"\n\nCorey Robin is the author of The Reactionary Mind: Conservatism from Edmund Burke to Donald Trump and a contributing editor at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Unless we take action, Trump might heed their advice - and enormous numbers of people could die as a result.\n\nUS president Donald Trump speaks at the daily coronavirus briefing in the James Brady Press Briefing Room at the White House on March 22, 2020 in Washington, DC.\nTasos Katopodis / Getty\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nLast week, the Wall Street Journal editorial board argued for quickly lifting social-distancing health measures because these were hurting \"the economy\" - i.e., corporate profits. On Sunday, Goldman Sachs chairman Lloyd Blankfein echoed this call. And now it appears that the White House may be willing to heed their advice: On Sunday evening, President Trump announced that he'll soon consider lifting our country's already inadequate social-distancing measures.\n\nIt's hard to imagine a starker illustration of the contradiction between public health needs and capitalist profit-making. The US government's too-delayed, too-limited response to the coronavirus potentially put millions of lives at risk. For weeks, Trump downplayed the virus and delayed taking action because he didn't want to take any measures that might disrupt the economy. As the New York Times reports , \"only when the disruption came anyway, in the form of a historic stock market sell-off, was he convinced to act.\"\n\nThose delays have cost countless lives. We have now reached the point where, according to some experts, only a five-week national lockdown can avoid a public health catastrophe. Yet the Wall Street Journal and the Lloyd Blankfeins of the world are proposing the exact opposite: ending lockdowns rather than extending them. Even the limited governmental measures taken so far are apparently too much for Wall Street to stomach.\n\nVice President Pence disclosed yesterday that some people exposed to the virus will soon be allowed to return to work if they wear masks. And according to Trump ,\n\nWE CANNOT LET THE CURE BE WORSE THAN THE PROBLEM ITSELF. AT THE END OF THE 15 DAY PERIOD, WE WILL MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHICH WAY WE WANT TO GO!\n\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 23, 2020\n\nThis disregard for public health is being sold through rhetoric about protecting the livelihoods of ordinary Americans. As the Wall Street Journal editorial put it,\n\nIf this government-ordered shutdown continues for much more than another week or two, the human cost of job losses and bankruptcies will exceed what most Americans imagine. This won't be popular to read in some quarters, but federal and state officials need to start adjusting their anti-virus strategy now to avoid an economic recession that will dwarf the harm from 2008-2009.\n\nIt's true that a looming pandemic-induced economic depression could inflict tremendous damage upon millions across this country and the world. But allowing the virus to continue to spread not only threatens the physical survival of these very same people - failing to flatten the curve could result in the breakdown of essential supply chains and even deeper economic and social crisis.\n\nBillionaire rhetoric about protecting jobs is a smokescreen. There's no reason to believe that the Wall Street Journal , Goldman Sachs, or Donald Trump actually care about the well-being of ordinary Americans. If they did, they would have already supported Bernie Sanders's plan to issue monthly cash payments of $2,000 to every person in this country and grant paid sick leave to all, or propose something like the United Kingdom's plan to cover 80 percent of all citizens' income.\n\nInstead, corporations are profiteering off the crisis and the Republicans are proposing a trillion-plus bailout for corporate America.\n\nThey don't care if we lose our jobs - and they don't care if we die. As always, all that matters for them is their bottom line.\n\nIf Trump or Wall Street actually cared about us, they would have already advocated using the Defense Production Act to ensure that large industries immediately start producing the masks, ventilators, and protective equipment we so desperately need to avoid a health catastrophe in the coming weeks. Instead, the president at Sunday's press conference explicitly rejected this proposal, arguing that \"the concept of nationalizing our businesses is not a good concept.\" He left out who exactly it's not good for: capitalists and their profits.\n\nUnless we take action , Wall Street may get its way. Stopping Trump from scrapping our existing public health measures is literally a matter of life and death. We need to do everything possible to force the White House and its corporate backers to take the urgent measures that experts agree are necessary to prevent a public health catastrophe.

In four years, Donald Trump has systematically destroyed that mystique.\n\nSupporters watch a video of US president Donald Trump while waiting in a cold rain for his arrival at a campaign rally at Capital Region International Airport October 27, 2020 in Lansing, Michigan.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nBy the mid-eighteenth-century, the absolutist system of monarchy painstakingly constructed during the reign of Louis XIV was showing serious signs of decay.\n\nUndoubtedly, humiliations in foreign policy, domestic grain shortages, and clashes with the landed nobility all served to discredit the regime of the Sun King's hapless successor. But decades before the national debt crisis that precipitated the revolutionary overthrow of the monarchy, the French state was already facing a catastrophic loss of legitimacy personified by the royal figurehead himself. Domestic failures and military defeats notwithstanding, Louis XV's private life and sexual indiscretions also became the stuff of eighteenth-century tabloid fodder. The personal compounding the political, the king increasingly lacked the capacity to project the aura of divinity from which the country's entire system of government drew its authority - gradually withdrawing from the public rites and religious ceremonies that consecrated his rule.\n\nAfter 1739, when his mistresses became visible at court, Louis discontinued the long-standing practice of touching people with scrofula. By 1750, he had ceased to attend grand masses or conduct ceremonial entrées to Paris. Literally and figuratively, the king had lost the royal touch, and with it a critical link to the people he ruled. In subsequent decades, the process of desacralization was accelerated by a boom in subversive literature that denigrated the royal court and depicted leading figures like Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette as sexually depraved perverts. Amid intellectual ferment, economic stagnation, and unrelenting political turmoil, French subjects, as historian Sarah Maza puts it , experienced an \"acute sense of moral void and social dissolution,\" feeling \"dangerously adrift in a world\" without its \"traditional sacred center.\"\n\nAt precisely the moment its ability to competently execute basic state functions was thrown into crisis, the symbolic legitimacy of the Bourbon dynasty - and the system over which it presided - had collapsed.\n\n\"He became president of the United States in that moment, period . . . For people who had been hoping he would become unifying, hoping that he might find some way to become presidential, they should be happy with that moment.\"\n\nThe occasion was late February 2017, and Donald J. Trump, former host of TV's The Apprentice , had just given his inaugural State of the Union address in his newly assumed role as president of the United States. The remark, belonging to liberal CNN commentator and former Obama administration special adviser Van Jones, referred to a moment in the speech when Trump had recognized a Navy SEAL killed during a raid in Yemen and paid tribute to his attending widow.\n\nInsipid pundit babble though it was, Jones's comment nevertheless had an accidental eloquence in context. The Yemen operation had, after all, been Trump's first as commander in chief of America's military. In addition to costing SEAL William Ryan Owens his life, fourteen people dubbed \"militants\" by authorities at the Pentagon had been killed alongside some ten women and children. Worse still, at least from the point of view of some mainstream commentators, the raid had been deemed a military failure, and Trump had off-loaded responsibility for Owens's death onto his generals.\n\nIn applauding the president's tribute, Jones was thus signaling his relief that, in spite of everything, the country's unlikely new leader could look sufficiently \"presidential\" to preside over imperial slaughter, then varnish the act with treacly jingoism on national TV. Having decried the result of November's election as a \"whitelash against a changing country,\" Jones would now attempt to take solace from his own strained assurance that, however fleetingly, Trump appeared capable of executing the symbolic function demanded of a US president.\n\nNotwithstanding Jones's justly mocked comment, Trump never succeeded in projecting the \"presidential\" aura that so many traumatized denizens of official Washington hoped for in the administration's early months. Playing to his political strengths, Trump has happily continued the postmodern carnival barker routine he first pioneered on network TV, eagerly insulting opponents, attacking supposedly nonpartisan figures, and transgressing against norms of civility on a daily basis. (To the particular ire of his liberal and centrist critics, he has even continued to binge-watch cable news and tweet in his own now-iconic vernacular.)\n\nBefore and since the 2016 election, the threat posed by Trump to the office and reputation of the presidency has been a major preoccupation driving the bipartisan backlash against him, with moral and ideological outrage revealingly taking a back seat to the endless fixation with his personality and temperament. Both Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush , two of Trump's loudest and least effective political opponents, opted to make character the central theme of their campaigns, and their defeats somehow did little to dissuade others from emulating their approach. Though the relentless incompetence of Trump's mainstream opponents is certainly one explanation, another is that America's elite implicitly recognizes the symbolic disruption wrought by his continued presence in the Oval Office.\n\nAs the symbol that consecrates the American political order, the presidency necessarily draws on myths that must be maintained for its semiotic function to persist: myths of personal virtue, technocratic competence, democratic equality, and, above all, a culture defined by meritocracy in which the very best inevitably rise to the top. Though mainstream outrage toward Trump often expresses itself in the language of propriety, a major subtext has always been a sense that the presidency will be diminished - his capture of the office working to overturn each and every one of its foundational myths.\n\nTechnocratic competence? Before 2016, Trump had never wielded political power and had far more crash-and-burn enterprises under his belt than genuine successes. Democratic equality? Trump visibly relishes hierarchy and partly became famous by theatrically telling people, \"You're fired!\" on national TV. Personal virtue? His private life had been the stuff of tabloid fodder for decades, and a more cruelly vindictive person can scarcely be imagined outside the realm of fiction. Tying it all together, Trump has exposed the lie of meritocracy in twenty-first-century America by demonstrating that wealth does, in fact, supersede everything else - talent, professionalism, and personal virtue are not actually prerequisites for those in high office.\n\nIf the country's imperial figurehead can really be this transparent huckster of a man, the average person may start to wonder whether the whole thing is a con. As Jodi Dean wrote in 2016:\n\nDonald Trump cuts through the ideological haze of American politics and exposes its underlying truth . . . Where other candidates appeal to a fictitious unity or pretense of moral integrity, he displays the power of inequality. Money buys access - why deny it? . . . This expression demonstrates the truth of economic inequality: civility is for the middle class, a normative container for the rage of the dispossessed and the contempt of the dispossessors. The .1 % need not pretend to care.\n\nThe symbolic disruption wrought by Trump thus expresses the wider crisis of a society whose structuring myths have grown increasingly distant from its lived realities for all but a privileged few. Faced with imperial decline, faltering living standards, cultural polarization, economic crisis, and ossified political institutions, American elites have continued to offer the same old fables of national exceptionalism and a brighter future awaiting just over the nearest horizon. In the figure of Joe Biden, Democrats, liberals, and their conservative allies hope to restore a pristine image to the office tarnished by Donald Trump, incorrectly holding him to be the cause of the country's ills rather than a mere symptom of them.\n\nShould Biden prevail on November 3, he may briefly assume the symbolic aura demanded by America's bipartisan establishment. Certain to take office in a country even sicker than the one that produced Donald Trump, the sheen is unlikely to last for long.\n\nLuke Savage is a staff writer at Jacobin .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

It's a little late for him to be posing now as a defender of democracy and a counter to Trump's authoritarianism.\n\nUS President Donald Trump and Vice President Mike Pence at the White House in April. (Drew Angerer / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nWhen Mike Pence announced Wednesday morning that he did not have the power to stop the transfer of presidential power from loser to victor, many outside the QAnon community rightly breathed a sigh of relief. The vice president had reached his limit; like most Americans, he'd had it with Donald Trump's nonsense. By afternoon, Trump's rage over Pence's refusal to aid his anti-democratic plot led him to incite his fans to storm the Capitol, which they did. The day ended with Pence cowering in a secret location and phoning the Pentagon.\n\nNews outlets are reporting that Pence is \"angry\" at Trump. Good grief. Now he's angry, just because his own narcissism has been injured by Trump's taunts? These two have deserved each other along.\n\nYesterday, Newt Gingrich called the eerily blank-eyed Ken Doll of a VP a \"profile in courage.\" Is he kidding?\n\nActually, Wednesday was a fitting coda to Mike Pence's disgraceful career: hiding from armed fascists and feigning shock at the authoritarian antics of the clown he's been faithfully serving for four years like a well-trained dog. No doubt he (reasonably) fears for his life, with the wrath of Trump's militias and random crazies upon him. He deserves whatever distress he's suffering right now and more. Mike Pence has spent his life enabling the rise of the far right and these remarkably unappealing chickens have now come home to roost, as Malcolm X would have noted. Or, to put it in language that the evangelical Pence might find more relatable: a man reaps what he sows.\n\nAfter all, Pence has been a dedicated enemy of democracy for even longer than Trump. Before he became Donald J. Trump's loyal silent butler, Mike Pence was a supporter of the Tea Party movement and a fully owned subsidiary of the Koch brothers. As Jane Mayer of the New Yorker has reported, the billionaire Koch family, highly organized in waging a conservative class war from above - specifically through policy, has been funding foot soldier Pence since he was in Congress. He did their bidding there, organizing other lawmakers to sign onto their \"No Climate Tax\" pledge. Even Steve Bannon reportedly expressed worry about Pence being so close in the presidential succession: \"I'd be concerned he'd be a president the Kochs would own.\"\n\nThis is surely true, and yet another reason to cheer the passing of the Trump/Pence administration. As governor of Indiana, a job he held from 2013 to 2017, Pence presided over the largest tax cut in Indiana's history, and the austerity that followed. While in Congress, he passionately opposed raising the minimum wage and even opposed rescuing the auto industry.\n\nMike Pence is one of those American conservatives who sees no contradiction between extreme \"economic freedom\" and social repression. Their brand of Christianity is harsh; they like the free market because it is punitive. Some might read the Bible and see Jesus as a peaceful, gentle, and forgiving hippy, but people like Pence dislike that version of Jesus. They want our lives to be an unending Book of Job, a hell on earth: no sex without procreation and no moment's rest from the struggle to make ends meet.\n\nWomen's rights are a cornerstone of civilization. Without gender equality, there is no real democracy, and every private home is a potential dictatorship. As governor of Indiana, Pence did his best to realize this dystopian vision, among other things by signing bills restricting abortion. He even attracted criticism from moderate Republicans by approving a religious freedom law that enables a wide range of bigoted corporate behavior. The law was rightly seen as giving carte blanche to companies to discriminate against LGBT workers, and objections from the business world (and, especially, from the National Collegiate Athletic Association) forced Pence to sign another bill strengthening protections for LGBT rights.\n\nPence may have tried to look like the adult in the room Wednesday, but the debacle was entirely his own fault. He may find these rioting chuds distasteful, but he's not much better than they are and has been helping out their cause for years. Even if he does end up using the 25th Amendment to prevent Trump from serving the remaining days of his term, it will be too little, too late, and won't make him any less complicit in Trump's latest assault on democracy.\n\nLiza Featherstone is a columnist for Jacobin , a freelance journalist, and the author of Selling Women Short: The Landmark Battle for Workers' Rights at Wal-Mart .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

This delusional and catastrophic posture has barely registered in the US news media.\n\nDonald Trump speaks at a campaign event on December 2, 2023 in Ankeny, Iowa. (Scott Olson / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nOn November 14, the US Global Change Research Program released the Fifth National Climate Assessment , which found that the United States is already experiencing the severe impacts of climate chaos, driven primarily by continued reliance on fossil fuels. One week later, the Financial Times reported that the Trump campaign is embracing what it calls Project 2025 - a 920-page conservative policy blueprint by the Heritage Foundation that, among other radical goals, urges the elimination of several energy department agencies and would overhaul the whole of the federal government to not only deny climate change but actively promote it.\n\nYet one would hardly know any of this reading coverage of the odds-on favorite to win the Republican nomination and betting markets' most likely pick to be the forty-seventh president of the United States, Donald J. Trump. The former president has spent the past month openly courting fossil fuel money and mocking the very idea of climate change, and this objectively delusional and potentially catastrophic posture has barely registered a blip in the American news media's radar.\n\nA survey of major media outlets from the past month shows that many - such as NPR and the Wall Street Journal - haven't mentioned Trump's recent anti-climate demagoguery at all. And the ones that have typically frame it in terms of subjective \"vanilla versus chocolate ice cream\" partisan preference or a minor \"energy policy\" news item.\n\nA New York Times \"fact check\" of a major \"energy\" speech Trump gave in Houston on November 2 didn't bother fact-checking the most egregious lie Trump told, or heavily implied, several times in his ninety-minute address: climate action is pointless. His speech repeatedly belittles climate policy designed to curb fossil fuel extraction, but the Times ' Angelo Fichera is more focused on inflation and other auxiliary lies. Which are important, but given the stakes of a categorical climate denier being in charge for another four years, one would think the basic rejection of scientific consensus would merit at least a mention, if not deserve to be the central premise of the article.\n\nThe Washington Post 's November 10 covrage of Trump's full-blown embrace of fossil fuels was given the \"both sides\" treatment, framing objections to the former president's oil- and gas-only energy plan as an \"environmentalists say\" ideological position, rather than a factual one.\n\n\"Environmentalists say they're not surprised by oil donors' embrace of Trump,\" Post reporters Josh Dawsey and Maxine Joselow inform us, \"whose climate legacy they describe as disastrous.\"\n\nThat full-blown climate denialism is disastrous is not a mere subjective assertion from an ideologically conflicted party, as presented by the Post . It is a uniform scientific consensus.\n\nIf Trump was standing on top of a building and told reporters he could fly, those opposing the wisdom of this position would not be framed as \"Gravitists say Trump is unlikely to fly.\" This immutable fact would be presented as reality, and the framing of the article wouldn't be \"Gravitists versus anti-gravitists\" - it would be a piece about the denying of objective laws of physics, and the inevitable, violent implications of the most powerful person on Earth doing so. It would be a story of pathological delusion, not \"some say\" media refereeing.\n\nComparing Trump and Biden's climate positions, CNN was equally blasé. \"Trump has a well-documented distaste of renewable energy, a distrust of wind energy in particular and has promised to roll back as much as he can of Biden's climate agenda,\" CNN's Zachary Wolf wrote on November 16 .\n\n\"Climate scientists and activists will point to alarming data showing Earth warming faster than expected and argue the US is not doing nearly enough,\" CNN tells us, \"although more drastic action would take direct bipartisan action by the House and Senate, something that seems unlikely given the power of Republicans representing coal and oil states in the House and Senate.\"\n\nThis is not a subjective or ideological position of \"climate scientists and activists\" - it's reality. That Trump has openly rejected this reality, again, ought to have been the headline, framing, and primary takeaway. Instead, CNN readers get the impression it's just another \"Democrat versus Republican\" issue.\n\nIn July, Politico framed Trump's climate denialism with the anodyne headline, \"Conservatives have already written a climate plan for Trump's second term.\" The piece frames Trump's assault on the Earth's climate and the survival of humanity as a partisan issue of \"rolling back Biden's signature climate law.\"\n\nThe reader does hear from Andrew Rosenberg, a former senior official at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, but his position, that Trump's plan \"undermines not only society but the economic capacity of the country at the same time as it's doing gross violence to the environment,\" is presented as just One Man's Opinion, rather than a scientific fact.\n\nThe Associated Press's roundup of \"Trump's plans if he returns to the White House\" from November 12 doesn't mention climate change at all. The quick hit frames Trump's embrace of accelerating the end of the world as mere \"energy\" policy.\n\n\"Trump's goal, he says, is for the U.S. to have the lowest-cost energy and electricity of any nation in the world, including China,\" writes Jill Colvin. The article continues, \"[Trump says] he will exit the Paris Climate Accords, end wind subsidies and eliminate regulations imposed and proposed by the Biden admiration targeting incandescent lightbulbs, gas stoves, dishwashers and shower heads.\"\n\nAnd what is the inevitable consequence to humanity of these actions, if they come to pass? It's left unsaid. It's just another policy preference.\n\nA rare instance of someone in mainstream media sounding the alarm is Hayes Brown of MSNBC, whose column detailed Trump's disastrous climate policy. Headlined, \"Trump's climate plan: Kill us all even faster,\" the piece makes clear that Trump's energy position is animated by a nihilistic embrace of mass suffering.\n\nYet the article isn't indexed as reporting, but rather \"opinion.\" Stating obvious facts about the inevitable result of Trump's energy policies is seen as too editorial, too subjective, too ideological. The reality of climate change is still framed as just another opinion positioned in opposition to an equally valid position that it's all just made up.\n\nWith only a few years remaining to mitigate the more extreme outcomes of climate chaos, and far less remaining for any outside chance of reversing course, the media removing urgency from the topic is conspicuous.\n\nIn March, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released another harrowing report , authored by ninety-three experts, which found that the Earth's average temperatures are on pace to rise by 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) over preindustrial levels likely by the first half of the 2030s. This shift would surpass a climate threshold, beyond which lie catastrophic heat waves, flooding, megastorms, famines, and extinction that threatens human civilization itself. The only chance we have to avoid this terrible future is for industrialized nations to dramatically - and immediately - cut their greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\"Emissions should be decreasing by now and will need to be cut by almost half by 2030, if warming is to be limited to 1.5°C,\" states a press release accompanying the report.\n\nA November 17 Media Matters analysis reviewed media coverage of a recent congressionally mandated climate report , which showed, once again, that the US embrace of oil and gas is accelerating climate change. The organization found that \"national TV news outlets CNN, MSNBC, NBC, CBS, ABC, and Fox News barely covered the report.\"\n\nThere's a subtext to the lack of urgency and coverage of Trump's brazen climate denialism: dual Outrage Fatigue. After eight years of warnings about the dangers of Trump, and decades of warnings about the dangers of climate change, our media - and to some its audience - have become desensitized. But being used to a threat does not make the threat go away, and the realities of what will happen if the United States doubles down on its fossil fuel extraction and production are no less manifest and existential because they are seen as banal.\n\nThese stories are not about Trump \" turning to oil barons \" or Trump \" misleading on energy .\" They're stories about the leading contender for the White House explicitly rejecting scientific consensus and steering the United States, and by implication, the rest of humanity, toward mass death. They're stories about deliberately denying reality, not cheeky fibs or competing partisan opinions.\n\nTo be sure, Biden's own embrace of fossil fuel extraction is also alarming , but it's magnitudes different from Trump's extremist Project 2025 plan , which mocks or belittles climate change a total of 127 times. Media's clarity about the existential threat of the latter doesn't mean it should cease criticizing the former - but the nature of the threat should be calibrated.\n\nWhat Trump is doing - outright denial and attempting to reverse course back to the nineteenth century - is extraordinary, even among right-wing leaders in peer countries. The radicalism and antiempiricism of Trump's position needs to be made central to the reader, not simply reduced to another routine partisan preference that \"environmentalists say\" may be dangerous.\n\nYou can subscribe to David Sirota's investigative journalism project, the Lever , here .\n\nAdam Johnson is the co-host of Citations Needed podcast and a writer at the Appeal .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThe media story in the days following the 2016 election was that a huge defection of angry, white, blue-collar workers in the Rust Belt from their traditional Democratic voting patterns put Donald J. Trump in the White House in a grand slap at the nation's \"liberal\" elite. But is that the real story?\n\nWhile he didn't actually win the popular vote, Trump did carry the majority (58 percent) of white voters. Furthermore, he won the key \"battleground\" states in the Rust Belt that are the basis of the media story, which raises serious questions. Who were these white voters? Was this the major shift that sent Trump to victory?\n\nExit polls taken during the primaries, when the Trump revolt began, showed that the whole election process was skewed toward the better-off sections of US society, and that Trump did better among them than Clinton. Looking at those voters in the general election from the 26 percent of US households earning more than $100,000, who are unlikely to be working class these days, we see that Clinton got 34 percent of her vote, and Trump a slightly larger 35 percent of his, from these well-to-do voters.\n\nIn other words, upper-income groups were overrepresented in the voting electorate as a whole, and both candidates drew a disproportionate part of their vote from the well-to-do, with Trump a bit more reliant on high-income voters. This in itself doesn't rule out a working-class shift to Trump, but the media's version of this is based on a problematic definition.\n\nAmong other problems, a large majority of those without a college degree don't vote at all. Furthermore, people who don't vote are generally to the left of those who do on economic issues and the role of government. Of the 135.5 million white Americans without degrees, about a fifth voted for Trump - a minority that doesn't represent this degree-less demographic very well.\n\nAnother problem is that there are only about 18.5 million white, blue-collar production workers - the prototype of the defecting white industrial worker. If we double this to account for adult spouses to make it just under 40 million, and assume that none of them have degrees, it still only accounts for a little more than a third of those white adults lacking the allegedly class-defining degree.\n\nOf course, there are another fourteen million or so white service workers who are working class, but even if we include them and their spouses we still account for only about half of the huge 70 percent of white adults in the United States who lack a college degree.\n\nThere are also millions of Americans who don't have a college degree, who are not working class, and who are actually more likely to vote than the \"left behind\" industrial workers. There are some seventeen million small-business owners without that degree. As a 2016 survey by the National Small Business Association tells us, 86 percent of small-business owners are white, they are twice as likely to be Republicans as Democrats, almost two-thirds consider themselves conservative (78 percent on economic issues), and 92 percent say they regularly vote in national elections.\n\nThey drew an average salary of $112,000 in 2016 compared to $48,320 for the average annual wage. Add in the spouses, and this classically petty-bourgeois group alone could more than account for all the twenty-nine million of those lacking a college degree who voted for Trump.\n\nThere are also 1.8 million managers, 8.8 million supervisors, and 1.6 million cops whose jobs don't require a college degree. To this we could add insurance and real-estate brokers and agents, and so on. Some may have a degree, but it is clear that there are tens of millions of non-working-class people in the United States who lack such a degree, and who are more likely to be traditional and frequent Republican voters than a majority of white, blue-collar workers.\n\nThe relatively high income levels of much of Trump's vote point toward a majority petty-bourgeois and middle-class base for Trump, something the Economist concluded in its earlier survey of Trump primary voters when they wrote, \"But the idea that it is the mostly poor, less-educated voters who are drawn to Mr. Trump is a bit of a myth.\" The first point, then, is that Trump's victory was disproportionately a middle-class, upper-income phenomenon.\n\nTo test the extent to which white, blue-collar or related workers handed Trump victory, we will look at the swings in union household voting in national elections. This is far from perfect, of course, since only a minority of workers belong to unions these days, about half are public employees, and nonwhite workers make up a quarter of the total.\n\nNevertheless, we can safely assume that any swings toward the Republicans came mostly from white union members and their families. It is important to bear in mind as well that the union household vote has declined as a percentage of the total vote in presidential elections from about 26-27 percent in 1980 to 18 percent in 2016 so that the impact of the union household vote has diminished though not disappeared.\n\nTwo things are clear from the table. First, an average of about 40 percent of union members and their families have been voting Republican in presidential elections for a long time , with the Democrats winning a little under 60 percent of the union household vote for the last four decades. Only in 1948 and 1964 did over 80 percent of union household members vote for the Democratic candidate, Harry Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson respectively.\n\nNevertheless, in 2016 a relatively small number shifted to Trump from 40 percent for the Republican in 2012 to 43 percent in 2016. These 3 percentage points represent a shift of just under eight hundred thousand union household voters across the entire country.\n\nEven more interesting is that the Demo­cratic vote fell by 7 points from 2012 to 2016 as union household members defected to a third party, refused to answer the question when surveyed, or didn't vote and weren't surveyed. While the unspecified \"no answer\" group of those surveyed lends some credibility to the theory of the \"silent Trump voter,\" this drop nonetheless points to the fact that the Democrats have lost votes since 2012.\n\nPutting this in historical context, Trump's shift of union household voters is actually less dramatic than the swing from 1976 to 1980 for Reagan, and even less so than the 14 point desertion of union household voters from Carter in 1980, half of which went to independent John Anderson rather than Reagan, in an election when union householders composed 26 percent of all voters.\n\nIn other words, Trump attracted both a smaller proportion and number of these voters than Reagan or Anderson. These same voters have swung for some time between Democrats, Republicans, and high-profile third-party candidates such as Anderson, Ross Perot who got 21 percent of union household voters in 1992, and Ralph Nader, who got 3 percent in 2000. The meaning of the 2016 shift was more sinister to be sure, but it was also long in the making as the Democrats moved to the right.\n\nThis is not to say that the swing of union household or white working-class voters away from the Democrats doesn't reflect the conservative social views, racism, and in the 2016 election, sexism of many white working- and middle-class people as well as their anger at their deteriorating situation.\n\nClearly Trump won almost ten million union household votes, compared to almost twelve million for Clinton. These numbers are significant, but we know that many are not as new to voting Republican as is often thought. This, of course, is not something to take comfort in, but it is an indication of the results of the Democratic Party's choice to emphasize higher-income people that began under Bill Clinton and the Democratic Leadership Council.\n\nIt seems clear that a significant number of white working-class people voted for Trump who had voted for Obama in 2008 or 2012 - even if more just didn't vote .\n\nWhile there was a swing among white, blue-collar and union household voters to Trump, it was significantly smaller than the overall drop in Democratic voters.\n\nWhile recent voter suppression laws demanding state-issued photo IDs in some seventeen states along with the racial cleansing of voter rolls in many states have undoubtedly limited voting for blacks, Latinos, and low-income whites, most non-voters don't vote because they don't see anything compelling to vote for.\n\nAt the same time, working-class voter participation has remained low in part because the political parties have reduced the direct door-to-door human contact with lower-income voters in favor of purchased forms of campaigning, from TV ads to the new digitized methods of targeting likely voters.\n\nVast amounts of personal data are accumulated by firms specializing in this, turned into voter-targeting algorithms , and sold. According to John Aristotle Phillips, the CEO of Aristotle, they can provide customers with \"up to 500 different data points on each individual.\" The parties or campaigns that purchase this service , in turn, use it to spread targeted messages to specific groups or even individual voters mostly via the internet through various platforms, including Facebook which apparently made a bundle off the 2016 election.\n\nSpending on digital political ads rose from $22 million in 2008 to $158 million in 2012, and is expected to hit $1 billion for the 2016 election and over $3 billion by the 2020 elections. No doubt they will continue to soar as they are increasingly available for elections way down the ballot to the local level according to the Democratic digital outfit DSPolitical .\n\nAside from the soaring costs this invasive digital targeting adds to US elections and the further erosion of our privacy, it further removes political campaigning from any direct human contact. As reporters for the Guardian put it, \"campaigns of the future will depend as much on being able to track people across screens and apps as knocking on doors or sending out flyers.\"\n\nIt's not that no doors are knocked on or phone calls made, but the algorithm that decides the limited number of actual voters to be visited or called to turn out the vote in practice has meant identifying the better-off part of the population. The Get-Out-The-Vote campaign has become the Get-Out-The-Well-To-Do-Votes canvass. More importantly, the shaping of the political process, already an auction, is being even further outsourced to the profit-making \"expert\" firms that provide this service.\n\nIn short, despite all the vast amounts of money raised and deployed, all the digital and \"expert\" sophistication available to this \"party of the people\" and Clinton's allegedly massive \"ground game\" force in the \"battleground\" states, the Democratic Party as a whole no longer can or tries to mobilize enough of those among its traditional core constituencies - blacks and Latinos, as well as white workers and union members - to win national and even state offices in these key states.\n\nTo be sure, Clinton won the popular vote nationally, perhaps as John Nichols gloated in the Nation by an \"unprecedented\" margin that might run as high as two million or more. The problem is that 1.5 million of that can be accounted for from Clinton's margin over Trump in New York City alone . The majorities in the coastal states of California and New York by themselves account for more than her net majority; the rest of the country continues to see its Democratic vote stagnate or decline.\n\nThe Democrats are and have been for decades the party of the (neoliberal) status quo when millions of all races have seen their living standards shrink and future prospects disappear and, as a result, have come to despise the status quo. And as the many millionaire Democrats in Congress (average wealth of a Democratic representative is $5.7 million) and their business buddies demonstrate for all to see, they are part of the nation's elite.\n\nThe decline in manufacturing jobs, the shrinking of union representation, the creation of more and more lousy jobs, the withdrawal of aid to the cities, etc. have created not just \"angry white men\" who voted for Trump, but angry white, black, Latino, and Asian men and women who, for good and sound reasons, no longer see the Democrats as their defenders.\n\nMany in this legion have voted with their feet , and it wasn't to the polls. In 2014, the last off-year congressional election, non-voters numbered almost 128 million adult citizens - a majority of eligible voters - the vast majority of these were middle- to lower-income working-class people.\n\nStrong evidence that the Democrats can no longer motivate or mobilize the majority in much of the country is the fact that the millions of non-voters are on average and in their majority politically to the left of those who do vote on key economic issues.\n\nAs one study put it, \"Non-voters tend to support increasing government services and spending, guaranteeing jobs, and reducing inequality\" more than voters , by about 17 percentage points. This includes whites as well as black and Latino non-voters.\n\nThe Democrats cannot mobilize the forces needed to defeat the Right, in part because they cannot implement any policies capable of addressing the plight of the majority that might attract these left-leaning non-voters.\n\nNationally the Democrats have been losing elections at just about every level since 2009 . In that year, during the 111th Congress the Democrats had 257 members in the House of Representatives. By 2015, in the 114th Congress that was down to 188 Democrats, the lowest number since the 80th Congress in 1947-49, over which time voter participation rates fell from 48 percent to 42 percent in off-year congressional elections.\n\nIn 2016 the Democrats won back just six seats in the House. Between 2009 and 2015 the Democrats lost 203 seats in state senates and 716 in state houses or assemblies. An indication of what was to come in Ohio and Pennsylvania in 2016 could be seen in the loss of 21 Democratic seats in the state legislatures of each of these states between 2009 and 2015.\n\nThis time, however, the falling Demo­cratic vote meant the victory not of a run-of-the-mill conservative or even a tea-bagger, but of a racist demagogue bent on doing serious damage. And he will.\n\nThere will be resistance. Rather, there will be increased resistance. And this will offer new possibilities for organizing, even in a more hostile atmosphere. At the same time many, including not a few on the socialist left, will run for cover in the Democratic Party's big tent, arguing that now is not the time to take on the Democrats, that the great task is to elect a Democratic congress, any Democratic congress, in 2018 to rein in Trump just as the Republicans blocked Obama after 2010, and so on.\n\nBut such a political direction will only reinforce the Democrats' neoliberalism, digital-dependency, and failed strategies. We had better bear in mind what this approach has not done for the past four decades and will not do in the coming years.\n\nIt will not significantly or permanently increase voter turnout for working-class people, especially African-American and Latino voters. The rate of voter turnout has fallen for the past few decades and particularly for off-year congressional elections.\n\nBoth black and Latino rates of voter participation in off-year elections, long below average, have nose-dived since 2010 and did not recover in 2016 despite the threat of a Trump victory.\n\nNor will the centrist liberalism, much less neoliberalism, of Democratic incumbents and most likely candidates win back those white working-class people or those in union households who have been voting Republican for decades, much less the recent angry Trump converts.\n\nPolitics as usual have failed!

Socialists should see impeachment as an opportunity to attack a movement that poses a long-run threat to the Left's very existence.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee votes on the two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump on December 13, 2019 in Washington, DC.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nToday, Jacobin is publishing dueling essays on the Democrats' efforts to impeach President Donald Trump. You can read the response to this essay, \"What's the Point of Impeachment,\" here .\n\nThe urgency of removing Donald J. Trump from the presidency seems to escape some on the Left. Coverage of the progress toward impeachment is conspicuously absent from the front pages of leading left websites.\n\nTo be sure, an obsession with impeachment can be tedious. We seek more than a restoration of the Obama-Clinton order, much less the elevation of President Michael Pence. The House Democrats' main complaint about Trump seems to boil down to his being a bad Republican. Both the Left and center can do better, especially with some coordination, a bit like what we old folks used to call a popular front.\n\nI share the pervasive boredom with the House Democrats' national security focus, a frequent theme in their attacks on the president. It may please the remaining neocons and #NeverTrumpers, but we don't need to dwell on how to fortify NATO or support Ukrainian authoritarians against Russian kleptocrats (or vice versa).\n\nSome may hope that the Democrats' narrow impeachment framework will be helpful at the polls next fall, particularly with suburban women. Haven't we seen that movie before? Will Soccer Mom be mobilized in defense of Yushchenko vs. Yanukovych? How crooked is Poroshenko? Has anybody checked in with Lobachevsky?\n\nGetting back to the urgency of removing Trump, has the damage attributable to him since his inauguration escaped notice? The leading bullet points include:\n\nAt the risk of getting lost in a fog of abstraction, disagreements on impeachment derive implicitly from one's view of the state. This old doctrinal question can be simplified into two stark categories: one is the state as a bourgeois redoubt subject to absolute control by the ruling class. The other is the state as a contested field, an apparatus capable of doing both good and bad things.\n\nIf the state is capable of no good, then the only purpose of electoral activity is for purely demonstrative exercises, a channel for elevating demands that are vital to the working class, regardless of whether they can be won under capitalism. By this view, no Democrat running for president, with the possible, grudging exception of Bernie Sanders, is acceptable.\n\nMy own jaundiced take on the latter perspective is that it implies a delusional scenario (one that I once - ahem - upheld myself) wherein a situation of dual power somehow comes to pass, presumably on the strength of powerful mass mobilization, leading to the elimination of the capitalist state, root and branch.\n\nAlternatively, if the state is contestable and potentially useful, then it pays to stand for election as socialists within the Democratic Party, with a view toward winning control of the party and getting good things done when elected . It also usually pays to support Democrats over Republicans, especially when third-party candidacies are made fruitless by winner-take-all, first-past-the-post election rules. If you are in this latter camp, then it follows that socialists should support the removal of Donald Trump from the presidency.\n\nThe centrist interest in removing Trump overlaps with the Left's priorities in at least one key respect, beyond the generality that Trump is just worse than any Democrat in every dimension. It is the need for honest elections and durable democratic institutions. No self-respecting Democrat, however hidebound and centrist, wants the party to be shut out of the presidency, numerous governorships, the US Senate, and the federal judiciary for the indefinite future. The strengthening of democracy could hardly be less vital for the future of DSA. We would better know what we had if it was gone.\n\nDemocracy also has an international dimension, going back to the Sanders-Varoufakis initiative cited above. Trump would recast the existing network of US alliances to facilitate his own style of dealmaking, a process that would foster growing power for his cancerous stable of close allies in Brazil, Saudi Arabia, the Philippines, Egypt, Israel, Hungary, England, and Russia. Internationalism should still be a thing.\n\nHow should we regard the impeachment proceedings? The narrow cast being constructed by the House Democrats should be expanded. Trump's self-dealing with respect to Ukraine and a Biden candidacy dovetails with his pervasive, ubiquitous corrupt practices. Corruption in this context defies accountability and, by extension, democracy writ large. His blatant obstruction of justice and defiance of all calls for cooperation with the US Congress defy the Constitution and attest to his basic illegitimacy. His illegitimacy should confer discredit on all his other policies, as well as the Republican Party as a whole, which has steadfastly supported them, and him. In general, the House Democrats have a reasonable grip on this story, but we can do better.\n\nIdeally, impeachment becomes a full-spectrum fightback against the panoply of extreme, right-wing maneuvers in play, and implicitly against their near-substitutes from the mouths of Democratic candidates like \"Mayor Pete.\" It should also be a warning to Democrats such as Senator Kyrsten Sinema or Senator Joe Manchin that failure to take the right stand facilitates an invigorated primary opponent in their future.\n\nMore specifically, the ongoing Republican assaults on voting, reproductive, and labor rights, as alluded to in the bullets above, deserve emphasis. Their implications for race, gender, and class in the United States are profound. I would argue these are the principal themes that the Left should inject into the popular discussions on impeachment.\n\nA comment I've heard disparages impeachment as little more than \"drama.\" Whether we like it or not, there are more people paying attention to this drama than chewing over the differences between Medicare for All and Medicare for Lots More Folks. Drama is interesting! That's why it's called drama.\n\nAs the hearings proceed and actual votes are taken, general interest will only increase. Socialists need to get our concerns into that picture, instead of trying to persuade everyone it is the wrong picture.\n\nMax B. Sawicky is an economist and writer in the wilds of Virginia.

The Left needs to put forward a politics that can counter the affective pleasures of Trumpism, rooted in solidarity rather than cruelty and exclusion.\n\nUS president Donald Trump speaks on June 6, 2024, in Phoenix, Arizona.

Let's leave aside the fact that many of Trump's most committed and gullible followers are about to lose huge sums of money, if they haven't already. Look instead at Trump's announcement of the coin on social media, which is something of a skeleton key to Trumpian ideology and its sources of appeal.\n\nMy NEW Official Trump Meme is HERE! It's time to celebrate everything we stand for: WINNING! Join my very special Trump Community. GET YOUR $TRUMP NOW. Go to https://t.co/GX3ZxT5xyq - Have Fun! pic.twitter.com/flIKYyfBrC\n\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 18, 2025\n\nHere we see three of Trumpism's main offers, neatly summarized in a single Trump post. First is \"WINNING!,\" with the requisite capitalization and punctuation, reminiscent of tiger blood-era Charlie Sheen. Second is membership in a \"very special Trump Community.\" Third is the paternal injunction to \"Have Fun!\"\n\nThere are two aspects to the Trumpian conception of \"winning.\" There's the general sense that being born in America (to the right kind of parents, of course) entitles you to always come out on top in everything you do and to do whatever you want without any negative consequences. That birthright, in turn, has to be protected from anyone who threatens to take it away.\n\nStephen Miller, Trump's white nationalist deputy chief of staff, took the stage at the president's preinauguration victory rally to make who that is abundantly clear: \"It's going to mean an executive order ending the border invasion, sending the illegals home and taking America back. . . . It's going to mean the eradication of the criminal cartels and the foreign gangs who are preying on our people. And it's going to mean justice for every American citizen who has lost a loved one to illegal aliens.\"\n\nIt's also going to mean an attack on transgender people. Miller: \"There are men, and there are women. And it's not up to you whether you're a man or a woman. That's a decision that's made by God and it can't be changed.\"\n\nIn short, it means victory over anyone \"poisoning the blood of our country,\" as Trump chillingly put it - immigrants and transgender people above all, but also anyone who would dare to defend them.\n\nThe second offer is membership in a \"very special Trump Community,\" the promise of fellowship with fellow believers under the benevolent leader's protective umbrella. This takes a number of different forms: wearable gear like the iconic MAGA hat; the Trump flags his supporters fly from their homes, boats, and RVs; and Trump's mass rallies, which have become a signature aspect of his movement's culture. They help Trump supporters recognize one another, declare their allegiances proudly, and strengthen their identification with the leading figure at the head of it all. Even if, as is all but certain with $TRUMP, that means blowing your money to make that figurehead even more wealthy and powerful.\n\nFinally, and most revealingly, we have the injunction to \"Have Fun!\" It's Trump playing the indulgent father, dispensing toys and sweets to the tykes clamoring at his feet, a fulfillment of the \"daddy's home\" memes his supporters have been circulating since November 5. With daddy back in charge, it's time to have fun again.\n\nIt's not just any kind of fun, though. For many, it means the self-indulgent kicks of the adolescent male. For Mark Zuckerberg, it means putting an end to \"culturally neutered\" companies groaning under the woke tyranny of diversity, equity, and inclusion czars and \"having a culture that celebrates the aggression\" of properly masculine men. \"I feel liberated,\" said a banker in a recent Financial Times report . \"We can say 'retard' and 'pussy' without the fear of getting cancelled. . . . It's a new dawn.\"\n\nFrom the moment he entered the political arena, Trump's appeal has been grounded in the ways he encourages people to act like he does: with zero sense of responsibility or accountability. And for millions of people, that sounds like a blast.\n\nMany Trump voters no doubt backed him out of economic and political frustration. But I am increasingly skeptical of the idea that Trump's core supporters can be \"won back\" through \"class politics\" pitched at the level of rational, economic self-interest. As a sixty-year-old Missourian who attended Trump's pre-inaugural rally put it , the experience of Trumpism \"is so emotional, so much fun. And all the people that we get to see, who we've seen on TV, are right there in front of us.\" So much of the appeal is grounded in deeply felt parasocial relationships with Fox News pundits, YouTubers, podcasters, streamers, and the big man himself, the guy who will fight against anyone who'd get between you and your fun.\n\nI write this on a visit to Florida, the spiritual home of Trumpism, where so many of his followers have moved precisely to \"Have Fun!\" It's a grim conception of the good life, completely devoid of collective responsibility or civic virtue, heedlessly devoted to living it up before the bill comes due. Karl Marx wrote that it's through collective struggles that people \"succeed in ridding [themselves] of all the muck of ages and become fitted to found society anew.\" Trump tells people that they don't need to rid themselves of the muck, that they should cover themselves with it, identify with it, have fun with it.\n\nIt's a very seductive proposition, one that can't be fully combated by campaign messaging or policy proposals. The muck has to be thrown off, our capacity for self-government restored. We need to develop a compelling conception of what politics is for and of what life in America is, or should be, about. That will entail many things, but it must include building new organizations, with new cultures and forms of solidarity, that teach people how to make decisions, govern themselves - and, in a different and constructive way, have fun together.\n\nChris Maisano is a Jacobin contributing editor and a member of Democratic Socialists of America.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

No wonder: most people care more about their material conditions than the partisan culture wars.\n\nA Donald Trump supporter holding a QAnon flag visits Mount Rushmore National Monument in South Dakota.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIf indeed Donald Trump's presidency has been cut short after just one term, then the next several months will be devoted to defining Trumpism and interpreting the country's repudiation of it.\n\nThe theories will be diverse, but one to anticipate is that Joe Biden's victory suggests the rehabilitation of political centrism, which has sustained challenges by perceived outsiders of all stripes over the last decade. The window for experimental alternatives to sanctioned establishment politics - represented in the minds of many moderates by Trump and Bernie Sanders alike, never mind the diametrically opposite politics of the Right and the Left - will be declared closed.\n\nThat explanation is attractive in its simplicity, and especially seductive for anyone with a major stake in restoring popular confidence in the existing political elite. But it doesn't accurately reflect the nature of the race. Biden as the establishment versus Trump as the gate-crasher is a throwback to the last election, when Trump was a real estate mogul and reality television star with no political experience, not the incumbent presiding over a nightmarish series of interlocking crises.\n\nThis election was different. It was chiefly a referendum on which menace the American people wanted their leaders to focus on: the coronavirus and its associated economic catastrophe, or an assortment of left-wing bogeymen. In other words, it was less a contest between political insiders and outsiders than between main attractions and sideshows. The politically vacuous Biden campaign certainly failed to do justice to the main attractions, but when American voters chose him by a fraction they also chose to elect a leader who at least gave the impression of focusing on ending the pandemic rather than, say, alleged roaming bands of Antifa.\n\nReality in the United States is exceedingly grim, so Trump's primary campaign strategy was to deflect it. In particular, he sought to rile up his base about the fabricated threats of Democrat-run cities falling to anarchists and looters , cancel-culture totalitarianism perpetrated by \" evil people ,\" and imaginary large-scale voter fraud , all while flattering fringe elements of his coalition like the Proud Boys , QAnon , and the right-wing militia movement . Biden's strategy, on the other hand, was to lay low, keep things simple and vague, and passively absorb support from anyone more concerned about the coronavirus pandemic and economic recession than Trump's culture-war melodrama.\n\nBuffalo protester shoved by Police could be an ANTIFA provocateur. 75 year old Martin Gugino was pushed away after appearing to scan police communications in order to black out the equipment. @OANN I watched, he fell harder than was pushed. Was aiming scanner. Could be a set up?\n\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 9, 2020\n\nOn many questions, from climate to health care, Biden's ambitious promises regarding the crisis and recovery were not very specific and his specific promises were not very ambitious. But he at least cleared the low bar by acknowledging the severity of the nation's situation, in which 230,000 have died, twelve million have lost their employer-sponsored health insurance, eight million have been pushed into poverty , and so on. That acknowledgment appears to have been sufficient to distinguish him from Trump, who routinely downplayed both the public health and economic dimensions of the present catastrophe.\n\nTrump's apparent disregard for the gravity of the pandemic left plenty of people cold, including elements of his own base. Take the example of Arizona seniors, a crucial demographic in this race. In 2016, Trump won Arizona voters over the age of sixty-five by 13 percentage points , a level that he will not even come close to matching this time.\n\nWhy the reversal? One profile of voters in Maricopa County featured a steadfast Trump supporter living in a retirement community outside Phoenix who fretted about distant Black Lives Matter protests and the need to restore \"law and order,\" despite the fact that her own suburb of Peoria recently made a list of the fifteen safest cities in America . Another profile of Arizona seniors featured a man who had voted Republican all his life, but who was switching to Biden because Trump is \"not accepting responsibility\" for the coronavirus pandemic and \"doesn't talk about the vulnerability of people in our age, 65 and older, group, even though he is part of that group.\"\n\nAll evidence points to a situation in which those who abandoned the president were concerned about things that concretely threaten them, while the Trump holdouts were preoccupied with the phantasmic picture of apocalypse the president spent the campaign painting. In other words, those who stayed with Trump were stubbornly attached to a fantasy, while those who abandoned him were lured away by reality.\n\nThere's an important lesson here, and it isn't that the path to electoral victory runs through centrism. It's that when push comes to shove, more people care about their material conditions than cultural shadowboxing.\n\nIncreasingly Americans are the captives of sprawling, convoluted, perpetually-evolving partisan storylines - conservatives and liberals alike - which colonize their minds and feed an intense political tribalism that disables all other modes of reasoning. Trump placed his bet on the idea that this type of cultural bogeyman politics would always be stronger than the allure of, for example, not dying of a deadly virus or not filing for bankruptcy after months of unemployment without relief . Yes, it was too close for comfort, and clearly plenty of people still bought what Trump was selling, but in the end Trump's instinct was wrong.\n\nThe crisis heightened people's attention to their own uncertain well-being. Biden did the minimum required to take advantage of this. He predictably refused, for example, to run on a broad expansion of public health insurance, even during a public health crisis and when a supermajority of the nation supports it. Nor would it be accurate to suggest that the Democrats this time were never guilty of hysterically demonizing their opponents; per usual, there was plenty of paranoia and vilification to go around. But what mattered was that in the end, the pandemic was Biden's issue. Voters associated him, and not Trump, with attention to the crisis at hand.\n\nOn some level, this should encourage an otherwise fairly demoralized American left. After all, we're the ones whose program consists of securing good health care, housing, education, infrastructure, and employment for everyone. While we didn't have a candidate in the race this week, we should interpret the result as smuggling in a small affirmation of the basic premise animating our political approach: that while ordinary people may have all kinds of perverse ideas and reactionary attitudes, direct appeals to what people need to survive and live decently have the power, on occasion, to dislodge delusions.\n\nNow, imagine the kinds of margins we'd have seen if Trump's opponent had actually campaigned on an ambitious platform that connected politics directly to people's material conditions. Whatever else it accomplished, such a campaign would have helped to snap millions of people out of the fog of political hypnosis. For the Left, that is the first step toward victory.\n\nMeagan Day is a staff writer at Jacobin .

      "text": "The Self-Destruction of Donald J. Trump\n\nDoug Mills/CNP via ZUMA\n\nIf the current numbers hold, sometime in mid- to late-September, the United States will likely reach the horrific marker of 200,000 people dead due to the coronavirus crisis. No doubt, the media will widely report on this artificial but significant milepost. If, tragically, the trend ticks up slightly after some schools reopen in late summer and after flu season begins in October, this grim headline could appear shortly before Election Day: \"COVID-19 Death Count in the US Tops a Quarter of a Million.\" One puzzle is why President Donald Trump does not seem to realize that these nightmarish statistics-and the news stories they will generate-could spell doom for his reelection prospects.\n\nBy now it's damn clear that Trump is a narcissistic sociopath who cannot express an ounce of regret over the deaths caused by the virus. He has boasted about the swell TV ratings of his pandemic briefings; he has said almost nothing of those Americans killed by the pandemic. \"It is what it is,\" he nonchalantly and ghastly observed the other day. Since the start of this epidemic, Trump has gushed out a series of idiotic and false remarks : The virus is no big deal. It will go away. This is a hoax. We will have a national testing program within days. We will have a vaccine within months. Try hydroxychloroquine. Maybe injecting bleach will help. Case numbers are high because of testing. I take no responsibility. I've been right all along. We've done an amazing job.\n\nHe has pushed to reopen state economies and schools before guideposts established by US government experts were met. He has politicized and, thus, discouraged the most basic practice to arrest the pandemic: wearing masks. Imagine being able to prevent tens of thousands of deaths of your fellow Americans with one easy action-and not taking that step. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you the president of the United States. In recent days, yes, Trump has begrudgingly shifted his stance on masks. His campaign sent out an email to supporters telling them that it is \" patriotic\" to wear a mask. Yet during his latest White House briefings, when he reads his opening statement that includes encouraging the use of masks, Trump hurries his way through this one line and hardly highlights the point. It's as if he is swallowing a bitter pill. And this reluctant about-face may have come too late to persuade his live-maskless-or-die followers. The damage has been done.\n\nTrump's self-obsessed behavior, his dismissal of expert advice, his attacks on news media outlets that report the awful truths of the pandemic, his focus on the positive economic indicators that exist within an economic calamity (look at the Dow Jones!)-none of this is shocking. But what is surprising is that Trump, perhaps the most self-interested man ever to reside in the White House, cannot see that his own and much-cherished personal interests-notably, getting re-elected-are aligned with the public interest of curtailing the pandemic.\n\nDo Trump and his campaign minions believe that he can be reelected as the number of COVID deaths top 200,000 or 250,000? Shouldn't he be doing whatever he can to prevent these headlines in the final weeks of the campaign? What the hell gives?\n\nThe responsible course for the president was not tough to discern. Follow the recommendations of public health experts. Model the appropriate conduct. (Wear a mask!) Assist front-line medical workers. Seek to help the economically dislocated. Mourn the dead and address the national fear and anxiety. Yet Trump's own inner compass is so broken that he could not even fake concern for his own political benefit. His deep-rooted pathologies-I know best, I can bullshit through anything-blocked him from adopting simple measures that would actually advance his own personal agenda.\n\nOne small example: In the early weeks of the pandemic, Trump picked a fight with Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat. She is a popular pol in the Wolverine State. She was elected 53 to 43 percent in 2018. And she was doing a good job responding to the crisis. Michigan is (or, now, maybe was) a key state for Trump. It was part of his \"beautiful\" electoral map in 2016, and he could well need it again to win. Yet he appeared more eager to feud with Whitmer than to help the state acquire equipment it needed to combat the coronavirus. \" Don't call the woman in Michigan,\" Trump said he told Vice President Mike Pence. Why piss off Michiganders when you desire their votes? It's in Trump's nature. (See the story of the scorpion and the frog.) He placed his love of revenge over his own political survival.\n\nConsider Trump's treatment of Dr. Anthony Fauci. This highly esteemed scientist is much-respected by the public. About two-thirds of Americans trust what he says about the pandemic. (Only 30 percent have confidence in what Trump utters about the crisis.) Trump was fortunate to have Fauci on the White House coronavirus task force. He should be riding the Fauci wave. Instead, the Trump White House has been backstabbing-and front-stabbing-this acclaimed public servant. Recently, Trump whined about Fauci's high-approval ratings and complained, \"Nobody likes me.\" He declared that Fauci's analysis about the ongoing coronavirus surge is \"wrong.\" (Trump also turned on Dr. Deborah Birx, the ever-loyal coordinator of the White House coronavirus task force, tweeting \"Pathetic!\" at her.)\n\nTrump has the LeBron James of public health on his team, and he only wants to dump on him. That's not a winning strategy.\n\nNeither was Trump's me-first insistence on holding me-me-me political rallies while the virus wildfire raged. Herman Cain-the co-chair of the president's Black Voices for Trump outfit-sadly died of COVID-19 weeks after attending that indoor rally in Tulsa, where he and thousands of others sat shoulder-to-shoulder and, emulating Trump, did not wear masks. It's unclear when and where Cain contracted the virus, but the episode suggests a basic lesson: Insisting on a premature return to normal can yield deadly results and cause serious political embarrassment. Yet for Trump, there are no teachable moments.\n\nTrump cannot stop himself from lying. (Last month, the Washington Post 's database of Trump's false statements hit the 20,000 mark.) Trump cannot stop himself from self-aggrandizing. (Trump at the Centers for Disease Control in March: \"Every one of these doctors said, 'How do you know so much about this?' Maybe I have a natural ability.\") Trump cannot throttle back on his racism (\"the China virus\"), his ignorance (\"supposing you brought the light inside the body\"), or his egotism (\"we had a lot of people watching, record numbers watching...in the history of cable television, there's never been anything like it\"). But the former reality TV celebrity, who became famous by exploiting the tabloid press, does know a thing or two about PR. So is it that difficult for him to comprehend that this continuing march of death threatens the only thing he cares about: his own standing? Grasping this simple notion should compel him to take immediate and extensive action to limit the number of lives lost to this killer virus-not for the good of others, but for his own sake.\n\nYet Trump's demons are in control. He is fueled by spite and by self-glory. Moreover, he appears incapable of peering into the future and considering the effects of his statements and actions. Last month, Trump publicly vowed that he would sign and enact a comprehensive health care plan within two weeks. The fortnight came and went; there was nothing. This was yet one more sign that Trump is 100-percent situational. He says whatever he thinks he needs to say at the moment to gain whatever advantage he seeks, without an iota of regard for later being held accountable. It sure sounds swell to promise everyone a signed, sealed, and delivered health care package within 14 days. Why not say that? So what if there is no new national health care program in two weeks? Trump will deal with that then. Or not. It doesn't matter to him. Neither present truth nor future consequences hold much reality for him.\n\nPerhaps this explains Trump's inability to fully fathom the threat he faces. The appalling body count of the present doesn't move him toward empathy or effective policy, and the prospect of hideous headlines to come also doesn't motivate him. Not even when his own political career is in jeopardy. Maybe he figures that he will BS his way through all this or rig the system somehow to retain power. Or that he will just get dumb-lucky via an external incident (a vaccine!) that changes the now-dark landscape. But Trump's inability to make a simple calculation-I should heed the experts and implement the counter-pandemic fundamentals to save lives and (also!) win reelection-is stark and disturbing. It shows Trump cannot perceive or escape the vortex of his own self-destruction. The immense tragedy is that thousands of Americans have died and will continue to die because Trump cannot help even himself.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Thank You, Donald J. Trump. I Love America More Because of You.\n\nI'd never really been a proud American-until Donald Trump was elected president. Let me explain.\n\nBy the time I understood what it meant to be American (besides being able to buy a Coca-Cola sweater and Guess jeans in middle school), I was tuning in to Ronald Reagan talk about \"trickle-down\" economics. Even as a preteen, I knew that \"trickle down\" as an economic policy sounded suspiciously off. I now know it was delusional.\n\nIn college and law school, when I was in India or anywhere other than the United States, I would go along with the standard conversations: \"Yes, Americans are embarrassing\"; \"Yes, the US government has caused tremendous harm across the globe\"; \"Yes, many Americans are racist\"-feeling relief and superiority in my ability to use my Indian heritage as a way to deny my American identity. Looking back, my embarrassment about America was in part a reflection of how I felt in this country.\n\nAs I grew up, I constantly walked a tightrope of acceptance and rejection-of being seen and not-in everything I did. I hated that tightrope and the elements of the country that created it.\n\nWhen Barack Obama was elected president in 2008, I exhaled a sigh of relief. Electing a Black president-now there's something to be proud of. As elated as I was, I still felt like Obama won in spite of Americans, not because of them. I was proud of President Obama and his family, but still very suspicious of America.\n\nOn November 9, 2016, the day after Donald Trump was elected, I was openly crying at work, my stomach in a permanent double knot. I kept asking \"Why?\" and \"How could this happen?\" My feet wanted to walk, but I had nowhere to go. A whole-body shutdown.\n\nNow I know why. The election of Trump broke my heart. It turns out I had loved the United States from the beginning. The fact that America was not enthusiastically ready to love me or the people I love back made my feelings easy to ignore. There is a lot of pain in loving something so flawed-a country so far from what it aspired to be and what it could be.\n\nDuring his presidential bid, Sen. Cory Booker said , \"If America hasn't broken your heart, you don't love [America] enough.\" On November 9, 2016, my heart was hammered into small pieces, and I knew I loved America more than ever.\n\nTo love my country is not to unconditionally accept it; it means working toward what is just. Because I love America and Americans, I am willing to fight to make the idea of America real, make democracy real, make justice real. I will not give in to cynicism or anger, and I will not give up.\n\nRep. John Lewis' legacy is a guiding light: America, you're mine and I'm yours. Together let's build a more perfect union, till death do us part.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Donald Trump's Campaign Is Running on Fumes. He Still Hasn't Cut the Check He Promised.\n\nPresident Donald Trump walks to board Marine One at the White House in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 20, 2020, for a short trip to Andrews Air Force Base, Md., and then on to Erie, Pa. for a campaign rally. AP Photo/Andrew Harnik\n\nLast month, after fundraising filings showed that his campaign was facing a possible cash crunch in the final weeks of the campaign, Donald Trump pledged to personally bankroll his reelection effort if money was needed.\n\n....Like I did in the 2016 Primaries, if more money is needed, which I doubt it will be, I will put it up!\n\n- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 8, 2020\n\nWell, it's needed. And a check from Trump has yet to materialize.\n\nYesterday, his campaign filed its September fundraising report, and it was dismal. Trump entered October with just $63 million in cash on hand. Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden reported having $177 million, nearly three times as much.\n\nDespite raising around $1 billion with his partners in the Republican Party since 2017, Trump is struggling to attract donations in the homestretch. In September, when his fundraising should have been reaching a crescendo, he pulled in just $81 million. Adjusted for inflation, that's less than what Mitt Romney's failed 2012 presidential campaign raised in the same month. And it's way less than the $281.6 million Biden brought in.\n\nSo, Trump is in a hole. What's he going to do about it? Unlike in 2016, when he gave around $55 million to fund his primary campaign, he hasn't provided a dime of his own money to the campaign yet this election cycle. Despite the promise he made in September and reports that he planned to fund his campaign to the tune of $100 million , he's not likely to contribute much at this point, if for no other reason than he probably can't afford to.\n\nMany of Trump's hotel and golf businesses were posting declining revenues before the pandemic wreaked havoc on the hospitality sector . Meanwhile, his company is facing looming deadlines to refinance or repay more than $400 million in debt . Trump's most recent financial disclosure showed that at the end of 2019 he had somewhere between $46.7 million and $156.6 million in checking or money-market accounts. In other words, without raising more cash by offloading assets, it's not even clear that he has $100 million to loan his campaign to begin with. Even a loan of $50 million might be a heavy lift. Trump does have a stock portfolio, but according to the New York Times bombshell reporting based on his tax returns, he already liquidated a big chunk of that in 2016 to fund his primary campaign. That well is probably dry.\n\nThe Trump Organization is allegedly exploring the sale of at least one big property in Westchester County, outside of New York City, but as far as this campaign goes, it's probably too little, too late.\n\nThe Trump campaign did not respond to a request for comment about whether Trump planned to throw a financial lifeline to his campaign.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Want to Save the Planet? Easy! Just \"Be More Like Donald\"\n\nJacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nPresident Trump is reading a book, and he would very much like you to know about it. It's a book about himself, called Donald J. Trump: An Environmental Hero , self-published in 2016 by his former environmental consultant, Edward Russo. Beginning in 2002, Russo consulted on the Trump Organization's golf courses on matters like landscaping and meeting local zoning requirements.\n\nIt's not entirely clear how long Russo worked for Trump-his book says it was 15 years, some media outlets say it was 17. But during that time, Russo claims he spoke with Trump two or three times a week about more than a dozen projects. Back in early 2017, I thought maybe I could get another window into Trump's environmental record by interviewing Russo. He spoke to me from Key West, Florida, where he now lives, and we had a wide-ranging conversation on the consulting practice he was hoping to get going, after a career serving local New Jersey environmental and planning boards.\n\nIt was a weird experience: He told me how Trump's early executive orders were really all about clean air and water and that his use of \"hoax\" to describe climate change was really a more nuanced criticism that climate change is just a distraction from the more important priorities, like cleaning up toxic sites. Later, when E&E News profiled him, he claimed to have turned down a position as Trump's White House environmental adviser .\n\nAt the time, I hesitated to write about my conversation with Russo because frankly, I didn't see why I should take seriously his claims about Trump's environmentalism. His book didn't provide a real window into the policy and industry interests Trump had backed. So his slim 88-pager sat on my desk for more than three years, collecting dust until I returned to it after a few recent events.\n\nFirst, there was a White House presser in early January announcing Trump's monumental rollback of environmental standards for new fossil fuel infrastructure. During a briefing, Trump noted, \"Somebody wrote a book that I'm an environmentalist and actually called [it] The Environmentalist -actually, before I did this. But they wrote a book. I'd like to get it.\"\n\nBut what really jogged my memory about Russo was the president's sudden interest in trees . As The New York Times ' Lisa Friedman reported Wednesday, \"The president's commitment to a global effort to plant one trillion trees by 2030 surprised even White House officials who work on environment policy.\"\n\nWhen I interviewed Russo in 2017, he told me, \"There is more of a frenzy to demonize Donald Trump than to expose the environmental achievements that he has created.\" When I pressed him to list those achievements, Russo praised Trump's interest in landscaping on his golf courses, dealing with issues like erosion control and creating \"specific and sometimes spectacular habitats.\" He wrote in his book, \"If I wanted to put in a pond to the left side to the left side of the fairway of hole six at Trump Philadelphia, he would remind me that there was a red maple close by and tell me to make sure we didn't damage the root zone.\" (Sometimes, Trump's golf course environmentalism involves clearing land of wildlife and trees, which a Trump Organization golf course was caught doing just last year .)\n\nIn the book, Russo lionizes Trump as a green hero, even as he dismisses environmental advocates' work as ineffective bureaucracy. While the environmentalists \"promote meetings and seminars to develop visioning for some amorphous nebulous future response, Donald has been concentrating on clean air and clean water by stabilizing river banks, planting millions of dollars of trees, and establishing and enhancing important habitats.\" (Yeah, sure, conferences are definitely all environmentalists do.) Russo wonders, \"I wonder how much effort Donald's media critics are making to clean up the environment?\"\n\nHe goes on to urge readers to \"be more like Donald\" in their own environmental efforts:\n\nIf people really want to do something constructive, start by cleaning up the landfills in your town, create important wildlife habitats, and promote water quality initiatives. You know, be more like Donald, because that is precisely what he does. Because if we concentrate on cleaning the air and water, the result will be reduced CO2 emissions. That is the point that Donald has been making. While others promote meetings and seminars to develop visioning for some amorphous nebulous future response, Donald has been concentrating on clean air and clean water by stabilizing river banks, planing millions of dollars of trees, and establishing and enhancing important habitats.\n\nTrump has been repeating Russo's claim that he cares about clean air and water-but the public has definitely not been buying it : Surveys of voters have consistently shown that climate change and the environment are his most unpopular positions, even among some Republicans. Small wonder, since wildlife , water quality, public lands , air pollution , enforcement , and oceans have all been targeted in the work of this \"environmental hero:\" 96 regulatory rollbacks and proposed budget cuts .

It's Made in China.\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds a Bible as he visits outside St. John's Church across Lafayette Park from the White House Monday, June 1, 2020, in Washington. Part of the church was set on fire during protests on Sunday night. AP Photo/Patrick Semansky\n\nDonald Trump's record of hypocrisy and grifting now appears to extend to his \"God Bless the USA\" Bible. A new report from the Associated Press reveals that nearly 120,000 copies of the former president's $60 Bibles are printed in China, the same country he's spent most of his political career lambasting.\n\nThose copies, according to records obtained by the AP, were shipped in February and March, likely making a $7 million profit for Trump.\n\nAs we previously wrote , these Bibles aren't just average publications of a holy text . They include a handwritten chorus of Lee Greenwood's \"God Bless the USA,\" as well as a custom embossing \"in remembrance of the day that God intervened during President Donald J. Trump's assassination attempt,\" available in special edition copies.\n\nAll of which made the potential decision to mandate Trump's Bible in Oklahoma's schools deeply alarming. As I wrote last week:\n\nOn Friday, the nonprofit news outlet Oklahoma Watch reported that the superintendent's bid documents included specific standards for the Bibles set to be used in Oklahoma classrooms, standards only met by two editions.\n\nAccording to the documents, the books must:\n\nSupplier Mardel Christian & Education reportedly searched through the 2,900 versions of the Bible it carries and found that none fit the bill-but Trump's \"God Bless the USA Bible\" does.\n\nTrump's Bible is, of course, just one of many odd business ventures he has started in this election cycle alone, including $400 golden sneakers.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Donald Trump Has a New Website But It's Bad\n\nThe Right View/ZUMA Wire\n\nWhen then-President Donald Trump permanently lost his tweeting privileges in January, he entered uncertain territory: How would the second president ever to have a Twitter account communicate to the world without a Twitter account? As the weeks went by, Trump talked about creating a new social media platform for himself and his supporters-a place to engage in public discussions and weigh in on the issues of the day, free of the Big Tech censors and oppressive wokeness. What would this new shitposting arcadia look like?\n\nApparently, it would look a lot like a blog.\n\nOn Tuesday, in a story that sounds weirdly like someone trying to describe the internet in 1992, Fox News reported that Trump had \"launched a communications platform, which will eventually give him the ability to communicate directly with his followers.\" The story continued:\n\nThe platform, \"From the Desk of Donald J. Trump\" appears on www.DonaldJTrump.com/desk. The space will allow Trump to post comments, images, and videos.\n\nDonald J. Trump dot com backslash desk. Donald J. Trump dot com backslash desk. Donald J. Trump dot com backslash desk. Donald J. Trump dot com backslash desk. This is a website! You're describing a blog, on a website! Why does this description sound like Bryant Gumbel and Katie Couric in that old Today Show video?\n\nThis is old technology, man. Anyone can set one of these up! Clicking on the website-again, that's Donald J. Trump dot com backslash desk-takes you to a landing page that looks sort of like a Twitter homepage, but which consists entirely of little farts of enlightenment from Trump, which up until now he had been sending to reporters using something called \"email.\" Finally, a place to communicate one's thoughts, on the internet. It's not exactly reinventing the spinning wheel- or is it :\n\nThe technology appears to be powered by Campaign Nucleus- the 'digital ecosystem made for efficiently managing political campaigns and organizations,' created by his former campaign manager, Brad Parscale.\n\nOkay, I take it back: it is not just a blog; it is probably a very expensive blog .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "What to Know About Donald Trump's New $60 Bible\n\nMother Jones illustration; Shealah Craighead/White House/ZUMA\n\nOne month after releasing a line of gilded high-tops for $399, Donald Trump revealed on Tuesday a new item: the Bible. \"All Americans need a Bible in their home, and I have many,\" the former president explained in a video promoting the country singer Lee Greenwood's version of a King James translation, the \"God Bless the USA Bible.\"\n\n\"It's my favorite book,\" Trump added.\n\nThroughout the rest of the clip, as if daring us into a collective disgust, Trump swerved through random opportunities to rail against bureaucrats and a country under threat-all while hawking a holy text.\n\nBut his latest sales pitch also prompted some legitimate questions. Such as: What the hell is going on? And: Excuse me? Here, we try to answer some of the queries.\n\nSo, that first question-what the hell-but more formally: What exactly is Trump promoting and how much will it cost me to shell out for this?\n\nTrump is encouraging his supporters to buy a Bible endorsed by himself and Lee Greenwood. It costs $59.99, without taxes or shipping included. That seems to sit on the more expensive end of Bibles on sale at Barnes & Noble . But those books presumably don't include copies of the Constitution, the Bill of Rights, and the handwritten lyrics to the chorus of Greenwood's \"God Bless the USA.\"\n\nThe \"God Bless the USA Bible\" does include these items .\n\nTrump is in a serious cash crunch . So is he going to make money with this Bible?\n\nAccording to the book's official site , the God Bless the USA Bible has nothing to do with Trump's campaign. It is \"not owned, managed, or controlled by Donald J. Trump, The Trump Organization, CIC Ventures LLC, or any of their respective principals or affiliates.\" Instead, Trump's \"name, likeness, and image\" are being used \"under paid license from CIC Ventures LLC.\"\n\nWait, what is CIC Ventures LLC, though?\n\nOkay, so CIC Ventures LLC is, according to the Washington Post , basically a pipeline to Trump:\n\nIn [Trump's] financial disclosure released last year, he's identified as the [CIC Ventures LLC's] \"manager, president, secretary and treasurer\" and the Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust is identified as a 100 percent owner of the business. The same entity also receives royalties from his book \"A MAGA Journey\" and speaking engagements.\n\nIn case it's not already obvious: if you look at the company's documents, you'll find the principal address for CIC Ventures LLC is 3505 Summit Boulevard, West Palm Beach, Florida. That is a Trump golf course . Moreover, in a 2022 disclosure, Nick Luna is listed as a manager. Luna was Trump's personal assistant and body man.\n\nSo, I'm sorry, but let me ask again: Is Trump making money off this?\n\nThe New York Times reports that \"according to a person familiar\" (classic) Trump will receive royalties from sales.\n\nYou could have just said that.\n\nI wanted to tell you about the other stuff I found. Any other questions?\n\nYes. Who is Lee Greenwood?\n\nThe country singer who wrote \"God Bless the USA.\" Greenwood is a fierce MAGA guy who otherwise made news after pulling out of an NRA concert in response to the Uvalde, Texas, mass shooting.\n\nDoes Greenwood have a Christmas album with an oddly sexual cover?\n\nYes. Look at this .\n\nPerfect sweater. Anyway, I feel like I'm experiencing deja vu. Hasn't Trump made headlines before with a Bible?\n\nYou're probably recalling that despicable photo-op when Trump held up a Bible in front of St. John's Church, which had been a location of racial justice protests in the days prior. There was a complicated saga, afterward, about whether or not Trump deployed the police to clear protesters to get to the church. An Inspector General's report ultimately concluded that he did not.\n\nMan, it's pretty rough remembering all the awful shit we went through with him as president.\n\nYep. If you ever want to wallow in political depression, check out this quick compilation .\n\nBut wait. Wasn't there another time Trump and the Bible made waves for something far more stupid?\n\nChristian nationalists adore Trump, so there have probably been many times that Trump has referenced the Bible. But you might also be thinking of this incredible clip of Trump attempting to name his favorite verse .\n\nHas a presidential candidate ever partnered on a holy text sale with a country musician?\n\nNot to my knowledge. But this is from a dude who just last week seemed to compare his current legal jeopardy with the persecution of Jesus Christ.

Gerry Connolly, of Virginia; Jared Moskowitz, of Florida; and John Garamendi, of California - comes in response to a measure introduced by a group of House Republicans to rename Washington Dulles International Airport after Trump.\n\nThe Democrats' bill would rename the Miami Federal Correctional Institution in Florida the \"Donald J. Trump Federal Correctional Institution.\"\n\n\"When our Republican colleagues introduced their bill to rename Dulles after Donald Trump, I said the more fitting option would be to rename a federal prison,\" Connolly said in a statement. \"I hope our Republican friends will join us in bestowing upon Donald J. Trump the only honor he truly deserves.\"\n\nTrump is facing multiple federal criminal charges in Florida for allegedly mishandling sensitive government, including willful retention of national defense information, false statements and representations, conspiracy to obstruct justice, withholding a document or record and corruptly concealing a document. He has pleaded not guilty and is awaiting a new trial date in that case.\n\nTrump is also facing state criminal charges in New York, where he's been accused of falsifying business records related to a hush money payment paid to adult film star Stormy Daniels in the closing days of the 2016 presidential election. He's pleaded not guilty in that case, which is scheduled to begin jury selection on April 15 .\n\nThe former president has been charged with illegally trying to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election in Georgia state court and in federal court in Washington, D.C. Trial dates have not been set in either case, and the D.C. case is on hold pending resolution of Trump's appeal that he's protected by presidential immunity. The U.S. Supreme Court is set to hear arguments on that appeal on April 25. Trump has pleaded not guilty in both cases.\n\n\"Everyone knows President Trump loves to write his name in gold letters on all his buildings, Moskowitz said. \"But he's never had his name on a federal building before and as a public servant I just want to help the former president. Help us make that dream a reality.\"\n\nThe bill to rename Dulles after Trump was filed last Friday. It was sponsored by Rep. Guy Reschenthaler, R-Pa., the chief deputy majority whip, and co-sponsored by six other Republicans: Reps. Michael Waltz, of Florida; Andrew Ogles, of Tennessee; Chuck Fleischmann, of Tennessee; Paul Gosar, of Arizona; Barry Moore, of Alabama; and Troy Nehls, of Texas.\n\nReschenthaler tweeted about the effort earlier this week. \"Freedom. Prosperity. Strength. That's what America stood for under the leadership of President Donald J. Trump - the best president of my lifetime,\" Reschenthaler wrote in a post on X . \"And that's why I'm introducing legislation to rename Dulles as the Donald J. Trump International Airport.\"\n\nThe airport, opened in 1962, is named after John Foster Dulles, who served as secretary of state under President Dwight D. Eisenhower from 1953 to 1959.\n\nI'm a reporter for NBC News covering Capitol Hill, elections and the intersection of politics and public policy in Washington.

The political news cycle that ensued - and was still going Monday with speculation about the sustainability of Biden's candidacy - is not one that Trump is eager to promptly flush out by introducing his running mate.\n\n\"What's the old adage? Never get in the way of your enemy while they are destroying themselves,\" a Republican familiar with the discussions said. \"I think that applies here. It's been Biden's week for all the wrong reasons; let them keep it.\"\n\nTrump has said he knows who his running mate will be, while sources close to the process continue to describe a search focused on three finalists : Gov. Doug Burgum of North Dakota, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.\n\nThe window for a decision and an announcement is narrowing. Trump has publicly expressed a preference to reveal his pick closer to, or at, the Republican National Convention, which begins July 15 in Milwaukee. Previous high-level discussions about the rollout had focused on the days around his sentencing next week, July 11, on 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nIt's not clear whether an announcement this week is off the table - given Trump's love for theatrics, a surprise reveal could come at any moment. But a prominent Republican fundraiser said that, at this point, it makes little sense for Trump to announce before the sentencing. Aside from the Biden debate fallout, the Supreme Court ruled Monday that Trump has immunity for some of his conduct as president in his federal election interference case.\n\n\"If the debate went badly, sure, I think we would know,\" the fundraiser said. \"But with so much turmoil going on ... I don't know why he would do it in the middle of all this.\"\n\nA veteran GOP operative familiar with the rollout discussions agreed.\n\n\"There is so much up in the air that there is no reason for them to act quickly after what happened in Atlanta,\" the operative said. \"There could be someone else nominated by Democrats - how does that potentially change things? Waiting for now makes all the sense in the world.\"\n\nTrump's closest aides have offered few clear reads into the process and the timeline, though senior adviser Chris LaCivita acknowledged on social media last week that the announcement could come any time between then and the convention.\n\n\"As President Trump has said himself, the top criteria in selecting a Vice President is a strong leader who will make a great President for eight years after his next four-year term concludes,\" Trump senior adviser Brian Hughes said in a written statement offered for this article - and nearly every other report written about the running mate search in recent weeks. \"But anyone telling you they know who or when President Trump will choose his VP is lying unless that person is named Donald J. Trump.\"\n\nA former senior adviser who remains close to Trump and has discussed the search with him felt comfortable making a more decisive observation.\n\n\"If Biden hadn't bombed that debate,\" the former adviser said, \"we'd know who Trump's VP choice was by now.\"\n\nI am a senior national political reporter for NBC News, based in Cleveland.

      "text": "Trump tries and fails to call the shots on Capitol Hill (again)\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nBy Steve Benen\n\nAs the deadline for a government shutdown approached, lawmakers on Capitol Hill were intently focused on a stopgap spending measure. Donald Trump was not.\n\nIn fact, the president-elect didn't say much of anything about Congress's continuing resolution as it took shape, and he was equally silent when leaders unveiled a bipartisan agreement on Tuesday. On Wednesday, however, after Elon Musk targeted the bipartisan deal with misinformation , Trump decided to intervene , too, condemning the legislation and making new, 11th-hour demands .\n\nA day later, House Republican leaders crafted an alternative package, which appeared designed to placate the incoming president. At least initially, they succeeded: Trump published an enthusiastic endorsement of the GOP-only bill to his social media platform, directing \"all Republicans\" to vote for it in order to \"do what is best for our Country.\"\n\nHours later, the Trump-endorsed bill failed in an embarrassing fashion - in part because so many Republicans ignored the president-elect's directive. The New York Times reported :\n\nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump's hammerlock on the Republican Party was shaken on Thursday night when 38 of his party's lawmakers in the House voted to defy his command to support a spending and debt deal. ... [W]ith just a month left before he returns to office, Mr. Trump found out that at least some of his followers were willing to buck his leadership in the right circumstances.\n\nThere's obviously no denying that Trump is the dominant voice in contemporary Republican Party politics. Indeed, a great many observers have made the case that the modern GOP often resembles a personality cult surrounding the president-elect, and those arguments are quite persuasive. The Times' report added that Trump has \"methodically seized control of the Republican Party at all levels,\" which is undeniably true.\n\nBut what often goes overlooked is that when it comes to events on Capitol Hill, the incoming president likes to bark orders, but GOP members don't always follow them. That's in part because Trump still has no idea how to persuade policymakers and in part because some lawmakers have ideological preferences that eclipse Trump's demands.\n\nThis happens more often than some in the party like to admit, especially in the wake of Trump's 2020 defeat. Earlier this year, for example, Congress weighed how and whether to reauthorize the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). Trump intervened in the hopes of derailing the effort, directing Republicans to \"KILL FISA\" because of a misguided conspiracy theory.\n\nTrump failed: Congress reauthorized FISA with ample support from GOP lawmakers who felt comfortable ignoring his orders.\n\nA day later, as the Republican-led House prepared to take up U.S. security aid for Ukraine, Trump didn't explicitly denounce the legislation, though he wasn't especially subtle about his opposition. GOP leaders brought the bill to the floor anyway, and it passed with over 300 bipartisan votes .\n\nThese are not isolated incidents. Trump told House Republicans to elect Rep. Jim Jordan as House speaker, and that didn't happen . Trump told Republicans to shut down the government in September 2023, and that didn't happen. Trump told Republicans to use the debt ceiling to default on the country's obligations , and that didn't happen.\n\nAs regular readers might recall , Trump also told Senate Republicans to replace Mitch McConnell as the Senate minority leader, and they didn't . Trump told Republicans to derail a bipartisan infrastructure package, and they didn't. Trump seemed especially eager for GOP lawmakers to kill an overhaul of the Electoral Count Act, and they didn't do that, either.\n\nThere's a myth in some circles that Trump can call the shots and watch GOP lawmakers link arms and obediently follow his instructions.\n\nIn several notable instances, that's just not the case.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage .\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Donald Trump, Day 1: From the Politics Desk\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nWelcome to the online version of From the Politics Desk , an evening newsletter that brings you the NBC News Politics team's latest reporting and analysis from the campaign trail, the White House and Capitol Hill.\n\nIn today's edition, senior national political reporter Jonathan Allen looks at the first day of Donald Trump's hush-money trial, inside and outside of the courtroom. Plus, senior political editor Mark Murray breaks down how the public is viewing Trump's legal woes.\n\nSign up to receive this newsletter in your inbox every weekday here.\n\nInside a courthouse nestled between Tribeca and Chinatown on Monday morning, former President Donald Trump's lawyers argued with the district attorney's office over procedures for a hush-money case that could send an ex-commander in chief to prison for the first time in American history.\n\nJudge Juan Merchan advised lawyers that he was getting a little annoyed by the \"minutia.\" With a pool of 500 prospective jurors waiting, he wanted to get started with the process of picking 12.\n\nDo you have a news tip? Let us know\n\nThe judge also delivered Trump his \"Parker warnings,\" including that he could be jailed for contempt if he is absent without leave at any point during the trial. Trump, betraying little emotion, said he understood.\n\nOutside, in a sun-filled park across the street, peculiarity reigned over pedantry.\n\nA smattering of pro-Trump demonstrators - some wearing costumes, others carrying signs, one temporarily lowering the top of her dinosaur-themed one-piece before writhing on the ground in performative ecstasy - lent their support to the presumptive Republican nominee.\n\nThe presence of high-profile gawkers accentuated the carnival-like nature of the gathering: The Daily Show's Jordan Klepper, former Republican gubernatorial candidate Andrew Giuliani and filmmaker Alexandra Pelosi, a daughter of former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif.\n\n\"I never miss a freak show,\" the younger Pelosi, a longtime resident of nearby Greenwich Village, said.\n\nThe unlikely tandem of Klepper and Giuliani provided a clear window into a series of truths about this trial: The charges are at once the least consequential of the set pending against Trump and as fundamental to democracy as the question of whether special treatment - either targeting or protection - can be avoided in the case of such a powerful figure.\n\nAt times during the lengthy proceedings, the former president suggested disinterest or exhaustion by closing his eyes.\n\nMost of the jurors sat quiet and expressionless. Merchan emphasized his desire to shield their identities from the public, going so far as to warn the rival legal teams not to reproduce lists of their names. More than half of them were dismissed when they raised their hands to say they could not be impartial in this trial.\n\nOne dismissed prospective juror was overheard in a hallway saying, \"I just couldn't do it.\"\n\nFinding 12 adults with no particular feelings about Donald J. Trump, and the will to sit through a multi-week trial, is no easy feat. That process will continue inside Merchan's court. For the rest of the world, the \"freak show\" rolls along on the outside.\n\nRead more →\n\nIt's unclear how the criminal trial into the hush money charges against Trump will ultimately play out, but recent national polling gives us a good idea where voters stand on the matter.\n\nAt least for now.\n\nSizable majorities say the charges against Trump are serious: 64% of voters said the charges that Trump falsified business records concerning the payment of hush money to Stormy Daniels during the 2016 election are very or somewhat serious, according to an April Reuters/Ipsos poll .\n\nYet that's smaller than the share of voters who believed the charges in the other criminal cases are serious - such as trying to overturn the 2020 election results (74%), pressuring Georgia state officials to overturn the 2020 election (72%) and illegally removing classified documents (69%).\n\nA recent New York Times/Siena College poll also found 58% of registered voters saying the hush-money charges are \"very\" or \"somewhat\" serious, including 30% of self-identified Republicans.\n\nViews about Trump's guilt are divided along party lines: But the same NYT/Siena poll showed a smaller share of voters (46%) believing that Trump should be found guilty in the hush-money case, while 36% said he should be found not guilty; another 18% say they didn't know or refused to answer.\n\nAnd look at the results by party:\n\nThe general election ballot slightly shifts if Trump is found guilty: Finally, the January 2024 national NBC News poll showed a slight shift in the horse race between Trump and President Joe Biden when voters are asked about their opinions *if* Trump is ultimately convicted of a crime.\n\nIn the original ballot test, Trump was ahead of Biden by 5 points among registered voters, 47% to 42%, which was within the poll's margin of error.\n\nBut when voters were asked - on the survey's final question - about their ballot choice if Trump is convicted of a crime, Biden jumped ahead of Trump by 2 points, 45% to 43%.\n\nThat's a 7-point swing.\n\nA caveat about that hypothetical, however: It assumes voters would see a conviction is fair and square. But as we all know, Trump has already spent months trying to cast the prosecution as unfair and politically motivated.\n\nThat's all from The Politics Desk for now.

Joe Wilson is known to national audiences, the South Carolina Republican might be remembered as the congressman who heckled Barack Obama during an address to Congress , shouting, \"You lie!\" (The Democratic president was not, in fact, lying.)\n\nNearly 16 years later, however, Wilson might soon be known for a different kind of presidential response. The State newspaper in South Carolina reported :\n\nThose who carry cash would have a denomination as an option with President Donald Trump's face, at least under the idea of one of South Carolina's congressmen. U.S. Rep. Joe Wilson, R-Springdale, a staunch supporter of Trump, says he's planning to propose a $250 dollar bill to include the president's portrait.\n\nThis is, evidently, an actual legislative proposal, called the Donald J. Trump $250 Bill Act, which according to Wilson's press release , would direct \"the Bureau of Printing and Engraving to design and print a $250 dollar bill of legal U.S. tender that bears the image\" of the incumbent Republican president.\n\nWhat about an existing federal law that prohibits any living person from being depicted on U.S. currency? The GOP congressman has apparently thought of that, too: Wilson's bill would create a one-time exception to the legal prohibition.\n\n(The press release also features a mockup of what the $250 dollar bill would look like. The image was created, of course, by way of the AI program built into Elon Musk's social media platform.)\n\nFor good measure, let's also note the fact that three sitting Republican members of Congress - Reps. Diana Harshbarger of Tennessee, Ralph Norman of South Carolina and Darrell Issa of California - signed on to Wilson's bill as original co-sponsors.\n\nTo be sure, it's tempting to ignore this silly legislative effort, which will almost certainly go ignored, but there's a larger pattern that's worth appreciating.\n\nNearly two weeks ago, for example, Republican Rep. Claudia Tenney of New York introduced legislation to make Trump's birthday a federal holiday . The GOP congresswoman, in apparent seriousness, argued that such a move would \"recognize him as the founder of America's Golden Age.\"\n\nAs regular readers might recall , that bill came on the heels of a bill intended to carve Trump's face into Mount Rushmore , which came on the heels of a measure to allow Trump to seek a third term .\n\nThere are also pending bills to rename Washington Dulles International Airport after Trump, as well as legislation to \"expunge\" Trump's first two impeachments.\n\nAs The New York Times recently summarized , \"A competition of sorts has broken out for whom the Republican base will see as the most pro-Trump member.\" From the article:\n\nThe rush of flattering legislation, some of which even the lawmakers concede is unlikely to pass, stands apart from merely carrying out Mr. Trump's agenda. ... \"It shows the power that Donald Trump has within the Republican Party these days, and that Republican members want to stay on his good side,\" said Sean M. Theriault, government professor at the University of Texas at Austin. \"A lot of these people are in really safe districts, but they're also thinking about what their next step is. And so if they have designs on being in the Senate or running for governor or even a position in the administration, then there's no better way to get on his good side than to do these over-the-top moves toward him.\"\n\nThis was published before Wilson's and Tenney's bills were introduced.\n\nI'm reminded anew of the response to the Ogles bill from Filipe Campante, a professor at Johns Hopkins University: \"The reason why this is bad is the very fact that it's transparently ridiculous: It shows how this is becoming a Kim Jong-Un-style cult of personality, where the sycophants try to outdo one another in their groveling to get the attention of Dear Leader.\"\n\nThat competition, alas, is apparently getting more intense.\n\nThis post updates our related earlier coverage .\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Trump in the form of a coin\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nThe vast majority of Americans will never receive a presidential \"challenge coin.\" That's because they're nearly always handed quietly to U.S. military officers and troops from sitting presidents, as a gesture of gratitude for their service.\n\nAs the Washington Post reported the other day the \"distinguished-looking coins\" have now \"undergone a Trumpian transformation.\"\n\nThe presidential seal has been replaced by an eagle bearing President Trump's signature. The eagle's head faces right, not left, as on the seal. The 13 arrows representing the original states have disappeared. And the national motto, \"E pluribus unum\" -- a Latin phrase that means \"Out of many, one\" -- is gone.Instead, both sides of the coin feature Trump's campaign slogan, \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nChallenge coins used to be modest, thin, made in subdued colors, and limited to military members. Donald Trump's challenge coins are big, thick, gold, and \"may be distributed at campaign rallies and to donors.\"\n\nIn fact, under this president, the coin isn't even round anymore: as the Post added , this new iteration of the coin is \"designed to literally stand on its own,\" featuring \"a ribbon-shaped banner\" bearing Trump's name in capital letters, which \"doubles as a rocking-horse-style base.\"\n\nAnd before you think some over-eager White House intern was responsible for these changes, let's not overlook the fact that the same article noted that Trump \"was personally involved in redesigning the coin.\"\n\nThe result is a coin that captures the essence of this president -- his narcissism, his disregard for American traditions, his need for ostentatious celebrations of himself -- in one oddly shaped disc.\n\nI can appreciate why this seems a little too easy, but I'd love to know what would've happened if Barack Obama had done something like this. Imagine if the Democrat took the challenge coin, stripped it of the national motto and removed the bald-eagle emblem. Then imagine if Obama personally had a hand in making sure the coin featured his name -- three times -- while prominently featuring his campaign slogan.\n\nThen imagine the Obama White House signaled his intention to make the challenge coin available to rally attendees and donors, instead of military personnel.\n\nWould he ever have heard the end of it?\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

The question now is whether he will suffer politically for his crimes.\n\nThe first former American president convicted at trial - found guilty Thursday on all 34 counts of scheming to help his 2016 campaign by covering up an alleged sexual encounter - Trump rallied quickly to raise money and votes from the verdict.\n\nHe blasted out a fundraising message to donors just minutes after the jury finished its work, and he vowed in the courthouse that \"the real verdict is going to be Nov. 5 by the people\" when he faces President Joe Biden in a rematch of their 2020 election.\n\nBiden agreed.\n\n\"There's only one way to keep Donald Trump out of the Oval Office: At the ballot box,\" he said in a statement posted to X along with a link to donate to his campaign. He took no victory lap, uttered no insult and offered no prediction of Trump's political demise.\n\nTrump also called himself a \" political prisoner \" in another fundraising appeal shortly after the verdict, even though he is not in prison.\n\nThere is simply no precedent for a convicted candidate's carrying a major party's banner into a general election. Many political experts say it is too early to tell whether the outcome will add fuel to Trump's campaign or make it toxic to persuadable voters.\n\n\"What no one knows yet is what independent and swing voters are going to do,\" said Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist who has worked on multiple presidential campaigns.\n\nDemocrats who spoke to NBC News on Thursday were split on whether Biden might get a bump from the verdict, with some seeing genuine upside to Trump's troubles and others expressing more doubt.\n\n\"This is the result we wanted and is another talking point against Trump but doesn't mean a lot for actual votes,\" said a Biden campaign official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to give an assessment without fear of retribution.\n\nOn the other side of the political divide, Republicans followed Trump's lead, voicing confidence that the jury's decision would create a powerful backlash in his favor.\n\nJames Blair, political director for the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee, conducted a conference call with GOP state party chairs shortly after the result was made public, according to two people who were on the call.\n\n\"There's a clear message they want us to convey,\" a participant said of Trump's political apparatus. \"It is an unjust witch hunt. We will appeal, and we will win the appeal. Guys, we just elected the next president of the United States.\"\n\nIf anyone has a playbook for this moment, it is Trump. He rode Republican outrage over his indictments in two federal and two state cases to a political rebound that helped him secure a third straight Republican nomination this year.\n\nLacking evidence of any coordination between Biden and the New York prosecutors who tried the case - much less the dozen jurors who voted unanimously to convict him on all counts - Trump nonetheless accused the president of abusing his power to harm a rival.\n\n\"This was done by the Biden administration in order to wound, to hurt a political opponent,\" Trump said at the courthouse.\n\nHis son Donald Trump Jr., reviving a controversial fram ing from Trump's presidency , said in a social media post that the U.S. is now a \"s---hole\" country.\n\nWhile Biden took a more subdued approach to the verdict Thursday, some Democrats said it should help him sway voters.\n\n\"The jury verdict affirms that former President Donald J. Trump is an unprecedented criminal who occupied the Oval Office and seeks to do so again,\" said Rep. Joaquin Castro, D-Texas. \"Joe Biden needs to remind all Americans of good conscience that such a person is completely unfit to serve as president. He's clearly a danger to democracy.\"\n\nA longtime Democratic operative said the trial is \"all upside for Biden,\" in part because it will remind voters of \"the chaos of [Trump's] presidency.\"\n\nTo the extent that undecided voters are dissatisfied with Biden, the operative said, \"I don't think this helps Trump become more appealing with that group.\"\n\nTrump runs the risk of blowing a political opportunity if he leans too heavily into his personal animus against Biden, Republican strategist Brad Todd said.\n\n\"Alvin Bragg and 12 New Yorkers just elected Donald Trump - if he plays his cards right,\" Todd said, referring to the Manhattan prosecutor whose office tried the case. To do that, Todd said, Trump has to make sure that his response is aimed at voters: \"not about him, but about them.\"\n\nThat is already taking the form of Trump and his campaign arguing that Democrats are trying to use the court system to deny the public a choice in the election.\n\n\"This is outrageous,\" said Brian Ballard, a Florida lobbyist who raises money for Trump. \"It's going to help not just with small-dollar donors but with everything. The intensity both from a fundraising standpoint and from just a political energy standpoint is going to be huge. Whatever Democrats hoped to get out of this has backfired.\"\n\nIt is not clear that Republicans would have portrayed any verdict - conviction, acquittal or a hung jury - as a political defeat for Trump. And there can be little doubt that he would prefer to have avoided the criminal label.\n\nNews that the jury had reached a verdict circulated through the Trump and Biden camps in the minutes before the convictions were returned.\n\nBiden's camp scrambled to send messaging guidance to operatives once Trump had been pronounced guilty - but not before - according to a person familiar with internal deliberations.\n\nIn Trump's orbit, there were signs that a conviction would not be seen as the full victory that some in the party were quick to claim.\n\n\"The quickness of this decision is probably not a good sign,\" a senior Trump campaign official said just before the jury rendered its judgment.\n\nJonathan Allen reported from Washington, D.C., and Matt Dixon from Tallahassee, Florida.\n\nI am an award-winning reporter and New York Times-bestselling author covering national politics for NBC News.

After all, the coin of the realm in Trump's domain is defending the big guy in tough, televised interviews.\n\nBut the younger Giuliani, a Trump White House official in his own right, was worried enough about the outcome - and aware enough of the art of video editing - that he asked an associate to make his own recording of the full interview.\n\nAdditional cameras seldom provide additional protection, and this case was no exception. Pelosi couldn't help but watch the scene unfold.\n\nKlepper wasn't interested in the high-stakes trial inside. Many Democrats are more exercised about the other charges Trump faces - he has been indicted in federal and Georgia courts for efforts to overturn the 2020 election and in another federal court over allegations that he illegally retained classified documents.\n\nWhat Klepper wanted to know - with Giuliani amounting to a stand-in for his father - was whether Trump's rhetoric would lead to violence. Trump recently said in a fundraising email that \"all hell\" would break loose at his trial. Before the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol, Trump told supporters that \"if you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore.\"\n\nGiuliani noted that the crowd outside the courthouse was definitively peaceful. Then, he went further.\n\n\"I was in Washington, D.C., on Jan. 6, as well,\" he said. \"I was with President Trump. I remember him talking about peacefully protesting.\"\n\nThat was the gotcha moment Klepper was waiting for.\n\n\"Some people were talking about peaceful protest,\" Klepper said. \"Some people also on Jan. 6 were talking about 'trial by combat.' Do you know anybody who was talking about that?\"\n\nIt was Rudy Giuliani who had called for \"trial by combat\" at the Trump rally preceding the sacking of the Capitol. His son declined to identify him. The interview turned more, well, combative after that.\n\n\"Oh, funny guy,\" Andrew Giuliani said with disdain. \"Let's get a brain in there.\"\n\nAlmost lost in the exchange was the message Giuliani wanted to deliver: that Democrats are trying to take Trump \"off the campaign trail,\" which amounts to \"the death of our constitutional republic.\"\n\nLike most satire, Klepper's interview was revealing.\n\nIt was a reminder that the hush money trial has much less to do with whether Trump is fit to serve as president than the election interference and classified documents cases - even though it carries with it the grave potential consequence of a major-party nominee's being convicted of a crime during the stretch run of a presidential campaign.\n\nTrump's critics argue that his push to silence porn actress Stormy Daniels amounts to an illegal benefit to his own 2016 campaign. He shouldn't be above the law, they contend, just as his allies argue he has been unjustly targeted for political purposes.\n\nThe spur-of-the-moment on-camera exchange between Giuliani and Klepper, two figures deeply engaged with American politics, also reflected and underscored the degree to which the right and left talk past each other.\n\nNeither suggested that the trial is important because it will determine whether Trump committed crimes.\n\nKlepper tried to sidestep that question. Giuliani used the trial as a foil for the argument that Trump is being persecuted.\n\nIt could be easy to forget, amid the onlookers, that the jurors will render a decision as simple and prosaic as whether one man broke the law by falsifying documents and as consequential as whether a former president, and current candidate, should be held accountable.\n\nRepublican strategist Matthew Bartlett, who wasn't at the trial, said the political landscape may not change based on the outcome.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I'm not sure this trial about a transaction from 2016 will have a superseding effect on what voters want for policy and a vision for the future of the country,\" he said.\n\nOutside the first day of the trial smacked of a Ringling Bros. production. Inside the courtroom, just across Centre Street, the solemn nature of the work ahead was evident.\n\nWhen the first group of 96 prospective jurors passed through metal detectors and into the courtroom around 2:30 p.m., filling every available seat, Trump twisted his neck to take a look. He later stood and turned to acknowledge them when he was named as the defendant.\n\nAt times during the lengthy proceedings, he suggested uninterest or exhaustion by closing his eyes.\n\nMost of the jurors sat quietly and expressionless. Merchan emphasized his desire to shield their identities from the public, going so far as to warn the rival legal teams not to reproduce lists of their names. More than half of them were dismissed when they raised their hands to say they couldn't be impartial in the trial.\n\nOne dismissed prospective juror was overheard in a hallway saying, \"I just couldn't do it.\"\n\nFinding 12 adults with no particular feelings about Donald J.

Trump International Airport.\" It perfectly sums up the GOP's approach to governing.\n\nCongress has been in recess these past two weeks, though you'd be hard-pressed to notice the difference. That's because the feckless, spectacle-driven GOP House majority has stripped down the exercise of legislative power to a set of content-free directives that run more or less on autopilot. Exhibit A would be a bill filed last Friday to rename one of the Washington area's major airports. In 1998, GOP lawmakers rechristened the anodyne National Airport in honor of Ronald Reagan-the man who broke the air traffic controllers' union. Today's MAGAfied Republican Congress has put forward the proposal to rename Dulles Airport after Donald Trump-the man who, just days after his inauguration, transformed the nation's airports into theaters of bigoted anti-Muslim persecution , and promptly bankrupted his own eponymous airline back in the 1990s. Indeed, the only remotely plausible case to name Dulles for Trump is that the facility's sweeping Eero Saarinen terminal design recalls the 45th president's hairline.\n\nYou'd be forgiven for concluding that hatred of air travel has been a central plank of the Republican platform over the past generation, but in reality the legislation is simply the 118th Congress's latest foray into transforming the people's business into MAGA-branded trolling. Deputy House whip Guy Reschenthaler proudly announced his sponsorship of the bill on Twitter, with this burst of Great Leader adulation : \"Freedom. Prosperity. Strength. That's what America stood for under the leadership of Donald J. Trump-the greatest president of my lifetime. And that's why I'm introducing legislation to rename Dulles the Donald J. Trump International Airport.\" Rechenthaler neglected to add that his stunt bill would be dead on arrival in a Democratic-led Senate-and that, even if it should by some unimaginable feat of legerdemain survive that gauntlet, it would never be signed into law by President Joe Biden, who is after all, Trump's general-election opponent this November. Meanwhile, Democratic representatives from Virginia, where Dulles is located, have done some gleeful trolling of their own. \"Donald Trump is facing 91 felony charges,\" Representative Gerry Connolly drily noted . \"If Republicans want to name something after him, I suggest they find a federal prison.\"\n\nBut none of that matters to today's congressional GOP. For a party obsessed with the alleged trespasses of woke virtue signaling, the Republicans have nonetheless commandeered all phases of the legislative process to telegraph their own insular devotion to the Trump cult. In that sense, the Dulles bill is entirely in line with the House's pending post-recess agenda, which as Politico reporter Jennifer Haberkorn notes, will be overrun with investigations to supplant the chamber's comically doomed 18-month effort to force a vote on Biden's impeachment.\n\n\"The search for a fresh line of attack has a scattershot feel to it,\" Haberkorn writes diplomatically, as she surveys a rich mosaic of Biden-baiting inquiries that have so far produced 50 oversight requests to various executive-branch agencies. Subjects for post-impeachment probes cover everything from the origins of Covid-19 (even though said origins date from Trump's presidency) to the administration's allegedly dilatory drawdowns of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (even though Biden's White House has conducted such drawdowns at historic new highs ). A prime focus in this throw-shit-against-the-wall investigative offensive will be administration's supposed posture of China appeasement (even though Biden has aggressively countered market-throttling Chinese tech initiatives and trade putsches in a way that Trump never did ).\n\nBut again, never mind: The China inquiries will tightly align House gavel activity with a key theme in Trump's election campaign, while unleashing no end of neo-McCarthyite grandstanding on the right. \"You look at the Biden administration, there's no question in my mind that they've had a soft-on-China policy,\" House Oversight Committee chair James Comer (R-KY) said during a recent podcast interview. The net result of the White House's invertebrate stance, he explained, was to \"put China first and America last.\"\n\nOne awkward obstacle for this jingoist messaging is that the sitting head of the House Select Subcommittee on Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party is Republican Representative Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin-who announced just before the House's last recess that he'd be leaving Congress by the end of this month. Yet such considerations won't long detain Comer and other MAGA inquisitors on the Hill: Gallagher's  committee was mostly a wonkish policy outfit, and the chair's interest in cobbling together workable policy frameworks is plainly out of step with the corps of Inspector Javerts charged with setting the House's agenda. Who needs to bother with all the messy work of governing, after all, when you can charter one MAGA flight of fancy after another through the House hearings calendar? There already is a Donald J. Trump International Airport, and it's the US House of Representatives.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Trump was convicted in his criminal trial outside of Manhattan Criminal Court in New York City, on May 30.\n\nOn Thursday evening, as business began to wind down at the courthouse in Downtown Manhattan, Donald J. Trump was finally held to account. Twelve New Yorkers found the former president guilty on all 34 felony counts in his New York City trial. After all the armchair commentary about this being a weak case, about District Attorney Alvin Bragg being out of his depth, about this being a legal theory of accountability built on quicksand, in the end it took the jurors less than two days of deliberation to come to a unanimous verdict on all counts.\n\nGuilty. Or, in Trump social media-speak, GUILTY!!!!!\n\nLet that sink in: Donald J. Trump, the GOP's presumptive nominee for president, a man who has spent his entire life making up his own rules of engagement, has been convicted of felony charges by a jury of his peers. Add that to a résumé that now includes two impeachments, liability for sexual abuse, tens of millions of dollars in fines for defamation, hundreds of millions of dollars in fines for his company's committing fraud, and three additional felony trials pending.\n\nIn normal times, all of those Republicans who have spent the past years sidling up to Trump would now start gradually sidling away. They might not like the premises of the charges Bragg brought against Trump, but they would find ways to say \"for the good of the party and the country, we urge ex-president Trump to step aside and withdraw his candidacy for the president of the United States.\" In this Trump-cult era, however, that won't happen. In case any Republicans were thinking of jumping ship, the House leadership immediately circled the wagons. Speaker Mike Johnson was quick out of the gate to declare the jury's verdict \"absurd\" and a \"shameful day in American history.\"\n\nAnd so, this American nightmare will continue, except now Trump's bid for the presidency is nothing more or less than a vengeance campaign against a legal system he has denounced as a web of corruption and political game-playing.\n\nOver the past several weeks, Trump has tried to preempt a guilty verdict by repositioning himself both as a politically persecuted martyr and also as a genuine Original Gangster, a bad-guy-tough-guy, a made man , a romantic desperado. He has repeatedly compared himself to Al Capone -not, of course, the broken man dying of syphilis after his release from Alcatraz, but the hero of working-class Chicago who waged a permanent war in the 1920s and early '30s against what Trump might term the deep state-the G-men, the Justice Department, the anti-racketeers, the tax agents-in the years before the government finally managed to bring him down. Trump has leaned into the notion that he will, if reelected, immediately pardon those convicted for their involvement in the January 6 insurrection. At a rally in the Bronx , he invited onto his stage two rappers indicted on charges of alleged conspiracy to commit murder. They bantered together and the rappers made the obligatory MAGA statements.\n\nTrump is, in these public performances, positioning himself as a Duterte-type character for whom criminal behavior is a boon rather than a curse, and he's banking on continually being able to shape his own image in the public eye as a strongman protector-of-the-nation type figure.\n\nLike everything else about the Teflon Don's life, however, it's all an act. Trump is no more Al Capone than he is Mother Teresa or Nelson Mandela -two other individuals whom he has, of late, compared himself to in his speeches. Sure, he's corrupt in his bones. But he's corrupt in a money-chiseling, bookkeeping kind of way. He's a small-time crook who bounces from one money-making or influence-peddling scheme to the next, rather than a master criminal. Look at Trump scowling and blustering and one sees a facsimile copy of a tough guy, a man who has made himself an avatar of what he thinks a hood cum politician looks like.\n\nWhich is why it was so delicious to see Robert De Niro standing outside the courtroom in New York this week, attacking Trump and mixing it up with the ex-president's diehard supporters .\n\nDe Niro also isn't a professional tough guy; he's an actor who plays tough guys. That, however, is where the comparison to Trump ends. For, unlike the 34-times convicted felon, De Niro plays Mean Streets characters really, really well, and has done so for more than half a century. Think of the menace of his Taxi Driver incarnation, of the incandescent fury of Raging Bull . Think of his Oscar-winning performance as Vito Corleone, in The Godfather Part II . Think, more recently, of the aging hit man he played to perfection in Scorsese's The Irishman and the sociopathic businessman he portrayed in Killers of the Flower Moon.\n\nLook at De Niro's scorching denunciation of the hecklers who accused the Capitol Police officers who stood up to the insurrectionists on January 6, 2021, of being \"traitors.\" There's a withering contempt when De Niro calls them gangsters , an \"I'll bury you with my tone, buddy\" message, that Trump, in his wildest dreams, couldn't come close to emulating. It was true cinema.\n\nThe newly minted felon-presidential candidate has always been good at projecting, ascribing to others what is clearly his own motive or behavior or reality. That's how he can explicitly advocate for creating a Justice Department infrastructure to round up political opponents and then, with a straight face, denounce his own indictments as being a political witch hunt. It's how he can accuse others of all kinds of treasonous acts while turning around and encouraging an armed uprising to prevent the peaceful transfer of power. It's how he can declare that his opponents are weakening America while he buddies up to miscellaneous strongman leaders around the world. And so on and so on.\n\nIt was, therefore, almost certainly projection when his campaign's knee-jerk response to De Niro's star turn outside the courthouse was to issue a broadside calling De Niro a \" washed up actor .\" Yes, one of these two septuagenarians is, indeed, a washed-up actor, but it surely isn't the man who received an Oscar nomination just this year for his performance in Killers of the Flower Moon .\n\nOn July 11, four days before the GOP convention begins, Trump will be sentenced. It's conceivable that he'll end up behind bars, especially if he keeps attacking the judge the way he did immediately after the verdict was announced. It's more likely that, just days before he is embraced by the GOP as the party's presidential nominee, he'll either be fined or sentenced to some form of house arrest. He might end up with probation. He could even be forced into community service-an ironic situation for a man who has done nothing selfless in his entire career. How fabulous it would be if, in the run-up to the election, Trump has to juggle his noxious, violent, xenophobic campaign rallies with, say, weekends spent working at homeless shelters, in drug treatment facilities, or ministering to sick migrant asylum-seekers.\n\nTrump's schtick is entertainment, which is why his numerous high crimes and misdemeanors, including alleged sexual violence and conspiracies to defraud the American public, his two impeachments, and his four state and federal trials, haven't so far hurt him with his legions of followers. But running for office as a convicted felon and a gangsta-candidate is an entirely different kettle of fish.\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJeet Heer\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nNow that a jury of his peers has convicted him, Trump knows that his Thug Nation show must go on-perhaps at a more frenzied pace, even, than has been the case up till now. If felon Trump wants to win the White House on a Bad Dude image, it's not a bad idea for the Biden team to roll out someone who has played tough guys awesomely well for a very, very long time to serve as his foil. De Niro has just the right persona to take it to Trump's goon squads, and, in his ripostes, to make these would-be toughs look small. He can say things that President Joe Biden, both by temperament and by virtue of the office he holds, cannot, and should not, say.\n\nDe Niro has Trump's number. Trump ain't Capone. He ain't the Godfather. At best, he's the hapless Fredo Corleone, the insecure loser-brother to the Big Man, the misfit who grifts and lies and cheats his way through life with no larger project in mind than self-advancement and petty pleasures.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Trump is entirely at the mercy of his own BS.\n\nA sign at The Wieners Circle, a popular hot dog restaurant in Chicago, in response to a statement made by former president Donald Trump during his Tuesday-night debate against Vice President Kamala Harris.\n\nMidway through Tuesday's debate, Donald Trump launched into a tirade about migrants stealing Americans' cats and dogs and devouring them. Trump made this bizarre allegation on national television as part of his ugly, nativist broadside against immigrants. But the claim, previously shared by his running mate , had already been debunked by local officials in the vicinity in which the events were rumored to have occurred.\n\nThe debate moderators pushed back against these outlandish claims. Trump dug in. After all, his crusade against non-white immigrants has always been story-driven-rather than based on any actual data-in an appeal to crude emotions rather than to reason. The MAGA-man had heard about the so-called pet eaters on television, he said; ergo, it must be true.\n\nIn the same debate, as Harris and the moderators pushed him on his attachment to conspiracy theories about the 2020 election, Trump made a revealing statement. He said that nameless advisers had told him that if he got more than 63 million votes, he was a shoo-in for reelection. Sure enough, he got more votes than that, but he still lost.\n\nIn Trump's mind, rather than that meaning that his opponent, Joe Biden, had gotten more votes than him in an election with historically high levels of voter turnout, it meant that he had been cheated out of his win. That's as myopic, as flat-out dumb, as the chess player who forgets that he has an opponent, fails to anticipate any of the moves coming in against him, loses the match, and then promptly denounces his opponent for rigging the game.\n\nPartly, this is Trump simply spouting Trumpian hyperbole. But I think it goes to a larger issue.\n\nDonald J. Trump is a gullible human being. The more time that passes, the more gullible he gets. Far from being the thoughtful genius of his inflated self-image, he is more akin to the slightly befuddled 78-year-old man surfing the Internet who gives away his passwords in response to a plea from a prince from some far-flung location who has a once-in-a-lifetime business opportunity he wants to pass along out of the kindness of his heart.\n\nThink about it: The far-right media says cats in Ohio are being eaten as appetizers. Trump thinks, \"Who am I to disagree?\" Sycophantic advisers tell Trump he must have won the 2020 election. Who is the failed erstwhile president to do a reality check?\n\nWe could all relate to Harris's putting on the facial expressions of a bemused, slightly sorrowful, relative looking at a family elder making a public spectacle of himself. And the way she treated this odious individual with sorrow rather than fury, to laugh in amazed exasperation rather than to try to debate him on these outlandish points. After all, if one's opponent is either too cynical or too foolish to distinguish truth from fantasy, why waste one's breath-and one's moment in the television spotlight-trying to put him back on the straight and narrow?\n\nBut, as Harris acknowledged, in his current state, Trump remains a huge threat to American democracy.\n\nUsually, failing candidates have enough self-awareness to not fully believe their own post-debate spin. In Trump's case, there is no sense of humility. He is now, a decade into his political career, entirely at the mercy of his own BS. Hours after the debate, deploying his finest elementary-school oratorical skills, MAGA-man told the world that he \" won the debate by a lot .\"\n\nSurrounded by yes-men desperate to prove their loyalty to the boss, Trump has convinced himself that he has a \"weave\" of oratorical genius . If audiences and commentators don't respond with appropriate enthusiasm, and if voters in November end up giving him another Bronx cheer, Trump's default belief system will kick in again: He didn't lose. He couldn't have lost-he was smarter and better-spoken than Harris, younger and better-looking than Harris... It must be a conspiracy! And once that part of his brain kicks into gear, it's only a short hop and skip to inciting post-election violence and political dirty tricks, much as he did in 2020.\n\nUnfortunately, there are many people in positions of power willing to go along with Trump on this autocratic ride. Board of Elections officials in Georgia are hard at work crafting new regulations that will make it far easier for local political figures to challenge the vote process and vote count in their jurisdictions. North Carolina Republicans have engaged in a full-court effort to empower the state legislature to take away authority from local elections boards-a power presumably to be used against big, urban, Democratic districts. Last week, the Associated Press reported that Republicans have already filed more than 100 lawsuits around the country challenging various parts of the voting process.\n\nAnd while 17 states have signed on to the National Popular Vote Compact , agreeing to allot their Electoral College votes to the winner of the popular vote once states representing more than half the total number of votes sign on to the compact, many GOP legislators are stampeding in the opposite direction. In Arizona over the past year, some lawmakers have tried to advance bills that would give the legislature broad powers to subvert the popular vote in the state-and the country-and essentially impose their presidential choice over the will of the people in order to install as president the loser of the popular vote. In 2020, conservative legislators in Wisconsin sought legal advice on whether they too could simply appoint their own electors.\n\nNone of this would matter if Trump were willing to say unequivocally that he would accept the election results even if they go against him. But, time and again, he has refused to do so. As a result, voters are heading into an election where, once again, they must face a brutal stress test of the nation's democratic infrastructure.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

Activate your online access\n\nThe country is about to be handed over to a band of fascists, and top Democrats are simply rolling over and waiting for the Republicans to tickle their tummies.\n\nDonald Trump souvenirs are displayed for sale at I Love DC Gifts ahead of the inauguration on January 16, 2025, in Washington, DC.\n\nOn Wednesday, Joe Biden gave a farewell address to the nation. If you missed it, you're not alone. Biden has been drifting off into the history books with startling rapidity, his presidency already reduced to a footnote between Trumpian chapters, his person diminished to the point of irrelevancy.\n\nAs usual, Biden's message was spot-on. Channeling Eisenhower and his warning of the rise of an unaccountable \"military-industrial\" complex, the outgoing president warned that America today is increasingly under the sway of the oligarchs spawned by a \" tech-industrial complex .\" These oligarchs, Biden noted, are using the high-tech infrastructure they control to corrode the public discourse, to confuse the public as to what is truth and what is falsehood, and to deliberately promote misinformation, all so that they can harvest more power and more wealth.\n\nElon Musk's personal fortune now stands at close to half a trillion dollars. Given the speed at which it is growing, he stands to become the world's first trillionaire in the not-too-distant future, with his business empire controlling everything from the cars of the future to the satellites vital to civilian and military infrastructure globally. That makes him a one-man superpower in his own right. Mark Zuckerberg isn't far behind him.\n\nCumulatively, Trump's cabinet and inner circle of billionaires is by far the wealthiest leadership cohort in the country's history, blending economic muscle and political clout in a quintessentially oligarchal manner. These men and women, some inside government, some simply cheerleading from the box seats in which they sit to enjoy the show, will, over the coming years, use political power to beget more economic power, and then turn around to use their economic power to consolidate their hold over the political process.\n\nAs I said, Biden's message was spot-on. After all, one can't look at Musk's outsize, and entirely destructive, current public role, his trolling of leaders around the world, his embrace of neo-Nazi politics, and not shudder. One can't look at Zuckerberg's craven embrace of Trump's \"If I say it, it's true\" philosophy, as well as his hosting of inauguration day parties feting Trump, and not be horrified at the tech titan's reincarnation as an enthusiastic midwife to fascism. But Biden's message, delivered in the hard-to-hear monotone that has come to define his image, no longer carries weight; the public has long since tuned the man out.\n\nAnd here's where I get really angry. Joe Biden had exactly one job when he assumed office after the 2020 election, and that was to craft a politics capable of neutralizing the MAGA movement and all of the extremism spewing forth from its leader's mouth. He had one job: to do everything in his power to make sure that Donald J. Trump could never again get within a mile of power and could never again use the power of the presidency to launch a full-on assault on American democracy. And Biden screwed that up. Not by a little bit, but in a volcanic eruption of incompetence. He failed again and again and again to sell his message, and, when it was clear the public wasn't buying what he was selling, he then failed to step aside in a timely manner to give another Democrat a viable chance of winning against a resurgent Trump.\n\nIt represents one of the most staggering displays of political malpractice in the history of democratic nations; and it's one that I dearly hope the history books hold Biden, who reportedly cares monumentally for his \"legacy,\" and his small circle of trusted confidants to account for.\n\nOne hundred years from now, I doubt anyone's going to remember the Inflation Reduction Act, but they sure as hell are going to remember Biden's late-Weimar dance-of-ineptitude as the forces of darkness gathered to storm America's citadel of power. Because come January 20, Trump will have pretty much unlimited power, thanks to the Supreme Court, and at the same time he will have a high-tech praetorian guard of social media tycoons magnifying his every word and attacking anyone who dares to stand in his way.\n\nSo although Biden is absolutely right to warn of an impending oligarchy, he was wrong not to apologize for dumping the country in the mess it is now in. Where was the humility, the acknowledgement of simply unfathomable political missteps over the past years?\n\nSpeaking of Democrats who aren't exactly standing on the side of decency or building a firewall against extremism, where are the senior party figures who are willing to absent themselves from an inauguration that will crown a would-be-tyrant, a convicted felon, a sexual abuser, as an unfettered, above-the-law president? To my knowledge, only Michelle Obama has had the courage to absent herself from a ceremony in which a lawless man will swear to protect and defend constitutional government. Her husband, Barack Obama, last seen making animated small talk with Trump at Jimmy Carter's funeral, will attend. So, too, will Bill and Hillary Clinton. It's an extraordinary act of legitimization for a man who has repeatedly spread blatant lies or falsehoods about, not to mention threatened to imprison, or worse, these same leaders who are now pledging to attend his ceremony, and whose supporters would likely have gone on a violent spree had he lost the election in November.\n\nAm I angry? Hell yes. The country is about to be handed over to a band of fascists and oligarchs; and top Democrats, feckless beyond even my own most pessimistic expectations, are rolling over and waiting for the Republicans to tickle their tummies instead of standing up for the concept of a pluralist, rationalist, empathic body politic.\n\nIt's MLK Day on Monday, a day when we generally pay homage to our pantheon of extraordinary progressive, radical men and women who have moved this country along the arc of justice in the profoundest of ways, even when confronted with the harshest forms of repression. This MLK Day, I will be resolutely ignoring the bleak news of the inauguration, and I will most certainly be ignoring those Democratic leaders who are making nice with a man whom, less than three months ago, they correctly identified as a fascist. Instead, I will be thinking of America's better angels, and hoping that a new generation of Democratic leaders soon emerges with the wherewithal to push back against the Trump juggernaut.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Activate your online access\n\nThe president-elect has made extraordinary statements recently about poaching land from other countries. It's tempting to write them off, but we must take him seriously.\n\nGraffiti on the sidewalk at the Trump International Hotel on December 23, 2024, in New York City.\n\nA little over four years ago, I wrote a political obituary of Donald J. Trump. My fervent hope then was that I was penning the grand finale about the national trauma that Trump had imposed on the country for four years; I wanted, somehow, to write us out of the political darkness that Trump had embodied during his term, then to take a long shower to scrub off the accumulated filth of covering this heinous figure for four years and to move on to sunnier topics.\n\nAlas, that dream was frightfully premature.\n\nHere we are, in 2025, careening toward another go-round of chaos, dysfunction, sadism, corruption, and sycophancy. Except this time around we cannot even say that we, as a country, voted for all of this in a fit of absence of mind. We cannot claim that we didn't know the full foulness of what Trump and Trumpism represent. We cannot plead ignorance to the pseudo-fascist catechism of the MAGA movement. Nor can we take solace in the fact that Trump got elected without winning the popular vote-since in 2024 he not only won the Electoral College vote but also won a plurality (and not-quite-but-almost a majority) of all the votes cast. This is, in other words, exactly what America now is.\n\nNearly half of voters in this country were willing to make a bargain with the political devil in exchange for a promise of lower egg prices at the supermarket and gas prices at the pump-and in exchange for permission to give their ids free rein to gang up on marginalized \"others,\" be they asylum seekers or trans youth. Their votes will now unleash the attack dogs in our culture.\n\nBut give the man his due. It's hard to imagine how the next four years will be boring. Hell, we're still more than two weeks out from Inauguration Day and the stock market has already become one giant roller-coaster ride . The various inchoate wings of the MAGA movement are in open warfare with one another over immigration policy and exactly how much xenophobia is too much. Elon Musk and Laura Loomer have been indulging in the X equivalent of an illegal cockfight-you know you're through the looking glass when Musk, who recently endorsed Germany's neo-Nazi AfD party , comes off as the voice of moderation in a debate on immigration policy. And bird flu is threatening to make the leap into the human population just when the conspiracy-mongering anti-vaxxer RFK Jr. is poised to take control over the Department of Health and Human Services.\n\nAnd none of that even touches on Trump's extraordinary proposals to upend the international order. Over the past few weeks, as he hovered in the wings to take power once more, Trump has signaled his foreign policy priorities, anchored around a string of threats to unilaterally impose tariff regimes not only against geopolitical rivals such as China but also against close allies of the United States, as well as a series of utterly extraordinary musings about poaching land from other countries -the Panama Canal from Panama, Greenland from Denmark, and Canada from... Canada.\n\nCNN labeled these plans as just an audacious geopolitical strategy akin to that which led to the Louisiana Purchase and the buying of Alaska from imperial Russia. It seems to me that in fact this is more about two German words beloved by the Nazis: Lebensraum and Anschluss. The former expressed the Nazi itch to expand eastward into lands lived in by people whom their racial theorists, such as Alfred Rosenberg , identified as being of a lower order of humanity than were the Aryan Germans. The latter expressed the idea of uniting all ethnic Germans into a single political unit-an idea that reached maturity with the absorption of the rump Austrian state into the Third Reich in March 1938.\n\nWhen Trump talks about seizing land in Panama, or appropriating Greenland and all its vast mineral resources without considering the will of the indigenous population that lives there, that is an updated version of the European colonial project of the 19th century and the fascist colonial project of the 1930s and '40s. When Trump deliberately needles Canadian leader Justin Trudeau by referring to him in social media posts as \" Governor Trudeau \" and speculates about absorbing Canada into the US as its 51st state, he is positing an Anschluss philosophy of Manifest Destiny updated for the 21st century; a worldview that believes all of wealthy North America, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the Gulf of Mexico to the Arctic, is, inherently, destined to fall under the governance of Washington, DC.\n\nThe temptation is to dismiss all of this as just the usual ugly trolling strategy of Donald J. Trump. And it's certainly possible that that's all it is. After all, in the 21st century, nobody in their right mind would possibly turn on an erstwhile friend and neighbor by seizing their land... Would they, Putin?\n\nBut it's also possible that Trump 2.0 is far more committed to an extreme political philosophy than was Trump 1.0. It is possible that this time around, drunk on his own power and belief in destiny, as well as his sense of political invulnerability, the near-octogenarian Trump will, as Putin did before him, allow his fascist instincts unfettered expression. After all, Trump has survived two impeachments, four criminal indictments, and two apparent assassination attempts, not to mention the fact that he was rewarded for his serial misbehavior by a Supreme Court ruling granting him virtual impunity and by a stunning election victory this past November. For a man of Trump's already vast narcissism and ego, such a string of good fortune can only come off as something akin to divine intervention. Indeed, he has explicitly suggested that God has saved him so that he can save a \"broken country.\"\n\nIf that is the case, I suspect we will see it play out not only domestically-with a full-frontal assault on the media and on academic freedoms, with political prosecutions and show trials, and a willingness to deploy the National Guard, and perhaps the US military, against protesters and against immigrants-but also fairly quickly in the international arena.\n\nTrump and his allies like to portray \"America First\" politics as the practice of peace-through-strength, of a United States concerned only with the well-being of its own citizens. In fact, what this gang of hoodlums is proposing is an America that uses, or threatens to use, brute military and economic force not only against established enemies but also, at least as importantly, against erstwhile friends. It is a might-is-right philosophy that views the world entirely in zero-sum terms, judging that what benefits the United States must, almost of necessity, hurt others; and, conversely, that what benefits others must, somehow, be seen as an intolerable rip-off of the good ole US of A.\n\nGiven such a calculus, why would Trump, who will soon control the most powerful military on earth, not bully allies to cede territory to him? Why would he not threaten to walk away from alliances unless allies pay to play? Why would he not grab key infrastructure assets, such as the Panama Canal, or at the very least coerce the governments who own those assets to make huge economic concessions, in order to maintain their sovereign integrity?\n\nI desperately hope that I'm wrong, and that Trump turns out to be more the troll than the tyrant. But, frankly, I'm not seeing too many signs of a cool, calm, and collected governing strategy emerging in this bizarre interregnum. What I am seeing, hiding in plain sight, is the erratic, perhaps senescent, nature of the would-be strongman, paraded on full, rancid, display before a global audience.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Activate your online access\n\nJoe Biden has created a distraction from the existential question that should define this election.\n\nThe 2024 presidential election, like the two previous ones, boils down to a simple question: Should the United States remain a representative democracy, or should it become a right-wing autocracy? Unfortunately, the crucial debate we should be having about Trump's fascism has been derailed in the wake of Joe Biden's terrible debate performance on June 28, which has made Biden's own fitness to continue as a nominee the most discussed topic in politics.\n\nDonald Trump's authoritarianism, which culminated in his refusal in 2021 to accede to the peaceful transfer of power and his incitement of a mob that attacked Congress, is well known. It has not receded in time but has only gotten worse. On Monday, The New York Times carried a story with this shocking headline : \"Trump Amplifies Calls to Jail Top Elected Officials, Invokes Military Tribunals.\"\n\nAccording to the article:\n\nFormer President Donald J. Trump over the weekend escalated his vows to prosecute his political opponents , circulating posts on his social media website invoking \"televised military tribunals\" and calling for the jailing of President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris, Senators Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer and former Vice President Mike Pence, among other high-profile politicians.\n\nMr. Trump, using his account on Truth Social on Sunday, promoted two posts from other users of the site that called for the jailing of his perceived political enemies.\n\nOne post that he circulated on Sunday singled out Liz Cheney, the former Wyoming congresswoman who is a Republican critic of Mr. Trump's, and called for her to be prosecuted by a type of military court reserved for enemy combatants and war criminals.\n\nWhile the prospect of Dick Cheney's daughter wearing an orange jumpsuit and locked up in Gitmo might offer some wry amusement to those who love historical irony, Trump is menacing not just the politicians he named but the rule of law itself. Nor are these threats merely rhetorical. Thanks to the Supreme Court's massive expansion of the domain of presidential immunity (which now encompasses anything that can be considered an official act), if he returns to the White House Trump would have license to commit crimes on a scale not seen since the heyday of the divine right of kings. As my Nation colleague Elie Mystal noted in his deft explication of the ruling ,\n\nTake the now-classic example of a president ordering Seal Team Six to assassinate a political rival. According to the logic of the Republicans on the Supreme Court, that would likely be an official act. According to their logic, there is also no way to prove it's \"unofficial,\" because any conversation the president has with their military advisers (where, for instance, the president tells them why they want a particular person assassinated) is official and cannot be used against them.\n\nTrump would be empowered by not only the judges he himself appointed in his first term but also by a Republican Party and conservative movement that has increasingly fallen under his sway. As amply documented by The Nation and other publications, the Trump agenda for a second term being prepared in Project 2025 by right-wing think tanks such as the Heritage Foundation involves a wholesale attack on guardrails of American democracy such as civil service neutrality. Trump and his political allies are preparing to reshape the federal government so that it ceases to be a bureaucracy with rules and norms and becomes instead the plaything of their whims.\n\nCelebrating the Supreme Court's expansion of presidential immunity, Heritage Foundation head Kevin Roberts on July 2 asserted that \"we are in the process of the second American Revolution, which will remain bloodless if the left allows it to be.\"\n\nNeither Trump's threats of violence, nor Robert's bloodcurdling prediction of Trump's leading a new American revolution are getting the attention they merit. Some liberals are blaming this on the media , saying they are amplifying the issue of Biden's age too much at the expense of more important stories.\n\nBut the Biden aging story is in fact completely legitimate. It's foolish to deny what more than 50 million Americans witnessed with their eyes and ears during the debate. It is a fact that Biden is facing calls withdraw his nomination from elected Democrats , big donors , major media outlets like The New York Times , and ordinary citizens.\n\nOn Wednesday, Biden met Democratic governors to reassure them that he is up to the job of being president and leading a campaign against Trump. According to the Times , Biden said \"he needed to get more sleep.... He repeatedly referenced pushing too hard and not listening to his team about his schedule, and said he needed to work fewer hours and avoid events after 8 p.m.\" Asked by Hawaii Governor Josh Green about his health, Biden responded that he was fine and \"it's just my brain.\" While this was meant as a joke, not everyone who heard the quip found it comforting. It fell into the disquieting category of a truth spoken in jest.\n\nThere's no shame in an 81-year-old man needing to cut back on his work schedule and get more sleep. We are biological creatures and aging is a natural part of life. But Biden has a uniquely demanding job which will become only more intense as the campaign heats up. If Biden needs more rest, the easiest way he can achieve that laudable goal is to quit his current job.\n\nBiden's remark to the governors should give great support to the push to have him resign as president now and for the Democrats to make Vice President Kamala Harris their nominee.\n\nImagine Biden getting all the sleep he needs in retirement while President Kamala Harris leads the charge against Trump's fascist threat. Imagine if Harris were holding rallies and giving daily interviews where she explains to the public what Project 2025 is and what Trump is threatening to do to both Republican and Democratic lawmakers. Imagine if President Harris were doing what President Biden has singularly failed to do in the last few months: make clear to the public the real stakes of the 2024 election.\n\nIn such a scenario, America would get the election they deserve, one where they could clearly repudiate a would-be dictator. But until Biden resigns, that clearly focused campaign on behalf of democracy cannot be launched.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

      "text": "'The Apprentice' Review: An Origin Story for Donald J. Trump\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nCritic's Pick\n\nIn this ribald fictional telling of a young Trump's rise, the man responsible is the lawyer Roy Cohn, played to sleazy perfection by Jeremy Strong.\n\nBy Manohla Dargis\n\nWhen you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission.\n\nMidway through \"The Apprentice,\" a gleefully vulgar fictional dramatization of the loves and deals of the young Donald J. Trump, the movie's look changes. From the start, the images have had the grainy quality that you sometimes see in films from the 1970s, which is when the movie opens. Then suddenly, while Donald - a terrific Sebastian Stan - is giving a TV interview in 1980, faint horizontal lines begin slicing across the image, evoking the flicker in analog video. It's a sly nod at the future and a brand-new reality: A (television) star is born.\n\n\"The Apprentice\" is arriving in theaters less than a month before the U.S. presidential election, but it would be a strain to call this energetic, queasily funny if finally very bleak portrait an October surprise. The real Trump's reaction to the movie suggested that it had the makings of a bombshell, though the most shocking parts of the movie have been reported elsewhere. His campaign called it \"garbage\" the day after its premiere at the Cannes Film Festival in May, and his lawyers sent a cease and desist letter to the filmmakers. Yet the only news here - and, really, the greatest surprise - is how thoroughly this ribald, at times predictably unflattering movie humanizes its protagonist, a classic American striver.\n\nIn broad strokes, \"The Apprentice\" recounts a familiar story of individual empowerment and (gilded) bootstraps through Donald, who hungers for the very best, or at least shiniest, that life can offer, be it women, clothing, swank digs or amber waves of hair. Like the hero in a Horatio Alger tale, except with, you know, family money and connections, Donald finds success partly through his association with a slithery lawyer, Roy Cohn (Jeremy Strong, fantastic), who was Senator Joseph R. McCarthy's chief counsel during the Senate's 1950s investigations into Communist influence in the United States. Roy becomes Donald's mentor, helping him achieve his American dream that here has the makings of a nightmare.\n\nThe director Ali Abbasi thrusts you right in the scrum, opening on Donald as he navigates the outwardly mean, trash-choked streets of Times Square. It's 1973, and New York seems to be on the ropes. Parts of the city look like they've been bombed, and its rats are on the march. It's tough out there, even for ambitious go-getters. Yet Donald, who's in his late 20s and works for the Trump family's sprawling real-estate business - he knocks on residential tenant doors to personally collect the rent - has grandiose plans to revive the struggling city and make his fortune by giving a hulking, rundown Midtown hotel a classy makeover.\n\nDonald's aspirations for that hotel, the Commodore, become the first in a series of ladder rungs he grasps on his upward climb through the 1970s and into the go-go '80s. Working from a script by Gabriel Sherman, Abbasi tracks Donald's high points and low on his transformational journey, which takes him from testy meals in his parents' Queens home and into Manhattan's corridors of power, its boardrooms and party dens. Whether in the back seat of a stretch limo or riding along with Roy Cohn in a Rolls, Donald is on the make and on the move. (Sherman wrote \"The Loudest Voice in the Room,\" a biography of the Fox News executive Roger Ailes; Abbasi's directing credits include \"Holy Spider.\")\n\nDonald's path, as it were, proves grim and glittering by turns, and is lined with shrewd wheedling, outlandish excesses, sketchy characters and anguished family drama. There's also somewhat of a fork in his road, symbolized by his relationship with Roy and his romance with a feisty, skeptical Czech model, Ivana (an appealing Maria Bakalova). The movie suggests that Ivana is good for Donald and maybe a potential lodestar, but he's in thrall to Roy and to his father, Fred (an unrecognizable Martin Donovan). A tyrant who berates his grown children at the family dining-room table, especially his eldest son, Freddy (Charlie Carrick), Fred is the father Donald conspicuously fears and whom he trades in for Roy.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump, is the chairman and chief executive.\n\nThe company is a property manager and developer specializing in luxury hotels, resorts, residential towers and golf courses worldwide.\n\nQ Your newest condo/hotel, Trump SoHo, opens on Friday. Is there a grand opening planned? A We're going to open subtly, then once we're back in the fall and the world's in a little better place, we'll do something a little more lavish. Given what's going on in the world and the economy, it didn't seem appropriate to do some major gala type of opening.\n\nQ How are sales and bookings?\n\nA We've sold a good number, but we haven't discussed that publicly. We've sold at about $2,900 a foot, on average, and the units are from under 500 feet to 10,000.\n\nWe're booking rooms. We're ramping up, and we're doing so at a lower rate: $389 initially. We want to get people in to see the building. There's nothing like it downtown. By fall, we hope to be north of $500 a night.\n\nQ What's your role in the project?\n\nA We weren't the developer. Our primary role has always been from the hotel management side.\n\nQ That means less financial risk.\n\nA It depends on the individual job - in this case, less so.\n\nPart of our business model has been to piggyback off the brand my father has created over the years. No one else really has that global brand recognition. We'll get involved in the aesthetic design. We're not necessarily the equity capital.\n\nQ Trump is developing and financing the Trump Scotland golf resort in Aberdeen, a project you supervise. How is that going?\n\nA We're under construction. We're going to be open for golf in about two years. We have 1,400 acres on the North Sea with dunes that step up over the beach - they go for 150 feet. It's a dream for a links golf course.\n\nThe housing component will phase in after that. We have 900 apartments, almost like a fractional ownership. We have villas and a 400-room hotel. We don't have any leverage on it; we've been building it out of cash.\n\nQ You're also supervising renovations at the Trump International Hotel and Tower. What's the status there?\n\nA We're doing it in two phases, so we don't have to take the building out of operation. The first phase is actually finishing now. It's a $25 million facelift. It's going to have a new contemporary feel.\n\nQ And you recently took over managing 40 Wall Street.\n\nA I'm taking over leasing. It's one of our downtown commercial buildings - a little different than what a lot of people would think of as \"Trump.\" At one point in time it was the tallest building in the world.\n\nOccupancy is probably north of 75 percent; a year ago it was probably in the 60s.\n\nQ So are you the heir apparent of the Trump Organization?\n\nA We don't really talk about that. We have a great relationship - Ivanka, Eric and I - and that's always carried on despite what's going on in our family. We recognize that each of us has perhaps strengths and weaknesses. The first thing that's going to destroy a pretty good thing and perhaps a family dynasty would be any kind of infighting over who's the boss.\n\nAnd knowing my father, he's going to be around here for a long time. His father's expression was, \"to retire is to expire.\"\n\nQ But there's no doubt you have been groomed for your job.\n\nA Very much so. I joke that I have 32 years in real estate. When I spent time with my father it wasn't playing ball in the backyard. I came to his office and listened to him do business or sat in on meetings. I walked job sites. On Saturday, we'd see my grandfather in Queens for a couple hours and then he'd say, \"Let's go collect rent!\"\n\nMy father's not the type of person that teaches you by saying, \"Come here, son. I'm going to tell you about real estate.\" You learn by watching it. If you don't pick it up, it's your problem.\n\nQ Do you think your father is perhaps harder on you than other employees.\n\nA I think so because he expects a lot from us. He holds us to a very high standard because he doesn't like poor reflections on himself. He's very tough, but also fair.\n\nQ Do you like being on \"The Apprentice\" ?\n\nA I actually enjoy it. I resisted it when my father initially asked me to get involved. But you could only say no to him for so long.\n\nEffectively my job is to create a little controversy in the boardroom, call people out when they're full of it and create an interesting show. It's nice being on his side of the table for a change.\n\nInterview conducted and condensed by Vivian Marino.\n\nAdvertisement"

Trump is considering an executive order to allow TikTok to continue operating despite a pending legal ban until new owners are found, according to a person with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe possible executive order, reported earlier by The Washington Post , is under discussion as TikTok faces a deadline on Sunday to be banned in the United States unless it finds a new owner. The popular video-sharing app is owned by ByteDance, a Chinese company. Republicans have said for years that they see the app, which has been downloaded to millions of smartphones, as a national security risk. It has become a rare issue that has united both parties in Congress.\n\nIf the Supreme Court upholds the law, which will ban the app unless ByteDance sells it to a non-Chinese company, special treatment from Mr. Trump might be the only way for TikTok to continue operating in the United States in the near term. The law requires app store operators like Apple and Google and cloud computing providers to stop distributing TikTok in the United States.\n\nAn executive order could try to direct the government not to enforce the law or to delay enforcement to complete a deal, a move that past presidents have used to challenge laws. It is unclear if an executive order would survive legal challenges or persuade the app stores and cloud computing companies to take steps that could expose them to huge penalties.\n\nAlan Z. Rozenshtein, a former national security adviser to the Justice Department and a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School, said an executive order should be \"taken with a medium-sized boulder of salt.\" Such an order is not a law, he said, and legally would not change the legislation passed by Congress and signed by President Biden.\n\nWhile there is some speculation that the app will still work if it has already been downloaded, the law also affects internet hosting companies like Oracle and other cloud computing providers, and it is unclear how video load times and the functionality of the app may respond.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

Trump. Here's what a few said about why.\n\nBy Reid J. Epstein and Camille Baker\n\nBy the time former President Donald J. Trump was convicted last week on 34 felony counts, the vast majority of people had made up their minds about him.\n\nBut a small sliver of Trump-ambivalent voters is out there - and in a close presidential election, they matter a lot.\n\nFor days, The New York Times has been listening to those voters process the news of Mr. Trump's conviction, trying to measure the small shifts that could alter the contest between him and President Biden. Will Trump-leaning voters move firmly into his camp? Will Biden-leaning voters get off the fence?\n\nA New York Times/Siena College Poll study of nearly 2,000 voters found modest good news for Mr. Biden. While the vast majority of people had not changed their position on the two men, more voters moved away from Mr. Trump than toward him .\n\nFollow-up interviews with these post-verdict switchers offer a window into the minds of still-persuadable Americans. Despite the big events and dramatic headlines, these voters said they were generally not fans of either candidate, they were in no hurry to decide and they might not vote at all.\n\nHere's a look at how this small, but potentially crucial, group of voters is thinking about Mr. Trump's conviction and how it might affect their choice for president in November:\n\nMr. Lyons, 65, owns catering and welding companies and a boat storage facility. Earlier this year, he said he considered himself a Trump voter primarily because of his anger over Mr. Biden's economic policies - even though he said he opposed Republican attempts to limit abortion rights.\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "Donald J. Sobol, Creator of Encyclopedia Brown, Dies at 87\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Denise Grady\n\nDonald J. Sobol, the creator of Encyclopedia Brown, the clever boy detective who made bookworms of many a reluctant young reader, died on Wednesday in South Miami. He was 87.\n\nThe cause was gastric lymphoma, his son John said.\n\nMr. Sobol's books have been translated into 12 languages and have sold millions of copies worldwide, according to his publisher, Penguin Young Readers Group. He continued to write every day until a month or so before his death, his son said. The 28th book in the series, \"Encyclopedia Brown and the Case of the Soccer Scheme,\" is to be published in October.\n\nThe first Encyclopedia Brown book came out in 1963 (after being rejected by two dozen publishers, something Mr. Sobol liked to tell aspiring writers to encourage them not to lose faith in their work).\n\nMr. Sobol found a winning formula and stuck to it. Each book holds 10 stories, each involving a mystery that 10-year-old Leroy (Encyclopedia) Brown solves by keen observation and deduction. He notices that the culprit has his sweater on inside out, or claims to smell flowers that are fake. The rest is self-evident. The solution is not spelled out in the story; readers are challenged to figure it out for themselves - or to flip to the back for the answer, as Jack Nicholson's character in the movie \"About Schmidt\" does as he lies in bed, engrossed in \"Encyclopedia Brown Gets His Man.\"\n\nEncyclopedia never ages and never charges more than 25 cents an hour for his detective services. Mr. Sobol wanted each book to stand alone, so that children could start with any one in the series and read the books in any order. The first story in each book always explains that his father is the chief of police in their hometown, Idaville - named, unbeknown to most readers, for Mr. Sobol's mother. (The books also included characters named for Mr. Sobol's children and their friends, as well as another town, Glennville, named for a son, Glenn, who died in a car accident in 1983 at the age of 23.)\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

And what does the New York attorney general's lawsuit against it mean?\n\nBy Vivian Wang\n\nOn Thursday, the New York State attorney general sued the Donald J. Trump Foundation , charging it with \"improper and extensive political activity, repeated and willful self-dealing transactions, and failure to follow basic fiduciary obligations or to implement even elementary corporate formalities required by law.\"\n\nThe lawsuit follows years of scrutiny of President Trump's charitable activities and adds to the president's extensive legal challenges, amid a continuing investigation by special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.\n\nMr. Trump established the Donald J. Trump Foundation in 1987, when he was a New York City real estate mogul, with the stated mission of collecting and maintaining money \"exclusively for charitable, religious, scientific, literary or educational purposes,\" either directly or by donating to other organizations. It is a private, nonprofit corporation. In its most recent I.R.S. filing, reporting as of Dec. 31, 2016, it had approximately $1 million in assets.\n\nMr. Trump served as the foundation's president from its start until Jan. 23, 2017, three days after he was inaugurated as president. Mr. Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump also stepped down from her position on the foundation's board of directors. His sons, Eric Trump and Donald Trump Jr., are still members of the board.\n\nIn October 2016, then-Attorney General Eric T.

      "text": "Donald Trump's Revenge\n\nElecting Donald J. Trump once could be dismissed as a fluke, an aberration, a terrible mistake-a consequential one, to be sure, yet still fundamentally an error. But America has now twice elected him as its President. It is a disastrous revelation about what the United States really is, as opposed to the country that so many hoped that it could be. His victory was a worst-case scenario-that a convicted felon, a chronic liar who mismanaged a deadly once-in-a-century pandemic, who tried to overturn the last election and unleashed a violent mob on the nation's Capitol, who calls America \"a garbage can for the world,\" and who threatens retribution against his political enemies could win-and yet, in the early morning hours of Wednesday, it happened.\n\nTrump's defeat of Kamala Harris was no upset, nor was it as unimaginable as when he beat Hillary Clinton, in 2016. But it was no less shocking. For much of the country, Trump's past offenses were simply disqualifying. Just a week ago, Harris gave her closing argument to the nation in advance of the vote. Trump \"has spent a decade trying to keep the American people divided and afraid of each other-that's who he is,\" she said. \"But, America, I'm here tonight to say: that's not who we are.\" Millions of voters in the states that mattered most, however, chose him anyway. In the end, Trump's inflammatory rhetoric about invading immigrant hordes, his macho posturing against a female opponent, and his promise to boost an inflation-battered U.S. economy simply resonated more than all the lectures about his many deficiencies as a person and a would-be President.\n\nThe Lede Reporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nEight years ago, at the dawn of what historians will call the Age of Trump in American politics, the outgoing President, Barack Obama, famously insisted that \"this is not the apocalypse.\" Privately, he summed up what would become the conventional view in Washington. Four years of Trump would be bad but survivable-the nation, he told a group of journalists just a few days before Trump's Inauguration, was like a leaky boat, taking on water but hopefully still sturdy enough to stay afloat. Two terms of Trump, he warned, would be another matter entirely.\n\nFour years later, after Joe Biden defeated Trump, Democrats and the dwindling ranks of anti-Trump Republicans made the fatal miscalculation of thinking that it was Trump who had sunk. Too many of them were sure that the hubris and folly of his reluctant exit from the Presidency had destroyed him politically. They saw him as nothing more than a sideshow-a malevolent figure in his Mar-a-Lago exile, but nonetheless a disgraced loser with no prospect of returning to power.\n\nThey were wrong. Rule No. 1 in politics is never underestimate your enemy. Trump's enemies hungered for a reckoning, for Trump to pay a price, legally and politically, for the damage that he had wreaked on American democracy. Instead, Trump has now achieved an unthinkable resurrection. Even his four criminal indictments have served only to revive and reinvigorate his hold on the Republican Party, which is now centered more than ever on the personality and the grievances of one man. Almost sixty-three million Americans voted for Trump in 2016; more than seventy-four million cast their ballots for him in 2020. In 2024, it's even possible, as votes are being counted overnight, that Trump might win the popular vote outright for the first time in his three races. With such backing, Trump, the first President since Grover Cleveland to be restored to the office that he lost, has vowed a second term of retribution and revenge. This time, shall we finally take him seriously?\n\nPresident Biden will receive much of the blame for this catastrophic outcome-by refusing to step aside when he should have, the eighty-one-year-old President, who rationalized his entire candidacy four years ago on the existential need to keep Trump out of the Oval Office, will have contributed greatly to Trump's return. Biden's reckless insistence on running again despite the visible signs of his aging may well have been the 2024 campaign's most consequential decision. When he finally bowed out, in late July, after a disastrous debate performance with Trump, was it already too late? This will be a hypothetical for the ages. Politicians from both parties make unfulfillable promises to the American electorate all the time. But the implicit premise of Biden's candidacy might have been one of the most sadly impossible campaign pledges ever-as it turned out, there was to be no restoration of normalcy, no return to a pre-Trump America.\n\nHarris moved swiftly and largely successfully to replace Biden on the Democratic ticket. She ran a polished if late-starting campaign during the subsequent hundred and seven days-a brief dash to Election Day more customary for a parliamentary election in Britain than for the years-long slog of endless politicking which Americans require of their candidates. But Harris, despite four years as Vice-President, had little national identity or constituency to fall back on. She was embraced by her party, thrown a rollicking, celebrity-studded Convention in Chicago, and cheered after her trouncing of Trump in their one and only debate, in September, but the net effect of her rise was to return the race to where it was before Biden's implosion: deadlock.\n\nIn the weeks before the election, poll after poll in the seven battleground states found a contest within the margin of error. Pennsylvania and Nevada were a dead heat in the final Five Thirty Eight polling averages ; Michigan and Wisconsin finished with a single-point advantage for Harris; and Arizona and Georgia showed a slight edge for Trump. Even that, in retrospect, turned out to be overly optimistic for Harris, who was losing, narrowly but decisively, in all of the battleground states at the time that the election was called. Her defeat in Pennsylvania-long considered her must-win bulwark-will probably lead to years of second-guessing her decision to bypass the state's popular governor, Josh Shapiro, as her Vice-Presidential running mate, in favor of Tim Walz, the governor of safely Democratic Minnesota. But, given her across-the-board defeat, perhaps it would not have mattered.\n\nHarris now becomes one of a long line of incumbent Vice-Presidents who tried and failed to secure a promotion; her difficulty in separating herself from the liabilities of Biden's record has proved why only one sitting No. 2, George H. W. Bush, has been elected to the Presidency since Martin Van Buren did so, in 1836. Too many voters appeared to have seen Harris as effectively the incumbent President in the race-at a time when large majorities of Americans report dissatisfaction with the direction of the country. This, according to Doug Sosnik, the White House political director for President Bill Clinton, is why ten of the twelve elections leading up to this one have resulted in a change of control in the House, the Senate, and/or the White House.\n\nTrump's victory, in that sense, was a predictable outcome for a Republican nominee, perhaps even the expected one. And yet what a leap of unthinking partisanship and collective amnesia it has taken for his party to embrace this twice-impeached, four-times-indicted, once-convicted con man from New York. Trump in 2024 was no regular G.O.P. candidate. He was an outlier in every possible way. In 2016, perhaps it was conceivable for voters upset with the status quo to see Trump, a celebrity businessman, as the outsider who would finally shake things up in Washington. But this is the post-2020 Trump-an older, angrier, more profane Trump, who demanded that his followers embrace his big lie about the last election and whose campaign will go down as one of the most racist, sexist, and xenophobic in modern history. His slogan is now openly the stuff of strongmen-Trump alone can fix it-and he will return to office unconstrained by the establishment Republicans who challenged him on Capitol Hill and from inside his own Cabinet. Many of those figures refused to endorse Trump, including his own Vice-President, Mike Pence. Trump's longest-serving White House chief of staff, the retired four-star marine general John Kelly, told the Times during the campaign that Trump met the literal definition of a \"fascist,\" and yet even that was not enough to deter the enablers and facilitators in the Republican Party who voted for Trump.\n\nThe new gang surrounding Trump will have few of Kelly's qualms. He will make sure of that. One of the main lessons that Trump took from his Presidency was about the power of the staff surrounding him; his son-in-law Jared Kushner left the White House concluding that poor personnel decisions represented the biggest problem for their Administration. Soon after Trump left office, I interviewed a senior national-security official who spent extensive time with him in the Oval Office. The official warned me that a second Trump term would be far more dangerous than his first term, specifically because he had learned how better to get his way-he was, the official said, like the velociraptors in the first \"Jurassic Park\" movie, who proved capable of learning while hunting their prey. Already, one of Trump's transition chairs, the billionaire Howard Lutnick, has said publicly that jobs in a new Administration will go only to those who pledge loyalty to Trump himself. Having beaten off impeachment twice, this second-term Trump will have little to fear from Congress reining him in, either, especially now that Republicans have managed to retake control of the Senate. And the Supreme Court, with its far-right majority solidified thanks to three Trump-appointed Justices, has recently granted the Presidency near-total immunity in a case brought by Trump seeking to quash the post-January 6th cases against him.\n\nThroughout this campaign, Trump has been deliberately coy about his extreme and radical agenda for a second term. He disavowed Project 2025, the nine-hundred-page governing blueprint spearheaded by an array of his former advisers, eschewing the specifics that might have turned off voters in swing states. Trump said, for example, that he was no longer in favor of a national abortion ban, despite pledging to sign a twenty-week ban when he was in office the first time. Project 2025, if Trump were to adopt its proposals as his own, includes an extensive menu of ways to further restrict women's access to abortion, contraception, and reproductive-health services.\n\nBut the agenda that Trump has publicly committed himself to is cause enough for grave alarm. He has said that he will begin \"mass deportations\" of undocumented migrants as soon as his new term begins; that he will be a dictator for a day when he is sworn in, on January 20th; that he will pardon the thousands of January 6th \"hostages\" who stormed the U.S. Capitol, in 2021, on his behalf; and that he will go after his opponents, the political \"enemy from within,\" deploying the U.S. military to quell domestic disturbances and even suggesting that Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who dared to challenge him while wearing America's uniform, was guilty of treason and deserving of execution. It is not inconceivable that Trump will move quickly to follow through on earlier threats to fire independent officials, including two of his own appointees whom he later turned on-the F.B.I. director Christopher Wray and Jay Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve. Even before his Inauguration, Trump's victory will shake alliances and embolden autocrats around the world. What power will NATO 's Article 5 guarantee of mutual defense hold with an American President who has publicly said that, as far as he is concerned, Russia can do whatever it wants to NATO members who do not, in Trump's view, pay their fair share? And what about embattled Ukraine, whose ability to fight on against Russia has been sustained by billions of dollars in U.S. military aid that Trump opposed? Trump has promised he can end the war in twenty-four hours-how will he do that, other than to pressure Ukraine to cede its stolen territory to Russia in exchange for peace on Vladimir Putin's terms?\n\nOn the economy, many Trump voters seemed to have believed his promise to restore the greatest economy in the history of the world-though it never was. Independent experts believe that his vows to enact sweeping tariffs on goods from other countries and to deport immigrants will likely result not in a boom but in an inflationary, deficit-busting spiral that will make those same voters nostalgic for the Biden-era price hikes that contributed to Trump's return to power. The world's richest man, Elon Musk, spent more than a hundred million dollars helping to elect Trump and promoting his lies, propaganda, and conspiracy theories on his social-media site, X; what, now, can we expect as Musk, a major government contractor through his SpaceX venture, seeks to collect on his investment? Even before announcing that he planned to make Musk his unofficial \"Secretary of Cost Cutting,\" Trump already had plans to oust vast numbers of nonpartisan federal employees by executive order and replace them with political appointees-a move he attempted just before his defeat, in 2020, but which was swiftly overturned when Biden took office. All of it portends a deeply destabilizing period for the country and the world, which is still highly dependent on American power and leadership. And it is likely to happen with a swiftness that may stun Trump's opponents.\n\nAt Harris's rallies, her audiences during these past hundred and seven days would chant her slogan, \"We're not going back!\" But, it turns out, we are. Harris fell short. Americans, at least enough of them to tilt the outcome, chose Trump's retrograde appeal. The question now is a different one: not if we are going back but how far? ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Who's Afraid of Judging Donald Trump? Lots of People\n\nOn Monday afternoon, ninety-six New Yorkers were ushered through metal detectors and into a courtroom on the fifteenth floor of the criminal courthouse in lower Manhattan. They had been selected as prospective jurors in the People of the State of New York v. Donald J. Trump-the first-ever criminal trial of an American President. As court officers led them into the gallery, several craned their necks to get a look at the defendant. There he was: his face exactly as orange and mottled as it looks on TV, a long red tie draped over his paunch. He stared right back at them, and leaned over to whisper something in the ear of one of his attorneys. One prospective juror broke out in giggles, and put a hand over her mouth. A clerk had everyone stand and swear to tell the truth during the jury-selection process. \"A fair juror is a person who will keep the promise to be fair and impartial,\" Judge Juan Merchan said. \"Please raise your hand if you believe you cannot be fair and impartial.\" More than half the hands in the room went up. Merchan excused these unfair and partial people one by one. \"I just couldn't do it,\" one dismissed potential juror was heard saying out in the hall.\n\nWho could? It takes a special kind of person to be completely impartial when it comes to Donald Trump . The judge and the lawyers on both sides of the case needed to find twelve such people for the jury, and also half a dozen more who could serve as alternates. The thirty or so candidates who'd remained in the courtroom were asked to read through a long questionnaire-forty-two questions, along with numerous sub-questions. The first prospective juror was a young woman who said she lived in midtown and worked in business development. She felt that she could be fair and impartial, but she also had vacation plans that coincided with the trial. She was excused. The second prospective juror was a middle-aged white man with thick-framed glasses, who said he was a creative director at a clothing company. \"I'm here to judge the facts that are presented and not the individual,\" he told the court. He said he had never read any of Trump's books and did not consider himself a supporter of the QAnon movement, the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters, the Boogaloo Boys, or Antifa. In his spare time, he said, he enjoyed hiking and cooking, and playing with his dog. Was there any reason at all that he could not be a fair and impartial juror? No, he said.\n\nAnd yet the dog-loving creative director was too good to be true. Trump's team discovered a spicy Facebook post that he made in 2017. \"Good news!! Trump lost his court battle on his unlawful travel ban!!!\" he wrote. \"Get him out and lock him up.\" Under questioning from Trump's lawyer Todd Blanche, the man acknowledged that the Facebook account was indeed his. \"I had strong feelings at the time,\" he told the judge. \"Today, like I said, I could be unbiased and open about what we are talking about today. But, you know, that was a place and time.\" Merchan wasn't having it; he granted the defense's request to have the potential juror axed. \"If I cannot credit a juror's responses, then we cannot have him on the jury,\" Merchan said. \"This is a person who has expressed, at least at one time-it was several years ago-the desire that Donald Trump be locked up,\" Merchan said. \"Everyone knows that, if Mr. Trump is found guilty in this case, he faces a potential jail sentence, which would be lockup.\"\n\nBy Thursday morning, only seven jurors had made it through the questionnaire, in addition to several rounds of follow-up questions from the prosecutors and Trump's attorneys, and had been sworn in as members of the official jury. They tended to be the people who had given the most inscrutable answers. The foreman is an immigrant, a native of Ireland who now lives in upper Manhattan, and who said he gets his news from the Times , Fox News, and MSNBC. Another juror, a young Black woman, seemed well aware of Trump's baggage. \"Obviously, I'm a person of color, so I'm around people who did have an opinion during the election,\" she said. Yet she expressed a certain admiration for the defendant. \"President Trump speaks his mind,\" she said. \"I would rather that in a person than someone who's in office and you don't know what they're doing behind the scenes.\"\n\nWhat was Trump doing during all this? Brooding, mostly. At several points, reporters noticed that he seemed to have dozed off, his eyes closed and his eyebrows slack, his chin occasionally drifting down toward his chest. At other times, he spoke animatedly with Blanche, slapping his lawyer's arm with the back of his hand. Coming in and out of the courtroom during recesses, he sometimes stopped to talk with the reporters waiting in the courtroom hallway. \"Every legal pundit, every legal scholar, said this trial is a disgrace,\" he said, on Tuesday morning, lying. \"This is a trial that should never happen. It should have been thrown out a long time ago.\" At the defense table, he often slumped, perking up only when a potential juror said something he particularly approved or disapproved of. He smiled and nodded, enthused, when the director of sales and revenue at a software company claimed to have read several of his old books, including \"The Art of the Deal\" and \"How to Get Rich.\" When Blanche questioned a prospective juror who had filmed videos of Upper West Siders celebrating the 2020 election results, Trump muttered something under his breath and gestured aggressively. \"I won't tolerate that,\" Merchan snapped. \"I will not have any jurors intimidated in this courtroom.\"\n\nAnd yet many of the would-be jurors have been intimidated, if not by Trump, then by the prospect of serving on a jury in such a high-profile case. The stakes felt higher than ever on Friday afternoon, when, just before the court broke for lunch, a man doused himself in accelerant and set himself on fire, in a small park across from the courthouse. (The man, who is reportedly in critical condition, threw pamphlets into the air before lighting the fire; the N.Y.P.D. has described the flyers as conspiracy-oriented.) Even before this, the judge announced that one of the seven people who'd made it onto the official jury had called in to say that she was having second thoughts. She'd heard from friends, family, and colleagues who told her that she was being talked about, online and on TV. On Tuesday night, Fox News's Jesse Watters did a segment on his prime-time show where he went through the chosen jurors one by one, and put graphics listing their occupations, racial backgrounds, and reading habits. Everything but their names. \"The fate of a billionaire real-estate tycoon, TV celebrity turned forty-fifth President of the United States, is in the hands of New York City lawyers, teachers, and Disney workers who like to dance and get their news from the Times ,\" Watters said, smirking.\n\nMerchan understood the juror's concerns and allowed her to withdraw from the jury. Anonymous juries are anonymous for good reason, he said: \"It kind of defeats the purpose of that when so much information is put out there that it is very, very easy for anyone to identify who the jurors are.\"He admonished the reporters in the courthouse and said he was \"directing\" them to refrain from identifying potential jurors' employers, or describing \"anything that you observe with your eyes and hear with your ears related to the jurors,\" such as their accents. First Amendment lawyers told the New York Law Journal that Merchan's prohibitions were \"dubious\" at best. A judge can't really keep journalists from reporting on what is said in an open court. But, online, many journalists seemed to side with Merchan, and spoke up out of concern for the safety of the jury pool. \"What of editorial standards? we don't report everything all the time,\" one former BuzzFeed reporter wrote on X (formerly known as Twitter). Having reporters choose what to censor in real time seems like a bad approach to a case that tests the very limits of judicial power and America's constitutional order. Merchan's suggestion was that the reporters in the courtroom simply use \"common sense.\"\n\nIn the lead-up to the trial, many law professors and former prosecutors were of the opinion that an acquittal was a long shot for Trump. \"The allegations are, in substance, that Donald Trump falsified business records to conceal an agreement with others to unlawfully influence the 2016 Presidential election,\" Merchan told the prospective jurors, on Monday. \"Specifically, it is alleged that Donald Trump made or caused false business records to hide the true nature of payments made to Michael Cohen by characterizing them as payment for legal services rendered pursuant to a retainer agreement.\" The payment at the center of the case went to Stormy Daniels, an adult-film star who was prepared to go public with her past affair with Trump. Trump has pleaded not guilty, but many legal observers believe a hung jury is the best outcome he can hope for. He needs just one obstinate fan to make it into the final jury box. On Tuesday afternoon, it seemed like he had almost found his guy, a young, fit man who looked to be in his thirties, with slicked-back hair. But, before he even got to the questionnaire, the man requested to be excused. \"Your Honor, as much as I would love to serve for New York and one of our great Presidents, I could not give up my job for six-plus weeks, which means I would be working eighty-plus hours a week,\" he said. The judge excused him.\n\nWhether Trump can get a hung jury is a narrow question compared with whether he can get a truly fair one. \"I feel so nervous and anxious right now,\" a prospective alternate juror said, her voice breaking, while under questioning from an Assistant District Attorney on Friday. \"I wouldn't want someone who feels this way to judge my case.\" Nearly three hundred prospective jurors were brought into the courtroom this week before a full jury box of twelve were sworn in. A few people who, at the start of the week, thought they could be impartial ended up ejecting themselves after taking more time to consider. These were not individuals who were scared off by the gravity of the trial; they were people who had decided that they could not be unbiased. On Tuesday afternoon, a woman who said she taught history at an all-girls private school on the Upper East Side made it all the way to Question 34 of the questionnaire, before relenting. \"You have strong opinions that would interfere with your ability to be fair and impartial?\" Merchan asked her. She nodded. \"As I am sitting here reflecting deeply, I do have concerns,\" she said. Merchan excused her. She gathered her things and walked out of the courtroom without giving Trump another look. ♦\n\nDonald Trump was ritually humiliated in the courtroom .\n\nTrump turned victimhood into his legal strategy .\n\nWhat was Hope Hicks crying about ?\n\nMichael Cohen, the star witness, was the most aggrieved and seemingly the most unreliable .\n\nCohen, Trump's ex-lawyer, used his old boss's playbook to help the prosecution .\n\nThe moment when the former President became a felon .\n\nSign up for our daily newsletter to receive the best stories from The New Yorker .\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The People v. Donald J. Trump\n\nOn a glorious spring day, with barely a cloud in the sky over the Manhattan Criminal Court building and magnolia trees blooming across the five boroughs, a seventy-six-year-old businessman who has lately been living in Florida was arraigned on thirty-four felony charges of falsifying business records to disguise a payment that he made, via his personal lawyer, to a self-employed Texas woman more than thirty years his junior.\n\nAt a press conference after the arraignment, Alvin Bragg, the Manhattan District Attorney , pointed out that prosecutors in his office regularly indict people for falsifying business records. What made this case different, Bragg didn't need to add, were the identity of the defendant and the legal strategy Bragg is using to elevate the charges of falsifying business records from misdemeanors to felonies.\n\nIn a sixteen-page indictment, \"The People of the State of New York Against Donald J. Trump,\" Bragg's office accused the former President of \"Falsifying Business Records in the First Degree in violation of Penal Law §175.10\"-a New York statute-thirty-four times between February and December of 2017. The charges all relate to payments Trump made to Michael Cohen , his former personal lawyer, who, just before the election in 2016, had quietly paid off Stormy Daniels , an adult-film actress who claimed to have had an affair with Trump. (Trump denies this latter allegation.) For each of the thirty-four counts, the indictment accused Trump of acting \"with intent to defraud and intent to commit another crime and aid and conceal the commission thereof.\" Under New York law, intent to break another law is necessary to charge falsifying business records as a felony rather than a misdemeanor.\n\nTrump and his supporters have accused Bragg, a Democrat, of concocting a legal theory as part of a political hit. The District Attorney, however, was at pains to stress the complex nature of the alleged crimes and the principles that his office was seeking to uphold. \"At its core, this case today is one with allegations-like so many of our white-collar cases-allegations that someone lied again and again to protect their interests and evade the laws to which we are all held accountable,\" the District Attorney said. \"As this office has done time and time again, we today uphold our solemn responsibility to insure everyone stands equal before the law.\"\n\nThe indictment didn't specify the other crime that Trump was intending to commit when he made the payment to Daniels through Cohen-an omission that surprised some legal commentators who aren't friendly to Trump. Speaking on MSNBC, Andrew Weissmann, a New York University School of Law professor who was one of the senior lawyers in the Mueller investigation, said of the indictment: \"You're left a little bit to wonder what precisely is the crime\" that justifies the felony charges. At Bragg's press conference, reporters pressed him on why the indictment hadn't spelled out the other crime-or crimes-that Trump allegedly intended to commit. \"The indictment doesn't specify them because the law does not so require,\" he said.\n\nThe statement of facts that Bragg's office filed to the court along with the indictment did spell out the prosecution's theory of the case, which is that Trump effectively conspired with others to defraud American voters in 2016 by purchasing and suppressing negative information about himself. \"In order to execute the unlawful scheme, the participants violated election laws and made and caused false entries in the business records of various entities in New York,\" the statement of facts says. \"The participants also took steps that mischaracterized, for tax purposes, the true nature of the payments made in furtherance of the scheme.\"\n\nIn explaining Trump's motive in making the payoffs and falsifying business records, Bragg said at his press conference, \"He did so to cover up crimes relating to the 2016 election.\" Bragg also singled out two of the criminal statutes that he suggested the payoff to Daniels had breached: federal campaign-finance law and a New York election law that makes it a campaign violation for two or more people to conspire to further a political candidacy \"by unlawful means.\"\n\nThis justification for the felony prosecution won't satisfy everybody-on Fox News, Bill Barr, Trump's former Attorney General, called the case \"pathetically weak\"-and Trump's legal team is sure to challenge it in pretrial hearings. But the underlying facts in the case, including the payoffs to Daniels and the reimbursements to Cohen, aren't really in dispute. The indictment indicates that Bragg's office has documentary evidence to back up its charges-invoices, business ledgers, signed checks-and it has been working on its over-all legal strategy since resurrecting a case that his predecessor and federal prosecutors both decided not to take to the courthouse.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, I spoke with Marc Agnifilo, a veteran New York criminal-defense lawyer who has also served as an Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan. Agnifilo said that he wasn't surprised by the Trump indictment. \"I've had a number of these cases filed by the Manhattan D.A.'s office, and they all take the same bare-bones approach,\" Agnifilo said. \"They don't indicate in the charges what that second crime is.\"\n\nAgnifilo did add that the other crime is usually obvious, because the charge of falsifying business records is part of a larger indictment for larceny or fraud. \"Here they don't let on in the indictment what the second crime is, but the statement of facts does kind of tell us what it is,\" Agnifilo explained. \"It's a little bit of a grab bag, whether it's a state-elections crime, a federal-elections crime, a tax offense. Between the two documents, you have an idea of what their over-all theory is.\"\n\nIn such a high-profile case, Bragg arguably should have gone beyond a grab bag. Assuming the case comes to trial, Agnifilo said, the prosecution will likely take the jury through the chronology of the payments and the Presidential campaign. \"You say, 'Look, this guy was running for President, and, lo and behold, all this stuff starts happening for the first time, so you know what his intent was.' If they can put that together really tightly, that would be compelling.\" Trump is likely to counter, Agnifilo added, that he was the victim of extortion. \"He can say, 'Yes, it does coincide with when I ran for President because that is when I was shake-downable.' Someone is going to have the better of that argument. The defense has some decent arguments, the prosecution has some decent arguments, and someone is going to win.\"\n\nWhen is that likely to happen? At Tuesday's arraignment, Judge Juan Merchan set the next in-person hearing in the case for December 4th. There will undoubtedly be some pretrial motions before then, including, almost certainly, a motion to dismiss the case from Trump's side. But, assuming that the judge rejects that motion, the case seems likely to drag on well into 2024 before reaching trial. \"I think a year is looking very optimistic,\" Agnifilo said. \"I did not think this would be adjourned right out of the chute for eight months. I now think we are looking at a year and a half, probably.\"\n\nWith Trump facing the possibility of more serious criminal charges elsewhere, the New York case could turn into a sideshow. In Fulton County, Georgia, the district attorney, Fani Willis, is investigating the efforts of Trump and his associates to overturn the results of the 2020 election in that state. In Washington, D.C., a special counsel is looking into Trump's actions following the 2020 election and into his alleged mishandling of classified documents after leaving office. Whatever happens in those investigations, though, Tuesday's criminal indictment marks a low-for him and for the office of the Presidency. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Donald Trump Returns to Washington\n\nThe weekend's pre-inaugural balls and parties reflected the exuberance of an ascendant MAGA movement-and the factional dissent already emerging.\n\nThe Potomac River in Washington is frozen. On Friday afternoon, divers on a D.C. police boat maneuvered through slabs of ice atop the water and recovered the second of two dead bodies-a pickup truck had careened off the Memorial Bridge and been entombed under the surface. \"There is an Arctic blast sweeping the Country,\" President-elect Donald Trump posted online, from Palm Beach. The bridge connects Arlington National Cemetery to the National Mall, which was ringed by thousands of tons of steel security barriers ahead of Trump's Inauguration. D.C. was in the middle of a set change; preparations had been under way for weeks. When I went downtown to pick up credentials for the inaugural parade, the Lime scooter I was riding stopped itself automatically at K Street, as though a dog had run against the perimeter of an electric fence. As it turned out, there would be no real parade; because of the windchill, it had been moved indoors, to the Capital One Arena, in Chinatown. The Inauguration itself was relocated, too, to the Capitol Rotunda, where only a select few will be able to watch live.\n\n\"January 20th cannot come fast enough!\" Trump wrote, in his post. \"Everybody, even those that initially opposed a Victory by President Donald J. Trump and the Trump Administration, just want it to happen.\" Trump would arrive in a city far more hospitable than the Washington of 2017. This time, he had no trouble booking marquee performers, as mainstream as Nelly and Carrie Underwood, who sings the theme song for Sunday Night Football. Jeff Bezos , Elon Musk , and Mark Zuckerberg would sit on the dais as Trump got sworn in; Musk was reportedly planning to turn a small boutique hotel near Ivanka Trump's house into a private club, his own mini Mar-a-Lago. The protests awaiting Trump were marginal compared with the height-of-the-resistance Women's March . (\"From the North Lawn, you can hear the faint cries and chants,\" a White House pool report mentioned in passing.) A New York Times poll published over the weekend found that the American public was largely sympathetic to significant parts of Trump's planned policy agenda, even if they didn't like him personally.\n\nA partner at a law firm who is joining the Administration had spent the weekend attending various celebratory galas. \"It's kind of like when you were really into a band and only like fifteen people would show up at their gigs, at a time when being known as a fan of that band could cause you to lose your job or be thrown into prison,\" she said. \"And now that band is playing huge sold-out concerts, and everybody says that they love them and have always loved them.\" The Make America Healthy Again Ball, set for Monday evening and with a no-seed-oil menu, was one of the most sought-after invitations.\n\nTrump has spent the past two months happily sequestered at Mar-a-Lago, golfing and dining outside with world leaders and tech C.E.O.s. He was named Time's Person of the Year and rang the bell of the New York Stock Exchange. Since Trump's election victory in November, everyone had been saying that this was the \"greatest political comeback in history\"-but now he has to come back to Washington to actually govern. Last January, on his way to the Iowa caucuses , Trump was delayed by snowstorms. He had worried that historically low temperatures would keep some of his most loyal supporters home, denying him a crucial victory as campaign season began in earnest. Back then, the weather was an easy way to contrive narrative tension for a story whose ending felt too obvious. Now Trump was putting on a good face about cold weather derailing the Inauguration-\"Everyone will be happy,\" he wrote-but the last-minute scramble was a reminder that the end of the honeymoon was fast approaching.\n\nOn Thursday, on the second floor of a bar in Capitol Hill, Steve Bannon was being introduced as a host of the \"War Room\" podcast party, which was called \"A New Order of the Ages.\" The m.c. alluded to a brewing tension between the MAGA old guard and Trump's coterie of Silicon Valley supporters, while calling Bannon to the mike: \"Despite billionaires and tech feudalists, he has carried the movement on his shoulders.\" Many of the weekend's events were hosted by these so-called tech feudalists, or even just by corporations like Spotify. (A guest at Peter Thiel's party, on Saturday, texted me that you could tell who the tech donors were because they wore tuxedos, signalling that they'd be heading off to balls afterward.) Bannon told the group, \"This is kicking off one of the greatest weekends in American history.\" He said that the gathering was meant to \"kind of replicate what Andrew Jackson did-a real populist throwdown party, people having a good time, people drinking heavily.\" Guests were drinking cocktails called American Carnage; waiters passed around oysters and salmon tartare. \"Our leader Donald Trump, at high noon on Monday, takes the oath,\" Bannon said. \"Then the real fun begins. . . . You have two, three days to get sober.\"\n\nBy the bar, I talked to someone who had been nominated for a role in the Trump Administration's State Department. \"We realized the entire regime could be completely tuned out,\" he said. \"Part of why Democrats are so subdued is because, if it was just white people giving Trump the win, that wouldn't really count. But it was a multiethnic, totally positive patriotic coalition that delivered the victory.\" \"Believe,\" by Cher, was playing on the speakers. He went on, \"We totally seized the vital center, issue-wise,\" adding that now \"the needle you have to thread is the tech right versus the white-working-class base that feels a sense of aggrievedness to this new multiracial coalition.\" A man named Vadim, who works in tech and who had helped Trump as a grassroots activist in northern Virginia, said, \"The media is trying to drive a wedge between Elon and Trump. If each of their egos doesn't get in the way, that'll be a formidable alliance.\" He continued, \"The MAGA movement is not a monolith.\" He didn't think this was a bad thing. \"But governing is messy,\" he said. \"And we have a slim majority in the House.\"\n\nMatthew Goodwin, a British political scientist, told me that he commended Bannon for delivering \"a blueprint for how to reshape conservatism to national conservatism, not liberal conservatism. And now that's global.\" If Trump hadn't won, he said, \"had it gone any other way, Western civilization-the values of the West-would be over. Now that's how we're selling the next U.K. election. This is your last chance.\" Post-Brexit British politics-the chaos and then collapse of the Conservative leadership-offered an object lesson. \"The one thing that can fuck all of this up is internal division,\" he noted. \"British Conservatives came in with a massive mandate. They didn't know what to give the country.\"\n\nIn the middle of the crowded room, I found Jack Posobiec, a MAGA influencer who had helped plan 2017's DeploraBall , an alternative to the main balls that was designed for the weird online fringe that \"memed Donald Trump into the White House,\" as they put it. Posobiec told me, \"Last time we were burglars, breaking and entering. Now we own the building.\" They would have to figure out how to live in it. The incoming State nominee said, \"A lot of people in the online right are temperamentally oppositional. They can't work in institutions. There are a lot of bitter, mostly young white men who have been totally screwed by the system.\" Posobiec acknowledged that \"it's always more fun to be a challenger. Now you have to do the job. That's a hundred times harder.\" He described a natural alliance between the Make America Healthy Again, crypto, and MAGA factions-a counter-élite going after the original élite. \"There's still Davos, Brussels, the Pentagon,\" he said. \"It kinda feels like we're in a place where the Tea Party was-you have to win, but then you have to win results. They don't understand how this town is going to try to get rid of them. The power structure is going to respond.\"\n\nA crowd around Bannon was dancing to \"Big Pimpin' \" by Jay-Z. People congratulated one another on new jobs. \"I was so glad when I saw the announcement,\" one guy in a Trump-Vance zip-up said to another. Trump's second term was often discussed as if it were a totally new chapter, a frame that neatly ignored the failures of the original go-around. The exuberance had a way of papering over the challenges to come. As Posobiec put it, \"Victory is not getting elected or getting inaugurated. You can't define victory until the last day of Trump's term.\" A Bitcoin venture philanthropist in a cowboy hat told me, \"What has gotten us here will not keep us going.\"\n\nThe following morning, two floors underground at the Omni Shoreham Hotel, members of the Republican National Committee streamed into a ballroom for their winter meeting. At the last R.N.C. meeting I'd attended, in the spring, there was debate about whether or not to redirect funding for down-ballot races to pay Trump's hefty legal fees; now members were mostly swapping inaugural-ball plans as they snacked on lemon bars. I entered the meeting during the opening benediction: \"We pray for all the members of Congress and all elected officials in our great country, that they act in your righteous name.\" Lara Trump, the R.N.C. co-chair, addressed the members. \"Look at the way we have expanded this tent,\" she said. \"But we have to make good on that. . . . They're saying, 'You have my vote now, but can you keep it?' \"\n\nMichael Whatley, the chairman, reiterated the point. \"As we look ahead to a new chapter in American history, we have to ask ourselves one simple question. Do we want two years of making America great again, or do we want four?\" he said. \"On Monday, when President Trump and J. D. Vance roll up their sleeves, they will do so with a Republican Senate and a Republican House. Within days, they will kick off a new golden era of American government.\" But a possible end to this golden era was already coming into view. \"Before you know it, the 2026 midterms will be here,\" he said. \"They're coming sooner than you think. If we let Democrats seize back control, everything changes.\" Even before 2026, Republicans on Capitol Hill can afford little internal disagreement; in the past few weeks, Mike Johnson, the House Speaker, has barely avoided a government shutdown and almost lost the House Speakership. At one point during the meeting, a Committee member named Morton Blackwell stood up. \"In 1964, I happened to be the youngest elected delegate for Barry Goldwater at the San Francisco Convention,\" he said. \"In those days, most conservatives believed that to be right in the sense of being correct is sufficient to win.\" He went on, \"There are some of you who won't remember the main slogan of the Goldwater campaign was 'In your heart, you know he's right.' That is not a winning campaign slogan. . . . Just being right does not mean you can win.\"\n\nAround 4:30 P.M. on Saturday, Trump's motorcade arrived on the tarmac at Palm Beach International Airport so he could board a government plane that would bring him back to Washington. When he landed at Dulles, reporters shouted questions about how he felt about his Inauguration ceremony being moved indoors. He pumped his fist and stayed quiet. Hundreds of supporters were staked out in the snow as the motorcade approached Trump's golf course in Virginia, which would be hosting a welcome party; they chanted \"U.S.A.\" and the clubhouse was lit up in red, white, and blue. An Elvis impersonator performed. Trump and Melania watched a display of golden fireworks while \"Nessun Dorma\" played. Charlie Kirk posted a clip of himself giving a thumbs-up, captioned, \"America's Golden Era is about to begin.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump's supporters, who had travelled to Washington from all over the country, would be left to watch the Inauguration on TV screens. And what was described by Trump as a weather-related event had already sent some into a tailspin about the peaceful transfer of power and the security state. General Michael Flynn tweeted , \"The walk away point of it all is that the outgoing administration cannot or will not secure the inauguration sufficiently for the United States of America to hold a peaceful transfer of power. ABSOLUTELY PATHETIC.\" (A few hours later, he added , \"In the you can't make this up category-with all the craziness going on, today is NATIONAL POPCORN DAY! ENJOY!!!\") There was speculation that even the small indoor ceremony at the Capitol would be scrapped at the last minute for something private at the White House.\n\n\"There's been an undercurrent of questioning of, Is there something bigger going on that we aren't being told?\" Tiffany Marie Brannon, a conservative strategist and podcaster, told me. \"There have been two very well-known assassination events, so there's also that kind of thought going around in the ether. It feels opaque.\" The grassroots, she went on, \"those travelling long distances who maybe don't have a lot of money, who couldn't afford the ball tickets,\" some of which cost tens of thousands of dollars, \"aren't as aware of the conversations going on about potential threats. . . . There is kind of a separation. It's kind of like, Now what do I do? I'm just going to be in D.C. in the cold and I could have watched this on TV?\" In any case, she continued, \"it's about coming together as brothers and sisters in arms for conservatism, even eating chicken tenders and espresso Martinis at 3 A.M. at the Waldorf with Kimberly Guilfoyle.\"\n\nOn Sunday, when President Joe Biden departed from Joint Base Andrews for his final official trip, a plane that said \"Argentina\" on its side was on the tarmac. Biden was going; the Argentinean President, Javier Milei , a self-described \"anarcho-capitalist\" and MAGA admirer, was arriving as Trump's guest. At the Capital One Arena, supporters had been lining up since dawn for a final victory rally. They were blocks from Trump's last major speech in D.C.-the one he gave at the Ellipse on January 6, 2021 . \"I'm the President, bitch\" was a new shirt for sale; otherwise, it was just like the long line at every other Trump rally. A life-size cutout of Trump bodysurfed on top of the crowd. Many of the same people would be back the next day; the arena was hosting an Inauguration live stream.\n\nTrump's rally remarks were a variation on the usual stump speech from his campaign. The crowd was as enraptured as ever. Several hours later, at a candlelight dinner for donors, he referred to his victory as a \"once in a lifetime realignment.\" Across town, Bannon, delivering the keynote at an Inaugural ball, told dinner guests, \"They're about to come in there and rip his face off. They're not gonna toss you the keys.\" Still, there was a final moment of honeymoon to be had. Even while he was President, Trump kept flying around the country to hold rallies; in some ways, he preferred them to the official events in Washington. On Monday, he will get the Inauguration that is perhaps most fitting: he'll go from the Capitol Rotunda back to the Capital One Arena, where he'll hold another rally. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Donald J. Trump Slept Here\n\nOn the evening of the solar eclipse, I found myself slinking about a\ncozy brick-and-stucco home in Queens, in the dark, brandishing a clump\nof sage and periodically knocking into a large cardboard cutout of\nDonald J. Trump. A week earlier, firm in the belief that meaning can be\nwrung from all experiences, I'd arranged to spend a night in the house\nwhere Trump was conceived and lived, from infancy to age four. Now I\nheld my sage aloft, like the Statue of Liberty gripping her torch. I'd\nread that ancient peoples believed that the herb had cleansing\npowers-that it could purify a space. I would excise these malevolent\nspirits in service of my country, or fall down a flight of stairs\ntrying.\n\nTrump's childhood home, in Jamaica Estates, Queens, first appeared on\nAirbnb a few weeks ago. The\nlisting had no reviews; the owner was asking seven hundred and\nthirty-six dollars a night. \"This is a unique and special opportunity to\nstay in the home of a sitting president,\" the description promised. (So\nfar, a lot of journalists have been taking that opportunity.) People close to Trump describe him\nas a homebody, and a childhood home provides a baseline from which every\nother domestic space we encounter is received and judged. The German\nword for \"uncanny,\" unheimlich , translates, literally, as \"un-homelike\":\nwe subconsciously clock aberrations by noting their deviation from that\nfirst resting place. It didn't seem unreasonable to think that something\nuseful could be divined from taking a night's shelter in the house where\nTrump spent the first few years of his life.\n\nFred Trump built the house, in 1940, to resemble a Tudor cottage. That\nthe house is a facsimile of an Old World architectural style adopted\nwhen wealthy landowners no longer needed to create fortified structures\nand could instead build for aesthetics-incorporating elaborate masonry,\nsteeply pitched gable roofs, and embellished chimneys-feels significant.\nThe property sold last March, for two million and a hundred and forty thousand dollars, which is double\nthe price of a comparable home in the neighborhood. A limited-liability\ncorporation, Trump Birth House, was created to finish the deal. (This\nalso insured the obfuscation of the buyer's name, though she is believed\nto be from China.)\n\nThe property at first was offered as a rental. Within twenty-four hours,\nsomeone agreed to fork over four thousand dollars a month, which was\nfifteen per cent higher than the asking price-until it became obvious\nthat listing the house on Airbnb would be significantly more lucrative.\nIf it's booked every night of a thirty-day month, at seven hundred and\nthirty-six dollars a night, it will generate twenty-two thousand eight hundred dollars in monthly income\nfor its owner, minus Airbnb's fee, which is usually between three and\nfive per cent. At present, there are no other Presidential homes listed\non the service, perhaps because it feels undignified to clip your\ntoenails or eat takeout pizza inside the former domicile of a world\nleader. That Trump's is the very first-that his personal history is now\nbeing mined, greedily and hastily, for cash-also seems befitting.\n\nWhat can I tell you about the place? It is small, dark, moneyed, and\nquiet. The Wi-Fi password is a series of letters and numbers followed by\nthe word \"bugs.\" There is a beautiful mahogany hearth, a sunroom with a\nslate floor and a wood-burning stove, and, in the dining room, a framed\ninvitation to Trump's Inauguration that seems, to me, forged. A large\ncardboard Trump lurks in the eastern corner of the parlor. The kitchen\ncabinets are stocked with commemorative pint glasses that read\n\"President Donald J. Trump Childhood Home\" and then, in much smaller\nprint, \"Not affiliated with the Trump Organization, at all.\" There are\nfive bedrooms, four of which are crammed full of rickety bunk beds,\nmeaning the house now sleeps sixteen. (In this way, the house feels most\nreflective of its prior occupant: streamlined not for beauty but for\nearning.) The house is twenty-five hundred square feet, but so twisty\nand cavernous that I periodically needed to pause to reorient.\n\nThere are photographs and framed quotations from Trump hung everywhere,\nmany inscrutable. (\"I like thinking big. I always have. To me it's very\nsimple: if you're going to be thinking anyway, you might as well think\nbig.\") I found six paperback copies of \"The Art of the Deal,\"\ndistributed evenly about the home's rooms. There are many large\ntelevisions, but I couldn't get any of them to broadcast the President's\nlive address on Afghanistan that evening, despite spending several\nminutes pressing every available button. (\"Sheer persistence is the\ndifference between success and failure,\" one of the quotes promised.)\nThe stove doesn't work. The toilets do not flush, or not vigorously.\n\nI had forgotten to buy a pair of eclipse glasses, so I spent much of the\nafternoon bumbling about nearby Cunningham Park, wearing my regular\nsunglasses, sneaking panicked glances at the heavens, shouting \"Is it\nhappening?\" to no one in particular, and wondering if my eyeballs were\ngoing to fall out of my face. The author Helen Macdonald, in an\nessay about eclipse-viewing for the Times Magazine , wrote of being\novercome by grisly imaginings in the face of totality: \"I stared up at\nthe hole in the sky and then at the figures around me, and became\ngripped by the conviction that my life was over; that I was kneeling in\nthe underworld in the company of all the shades of the dead.\"\n\nI'll admit that the eclipse made the timing of my visit to Trump House\nfeel auspicious, even perilous. What pockets of devious juju might I\ninadvertently unleash? European folklore is rife with macabre stories of\nsacrifices being made in deference to a home-little creatures bricked\ninto the walls, surrendered alive in exchange for good blessings. In her\nbook \" The Making of\nHome ,\"\nJudith Flanders tells the story of contractors remodelling a house in\nNorth London and uncovering, behind a fireplace, a basket holding two\nshoes, a candlestick, a drinking vessel, and the skeletons of four\nchickens. (Two had been walled up alive, and two had been strangled.)\n\"Votive offerings to the house-gods of the sixteenth century,\nresurfacing in the twentieth\" is how Flanders describes the discovery.\nShe reminds us of the old beliefs about the inner lives of structures:\n\"Houses, according to myth, folk tale and legend, have souls, and\npossibly even minds.\"\n\nWhen Trump was young, his life here was charmed. \"We had a very\ntraditional family. My father was the power and the breadwinner, and my\nmother was the perfect housewife,\" Trump writes in \"The Art of the\nDeal.\" He describes his relationship with his dad as \"businesslike,\" and\nhimself as \"a very assertive, aggressive kid.\" To me, he sounds like the\nkind of child about whom you furtively whisper \"Bad seed!\" after his\nparents have turned around. In a chapter titled \"Growing Up,\" Trump\nrecounts a ghastly story about punching his second-grade music teacher\nin the face because he \"didn't think he knew anything about music.\"\n\nJamaica Estates is a leafy, upper-middle-class neighborhood. (Besides\nTrump, it was also once home to Lennie Tristano, a blind pianist who\nplayed with Charlie Parker; some consider his atonal improvisations\ncrucial to the development of free jazz.) It is a lovely place to take a\ntwilight stroll. I wandered over to a slice joint called Benny's, where\nI ate a pepperoni roll and read a copy of the Post that someone had\nleft on the table. I walked past a Second World War memorial, a Catholic\nmonastery, and a Hindu ashram. I tried very hard to find the McDowell\nhouse from the movie \"Coming to America,\" which I'd been told was filmed\nin the area.\n\nIn \"The Art of the Deal,\" Trump barely conceals his vitriol for the\nouter boroughs. He had his sights set on loftier environs: \"My father\nbuilt low-income and middle-income buildings in Brooklyn and Queens, but\neven then, I gravitated to the best location,\" he writes. \"When I was\nworking in Queens, I always wanted Forest Hills. And as I grew older,\nand perhaps wiser, I realized that Forest Hills was great, but Forest\nHills isn't Fifth Avenue.\" (Confusingly, around a dozen pages later, he\nwrites, \"Perhaps the most misunderstood concept in all of real estate is\nthat the key to success is location, location, location. Usually, that's\nsaid by people who don't know what they're talking about.\") In 1950,\nFred Trump bought two adjoining lots nearby and built a\ntwenty-three-room mansion for his family. When I walked past, three\nexpensive, clean cars were parked in the driveway. In the biography\n\" Trump\nRevealed ,\"\nthe reporters Michael Kranish and Marc Fisher interview a neighbor who\nrecalled how a six-year-old Donald used to throw rocks at him from the\nlawn.\n\nAs I was dribbling a greasy little cup of Italian dressing onto a carton\nof salad-a friend had stopped by, with food-the doorbell rang. I froze.\nBut it was just a neighbor. People on the block were curious about the\nhouse, he said. Now there were lights on. There had never been lights on\nbefore. \"We were looking in the windows,\" he said. He was peering around\nme, trying to get a glimpse of the interior. I kept strategically\nshifting my body around to conceal the cardboard Trump. It was no use. I\ngave up and let the man get a good look at my scene-I had piled up all\nsix copies of \"The Art of the Deal\" on a coffee table, where I was\ndrinking wine from one of the commemorative pint glasses-and then I\nwished him a pleasant evening.\n\nLater, while lying in a large white bed underneath a plaque\ncommemorating Trump's conception, I revisited the interminable last\nchapter of \"The Art of the Deal\"-the one in which readers finally\ndiscover how of all the deals turned out (great deals!). It is hard to\nknow Trump, and I have no desire to humanize him. I'm not sure anyone\ncould, anyway. He is rarely photographed not wearing a billowy suit. As\nAl Franken, the Democratic senator, has pointed\nout ,\nhe doesn't laugh much. He is the first President since James K. Polk to\nnot have a pet in the White House. Clicking around on my laptop, I\nwatched \"The Solar Eclipse,\" an ABC News special that aired in 1979 (and was\nresurrected online this week). The broadcast journalist Frank Reynolds reminded\nviewers that the next eclipse wouldn't occur for thirty-eight years:\n\"May the shadow of the moon fall on a world at peace,\" Reynolds said.\nThe world under Trump feels very far from peace.\n\nI didn't sleep at all.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The First Five Rules of Trump\n\nDescriptions of Donald J. Trump tend to emphasize his unpredictability-he's an impetuous rogue, an unguided missile, and so on. But careful students of Trump often discover that he is noticeably deliberate in his choices. He calibrates his actions with a subtle sense of the consequences. Years ago, explaining his decorating aesthetic to my colleague Mark Singer, Trump noted that residential buildings call for a specific level of pomp: \"I sometimes use flash, which is a level below glitz.\"\n\nAs a man of idiosyncratic discipline, Trump is consistent enough in his tweets and his comments to allow us to identify the first five rules of Trump communication:\n\nTrump Rule No. 1:\n\nManage expectations. Casino owners know the importance of loss aversion: we value our losses more heavily, psychologically, than we value our gains. For Trump, that means it's vital to prevent people from pricing a gain into his image, in case he fails to achieve it. In the days before Time revealed its Person of the Year, Trump was telling crowds , \"Even if I deserve it, they can't do it.\" (They did not do it.) Hours before the fourth Republican debate, he tweeted :\n\nI wonder if @megynkelly and her flunkies have written their scripts yet about my debate performance tonight. No matter how well I do - bad!\n\nTrump Rule No. 2:\n\n\"Overrated\" is the best way to describe a critic who is undeniably prominent. When \"loser\" doesn't work-because it clangs against our sense of who is doing well enough, who has influence-Trump reaches for the sense that the truly knowledgeable are not fooled by the appearance of success. \"Overrated\" is usually reserved for utterances on Megyn Kelly of Fox News, but it can be used for irritants of all stripes:\n\n@oreillyfactor, horrible defense of me against highly overrated @krauthammer. I will bring more people into the party & easily beat Hillary!\n\nTrump Rule No. 3\n\n\"Nice\" is the preferred term for people who praise Donald J. Trump on television. Whenever possible, Trump campaigns on emotion, not fact, and in his constant recalculation of niceness, he ensures that people remember that, for Trump, this is all personal, not business. During the past twenty-four hours, Trump has rendered a judgment of nice on four commentators, including two-time Pro Bowl quarterback Joe Theismann, who was nice to Trump on Fox News Channel (\"He knows far more than football. Thanks for the nice words Joe!\"), a couple of lesser-known nice people who are probably underrated, and Chris Matt h ews :\n\nThank you @hardball_chris for your nice words. They are very much appreciated. I fully understand that you really get it.\n\nTrump Rule No. 4\n\n\"Think about it\" invites the reader to imagine a conspiracy, any conspiracy, whatever conspiracy comes to mind. This rule rests on the theory that any set of unfavorable facts can look terrifying, when exposed to sustained thinking. Trump has encouraged his people to think deeply about the motivations of the press, the Republican National Committee, and Mexicans, and they've heeded his advice: \"Think about it,\" Tracy Hooker, a Trump fan told the Associated Press for a piece yesterday, describing her fear of Muslim tourists, immigrants, and refugees. \"You don't know if they like us. You don't know if they hate us.\" She added, \"You don't know why they're here.\" Most recently, Trump has advised thinking darkly about Fox News:\n\nWhy doesn't @FoxNews quote the new Iowa @CNN Poll where I have a 33% to 20% lead over Ted Cruz and all others. Think about it!\n\nTrump Rule No. 5\n\nDonald J. Trump hears things - and he knows they sound better when he doesn't reveal the source. He hears from national-security experts whom he would rather not name; he hears from Washington insiders who love him, and from border guards who need his help but are afraid to come forward. \"I hear\" is a splendid phrase, impervious to fact-checking, and can be used to describe deep, almost mystical knowledge of the future moves of ISIS and of China, as well as those of the human-resources department at CNN :\n\nWhy does @CNN bore their audience with people like @secupp, a totally biased loser who doesn't have a clue. I hear she will soon be gone!\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.
