REUTERS/Kevin Mohatt\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tariff announcement last week has not only rattled financial markets, but even a group of far-right billionaires who have a history of supporting Republican causes.\n\nThe Guardian reported that both a far-right group funded by both multibillionaire Charles Koch and the Federalist Society's Leonard Leo is now suing to stop Trump's new trade duties on China from taking effect. The New Civil Liberties Alliance argued that Trump's invocation of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to justify his unilateral imposition of new tariffs is illegal, and that the courts should intervene based on precedent that requires Congress weigh in on certain policy-related matters.\n\n\"This statute authorizes specific emergency actions like imposing sanctions or freezing assets to protect the United States from foreign threats,\" the organization stated . \"It does not authorize the president to impose tariffs. In its nearly 50-year history, no other president - including President Trump in his first term - has ever tried to use the IEEPA to impose tariffs.\"\n\n\"His attempt to use the IEEPA this way not only violates the law as written, but it also invites application of the supreme court's major questions doctrine, which tells courts not to discern policies of 'vast economic and political significance' in a law without explicit congressional authorization,\" the statement continued.\n\nMark Chenoweth, who is president of the New Civil Liberties Alliance, said that by filing the lawsuit in Pensacola, Florida court, the judge would have to abide by the aforementioned precedent, or else it would ultimately \"transfer core legislative power.\" And Sen. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) - who recently voted with Democrats to limit Trump's tariff powers on Canada - opined that his colleagues in the Senate Republican Conference are also likely very uneasy about the president's latest new import taxes,\n\n\"They all see the stock market, and they're all worried about it,\" Paul said. \"But they are putting on a stiff upper lip to try to act as if nothing's happening and hoping it goes away.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also signals an escalation from the various arms of the Koch political machine. His Americans for Prosperity organization threw its weight behind former United Nations Ambassador Nikki Haley in the 2024 Republican presidential primary, only for her to bow out and eventually endorse Trump after Trump won the Super Tuesday primaries."

      "text": "'Pushed me over the edge': Here's why MAGA is enraged at the Trump administration\n\nSome of President Trump's most ardent MAGA fans are questioning FBI Director Kash Patel's decision to elevate an agency veteran who played a key role in coordinating the sprawling Jan. 6 investigation to lead the Washington Field Office.\n\nSteven J. Jensen previously served as chief of the FBI's Domestic Terrorism Operations Section, and was recently named by Patel as assistant director in charge of the office, according to a report by the New York Times.\n\n\"The anger and depression is hitting hard today,\" Richard Barnett, a self-described white nationalist who was sentenced to 54 months in prison for raiding the Capitol on Jan. 6, wrote on X on Monday. Barnett, who was among some 1,500s rioters pardoned by Trump , complained that Patel and Deputy Director Dan Bongino \"stabbed us in the back\" and \"actually promoted one of our tormenters, Steve Jensen, into a position of great power within the FBI.\"\n\nKyle Seraphin, part of a group of former agents who called themselves the \"Suspendables\" for raising objections to the Jan. 6 investigations, called Jensen a \"true J6 insurrection believer\" and a \"January 6 th hysteric\" on X.\n\nSeraphin's criticism is especially notable because of his close relationship with the FBI's current director and its deputy director. Seraphin was placed on leave from the FBI for contesting coronavirus vaccine mandates, and he went public in 2022 with his criticism of the FBI's handling of the Jan. 6 investigations by appearing on the podcast of Dan Bongino, who is now the FBI's deputy director.\n\nBongino at the time described Seraphin as \"a brave guy and a patriot.\" Bongino went on to say that Seraphin \"gave up everything to give us this incredible, incredible account of what's going on inside the now-broken FBI, some of the abuses taking place.\n\n\"Please listen to this and spread the word,\" Bongino added. \"It's a really important interview.\"\n\nFollowing the Bongino interview, Seraphin recounted to the Washington Post that Patel, then a former Trump administration official, reached out to him to offer support. Patel's foundation would up cutting a check to Seraphin for $10,000. Seraphin told the Post that his relationship with Patel has continued, and that the two spoke after Trump nominated Patel to lead the FBI.\n\nIn an X post over the weekend, Seraphin noted that Jensen was the subject of testimony to the House Weaponization Committee chaired by Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH). George J. Hill, a former FBI supervisory intelligence analyst in the Boston Field Office who took a critical stance on the Jan. 6 investigation, testified to the House Republicans that \"probably the most egregious and one of the things that pushed me over the edge was a tirade by Steve Jensen.\"\n\nHill testified that Jensen pushed back against officials from the Philadelphia Field Office who expressed the view during a national conference call that there wasn't sufficient evidence to pursue cases against three individuals suspected of Jan. 6-related offenses. According to Hill's account, Jensen responded by saying, \"I don't give a blank, they're goddamn terrorists, and we're gonna round them all up.\"\n\nDisbelief and disillusion\n\nSome Jan. 6 defendants are echoing Barnett's disgust with Patel's decision to elevate Jensen to the Washington Field Office.\n\n\"Seriously Kash? Why the f--- does this guy have a job, let alone a promotion?\" Derrick Evans, a former West Virginia state lawmaker who served a three-month sentence for felony obstructing or impeding officers during a civil disorder, wrote on X.\n\nSteve Baker, another convicted Jan. 6 defendant who is now a contributor to Blaze Media, posted : \"I would admonish all Trump supporters to voice their opposition to the appointment of Steve Jensen as @FBIWFO ADIC... because this is 'not what we voted for.'\"\n\nThe FBI declined to comment for this story.\n\nBut many Trump supporters, swayed by conspiracy sites with a vested interest in discrediting the mainstream media, have dismissed the appointment as \"fake news.\" The right-wing site Gateway Pundit initially published a story headlined, \"NY Times Caught Again Spreading Fake News: TGP Confirms Jan. 6 Activist Agent Was NOT Appointed Washington Field Office Assistant Director...Questions Remain,\" before confirming that Jensen was, in fact, appointed to the position.\n\nThe popular X account Catturd posted on April 5: \"Yesterday over half the conservatives on X were fooled by a fake news article by the NYT that I told you was fake - and they spent all day doomsday gaslighting a fake story.\"\n\nTwo people who have not commented on the appointment are Rep. Jordan, the former chair of the now-defunct House Weaponization Committee, and former Congressman Matt Gaetz, who were present when Hill leveled criticism at Jensen during his committee interview.\n\nHouse Republicans' silence on Jensen's appointment prompted Baker and Seraphin to accuse the Weaponization Committee of exploiting Jan. 6 defendants for political gain.\n\n\"@Weaponization committee hearings with @FBI whistleblowers ultimately led to nothing other than typical strongly worded letters - which were ignored by the DOJ and FBI and resulted in no follow-up action,\" Baker complained .\n\nSeraphin, in turn, predicted : \"The FBI's new management will distance themselves from whistleblower testimony proven true after congressional investigations to continue the status quo. Congress will suggest perhaps all of their fundraising and Fox News hits exaggerated the problems at the FBI.\""

Boghosian/Flickr )\n\nAlthough University of Chicago economics professor Brent Neiman served in the U.S. Treasury Dept. under former President Joe Biden, the Trump Administration used his research to make its arguments in favor of tariffs.\n\nPresident Donald Trump, along with key allies like Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick and trade adviser Peter Navarro, is pushing steep new tariffs that are causing the stock market to plummet. According to economists Paul Krugman and Robert Reich , Trump's tariffs will cause a wide range of goods to soar in price and could be a factor in pushing the United States into a recession.\n\nIn an op-ed published by The New York Times on April 7, Neiman argues that Trump and his allies are taking his research out of context badly distorting his economic analysis.\n\n\"The Office of the U.S. Trade Representative released its methodology and cited an academic paper produced by four economists, including me, seemingly in support of their numbers,\" Neiman explains . \"But they got it wrong. Very wrong.\"\n\nThe economist continues , \"I disagree fundamentally with the government's trade policy and approach. But even taking it at face value, our findings suggest the calculated tariffs should be dramatically smaller - perhaps one-fourth as large.\"\n\nTrump's allies, according to Neiman , are distorting his views on trade deficits.\n\n\"There are some reasonable arguments in favor of reducing the overall trade deficit, such as to reduce risks from our debt,\" Neiman notes . \"But these arguments don't apply country by country.... For the sake of argument, let's grant President Trump his goal of eliminating all trade deficits, no matter how destructive that would be. Could these reciprocal tariffs succeed? Again, no.\"\n\nThe University of Chicago professor notes that the Trump Administration has a \"formula\" that \"uses four different numbers to calculate tariffs.\"\n\nAccording to Neiman , \"The part that directly relates to our research is an estimate of how much import prices change in response to the additional costs imposed by tariffs.... The (Trump) Administration's trade office cites our work, but mentions a different result from the paper, which found a low pass-through rate to the listed prices at two retailers. The Trump Administration then plugs a rate of 25 percent into its formula. Where does 25 percent come from?.... The methodology note offers shockingly few details.\"\n\nBrent Neiman's full New York Times op-ed is available at this link (subscription required)."

Sweet have warned that the Trump administration's policies are hurting America's interests.\n\nIn an op-ed titled \"America is losing trade wars\" published in The Hill on Thursday, Toth and Sweet criticized the administration for its \"self-defeating approach,\" saying it will \"not make America great again.\"\n\n\"To the contrary, if left unchecked, it could result in the partial or complete destruction of U.S. global economic and military power,\" they wrote.\n\nToth is a veteran national security commentator and Sweet served 30 years as an army intelligence officer.\n\nThe analysts said the first war the administration is losing is \"the one Russian President Vladimir Putin declared against the West when he invaded Ukraine.\"\n\n\"The second one is metaphorical - the one President Trump himself is now waging against U.S. allies,\" they wrote, referring to Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on U.S. imports.\n\nCommenting on the president's handling of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, they said Putin is \"just playing Trump for time,\" adding that he is preparing a new multi-front offensive in the Donbas.\n\nOn Monday, Russia announced that \"one of the largest rounds of conscription to Russia's military for several years is underway.\"\n\n\"He made concession after concession to Russia, including partial ceasefires against energy targets in Russia and naval targets in the Black Sea - to get Putin to the negotiating table in Jeddah,\" they said of Trump.\n\n\"Yet Moscow declared Tuesday that it rejects Trump's ceasefire deal 'in its current form.'\"\n\nThe writers said Chinese President Xi Jinping was also \"taking full advantage of Team Trump's global missteps and the geopolitical vacuums they are creating across the region.\"\n\n\"To back its growing military power, Beijing announced in March it is increasing its defense budget by 7.2 percent in 2025,\" they added.\n\nThey advised the administration to reach out to key U.S. allies and \"build a combined and united response,\" noting that the administration was doing \"just the opposite of that\" by declaring April 2 as \"Liberation Day.\"\n\n\"The EU is larger as a market than the U.S. economy as a whole,\" they said, adding that European allies are turning to South Korea and France to meet their weapons requirements, accounting for 6.5 percent of NATO's European arms imports in 2024.\n\n\"Alienating your allies is a bad course of action,\" the experts said."

      "text": "'Dominate the playground': What Trump's 'new world order' reveals about his psychology\n\nPresident Donald Trump , on Wednesday, April 2, laid out the specifics for steep new tariffs he is imposing on a long list of countries. And they range from 10 percent tariffs for many countries to much higher ones for others. Mainland China is facing tariffs totaling 54 percent, while goods imported into the United States from European Union (EU) countries will see 20 percent tariffs.\n\nEarly April articles from the Australia Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) and the London Times delve into the reasons why Trump is so obsessed with tariffs, including his hyper-competitive mentality.\n\nABC's John Lyons explains , \"This new world order of trade is driven by a central belief of President Trump: that the U.S., over decades, has built one of the world's biggest and most successful economies, but over many years, other countries have tried to take advantage of that success, reducing the wealth of Americans. He believes that by imposing these taxes on goods coming into the U.S., he will earn money to pay down U.S. debt levels.\"\n\nLyons details the effects Trump's tariffs will have on Australia's economy, noting that \"by nature, Trump is the ultimate crash-through politician.\"\n\nLyons writes , \"Will he do something he rarely does - read the room of discontent from financial markets, American consumers, traditional friends and allies and the obstacle of the Constitution? Or will he take on all these realities at once? If he decides to try to crash through, the world is facing a very rocky few years.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in the London Times , reporter David Charter cites Trump's need for dominance as a key reason for his tariffs obsession.\n\nCharter notes that for Trump, \"Life has been a constant battle to dominate the playground.\"\n\nTrump's need for dominance, according to Charter, was evident back in 1987 - when his book \"The Art of the Deal\" came out. And Charter points out that the 41-year-old Trump of 1987 sounds a lot like the 78-year-old Trump who made his tariffs announcement on April 2, 2025.\n\nIn 1987, Trump declared, \"To the American People: For decades, Japan and other nations have been taking advantage of the United States.\" And that year, he told television interviewer Larry King, \"A lot of other people are tired of watching other people ripping off the United States. This is a great country. They laugh at us. Behind our backs, they laugh at us because of our own stupidity.\"\n\nRead the full Australia Broadcasting Corporation article at this link and the London Times' reporting here ."

REUTERS/Evelyn Hockstein\n\nDuring the 2024 presidential election, Donald Trump insisted that he knew nothing about Project 2025 -the Heritage Foundation's 920-page blueprint for a second Trump presidency. But now that President Trump is actually serving his second term, a key part of the Project 2025 agenda - a dramatic restructuring of the federal workforce - is being carried out with the help of the Elon Musk-led Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).\n\nIn an article published on April 1 , however, The Atlantic's David A. Graham focuses on a Project 2025 priority that so far, hasn't been a big priority for the Trump administration: A push for Christian fundamentalist households.\n\n\"Project 2025 has proved to be a good road map for understanding the first months of Donald Trump's second term,\" Graham explains , \"but most of the focus has been on efforts to dismantle the federal government as we know it. The effort to restore traditional families has been less prominent so far, but it could reshape the everyday lives of all Americans in fundamental ways.\"\n\nGraham adds , \"Its place atop the list of priorities is no accident - it reflects the most deeply held views of many of the contributors - though the destruction of the administrative state might end up imperiling the Trump team's ability to actually carry out the changes the authors want. A focus on heterosexual, married, procreating couples is everywhere in Project 2025.\"\n\nGraham notes that Project 2025 describes \"a range of ways to achieve\" that \"goal across the executive branch.\"\n\n\"Changes to rules for 401(k)s and other savings programs would be more generous to married couples,\" the Atlantic journalist notes . \"(The Department of Health and Human Services) would enlist churches and other faith-based organizations to 'provide marriage and parenting guidance for low-income fathers' that would 'affirm and teach' based on 'a biological and sociological understanding of what it means to be a father - not a gender-neutral parent - from social science, psychology, personal testimonies, etc.' Through educational programs, tax incentives, and other methods, the child-support system 'should strengthen marriage as the norm, restore broken homes, and encourage unmarried couples to commit to marriage.'\"\n\nGraham adds , \"Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the lead federal welfare program, would track statistics about 'marriage, healthy family formation, and delaying sex to prevent pregnancy.' In this vision, men are breadwinners and women are mothers.\"\n\nAccording to Graham, Project 2025's view of family life is extremely patriarchal.\n\n\"With a little imagination,\" Graham writes, \"we can glimpse the America that Project 2025 proposes. It is an avowedly Christian nation, but following a very specific, narrow strain of Christianity. In many ways, it resembles the 1950s. While fathers work, mothers stay at home with larger families. At school, students learn old-fashioned values and lessons. Abortion is illegal, vaccines are voluntary, and the state is minimally involved in health care.\"\n\nDavid A.

All 100 seats in the House of Delegates will be on the ballot, and the group has identified a slate of competitive districts where it plans to go all in.\n\n\"All eyes are on Virginia in 2025,\" DLCC Director Heather Williams said in a statement. \"Opportunities to move policy and build power aren't happening in Washington - they're happening in the statehouses. State legislative races are the most immediate opportunity for Democrats to defend and build sustainable power, and Virginia will be the highest profile, most data-rich election of 2025.\"\n\nThough the Virginia Senate is not on the ballot this cycle, Democrats are also eyeing the lieutenant governor's race as a key opportunity. With the party holding just a one-seat majority in the chamber, a Democratic lieutenant governor could play a pivotal role by casting tie-breaking votes to advance the party's agenda.\n\nDuring his tenure, former Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax cast several tie-breaking votes in favor of Democratic priorities. In contrast, Republican Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears has often broken ties against Democratic legislation - most recently in a closely watched vote on contraception access.\n\nIn that case, Democrats used a procedural maneuver to set up a tie by having one senator abstain and another vote no on a right-to-contraception bill. With a Republican absent that day, Earle-Sears was forced to cast the deciding vote - and voted against the measure.\n\nDemocrats then quickly used a chamber rule that allows members who vote against a bill to request reconsideration. The bill was brought back for a second vote and passed with a Democratic majority. But forcing Earle-Sears to go on the record against the proposal was seen as a strategic move - a way to draw a clear contrast on reproductive rights between her and Democratic gubernatorial nominee Abigail Spanberger ahead of this November's election.\n\nBoth parties are also preparing for competitive primaries this summer to determine their nominees for lieutenant governor.\n\nAlthough the DLCC focuses primarily on legislative races, its plan to support the Democratic candidate for lieutenant governor underscores the office's importance in shaping policy outcomes, especially when tie-breaking votes are needed.\n\nSo far, the DLCC has announced it will support four Democratic candidates in battleground districts: Dels. Josh Thomas, D-Prince William; Josh Cole, D-Fredericksburg; Nadarius Clark, D-Suffolk, and Michael Feggans, D-Virginia Beach. Each won their last race by between 3 to 6 percentage points in their competitive districts. More DLCC endorsements are also expected after the June primaries.\n\nDemocrats also see opportunities to flip Republican-held seats. Two GOP delegates - Chis Obenshain, R-Montgomery, and Kim Taylor, R-Dinwiddie -  won in 2023 by razor-thin margins of 183 and 53 votes, respectively. Both will face rematches this year against their former Democratic opponents, Lily Franklin and Kimberly Pope Adams.\n\nIn another closely watched race, Del. David Owen, R-Henrico, defeated Democrat Susanna Gibson by just over 700 votes in 2023. His 57th District, which includes parts of increasingly blue Henrico County and more conservative Goochland County, is expected to be competitive again this year. Owen likely will face either Andrew Schear or May Nivar, who are vying for the Democratic nomination.\n\nWhile the DLCC is focusing heavily on Virginia this year, it is also part of the organization's broader 2025-2026 Target Map of battleground states. Alongside Virginia, states like North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona are  expected to receive investments, with the aim of helping Democrats flip legislatures or build stronger democratic bases.\n\nVirginia remains one of the DLCC's most closely-watched and supported states this cycle, as the group looks to maintain momentum and build power at the state level.\n\nGET THE MORNING HEADLINES.\n\nVirginia Mercury is part of States Newsroom, a nonprofit news network supported by grants and a coalition of donors as a 501c(3) public charity.

REUTERS/Nathan Howard\n\nOver the weekend, President Donald Trump once again flirted with the idea of running for a third term, not ruling it out entirely in an NBC News interview.\n\nBut on Monday, presidential historian Tim Naftali told CNN that after the ratification of the 22nd Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, term-limited presidents have no legal way to stay in power . He pointed out that short of the arduous process of amending the Constitution (which involves getting two-thirds support among state legislatures and two-thirds support from both chambers of Congress), Trump will have no choice but to leave the White House in January of 2029.\n\n\"President Trump does not have the Constitutional cards in this case,\" Naftali said. \"There are only two scenarios by which you could constitutionally alter the the Constitution and allow him to run for a third term, and they both involve finding 38 states. Donald Trump knows that there aren't 38 red states.\"\n\nCNN host Brianna Keilar then asked Naftali about the scenario in which Trump could mimic Russian President Vladimir Putin, who was prime minister under Dmitry Medvedev and ran the government behind the scenes before once again ascending to the presidency for yet another term. Keilar posited that Trump could run as Vice President JD Vance's running mate in 2028, only for Vance to then resign if elected and allow Trump to once again occupy the White House for four more years. However, Naftali threw cold water on that idea.\n\n\"The 12th amendment of our Constitution stipulates that no one can be a vice presidential candidate if they're not Constitutionally eligible to be president,\" he said. \"That kind of Putin-Medvedev scenario is not possible in our country.\"\n\nBut the historian and New York University associate professor then pivoted to what he viewed as the most pressing question, which is: \"Why is he talking this way?\" Naftali explained that Trump \"knows he doesn't have 38 states\" and said that his talk of a third term has just three possible explanations. He added that the third option had particularly dark implications.\n\n\"One: Political theater. Donald Trump likes attention. He likes the fact we're talking about him right now. Maybe he's also hoping some people are going to say some things that are a little bit outrageous, which he can use to fundraise,\" he explained. \"Number two, we're living in a in an increasingly evident culture of impunity. The president is using fear to get his way with universities, to get his way with law firms, to get his way with Congress, to get his way with Canada and Greenland and Panama and Ukraine. He's on a roll. And so why not talk about what he really wants, which is to stay in office as long as he can? The third is the January 6th scenario that the president, when he was in his first term, was capable of pushing for an unconstitutional and/or illegal way of staying in office. And maybe he is signaling to his supporters: 'Start thinking about ways we can stay through 2028 and 2029.'\"\n\nWatch the segment below, or by clicking this link."

The Kennedy Center was established by Congress and has been run by a bipartisan board since it opened in 1971, but Trump upended that in February when he moved to install his loyalists in key positions and make himself chair. Last week, the Kennedy Center's new leadership fired at least seven members of its social impact team that worked to reach more diverse audiences and artists, including the vice president and artistic director of Social Impact, Marc Bamuthi Joseph. The acclaimed artist and playwright joins Democracy Now! to discuss Trump's changes at the Kennedy Center, which he criticizes for destroying a \"sanctuary for freedom of thought and freedom of creative expression.\" Joseph notes that while the Kennedy Center has not yet made drastic programming changes, the rhetoric from Trump and others \"severely restricts and almost criminalizes demographic realities outside of white, straight, male Christianity.\"\n\nThis is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman, as we turn to the Trump administration's intensifying attacks on cultural institutions and diversity, equity and inclusion efforts, including the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts.\n\nIn February, President Trump ousted the center's longtime chair, David Rubenstein, made himself chair of the board. Trump also fired longtime President Deborah Rutter. Last week, the Kennedy Center fired at least seven members of its Social Impact initiative, including its vice president, artistic director, the renowned artist Marc Bamuthi Joseph. The team aimed to expand the art center's reach to diverse audiences, to commission new works by Black composers. The job terminations come weeks after President Trump took over the Kennedy Center and also appointed his allies, including his chief of staff, Susie Wiles, to the board, and her mother and second lady Usha Vance and two hosts on Fox News, Laura Ingraham and Maria Bartiromo.\n\nMarc Bamuthi Joseph recorded this video from his office just after he was fired.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Marc Bamuthi Joseph, speaking after he was fired as vice president and artistic director of Social Impact at the Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the last time he was in his office. And this is a portion from Marc Bamuthi Joseph's spoken word performance Friday, when he went back to Oakland for a timely production with the Oakland Symphony titled \"The Forgiveness Suite,\" accompanied by musician Daniel Bernard Roumain.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: You've been listening to Marc Bamuthi Joseph. He joins us right now from Virginia.\n\nWelcome to Democracy Now! , Bamuthi. Talk about what happened last week. Talk about what's happening to the Kennedy Center.\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Peace, Amy. Good morning to you, and good morning to everyone listening and watching.\n\nI feel so privileged to be the child of immigrants and having lived in the state of California for a long time. Moving to D.C. infused me with a different sense of patriotism and connection to the American promise, to the plurality that makes this country truly great.\n\nThere has been, as you've distilled, an infusion of a kind of binary political discourse into what's supposed to be a sanctuary for freedom of thought and freedom of creative expression. The Kennedy Center, it should be said, has not officially canceled any performances or explicitly contractually removed themselves from relationship to any artists. But as you've been describing so diligently and so bravely over the course of your entire career, we create atmosphere through rhetoric. The stated agenda as institutionalized in spaces like the National Endowment for the Arts, let's say, severely restricts and almost criminalizes demographic realities outside of white, straight, male Christianity. The specific attack on gay, trans and drag performers has narrowed the cultural radius at the Kennedy Center significantly, so that artists feel like they can't in good conscience come to the Kennedy Center. So you're seeing artists like Issa Rae or the producers of Hamilton or the artist Rhiannon Giddens remove themselves from their relationship to the Kennedy Center.\n\nAnd that, in turn, trickles down to the brave staff, who are arts professionals who care about cultural providence and have to do their very best to make it possible for artists to continue to be at their best. But against the backdrop of this oppressive regime and this politically narrow board of directors, that's extraordinarily difficult to do.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I mean, you have this unbelievable moment that we just played, Jon Batiste playing \"Star-Spangled Banner.\" President Trump is saluting -\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: - at the Super Bowl, and he had just fired him from the board of trustees of the Kennedy Center -\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: - along with many others. And then John F. Kennedy, you've got the portrait there in the John F. Kennedy Performing Arts Center.\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And when he came for his board meeting, President Trump as chair, what he put up, new portraits, himself, his wife, Usha Vance and Vice President Vance.\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Yeah, you know, what you're seeing all over government are folks who aren't necessarily experienced in the lines or departments or vectors of action that they're supposed to lead. And there is no formal experience in either nonprofits, arts management or the art of curation that is now present at the top of the organizational chart, beginning with the board chair. So, you know, the desire to satisfy one's ego or the desire to be vengeful, apparently, has superseded the desire to serve this nation in terms of making a safe space for artists, particularly artists from historically marginalized communities or historically minoritized communities to thrive.\n\nThe work that we did in Social Impact - and I'm so proud of my team, my staff and all of my colleagues who supported us - you know, that work was meant to focus on the historically marginalized, but also it connected to this idea of the constitutionality of inspiration. Our belief is that you cannot be - you cannot have access to the franchise, to the American franchise, if you don't have access to the impulse of creativity, that just like you have access to the ballot box or equal protection under the law under the 14th Amendment, you also have access and protection to inspiration. How can you be an American if you cannot hope? And who authors hope more than artists? So, this diminishment of creativity, of ideas, the diminishment of folks' access to high-level inspired works of art is among the more un-American things, I think, that a leader would do.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: During your time there, Marc Bamuthi Joseph, you helped launch the Culture Caucus, which offered two-year residencies with groups -\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: - that work with queer and trans youth, formerly incarcerated people -\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: - the disabled community.\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: You also established a national partnership -\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: - called Conflux, which worked with the National Arab Orchestra -\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: - the First Nations community and World Pride.\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Your audience, mainly wealthy and white.\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: And can you talk about the direction that Trump is now taking the performing arts center in? We heard from, what, Steve Bannon, one of his allies, that he had spoken to Ric Grenell, the new head of the Kennedy Center, that they're going to be bringing, what, in one of the first performances, the January 6th Choir to perform there to usher -\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: - in a new era of culture in the new Kennedy Center.\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Yeah, I won't speak to the president's curatorial tastes. They speak for themselves. I think maybe what I would point to is the list of maybe more than 200 musicians who didn't want their music played at his rallies. That speaks to a broader environment, I think, and disconnect between the arts community and the political direction of the president of the United States.\n\nAll the work that you cited, that's the work that we stand on and that we're proud of. You know, your listeners and your viewers know, going out to have a date night or a family night is increasingly expensive - parking and food, and, you know, not to mention the cost of the tickets themselves, child care. A lot of the work that we did was we lowered the barrier to entry from a financial standpoint, but also from a social standpoint. You know, my folks always want to know who all gonna be there, right? Well, what we did in Social Impact was we helped usher in a culture of invitation. The Kennedy Center, historically, at its best, produces more than 2,000 events a year.\n\nSo, maybe less than focus on what happens curatorially, I think we all have to ask ourselves: How many artists are willing to come into a space with such a narrow field of cultural vision? What is the scale of the Kennedy Center going to be like six months from now or a year from now?\n\nWhat happens inside the building is only as powerful as the people and the artists within it. So, you know, God bless all the curators at the Kennedy Center, but maybe more importantly, God bless the artists, who now have perhaps one less venue to share their work with the world. And then, God bless the audiences, because audiences or, you know, American citizens, folks who have less access to inspiration erode the democracy from the point of a lack of sight onto the creative horizon.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I wanted to also ask you, Bamuthi, about Trump's executive order -\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: - signed last week, appointing the vice president, JD Vance, to eliminate, quote, \"divisive, race-centered ideology,\" unquote, from Smithsonian museums, research centers and the National Zoo. The order, called \"Restoring Truth and Sanity to American History,\" aims to remove exhibits and programs that portray U.S. history and values as \"inherently harmful and oppressive,\" unquote. It cites in particular the National Museum of African American History and Culture, which opened in 2016. The Smithsonian operates independently, since it was established as a public-private partnership by Congress in 1846, but roughly receives 60% of its funding from the federal government. You know, you're an Oakland guy, but you've moved to Washington -\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: - for your job, that you were just fired from, and I'm sure you've spent time at the African American museum. The significance of -\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Absolutely.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: - putting Vance in charge of deciding what exhibits are appropriate or not, what is American or not?\n\nMARC BAMUTHI JOSEPH: Yeah. Yeah. It is chilling. It is a harbinger. It is a signifier in the most ominous of terms.\n\nI think about the words of John F. Kennedy inscribed on the wall at the Kennedy Center. Kennedy spoke of an America that was unafraid of grace and beauty. I think about the writers and the teachers who made me, everyone from Dr. Daniel Omotosho Black at Clark Atlanta University to the author Toni Morrison, the poet Nikki Giovanni. I think about how they all authored the story of our overcoming.\n\nAmerica is actually built on struggle. And, you know, it's obviously impossible to decouple American history from a genocidal, hyper-patriarchal, hyper-capitalist frame and origin story. But the idea of democracy itself is a radical idea. The Constitution itself is a critical theory. It describes a way, a populist way, that requires participation in order to actually make the country thrive. In order to be - in order to fully participate in the democracy, you have to sublimate or suppress your apathy.\n\nMy partners at SOZO Artists and I think about the idea that the way to turn apathy into empathy is to infuse inspiration as a conversion element. These museums, these Smithsonian museums, inspire folks because they distill the story of our overcoming. You enter - even if you entered one of the Smithsonian institutions apathetic as to the idea of struggle or overcoming, you are inspired inside of that institution, and you leave a more compassionate and more empathetic human being. So, you know, this description of what the Smithsonian institutions do, particularly what we call the \"Blacksonian\" here locally, that description is severely un-American and disconnected from the American promise. But maybe more critically, it minimizes the opportunity to generate empathy among not only the citizens of this country, but visitors from all over the world.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Marc Bamuthi Joseph, I want to thank you so much for being with us, renowned artist and playwright, fired from his role as vice president and artistic director of the Kennedy Center's Social Impact initiative."

      "text": "Why the new Trump leak is so much worse than what Clinton did\n\nEven in a political environment marked by daily scandal and outrage, the revelation of a reckless and stupid security breach by Trump's top cabinet members exploded this week. The potentially catastrophic leak of a top-secret military operation showed why President Trump's cabinet choices were so dangerous - as many seasoned experts warned when he named them. Only by sheer luck was a disaster avoided.\n\nIt was a simple but stunning story: The Atlantic magazine's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg, as reported by him and his staff, had been included by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz in a supposedly secret mid-March group text chat -- along with Vice President J.D. Vance, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard, and more than a dozen other high-ranking officials. A Pentagon spokesman confirmed that the chat, convened on the encrypted app Signal, was authentic.\n\nThe chat messages conveyed highly sensitive military and diplomatic information, including \"precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing\" that occurred two hours after he received a message on March 15.\n\nHegseth's feeble attempt to deny that any \"war plans\" had been disclosed can only be added to the long roster of lies from him and other administration officials. A former Fox News personality and the target of numerous warnings against his arrogance, drunkenness, and inexperience before his confirmation, the defense secretary ironically assured the group chat that \"We are currently clean on OPSEC\" -- the military acronym for operational security.\n\n\"Under the previous administration, we looked like fools,\" Hegseth recently boasted. \"Not anymore.\" Hegseth, Waltz, and the rest of the participants in those fateful discussions should soon become subjects of a national security investigation, during which they will presumably be wired up to polygraph machines, just as Hegseth has sternly prescribed for all suspected Pentagon leakers.\n\nAs soon as she read the news, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton took to social media. \"You've got to be kidding me,\" quipped the irrepressible Democrat, daring her critics to bring up the old matter of \"her emails\" and the alleged scandal that probably cost her the presidency in 2016.\n\nDespite Republican bleats of indignation, and angry posts urging her to \"sit down\" or worse, it is instructive to contrast what Hegseth and company did with Clinton's own exhaustively investigated actions.\n\nAs reported in this space three years ag o - and confirmed in a subsequent investigation by Washington Post reporter and fact-checker Glenn Kessler - Clinton actually disclosed no classified information in those fabled emails or her home server. Her innocence was confirmed not only by the Justice Department and the FBI (under Republican James Comey, who sank her campaign with his own unethical conduct), but in two subsequent State Department probes during the first Trump administration.\n\nAmong the Clinton emails that Comey used to tar her before the election, none disclosed national security information or were classified before she sent them. A typical example was a message from an aide, reminding her to send a condolence note to the president of Malawi.\n\nSuch innocuous and outdated information contrasts sharply with the real-time disclosure of a bombing mission which, if exposed, could jeopardize its success and the lives of the pilots and other military and intelligence personnel.\n\nSen. Jack Reed (D-RI), the ranking member on the Senate Armed Services Committee, described the Signal chat as \"one of the most egregious failures of operational security and common sense I have ever seen.\"\n\nJoining many other Democrats and some dismayed Republicans, as well as a platoon of retired military and defense experts, Reed said, \"Military operations need to be handled with utmost discretion, using approved, secure lines of communication, because American lives are on the line. The carelessness shown by President Trump's Cabinet is stunning and dangerous.\"\n\nRep. Pat Ryan (D-NY), an Army veteran and member of the House Armed Services Committee, offered an even more pithy reaction . \"If House Republicans won't hold a hearing on how this happened IMMEDIATELY, I'll do it my damn self,\" he wrote on X. \"Only one word for this: FUBAR,\" a military acronym that means \"f----- up beyond all recognition.\"\n\nWhich aptly expresses the condition of American national security under Donald Trump and his incompetent and highly suspect minions.\n\nNOW READ: Trump's interior life is a clown car of neurotic conflicts -so we must all suffer"

(AP Photo/Yuki Iwamura)\n\n▶ Follow live updates on the global markets\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Undeterred by a panicked stock market, President Donald Trump threatened additional tariffs on China on Monday, raising fresh concerns that his drive to rebalance the global economy could intensify a financially destructive trade war.\n\nTrump's threat came after China said it would retaliate against U.S. tariffs he announced last week .\n\n\"If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\"\n\nThe U.S. president has shown few signs of backing down on tariffs despite the mounting pressure in the financial markets. His commitment to tariffs could have devastating effects for the global economy, even though Trump is banking that it will ultimately pay off with manufacturing jobs.\n\nAsked Monday if he would consider a pause on his widespread tariffs, Trump said, \"We're not looking at that.\" The U.S. president said he was open to negotiations \"if we can make a really fair deal and a good deal for the United States.\" Trump added that it's possible to have both negotiated settlements with other countries and permanent tariffs.\n\nEven as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country would take its tariffs against U.S. goods to zero, Trump was noncommittal about removing the new import taxes placed on an ally. The White House also said Monday that Trump would veto a Senate bill that would mandate congressional approval for new tariffs, a bet that the critical mass of Republican lawmakers will loyally back him despite the economic and political risks.\n\nHowever, there are signs of frustration even among Trump's allies. Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican, said he supports the president's goals of better trade deals but worries about the economic uncertainty.\n\n\"We don't know if the medicine will be worse than the disease,\" Kennedy said, adding, \"This is President Trump's economy now.\"\n\nIf Trump implements his new taxes on imports from China, U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods would reach a combined 104%. The new taxes would be on top of the 20% tariffs announced as punishment for fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34% tariffs announced last week. Not only could that increase prices for American consumers, it could also give China an incentive to flood other countries with cheaper goods and seek deeper relationships with other trading partners.\n\nChina responded angrily and said it would not back down.\n\n\"The U.S. threat to escalate tariffs on China is a mistake on top of a mistake and once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the U.S.,\" said a statement from the Commerce Ministry in Beijing. \"China will never accept this. If the U.S. insists on its own way, China will fight to the end.\"\n\nAfter sell-offs on the prior two days of trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Monday fell 0.9%. The S&P 500 slumped 0.2%, and the Nasdaq composite was up 0.1%.\n\nTrump frequently bragged about stock market gains during his first term, and the threat of losses on Wall Street was viewed as a potential guardrail on risky economic policies in his second term. But that hasn't been the case, and Trump has described days of financial pain as necessary.\n\n\"I don't mind going through it because I see a beautiful picture at the end,\" he said.\n\nTrump officials have frequently appeared on television to make the case for his policies, but none of their explanations have calmed the markets. The only improvement came from a false report that top economic adviser Kevin Hassett said Trump was considering a pause on all tariffs except for China. Stock prices spiked before the White House denied it was true by calling the post \"fake news.\"\n\nThe Republican president has remained defiant despite fears that he could be pushing the U.S. toward a recession, insisting that his tariffs are necessary for rebuilding domestic manufacturing and resetting trade relationships with other countries.\n\nBut his aggressive push has scrambled U.S. economic policy. Even though inflation remains elevated, Trump has called on the Federal Reserve to lower its benchmark interest rates that were increased to constrain price increases.\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell warned Friday that the tariffs could increase inflation , and he said, \"There's a lot of waiting and seeing going on, including by us,\" before any decisions would be made.\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said the European Union would focus on trade with other countries besides the United States, saying there are \"vast opportunities\" elsewhere.\n\nTrump said he spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to start trade negotiations. He complained on Truth Social \"they have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade\" and \"they don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs.\"\n\nIshiba said he told Trump that he's \"strongly concerned\" that tariffs would discourage investment from Japan, which has been the world's biggest investor in the U.S. in the past five years. He described the situation as a \"national crisis\" and said his government would negotiate with Washington to urge Trump to reconsider the tariffs.\n\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested countries would need to do much more than simply lower their own tariff rates to reach deals, an indication that talks could be a drawn-out process.\n\n\"Let's take Vietnam,\" he said on CNBC. \"When they come to us and say, 'We'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters.\"\n\nMeeting with Trump at the White House on Monday, Netanyahu said his country would remove tariffs and other trade barriers in response to the U.S. placing 17% taxes on imports from Israel.\n\n\"Israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same,\" Netanyahu told the U.S. president.\n\nTrump said he appreciated \"very much\" what Netanyahu had said. But when asked if he would remove the tariffs, Trump said \"maybe not\" because of the aid that the United States provides to Israel. The U.S. had a $7.4 billion trade deficit in goods last year with Israel, according to the Census Bureau.\n\nTrump has strived for a united front after the chaotic infighting of his first term. However, the economic turbulence has exposed some fractures among his supporters.\n\nBill Ackman, a hedge fund manager, assailed Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick on Sunday as \"indifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing.\"\n\nOn Monday, Ackman apologized for his criticism claiming that Lutnick, previously the head of the financial firm Cantor Fitzgerald, could benefit from the tariffs because of its bond investments. But the hedge fund manager also reiterated his concerns about Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"I am just frustrated watching what I believe to be a major policy error occur after our country and the president have been making huge economic progress that is now at risk due to the tariffs,\" he wrote on X.\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk , a top adviser to Trump on overhauling the federal government, expressed skepticism about tariffs over the weekend. Musk has said that tariffs would drive up costs for Tesla, his electric automaker.\n\n\"I hope it is agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally in my view to a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America,\" Musk said in a video conference with Italian politicians .\n\nNavarro later told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures\" that Musk \"doesn't understand\" the situation.\n\n\"He sells cars,\" Navarro said. \"That's what he does.\" He added, \"He's simply protecting his own interests as any businessperson would do.\"\n\n___ Associated Press writers Didi Tang and Stephen Groves in Washington and Mari Yamaguchi in Tokyo contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nFollow the AP's coverage of President Donald Trump at https://apnews.com/hub/donald-trump .\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Huh)\n\n▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - After weeks of anticipation and speculation, President Donald Trump followed through on his tariff threats by declaring a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries and higher tariff rates on dozens of nations that run trade surpluses with the United States.\n\nGlobal markets cratered the day after the announcement and then fell further when China announced it would retaliate with tariffs equal to the ones the U.S. is imposing.\n\nIn announcing what he has called reciprocal tariffs , Trump was fulfilling a key campaign promise by raising U.S. taxes on foreign goods to narrow the gap with the tariffs the White House says other countries unfairly impose on U.S. products.\n\nTrump's higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the United States than they buy. But economists don't share Trump's enthusiasm for tariffs since they're a tax on importers that usually get passed on to consumers. It's possible, however, that the reciprocal tariffs could bring other countries to the table and get them to lower their own import taxes.\n\nThe Associated Press asked for your questions about reciprocal tariffs. Here are a few of them, along with our answers:\n\nIt is often unclear what the president's endgame is, which adds to the uncertainty surrounding his trade wars. He has given different reasons for his sweeping import taxes, and sometimes they contradict each other.\n\nTrump has said that tariffs can raise money for the U.S. Treasury, protect U.S. industries, draw factories to the United States and serve as a negotiating tactic to get other countries to bend to his will, whether it means getting them to reduce their own tariffs or to crack down on the illegal flow of drugs and immigrants into the United States.\n\nBut if tariffs mean Americans buy fewer imports or if companies relocate factories to the United States, then revenue from tariffs will fall, undercutting his plan to use them as a money generating alternative to the income tax.\n\nTrump and his own aides have also offered competing explanations for the sweeping \"reciprocal'' tariffs he announced Wednesday.\n\nThe president on Thursday said the levies \"give us great power to negotiate'' and were coaxing other countries into offering to lower their own trade barriers. \"Every country is calling us,\" Trump said. \"That's the beauty of what we do. We put ourselves in the driver's seat.''\n\nThe same day, White House trade adviser Peter Navarro told CNBC that the tariffs were meant to stay: The idea is to get companies to produce goods in America, not abroad, bringing down longstanding U.S. trade deficits. \"Let me make this very clear,\" he said. \"This is not a negotiation. This is not that. This is a national emergency.''\n\nCurrency manipulation takes place when a country deliberately pushes the value of its currency lower, which makes its companies' exports cheaper in foreign markets and gives them an unfair competitive advantage. It can do this by selling its own currency and buying another country's - usually the U.S. dollar - in foreign exchange markets.\n\nIn announcing sweeping tariffs this year, Trump has accused other countries of using this tactic to gain an unfair edge over American companies. China, in particular, was notorious for years for manipulating its currency lower to boost exports. But last November the Biden administration's Treasury Department concluded that \"no major U.S. trading partner'' had manipulated its currency to gain an unfair advantage in the fiscal year that ended in June 2024.\n\nThe U.S. dollar's status as the world's \"reserve currency'' - used far more than others in global commerce - tends to keep its value high, which can put U.S. exporters at a disadvantage.\n\nAccording to the Trump administration, the European Union's tariffs and trade barriers against the U.S. amount to a 39% tariff on U.S. goods, while China's, it says, are 67%, and India's 52%.\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds a signed executive order during an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden of the White House, Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\nThose are much higher than what other sources say. The World Trade Organizations puts the EU's average tariffs on all imports at 2.7%, China's at 3%, and India's at 12%.\n\nThe Trump administration says it is including currency manipulation, government subsidies, and other barriers to trade in its calculations. Trump said Wednesday he was being \"kind\" and then charging half what other countries imposed on the U.S. So the U.S. will as of April 9 impose 20% duties on imports from Europe, 26% on India, and 34% on China. For China, that's in addition to other duties, which means some Chinese goods will face duties as high as 79%.\n\nMany countries do take other steps besides tariffs to restrict access to their markets. The EU, for example, restricts imports of hormone-treated beef from the U.S. And the U.S. government has long complained that China doesn't protect intellectual property, such as software made by American companies.\n\nStill, those factors don't explain how the administration came up with such high numbers for other countries' tariffs. Instead, the White House says it did a simple calculation : It took the size of each country's trade imbalance on goods with the United States and divided that by how much America imports from that nation.\n\nIt then took half that percentage and made it the new tariff rate.\n\nTariffs are taxes on imports, collected when foreign goods cross the U.S. border by the Customs and Border Protection agency. The money - about $80 billion last year - goes to the U.S. Treasury to help pay the federal government's expenses. Congress has authority to say how the money will be spent.\n\nTrump - largely supported by Republican lawmakers who control the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives - wants to use increased tariff revenue to finance tax cuts that analysts say would disproportionately benefit the wealthy. Specifically, they want to extend tax cuts passed in Trump's first term and largely set to expire at the end of 2025. The Tax Foundation, a nonpartisan think tank in Washington, has found that extending Trump's tax cuts would reduce federal revenue by $4.5 trillion from 2025 to 2034.\n\nTrump wants higher tariffs to help offset the lower tax collections. Another think tank, the Tax Policy Center, has said that extending the 2017 tax cuts would deliver continued tax relief to Americans at all income levels, \"but higher-income households would receive a larger benefit.''\n\nIt depends on how businesses both in the United States and overseas respond, but consumers could see overall prices rising within a month or two of tariffs being imposed. For some products, such as produce from Mexico, prices could rise much more quickly after the tariffs take effect.\n\nSome U.S. retailers and other importers may eat part of the cost of the tariff, and overseas exporters may reduce their prices to offset the extra duties. But for many businesses, the tariffs Trump announced Wednesday - such as 20% on imports from Europe - will be too large to swallow on their own.\n\nCompanies may also use the tariffs as an excuse to raise prices. When Trump slapped duties on washing machines in 2018, studies later showed that retailers raised prices on both washers and dryers , even though there were no new duties on dryers.\n\nA key question in the coming months is whether something similar will happen again. Economists worry that consumers, having just lived through the biggest inflationary spike in four decades, are more accustomed to rising prices than they were before the pandemic.\n\nYet there are also signs that Americans, put off by the rise in the cost of living, are less willing to accept price increases and will simply cut back on their purchases. That could discourage businesses from raising prices by much.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution grants the power to set tariffs to Congress. But over the years, Congress has delegated those powers to the president through several different laws. Those laws specify the circumstances under which the White House can impose tariffs, which are typically limited to cases where imports threaten national security or are severely harming a specific industry.\n\nIn the past, presidents generally imposed tariffs only after carrying out public hearings to determine if certain imports met those criteria. Trump followed those steps when imposing tariffs in his first term.\n\nIn his second term, however, Trump has sought to use emergency powers set out in a 1977 law to impose tariffs in a more ad hoc fashion. Trump has said, for example, that fentanyl flowing in from Canada and Mexico constitute a national emergency and has used that pretext to impose 25% duties on goods from both countries.\n\nCongress can seek to cancel an emergency that a president declares, and Sen. Tim Kaine, a Democrat from Virginia, has proposed to do just that regarding Canada. That legislation could pass the Senate but would likely die in the House. Other bills in Congress that would also limit the president's authority to set tariffs face tough odds for passage as well.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Evan Vucci)\n\n▶ Follow live updates on President Donald Trump and his administration\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump announced far-reaching new tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners - a 34% tax on imports from China and 20% on the European Union, among others - that threaten to dismantle much of the architecture of the global economy and trigger broader trade wars.\n\nTrump, in a Rose Garden announcement on Wednesday, said he was placing elevated tariff rates on dozens of nations that run meaningful trade surpluses with the United States, while imposing a 10% baseline tax on imports from all countries in response to what he called an economic emergency.\n\nThe president, who said the tariffs were designed to boost domestic manufacturing, used aggressive rhetoric to describe a global trade system that the United States helped to build after World War II, saying \"our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered\" by other nations.\n\nThe action amounts to a historic tax hike that could push the global order to a breaking point. It kickstarts what could be a painful transition for many Americans as middle-class essentials such as housing, autos and clothing are expected to become more costly, while disrupting the alliances built to ensure peace and economic stability.\n\nTrump said he was acting to bring in hundreds of billions in new revenue to the U.S. government and restore fairness to global trade.\n\n\"Taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years,\" he said. \"But it is not going to happen anymore.\"\n\nTrump declared a national economic emergency to levy the tariffs. He has promised that factory jobs will return to the United States as a result of the taxes, but his policies risk a sudden economic slowdown as consumers and businesses could face sharp price hikes.\n\nTrump was fulfilling a key campaign promise as he imposed what he called \"reciprocal\" tariffs on trade partners, acting without Congress under the 1977 International Emergency Powers Act. But his action Wednesday could jeopardize Trump's voter mandate in last year's election to combat inflation. Several Republican senators, particularly from farm and border states, have questioned the wisdom of the tariffs. U.S. stock market futures sold off sharply overnight in anticipation of the economy weakening, after having already dropped since the start of this year.\n\n\"With today's announcement, U.S. tariffs will approach levels not seen since the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930, which incited a global trade war and deepened the Great Depression,\" said Scott Lincicome and Colin Grabow of the Cato Institute, a libertarian think tank.\n\nThe president's higher rates would hit foreign entities that sell more goods to the United States than they buy. The administration essentially calculated its tariff rates to raise revenues equal in size to the trade imbalances with those nations. Trump then halved that rate in an act that he described as \"very kind.\"\n\nThe White House says the tariffs and other trade imbalances led to an $1.2 trillion imbalance last year. Administration officials suggested it could take an extended set of actions by other countries to bring down the new tariffs their imports now face, and retaliatory tariffs by those countries could make the situation worse.\n\nOlu Sonola, head of U.S. economic research at Fitch Ratings, said the average tariff rate charged by the United States would increase to roughly 22% from 2.5% in 2024.\n\n\"Many countries will likely end up in a recession,\" Sonola said. \"You can throw most forecasts out the door, if this tariff rate stays on for an extended period of time.\"\n\nThe new tariffs will come on top of recent announcements of 25% taxes on auto imports ; levies against China, Canada and Mexico; and expanded trade penalties on steel and aluminum . Trump has also imposed tariffs on countries that import oil from Venezuela and he plans separate import taxes on pharmaceutical drugs, lumber, copper and computer chips.\n\nCanada and Mexico would not face higher rates on what they're already being charged by Trump in what he says is an effort to stop illegal immigration and drug smuggling. As of now, goods that comply with the USMCA North American trade pact would be excluded from those tariffs.\n\nBut the 20% charged on imports from China due to its role in fentanyl production would largely be added to the 34% announced by Trump. The specific products that Trump is tariffing, such as autos, would be exempt from the tariffs unveiled Wednesday, as would products such as pharmaceutical drugs that he plans to tariff at a later date.\n\nNone of the warning signs about a falling stock market or consumer sentiment turning morose have caused the administration to publicly second-guess its strategy, despite the risk of political backlash.\n\nSenior administration officials, who insisted on anonymity to preview the new tariffs with reporters ahead of Trump's speech, said the taxes would raise hundreds of billions of dollars annually in revenues. They said the 10% baseline rate existed to help ensure compliance, while the higher rates were based on the trade deficits run with other nations and then halved to reach the numbers that Trump presented in the Rose Garden.\n\nThe 10% rate would be collected starting Saturday and the higher rates would be collected beginning April 9.\n\nTrump removed the tariff exemptions on imports from China worth $800 or less. He plans to remove the exemptions other nations have on imports worth $800 or less once the federal government certifies that is has the staffing and resources in place.\n\nBased on the possibility of broad tariffs that have been floated by some White House aides, most outside analyses by banks and think tanks see an economy tarnished by higher prices and stagnating growth.\n\nTrump would be applying these tariffs on his own; he has ways of doing so without congressional approval. That makes it easy for Democratic lawmakers and policymakers to criticize the administration if the uncertainty expressed by businesses and declining consumer sentiment are signs of trouble to come.\n\nRep. Suzan DelBene, D-Wash., said the tariffs are \"part of the chaos and dysfunction\" being generated across the Trump administration. The chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee stressed that Trump should not have the sole authority to raise taxes as he intends without getting lawmakers' approval, saying that Republicans so far have been \"blindly loyal.\"\n\n\"The president shouldn't be able to do that,\" DelBene said. \"This is a massive tax increase on American families, and it's without a vote in Congress. ... President Trump promised on the campaign trail that he would lower costs on day one. Now he says he doesn't care if prices go up - he's broken his promise.\"\n\nEven Republicans who trust Trump's instincts have acknowledged that the tariffs could disrupt an economy with an otherwise healthy 4.1 % unemployment rate.\n\n\"We'll see how it all develops,\" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. \"It may be rocky in the beginning. But I think that this will make sense for Americans and help all Americans.\"\n\nLongtime trading partners are preparing their own countermeasures. Canada has imposed some in response to the tariffs that Trump tied to the trafficking of fentanyl. The European Union, in response to the steel and aluminum tariffs, put taxes on 26 billion euros ($28 billion) worth of U.S. goods, including on bourbon, which prompted Trump to threaten a 200% tariff on European alcohol.\n\nMany allies feel they have been reluctantly drawn into a confrontation by Trump, who routinely says America's friends and foes have essentially ripped off the United States with a mix of tariffs and other trade barriers.\n\nThe flip side is that Americans also have the incomes to choose to buy designer gowns by French fashion houses and autos from German manufacturers, whereas World Bank data show the EU has lower incomes per capita than the U.S.\n\nThe Chinese government delivered a measured response to the new tariffs, saying in a statement: \"China believes that protectionism leads nowhere, and trade and tariff wars have no winners. This has been widely recognized in the international community.\"\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Trump's new tariffs would \"fundamentally change the international trading system.\" He noted that the tariffs already in place against his country and those Trump says he plans to add will be fought with countermeasures.\n\n\"In a crisis, it's important to come together and it's essential to act with purpose and with force and that's what we will do,\" Carney said.\n\nItaly's conservative Premier Giorgia Meloni said Trump's new tariffs against the EU were \"wrong\" and Italy would work toward an agreement with the United States to avoid a trade war that would weaken all involved.\n\nBasic Fun CEO Jay Foreman, whose company is behind such classic toys as Tonka trucks, Lincoln Logs and Care Bears, has been working hard to come up with new ways to cut tariff-related costs like reduce packaging and eliminate batteries with the products.\n\nBut Trump's announcement that he plans a 34% increase in tariffs on Chinese imports has solidified his decision to hike prices. Most of the company's toys are made in China. He said the Tonka Mighty Dump Truck will go from $29.99 to $39.99 this holiday season, possibly even $45.\n\n\"There is no other way,\" he said.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Anne D'Innocenzio in New York, Rob Gillies in Toronto and Didi Tang, Paul Wiseman and Lisa Mascaro in Washington contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Mark Schiefelbein)\n\nTrump has described the import taxes, ranging from 10% to 49%, as a way to reverse unfair treatment by American trading partners and draw factories and jobs back home.\n\nSetting off for Florida from the White House on Thursday, he struck an optimistic note. \"I think it's going very well.\"\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen says President Trump's tariffs are a blow to the world economy.\n\n\"The markets are going to boom, the stock is going to boom and the country is going to boom,\" Trump said.\n\nChina, a key exporter to the U.S. of everything from clothing to kitchenware, has already announced a raft of retaliatory measures expected to raise prices for U.S. consumers.\n\n\"There are no winners in trade wars and tariff wars,\" China's Foreign Ministry spokesperson Guo Jiakun said. \"It's clear to everyone that more and more countries are opposing the unilateral bullying actions of the U.S.\"\n\nFrench President Emmanuel Macron met with representatives from key commercial sectors affected by the tariffs, like wines and spirits, cosmetics and aircraft, after urging businesses to suspend all investments in the U.S. \"What would be the message of having major European players investing billions of euros in the American economy at a time when they're hitting us?\" Macron asked.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of a new 20% tariff on the European Union drew a sharp rebuke from European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. She said it was a major blow to the world economy and the consequences \"will be dire for millions of people.\"\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen denounced Trump's levies as a \"major blow to the world economy\" but held off announcing new countermeasures. She said the commission - which handles trade issues for the 27 EU member countries - was \"always ready\" to talk.\n\nAnalysts say there's little to be gained from an all-out trade war, since higher tariffs can restrain growth and raise inflation.\n\n\"Europe will have to respond, but the paradox is that the EU would be better off doing nothing,\" said Matteo Villa, a senior analyst at Italy's Institute for International Political Studies.\n\n\"Trump seems to understand only the language of force, and this indicates the need for a strong and immediate response,\" Villa said. \"The hope, in Brussels, is that the response will be strong enough to induce Trump to negotiate and, soon, to backtrack.\"\n\nContainers are stacked at the Port of Los Angeles Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in Los Angeles.

(Michi Ono/Kyodo News via AP)\n\nEurope's strategy so far has been to limit retaliation to a few politically sensitive goods, like whiskey and Harley-Davidson motorcycles, in an attempt to push the U.S. to the negotiating table.\n\nEconomists say that Europe could broaden the trade war to the vast services sector by targeting Big Tech - a category more vulnerable to retaliation because the U.S. exports more than it imports.\n\nThe EU response could include a tax on U.S. digital giants such as Google, Apple, Meta, Amazon and Microsoft, as French officials have recommended.\n\nOutgoing German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said the EU \"must show that we have strong muscles.\" But he expressed no appetite for sparking an all-out trade war that could hobble the bloc's export-dependent economy.\n\n\"An agreement,\" he said, \"is best for prosperity in the U.S., for prosperity in Europe and for prosperity in the world.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Kier Starmer said his government would react with \"cool and calm heads,\" telling business leaders in London that he hoped to strike a trade deal with the U.S. that would see the tariffs rescinded.\n\n\"Nobody wins in a trade war, that is not in our national interest,\" Starmer said.\n\nJapan, the biggest foreign investor in the U.S. and its closest ally in Asia, plans to assess the impact of the tariffs, Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshimasa Hayashi said, displaying a more conciliatory approach.\n\nPresident Donald Trump departs after signing an executive order at an event to announce new tariffs in the Rose Garden of the White House, Wednesday, April 2, 2025, in Washington.

(AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)\n\nThe round of tariffs jolted financial markets, with the U.S. Standard & Poors 500 off 3.7% in afternoon trading.\n\nThe STOXX Europe 600 index fell 2.7% and a 2.8% drop in Tokyo's benchmark led losses in Asia. Oil prices sank more than $2 a barrel. Analysts fished for superlatives to convey the disruption to the global trading order as Trump's announcement overturned decades of efforts to lower tariffs through free trade agreements and negotiations.\n\n\"The magnitude of the rollout - both in scale and speed - wasn't just aggressive; it was a full-throttle macro disruption,\" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said.\n\nWith an average tariff of 25%-30%, the highest since the early 20th century, the U.S. has initiated a \"radical policy reordering,\"said Deutsche Bank's Jim Reid.\n\nThe head of the World Trade Organization warned that U.S. protectionist measures will likely cause global trade volumes to drop by about 1% this year.\n\n\"I'm deeply concerned about this decline and the potential for escalation into a tariff war with a cycle of retaliatory measures that lead to further declines in trade,\" said WTO Director-General Ngozi Iweala-Okonjo.\n\nThe tariffs are not paid by the foreign countries they target, but by the U.S.-based companies that buy the goods to sell to Americans.\n\nNow companies must decide whether to absorb the new taxes or pass them on to consumers in the form of higher prices.\n\nThe makers of Italy's Parmigiano Reggiano cheese, for instance, say the new tariffs mean U.S. consumers will pay more for their crumbly pasta topping.\n\n\"Americans continued to choose us even when the price went up\" after an earlier round of Trump tariffs in 2019, said Nicola Bertinelli, president of the Parmigian Reggiano Consortium. \"Putting tariffs on a product like ours, only increases the price for American consumers, without protecting local producers.\"\n\nThe Consumer Brands Association, which represents big food companies like Coca-Cola and General Mills as well as consumer product makers like Procter & Gamble, warned that although its businesses make most of their goods in the U.S., they now face tariffs on critical ingredients - like wood pulp for toilet paper or cinnamon - that must be imported because of domestic scarcity.\n\n\"We encourage President Trump and his trade advisors to fine-tune their approach and exempt key ingredients and inputs in order to protect manufacturing jobs and prevent unnecessary inflation at the grocery store,\" said Tom Madrecki, the association's vice-president of supply chain resiliency.\n\nA eye-popping 29% tariff imposed on Norfolk Island came as a shock to the remote South Pacific outpost's 2,000 inhabitants, particularly as its governing nation, Australia, was hit with a far lower tariff of 10%.\n\n\"To my knowledge, we do not export anything to the United States,\" Norfolk Island Administrator George Plant, the Australian government's representative on the island, said Thursday. \"We're scratching our heads here.\"\n\nVladimir Putin's Russia, meanwhile, was left off Trump's list.\n\n___\n\nAP journalists around the world contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "The Trump Administration Accidentally Texted Me Its War Plans\n\nU.S. national-security leaders included me in a group chat about upcoming military strikes in Yemen. I didn't think it could be real. Then the bombs started falling.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nThe world found out shortly before 2 p.m. eastern time on March 15 that the United States was bombing Houthi targets across Yemen.\n\nI, however, knew two hours before the first bombs exploded that the attack might be coming. The reason I knew this is that Pete Hegseth , the secretary of defense, had texted me the war plan at 11:44 a.m. The plan included precise information about weapons packages, targets, and timing.\n\nThis is going to require some explaining.\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\nThe story technically begins shortly after the Hamas invasion of southern Israel, in October 2023. The Houthis-an Iran-backed terrorist organization whose motto is \"God is great, death to America, death to Israel, curse on the Jews, victory to Islam\"-soon launched attacks on Israel and on international shipping, creating havoc for global trade. Throughout 2024, the Biden administration was ineffective in countering these Houthi attacks; the incoming Trump administration promised a tougher response.\n\nThis is where Pete Hegseth and I come in.\n\nOn Tuesday, March 11, I received a connection request on Signal from a user identified as Michael Waltz. Signal is an open-source encrypted messaging service popular with journalists and others who seek more privacy than other text-messaging services are capable of delivering. I assumed that the Michael Waltz in question was President Donald Trump's national security adviser. I did not assume, however, that the request was from the actual Michael Waltz. I have met him in the past, and though I didn't find it particularly strange that he might be reaching out to me, I did think it somewhat unusual, given the Trump administration's contentious relationship with journalists-and Trump's periodic fixation on me specifically. It immediately crossed my mind that someone could be masquerading as Waltz in order to somehow entrap me. It is not at all uncommon these days for nefarious actors to try to induce journalists to share information that could be used against them.\n\nI accepted the connection request, hoping that this was the actual national security adviser, and that he wanted to chat about Ukraine, or Iran, or some other important matter.\n\nTwo days later-Thursday-at 4:28 p.m., I received a notice that I was to be included in a Signal chat group. It was called the \"Houthi PC small group.\"\n\nA message to the group, from \"Michael Waltz,\" read as follows: \"Team - establishing a principles [ sic ] group for coordination on Houthis, particularly for over the next 72 hours. My deputy Alex Wong is pulling together a tiger team at deputies/agency Chief of Staff level following up from the meeting in the Sit Room this morning for action items and will be sending that out later this evening.\"\n\nThe message continued, \"Pls provide the best staff POC from your team for us to coordinate with over the next couple days and over the weekend. Thx.\"\n\nRead: Here are the attack plans that Trump's advisers shared on Signal\n\nThe term principals committee generally refers to a group of the senior-most national-security officials, including the secretaries of defense, state, and the treasury, as well as the director of the CIA. It should go without saying-but I'll say it anyway-that I have never been invited to a White House principals-committee meeting, and that, in my many years of reporting on national-security matters, I had never heard of one being convened over a commercial messaging app.\n\nOne minute later, a person identified only as \"MAR\"-the secretary of state is Marco Antonio Rubio -wrote, \"Mike Needham for State,\" apparently designating the current counselor of the State Department as his representative. At that same moment, a Signal user identified as \" JD Vance \" wrote, \"Andy baker for VP.\" One minute after that, \"TG\" (presumably Tulsi Gabbard , the director of national intelligence, or someone masquerading as her) wrote, \"Joe Kent for DNI.\" Nine minutes later, \"Scott B\"-apparently Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, or someone spoofing his identity, wrote, \"Dan Katz for Treasury.\" At 4:53 p.m., a user called \"Pete Hegseth\" wrote, \"Dan Caldwell for DoD.\" And at 6:34 p.m., \"Brian\" wrote \"Brian McCormack for NSC.\" One more person responded: \"John Ratcliffe\" wrote at 5:24 p.m. with the name of a CIA official to be included in the group. I am not publishing that name, because that person is an active intelligence officer.\n\nThe principals had apparently assembled. In all, 18 individuals were listed as members of this group, including various National Security Council officials; Steve Witkoff, President Trump's Middle East and Ukraine negotiator; Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; and someone identified only as \"S M,\" which I took to stand for Stephen Miller . I appeared on my own screen only as \"JG.\"\n\nThat was the end of the Thursday text chain.\n\nAfter receiving the Waltz text related to the \"Houthi PC small group,\" I consulted a number of colleagues. We discussed the possibility that these texts were part of a disinformation campaign, initiated by either a foreign intelligence service or, more likely, a media-gadfly organization, the sort of group that attempts to place journalists in embarrassing positions, and sometimes succeeds. I had very strong doubts that this text group was real, because I could not believe that the national-security leadership of the United States would communicate on Signal about imminent war plans. I also could not believe that the national security adviser to the president would be so reckless as to include the editor in chief of The Atlantic in such discussions with senior U.S. officials, up to and including the vice president.\n\nThe next day, things got even stranger.\n\nAt 8:05 a.m. on Friday, March 14, \"Michael Waltz\" texted the group: \"Team, you should have a statement of conclusions with taskings per the Presidents guidance this morning in your high side inboxes.\" ( High side , in government parlance, refers to classified computer and communications systems.) \"State and DOD, we developed suggested notification lists for regional Allies and partners. Joint Staff is sending this am a more specific sequence of events in the coming days and we will work w DOD to ensure COS, OVP and POTUS are briefed.\"\n\nAt this point, a fascinating policy discussion commenced. The account labeled \"JD Vance\" responded at 8:16: \"Team, I am out for the day doing an economic event in Michigan. But I think we are making a mistake.\" (Vance was indeed in Michigan that day.) The Vance account goes on to state, \"3 percent of US trade runs through the suez. 40 percent of European trade does. There is a real risk that the public doesn't understand this or why it's necessary. The strongest reason to do this is, as POTUS said, to send a message.\"\n\nThe Vance account then goes on to make a noteworthy statement, considering that the vice president has not deviated publicly from Trump's position on virtually any issue. \"I am not sure the president is aware how inconsistent this is with his message on Europe right now. There's a further risk that we see a moderate to severe spike in oil prices. I am willing to support the consensus of the team and keep these concerns to myself. But there is a strong argument for delaying this a month, doing the messaging work on why this matters, seeing where the economy is, etc.\"\n\nA person identified in Signal as \"Joe Kent\" (Trump's nominee to run the National Counterterrorism Center is named Joe Kent) wrote at 8:22, \"There is nothing time sensitive driving the time line. We'll have the exact same options in a month.\"\n\nThen, at 8:26 a.m., a message landed in my Signal app from the user \"John Ratcliffe.\" The message contained information that might be interpreted as related to actual and current intelligence operations.\n\nAt 8:27, a message arrived from the \"Pete Hegseth\" account. \"VP: I understand your concerns - and fully support you raising w/ POTUS. Important considerations, most of which are tough to know how they play out (economy, Ukraine peace, Gaza, etc). I think messaging is going to be tough no matter what - nobody knows who the Houthis are - which is why we would need to stay focused on: 1) Biden failed & 2) Iran funded.\"\n\nThe Hegseth message goes on to state, \"Waiting a few weeks or a month does not fundamentally change the calculus. 2 immediate risks on waiting: 1) this leaks, and we look indecisive; 2) Israel takes an action first - or Gaza cease fire falls apart - and we don't get to start this on our own terms. We can manage both. We are prepared to execute, and if I had final go or no go vote, I believe we should. This [is] not about the Houthis. I see it as two things: 1) Restoring Freedom of Navigation, a core national interest; and 2) Reestablish deterrence, which Biden cratered. But, we can easily pause. And if we do, I will do all we can to enforce 100% OPSEC\"-operations security. \"I welcome other thoughts.\"\n\nA few minutes later, the \"Michael Waltz\" account posted a lengthy note about trade figures, and the limited capabilities of European navies. \"Whether it's now or several weeks from now, it will have to be the United States that reopens these shipping lanes. Per the president's request we are working with DOD and State to determine how to compile the cost associated and levy them on the Europeans.\"\n\nThe account identified as \"JD Vance\" addressed a message at 8:45 to @Pete Hegseth: \"if you think we should do it let's go. I just hate bailing Europe out again.\" (The administration has argued that America's European allies benefit economically from the U.S. Navy's protection of international shipping lanes.)\n\nThe user identified as Hegseth responded three minutes later: \"VP: I fully share your loathing of European free-loading. It's PATHETIC. But Mike is correct, we are the only ones on the planet (on our side of the ledger) who can do this. Nobody else even close. Question is timing. I feel like now is as good a time as any, given POTUS directive to reopen shipping lanes. I think we should go; but POTUS still retains 24 hours of decision space.\"\n\nAt this point, the previously silent \"S M\" joined the conversation. \"As I heard it, the president was clear: green light, but we soon make clear to Egypt and Europe what we expect in return. We also need to figure out how to enforce such a requirement. EG, if Europe doesn't remunerate, then what? If the US successfully restores freedom of navigation at great cost there needs to be some further economic gain extracted in return.\"\n\nThat message from \"S M\"-presumably President Trump's confidant Stephen Miller, the deputy White House chief of staff, or someone playing Stephen Miller-effectively shut down the conversation. The last text of the day came from \"Pete Hegseth,\" who wrote at 9:46 a.m., \"Agree.\"\n\nAfter reading this chain, I recognized that this conversation possessed a high degree of verisimilitude. The texts, in their word choice and arguments, sounded as if they were written by the people who purportedly sent them, or by a particularly adept AI text generator. I was still concerned that this could be a disinformation operation, or a simulation of some sort. And I remained mystified that no one in the group seemed to have noticed my presence. But if it was a hoax, the quality of mimicry and the level of foreign-policy insight were impressive.\n\nIt was the next morning, Saturday, March 15, when this story became truly bizarre.\n\nAt 11:44 a.m., the account labeled \"Pete Hegseth\" posted in Signal a \"TEAM UPDATE.\" I will not quote from this update, or from certain other subsequent texts. The information contained in them, if they had been read by an adversary of the United States, could conceivably have been used to harm American military and intelligence personnel, particularly in the broader Middle East, Central Command's area of responsibility. What I will say, in order to illustrate the shocking recklessness of this Signal conversation, is that the Hegseth post contained operational details of forthcoming strikes on Yemen, including information about targets, weapons the U.S. would be deploying, and attack sequencing.\n\nThe only person to reply to the update from Hegseth was the person identified as the vice president. \"I will say a prayer for victory,\" Vance wrote. (Two other users subsequently added prayer emoji.)\n\nAccording to the lengthy Hegseth text, the first detonations in Yemen would be felt two hours hence, at 1:45 p.m. eastern time. So I waited in my car in a supermarket parking lot. If this Signal chat was real, I reasoned, Houthi targets would soon be bombed. At about 1:55, I checked X and searched Yemen . Explosions were then being heard across Sanaa, the capital city.\n\nI went back to the Signal channel. At 1:48, \"Michael Waltz\" had provided the group an update. Again, I won't quote from this text, except to note that he described the operation as an \"amazing job.\" A few minutes later, \"John Ratcliffe\" wrote, \"A good start.\" Not long after, Waltz responded with three emoji: a fist, an American flag, and fire. Others soon joined in, including \"MAR,\" who wrote, \"Good Job Pete and your team!!,\" and \"Susie Wiles,\" who texted, \"Kudos to all - most particularly those in theater and CENTCOM! Really great. God bless.\" \"Steve Witkoff\" responded with five emoji: two hands-praying, a flexed bicep, and two American flags. \"TG\" responded, \"Great work and effects!\" The after-action discussion included assessments of damage done, including the likely death of a specific individual. The Houthi-run Yemeni health ministry reported that at least 53 people were killed in the strikes, a number that has not been independently verified.\n\nOn Sunday, Waltz appeared on ABC's This Week and contrasted the strikes with the Biden administration's more hesitant approach. \"These were not kind of pinprick, back-and-forth-what ultimately proved to be feckless attacks,\" he said. \"This was an overwhelming response that actually targeted multiple Houthi leaders and took them out.\"\n\nThe Signal chat group, I concluded, was almost certainly real. Having come to this realization, one that seemed nearly impossible only hours before, I removed myself from the Signal group, understanding that this would trigger an automatic notification to the group's creator, \"Michael Waltz,\" that I had left. No one in the chat had seemed to notice that I was there. And I received no subsequent questions about why I left-or, more to the point, who I was.\n\nEarlier today, I emailed Waltz and sent him a message on his Signal account. I also wrote to Pete Hegseth, John Ratcliffe, Tulsi Gabbard, and other officials. In an email, I outlined some of my questions: Is the \"Houthi PC small group\" a genuine Signal thread? Did they know that I was included in this group? Was I (on the off chance) included on purpose? If not, who did they think I was? Did anyone realize who I was when I was added, or when I removed myself from the group? Do senior Trump-administration officials use Signal regularly for sensitive discussions? Do the officials believe that the use of such a channel could endanger American personnel?\n\nBrian Hughes, the spokesman for the National Security Council, responded two hours later, confirming the veracity of the Signal group. \"This appears to be an authentic message chain, and we are reviewing how an inadvertent number was added to the chain,\" Hughes wrote. \"The thread is a demonstration of the deep and thoughtful policy coordination between senior officials. The ongoing success of the Houthi operation demonstrates that there were no threats to troops or national security.\"\n\nWilliam Martin, a spokesperson for Vance, said that despite the impression created by the texts, the vice president is fully aligned with the president. \"The Vice President's first priority is always making sure that the President's advisers are adequately briefing him on the substance of their internal deliberations,\" he said. \"Vice President Vance unequivocally supports this administration's foreign policy. The President and the Vice President have had subsequent conversations about this matter and are in complete agreement.\"\n\nI have never seen a breach quite like this. It is not uncommon for national-security officials to communicate on Signal. But the app is used primarily for meeting planning and other logistical matters-not for detailed and highly confidential discussions of a pending military action. And, of course, I've never heard of an instance in which a journalist has been invited to such a discussion.\n\nRead: A conversation with Jeffrey Goldberg about his extraordinary scoop\n\nConceivably, Waltz, by coordinating a national-security-related action over Signal, may have violated several provisions of the Espionage Act, which governs the handling of \"national defense\" information, according to several national-security lawyers interviewed by my colleague Shane Harris for this story. Harris asked them to consider a hypothetical scenario in which a senior U.S. official creates a Signal thread for the express purpose of sharing information with Cabinet officials about an active military operation. He did not show them the actual Signal messages or tell them specifically what had occurred.\n\nAll of these lawyers said that a U.S. official should not establish a Signal thread in the first place. Information about an active operation would presumably fit the law's definition of \"national defense\" information. The Signal app is not approved by the government for sharing classified information. The government has its own systems for that purpose. If officials want to discuss military activity, they should go into a specially designed space known as a sensitive compartmented information facility, or SCIF-most Cabinet-level national-security officials have one installed in their home-or communicate only on approved government equipment, the lawyers said. Normally, cellphones are not permitted inside a SCIF, which suggests that as these officials were sharing information about an active military operation, they could have been moving around in public. Had they lost their phones, or had they been stolen, the potential risk to national security would have been severe.\n\nHegseth, Ratcliffe, and other Cabinet-level officials presumably would have the authority to declassify information, and several of the national-security lawyers noted that the hypothetical officials on the Signal chain might claim that they had declassified the information they shared. But this argument rings hollow, they cautioned, because Signal is not an authorized venue for sharing information of such a sensitive nature, regardless of whether it has been stamped \"top secret\" or not.\n\nThere was another potential problem: Waltz set some of the messages in the Signal group to disappear after one week, and some after four. That raises questions about whether the officials may have violated federal records law: Text messages about official acts are considered records that should be preserved.\n\n\"Under the records laws applicable to the White House and federal agencies, all government employees are prohibited from using electronic-messaging applications such as Signal for official business, unless those messages are promptly forwarded or copied to an official government account,\" Jason R. Baron, a professor at the University of Maryland and the former director of litigation at the National Archives and Records Administration, told Harris.\n\n\"Intentional violations of these requirements are a basis for disciplinary action. Additionally, agencies such as the Department of Defense restrict electronic messaging containing classified information to classified government networks and/or networks with government-approved encrypted features,\" Baron said.\n\nSeveral former U.S. officials told Harris and me that they had used Signal to share unclassified information and to discuss routine matters, particularly when traveling overseas without access to U.S. government systems. But they knew never to share classified or sensitive information on the app, because their phones could have been hacked by a foreign intelligence service, which would have been able to read the messages on the devices. It is worth noting that Donald Trump, as a candidate for president (and as president), repeatedly and vociferously demanded that Hillary Clinton be imprisoned for using a private email server for official business when she was secretary of state. (It is also worth noting that Trump was indicted in 2023 for mishandling classified documents, but the charges were dropped after his election.)\n\nWaltz and the other Cabinet-level officials were already potentially violating government policy and the law simply by texting one another about the operation. But when Waltz added a journalist-presumably by mistake-to his principals committee, he created new security and legal issues. Now the group was transmitting information to someone not authorized to receive it. That is the classic definition of a leak, even if it was unintentional, and even if the recipient of the leak did not actually believe it was a leak until Yemen came under American attack.\n\nAll along, members of the Signal group were aware of the need for secrecy and operations security. In his text detailing aspects of the forthcoming attack on Houthi targets, Hegseth wrote to the group-which, at the time, included me-\"We are currently clean on OPSEC.\"\n\nShane Harris contributed reporting."

      "text": "Trump's Day of Reckoning\n\nThe president's allies are privately acknowledging that he is in a rough stretch.\n\nProduced by ElevenLabs and News Over Audio (Noa) using AI narration. Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nUpdated at 8:25 p.m. ET on April 2, 2025\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he pushed his so-called Liberation Day from yesterday to today to avoid April Fool's Day-\"because then nobody would believe what I said.\" Now, instead of falling on a date devoted to pranks, Trump's announcement about a new wave of reciprocal tariffs comes at a moment when his White House is facing a sobering reality.\n\nLast night, Republicans took a double-digit loss in a closely watched Wisconsin election-a campaign that became a referendum on top Trump adviser Elon Musk-and had to sweat out wins in a pair of deep-red Florida House districts. The first major scandal of Trump's second term, his team's use of Signal to discuss sensitive military attack plans, could spawn an independent investigation. Some influential MAGA luminaries and immigration hawks have begun to criticize the administration's deportation tactics for lacking due process. Consumer prices aren't falling, but the stock market sure is. And as Trump moves to escalate his trade war, fears of a recession are rising.\n\nFor the first time since Trump reclaimed the White House, some of his close allies and aides are privately acknowledging that a president who returned to office after a historic political comeback has been knocked off his stride. They admit that the past two weeks-particularly the Signal scandal, which has led some congressional Republicans to defy Trump and demand a probe-have been the most challenging of his term.\n\nFor months now, Trump has tried very hard to make \"Liberation Day\" a thing. Soon after his January swearing-in, he christened the day as the moment when he would enact reciprocal tariffs on major trading partners, particularly those that contribute the most to the $1.2 trillion U.S. trade deficit. He first eyed holding the day in February but pushed back the implementation of the levies to April 1-the date by which he ordered the Treasury Department and the Commerce Department to complete studies on what the policies might look like in practice-before nudging it one more day.\n\nRead: Wisconsin's message for Trump\n\nAt 7:06 eastern time this morning, Trump saluted the occasion on Truth Social: \"IT'S LIBERATION DAY IN AMERICA!\" But the more telling post had come six hours earlier, at nearly 1 a.m. EST. Trump advisers have long told me that the clearest revelations about the president's frustrations and insecurities come late at night, when he is alone with his phone. In this case, his anger was directed at four fellow Republicans-Senators Mitch McConnell, Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, and Rand Paul-who he said were being \"extremely difficult to deal with and unbelievably disloyal\" by opposing tariffs on Canada. \"What is wrong with them, other than suffering from Trump Derangement Syndrome, commonly known as TDS?\" Trump wrote.\n\nTrump, used to tightly controlling the GOP during partisan fights, was furious that he was not getting a united Republican front for his prized tariffs, two White House officials and a close outside ally told me, granted anonymity to discuss internal conversations.\n\nWhile those four Republicans have gone public with their misgivings about the tariffs, many others have quietly expressed concerns to colleagues and reporters, or tried to lobby the White House for carve-outs that would spare their state's constituents or favored industries. Business leaders who thought Trump was largely bluffing with his trade-war talk (the tariffs in his first term ended up being milder than expected) have also tried to lobby the president or Chief of Staff Susie Wiles to ease up, the White House officials told me.\n\nTrump has vacillated on the size and targets of the tariffs-they were still being settled in the hours before the Rose Garden announcement, one of the White House officials confirmed to me-but never on whether to impose them. Trump assigns outsize weight to the stock market when judging the nation's economy, but even tumbles on Wall Street have not dissuaded him. Trump possesses few consistent political ideologies but has promoted tariffs since the 1980s as a means to reduce trade deficits and spur U.S. manufacturing, and he has dismissed economists' warnings that they would drive up prices for Americans and potentially stagnate the nation's economy.\n\nRead: The Trump administration accidentally texted me its war plans\n\n\"Republicans are crashing the American economy in real time and driving us to a recession. This is not Liberation Day; it's Recession Day,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries told reporters in the Capitol today.\n\nThe pushback to his tariffs has not been the only source of ire for Trump during a sudden eruption of negative headlines. Democrats seized on the results in three off-year elections yesterday, held just 70 days into Trump's term. Although Republicans won both special elections to fill vacant Florida congressional seats, both winning candidates earned about 20 percent fewer votes than Trump did in those same districts in November. Of note: In the ruby-red Florida panhandle, Escambia County went Democratic for the first time in any national election since 1992-a result, many political observers have said, of the Trump administration's cuts to Veterans Affairs programs in a region with many military families.\n\nThe face of those cuts, of course, is Elon Musk, whose Department of Government Efficiency has chainsawed its way through the federal bureaucracy on Trump's orders. And Musk-whose personal poll numbers have been cratering along with Tesla's stock-received much of the blame for the outcome of yesterday's Wisconsin state-supreme-court election. The world's richest man threw himself into the race with his time and fortune, declaring that \"humanity's destiny rests\" on the outcome. Despite the lofty stakes, Musk's preferred candidate lost by 10 points.\n\nSome in Trump's orbit hope that the loss might represent the beginning of the end of Musk's influence. For weeks, Republicans in Congress have quietly complained to the White House that Musk's often indiscriminate cuts are making them the target of voter anger. Cabinet secretaries' complaints also led Trump to somewhat rein in his billionaire aide. Trump has told advisers in recent days that Musk will begin winding down his time in the White House in the weeks ahead, likely when his 130-day window as a \"special government employee\" runs out at the end of next month, according to the two White House officials.\n\n\"Musk's 'sell by date' is rapidly approaching,\" the outside ally wrote to me. \"He was a heat shield for a time. Now he's a heat source.\"\n\nRead: Is DOGE losing steam?\n\nTrump has at times chafed at Musk's more politically incendiary comments, such as his declaration that Social Security is \"the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\" But the president, according to the two White House officials, has told advisers that-at least for now-he plans to have Musk remain in his orbit even after he leaves the administration.\n\nTrump has recently taken to phoning allies late at night to complain about a series of negative stories, according to the outside ally and another person who has received such calls. He remains angry at National Security Adviser Mike Waltz for inadvertently adding Jeffrey Goldberg, the editor in chief of The Atlantic , to a Signal chat about attack plans to strike Houthi rebels in Yemen. He has resisted firing Waltz so as not to be seen as giving in to the media, though he has fumed about Waltz having Goldberg's number in his phone. Having pledged to bring a quick end to wars in both the Middle East and Ukraine, Trump has watched as a cease-fire in Gaza has been shattered and as Vladimir Putin has refused to agree to American terms to bring a temporary halt to the fighting in Europe. And although Trump has delighted in the showy deportations of alleged gang members to a notorious El Salvador prison, he was annoyed that friendly media voices including Joe Rogan questioned a lack of due process, and that the right-wing pundit Ann Coulter openly balked at the arrest of a Columbia University graduate student who led pro-Palestine protests.\n\nAsked whether the White House was concerned that Trump's political momentum might be stalling, Karoline Leavitt, his press secretary, told me in a statement: \"President Trump has accomplished more in 72 days than any president in four years\" and that he is \"just getting started-there's more work to do to clean up the crises of the incompetent Biden-Harris Administration.\"\n\nBut the administration is clearly hoping that Liberation Day will reset the political narrative.\n\nTrump has \"spent a lot of political capital in his first 100 days, but Republicans will see it as a good investment if he can ultimately deliver on tax cuts and deficit reductions,\" Alex Conant, a GOP strategist who worked in President George W. Bush's White House and on then-Senator Marco Rubio's presidential campaign, told me. \"But recessions and inflation are politically devastating for any president. Trump is risking both with his trade wars, so it's understandably making his allies extremely nervous.\"\n\nIn a tacit acknowledgment of the skepticism the tariffs are generating, the White House pushed back the Rose Garden event from early afternoon until after the markets had closed."

      "text": "Trump: Americans Who Died in War Are 'Losers' and 'Suckers'\n\nThe president has repeatedly disparaged the intelligence of service members, and asked that wounded veterans be kept out of military parades, multiple sources tell The Atlantic .\n\nWhen President Donald Trump canceled a visit to the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery, near Paris, in 2018, he blamed rain for the last-minute decision, saying that \"the helicopter couldn't fly\" and that the Secret Service wouldn't drive him there. Neither claim was true.\n\nTrump rejected the idea of the visit because he feared his hair would become disheveled in the rain, and because he did not believe it important to honor American war dead, according to four people with firsthand knowledge of the discussion that day. In a conversation with senior staff members on the morning of the scheduled visit, Trump said, \"Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers.\" In a separate conversation on the same trip, Trump referred to the more than 1,800 marines who lost their lives at Belleau Wood as \"suckers\" for getting killed.\n\nFrom the April 2020 issue: The president is winning his war on American institutions\n\nBelleau Wood is a consequential battle in American history, and the ground on which it was fought is venerated by the Marine Corps. America and its allies stopped the German advance toward Paris there in the spring of 1918. But Trump, on that same trip, asked aides, \"Who were the good guys in this war?\" He also said that he didn't understand why the United States would intervene on the side of the Allies.\n\nTrump's understanding of concepts such as patriotism, service, and sacrifice has interested me since he expressed contempt for the war record of the late Senator John McCain, who spent more than five years as a prisoner of the North Vietnamese. \"He's not a war hero,\" Trump said in 2015 while running for the Republican nomination for president. \"I like people who weren't captured.\"\n\nRead: John McCain's death brought out the worst in the Trump administration\n\nThere was no precedent in American politics for the expression of this sort of contempt, but the performatively patriotic Trump did no damage to his candidacy by attacking McCain in this manner. Nor did he set his campaign back by attacking the parents of Humayun Khan, an Army captain who was killed in Iraq in 2004.\n\nTrump remained fixated on McCain, one of the few prominent Republicans to continue criticizing him after he won the nomination. When McCain died, in August 2018, Trump told his senior staff, according to three sources with direct knowledge of this event, \"We're not going to support that loser's funeral,\" and he became furious, according to witnesses, when he saw flags lowered to half-staff. \"What the fuck are we doing that for? Guy was a fucking loser,\" the president told aides. Trump was not invited to McCain's funeral. (These sources, and others quoted in this article, spoke on condition of anonymity. The White House did not return earlier calls for comment, but Alyssa Farah, a White House spokesperson, emailed me this statement shortly after this story was posted: \"This report is false. President Trump holds the military in the highest regard. He's demonstrated his commitment to them at every turn: delivering on his promise to give our troops a much needed pay raise, increasing military spending, signing critical veterans reforms, and supporting military spouses. This has no basis in fact.\")\n\nEliot A. Cohen: America's generals must stand up to Trump\n\nTrump's understanding of heroism has not evolved since he became president. According to sources with knowledge of the president's views, he seems to genuinely not understand why Americans treat former prisoners of war with respect. Nor does he understand why pilots who are shot down in combat are honored by the military. On at least two occasions since becoming president, according to three sources with direct knowledge of his views, Trump referred to former President George H. W. Bush as a \"loser\" for being shot down by the Japanese as a Navy pilot in World War II. (Bush escaped capture, but eight other men shot down during the same mission were caught, tortured, and executed by Japanese soldiers.)\n\nWhen lashing out at critics, Trump often reaches for illogical and corrosive insults, and members of the Bush family have publicly opposed him. But his cynicism about service and heroism extends even to the World War I dead buried outside Paris-people who were killed more than a quarter century before he was born. Trump finds the notion of military service difficult to understand, and the idea of volunteering to serve especially incomprehensible. (The president did not serve in the military; he received a medical deferment from the draft during the Vietnam War because of the alleged presence of bone spurs in his feet. In the 1990s, Trump said his efforts to avoid contracting sexually transmitted diseases constituted his \"personal Vietnam.\")\n\nAmy J. Rutenberg: What Trump's draft deferments reveal\n\nOn Memorial Day 2017, Trump visited Arlington National Cemetery, a short drive from the White House. He was accompanied on this visit by John Kelly, who was then the secretary of homeland security, and who would, a short time later, be named the White House chief of staff. The two men were set to visit Section 60, the 14-acre area of the cemetery that is the burial ground for those killed in America's most recent wars. Kelly's son Robert is buried in Section 60. A first lieutenant in the Marine Corps, Robert Kelly was killed in 2010 in Afghanistan. He was 29. Trump was meant, on this visit, to join John Kelly in paying respects at his son's grave, and to comfort the families of other fallen service members. But according to sources with knowledge of this visit, Trump, while standing by Robert Kelly's grave, turned directly to his father and said, \"I don't get it. What was in it for them?\" Kelly (who declined to comment for this story) initially believed, people close to him said, that Trump was making a ham-handed reference to the selflessness of America's all-volunteer force. But later he came to realize that Trump simply does not understand non-transactional life choices.\n\n\"He can't fathom the idea of doing something for someone other than himself,\" one of Kelly's friends, a retired four-star general, told me. \"He just thinks that anyone who does anything when there's no direct personal gain to be had is a sucker. There's no money in serving the nation.\" Kelly's friend went on to say, \"Trump can't imagine anyone else's pain. That's why he would say this to the father of a fallen marine on Memorial Day in the cemetery where he's buried.\"\n\nI've asked numerous general officers over the past year for their analysis of Trump's seeming contempt for military service. They offer a number of explanations. Some of his cynicism is rooted in frustration, they say. Trump, unlike previous presidents, tends to believe that the military, like other departments of the federal government, is beholden only to him, and not the Constitution. Many senior officers have expressed worry about Trump's understanding of the rules governing the use of the armed forces. This issue came to a head in early June, during demonstrations in Washington, D.C., in response to police killings of Black people. James Mattis, the retired Marine general and former secretary of defense, lambasted Trump at the time for ordering law-enforcement officers to forcibly clear protesters from Lafayette Square, and for using soldiers as props: \"When I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution,\" Mattis wrote. \"Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens-much less to provide a bizarre photo op for the elected commander-in-chief, with military leadership standing alongside.\"\n\nRead: James Mattis denounces President Trump, describes him as a threat to the Constitution\n\nAnother explanation is more quotidian, and aligns with a broader understanding of Trump's material-focused worldview. The president believes that nothing is worth doing without the promise of monetary payback, and that talented people who don't pursue riches are \"losers.\" (According to eyewitnesses, after a White House briefing given by the then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joe Dunford, Trump turned to aides and said, \"That guy is smart. Why did he join the military?\")\n\nYet another, related, explanation concerns what appears to be Trump's pathological fear of appearing to look like a \"sucker\" himself. His capacious definition of sucker includes those who lose their lives in service to their country, as well as those who are taken prisoner, or are wounded in battle. \"He has a lot of fear,\" one officer with firsthand knowledge of Trump's views said. \"He doesn't see the heroism in fighting.\" Several observers told me that Trump is deeply anxious about dying or being disfigured, and this worry manifests itself as disgust for those who have suffered. Trump recently claimed that he has received the bodies of slain service members \"many, many\" times, but in fact he has traveled to Dover Air Force Base, the transfer point for the remains of fallen service members, only four times since becoming president. In another incident , Trump falsely claimed that he had called \"virtually all\" of the families of service members who had died during his term, then began rush-shipping condolence letters when families said the president was not telling the truth.\n\nRead: Top military officers unload on Trump\n\nTrump has been, for the duration of his presidency, fixated on staging military parades, but only of a certain sort. In a 2018 White House planning meeting for such an event, Trump asked his staff not to include wounded veterans, on grounds that spectators would feel uncomfortable in the presence of amputees. \"Nobody wants to see that,\" he said."

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here.\n\nAccording to President Donald Trump, April 2, 2025-the day he unveiled his executive order implementing global tariffs-will be remembered as a turning point in American history. He might be right. Unfortunately, April 2 is more likely to be remembered as a fiasco-alongside October 24, 1929 (the stock-market crash that kicked off the Great Depression), and September 15, 2008 (the collapse of Lehman Brothers)-than as the beginning of a new era of American prosperity.\n\nThe stated rationale behind Trump's new \"reciprocal tariffs\" has a more coherent internal logic than Trump's previous tariff maneuvers. ( Stated , as we will see, is the key word.) The idea is that other countries have unfairly advantaged their own industries at the expense of America's, both through tariffs and through methods such as currency manipulation and subsidies to domestic firms. To solve the problem, the U.S. will now tax imports from nearly every country on the planet, supposedly in proportion to the barriers that those countries place on American goods.\n\nThe goal, according to senior administration officials, is to pressure other countries into removing their trade barriers, at which point the U.S. will drop its own. In his Rose Garden speech announcing the tariff order, Trump demanded that foreign countries \"terminate your own tariffs, drop your barriers,\" and \"don't manipulate your currencies\" if they hoped to get a reprieve from tariffs. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent has even argued that many of the new tariffs won't ever need to go into effect, because other countries will be so quick to comply. In this telling, Trump's reciprocal measures represent the tariff to end all tariffs, paving the road to a system of genuinely free trade and a return to American industrial dominance.\n\nBut the logical consistency, such as it is, is only internal. When the new tariffs come into contact with external reality, they are likely to produce the exact opposite of the intended outcome.\n\nJonathan Chait: The good news about Trump's tariffs\n\nMost obviously, the tariffs don't appear to be based on actual trade barriers, which undermines their entire justification. Contrary to White House messaging, the formula for determining the new rates turns out to have been based simply on the dollar value of goods the U.S. imports from a given country relative to how much it exports. The administration took the difference between the two numbers, divided it by each country's total exports, then divided that total in half, and slapped an import tax on countries at that rate. The theoretically reciprocal tariffs are not, in fact, reciprocal.\n\nThe result is that there is no clear or obvious path that countries could take to get those tariffs removed even if they wanted to. Countries can remove all of their trade restrictions and still run a trade surplus. South Korea, Mexico, and Canada, for example, export more to us than they import from us despite imposing virtually no trade barriers. As The New York Times reported , \"Trump's decision to put a 32 percent tariff on Switzerland stunned politicians and business leaders in the Alpine country. Switzerland has an open trade policy and recently abolished all industrial tariffs, including on goods from the United States, which is also its largest export market.\"\n\nEven if other countries did figure out ways to shrink their trade imbalances with the U.S., that still wouldn't necessarily lead to a reprieve: Trump imposed 10 percent tariffs even on countries, like Brazil, that import more from America than they export to it. The only thing the White House has made clear is that any decision to remove or raise tariffs will be made by Trump himself. \"These tariffs will remain in effect until such a time as President Trump determines that the threat posed by the trade deficit and underlying nonreciprocal treatment is satisfied, resolved, or mitigated,\" read the White House's memo on the new order. Translation: The only way you will get a tariff reprieve is by groveling at Trump's feet.\n\nTo see the impossible choices that Trump's tariffs impose on other countries, consider the trade restrictions that the administration accuses the European Union of maintaining against American products. These include food-safety regulations that ban certain ingredients, digital sales taxes, and the value-added tax-the European equivalent of a national sales tax that funds much of its members' welfare programs. Calling most of these \"trade barriers\" in the first place is nonsensical, because they apply equally to foreign and domestic goods. The upshot is that, in order to meet Trump's demands for tariff removal, Europe would need to overhaul not only its trade practices but much of its tax and regulatory system.\n\nThe best way to predict how countries will react to Trump's newest tariffs is to look at how they responded to earlier ones. China and Europe quickly met past Trump tariffs with steep retaliatory measures of their own. Even in a friendly country as dependent on U.S. trade as Canada, Trump's threats have generated a surge of anti-American nationalism that has upended the country's domestic politics. \"The idea that foreign leaders are going to commit political suicide to give Trump what he wants is crazy enough,\" Scott Lincicome, the director of general economics and trade at the Cato Institute, told me. \"The idea that they'd do it with basically no guaranteed upside just completely boggles the mind.\"\n\nScott Lincicome: How Republicans learned to love high prices\n\nTrump's newest tariffs have already sparked widespread outrage among America's trading partners. The head of the European Union has said that the body has a \"strong plan to retaliate\" against Trump's reciprocal tariffs, and multiple individual European countries are considering their own additional retaliatory policies. France has floated the idea of expanding the trade war beyond physical goods by targeting U.S. tech companies. China vowed to take countermeasures against what it described as \"self-defeating bullying.\" Brazil's president is considering retaliating, and the country's National Congress, which includes many vocal right-wing supporters of Trump, recently approved legislation to empower him to do so.\n\nIf that pattern holds, Trump's tariffs are likely to backfire. The result will be a one-way ratcheting up of tariffs across the globe, creating a trade wall between the U.S. and the rest of the world and indefinitely raising the cost of all imports.\n\nTrump seems to welcome that possibility. During his Rose Garden address, which was titled \"Make America Wealthy Again,\" the president spoke at length about outcomes that are likely to occur only if the U.S. does not lower its tariffs, such as bringing in \"trillions and trillions\" of dollars of revenue and forcing companies to open factories inside the U.S. to avoid the new barriers. He sounded much more like someone who expected the tariffs to stay in place indefinitely than someone using them as a negotiating tactic.\n\nIn theory, the flip side of sustained higher prices would be a boost to American manufacturing, as consumers choose to purchase domestic goods over foreign ones. But here again, reality might laugh at the theory. About half of all U.S. imports are inputs that go into our own manufacturing production, meaning that American companies will suffer from higher prices too, even as retaliatory tariffs make it harder to sell their products abroad.\n\nPerhaps the greatest damage will result from global uncertainty. After weeks of economic chaos, Trump's big announcement was supposed to finally provide some clarity, allowing businesses to plan for the future. Instead, the future is more cloudy than ever. No one knows which of the tariffs will stick and which will be lifted. Countries will appeal to Trump to get their tariffs removed. Industries will lobby for carve-outs. The White House has announced no clear system for removing or reducing the tariffs, and even if it did, the ultimate choice will lie with the president himself, who is not known as a model of consistent and predictable decision making. These are the makings of an economic slowdown. \"I would be shocked if we make it through next year without a recession,\" Kimberly Clausing, an economist at the UCLA School of Law, told me.\n\nRogé Karma: The job market is frozen\n\nWhat makes the new reciprocal tariffs all the more baffling is that a much less risky method exists to get other countries to agree to free trade. It is called a free-trade agreement. Trump ought to know. In his first term, his administration negotiated the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or \"New NAFTA,\" which lowered trade barriers between America and its neighbors while requiring all parties to abide by higher labor and environmental standards. The Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade deal negotiated by the Obama administration between the U.S. and 11 countries, including Vietnam, Japan, Singapore, and Malaysia, would have done something similar if Trump hadn't pulled the U.S. out of the deal upon entering office in 2017. Those are some of the same countries that he is now trying to tariff into submission. He would have been better off remembering the art of the deal.\n\nSupport for this project was provided by the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation."

Listen to more stories on the Noa app.\n\nSign up for Trump's Return , a newsletter featuring coverage of the second Trump presidency.\n\nLast week, when the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison cut a deal with President Donald Trump to break free from an executive order that could have ruined its business, the powerhouse firm framed the concessions as a mere reaffirmation of its principles. Those principles include: \"We refuse to be deterred by the unpopularity of a client or his cause.\"\n\nBut on Thursday morning, hours before Trump took to social media to proclaim that the firm, known as Paul Weiss, had pledged $40 million worth of pro bono services to initiatives aligned with his administration, the firm severed ties with the nation's oldest and largest Latino civil-rights organization, the League of United Latin American Citizens.\n\n\"LULAC's long-standing relationship with Paul Weiss has been a fruitful one,\" the organization's CEO, Juan Proaño, told me over the weekend when I contacted him about the decision by Paul Weiss, which has been associated with prominent Democrats, to stop representing the group. The move is a previously unreported aspect of the firm's concessions to Trump. The firm did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"I suppose they view LULAC as a DEI organization because we're Latino,\" Proaño said, referring to diversity, equity, and inclusion-commitments derided by Trump. He added, \"We understand what the pressures are.\"\n\nThe pressures boil down to fear-fear of adverse executive action, fear of associations disfavored by a vengeful president, and fear of a government bent on retribution.\n\nTwo months into Trump's second term, fear is taking hold across broad cross sections of American society. Business executives are privately speculating that the U.S. president could be a foreign asset, his actions a \"gift to China,\" but biting their tongues in public. University administrators and the lobbyists they've retained are quietly expressing relief that Columbia is the government's \"whipping boy,\" keeping their heads down to avoid a lashing of their own. Government scientists, apprehensive that their research will be scrapped, are scrubbing their work of anything that might smack of diversity efforts.\n\nThe fear stems from aggressive actions the president has taken to punish his perceived adversaries. These actions go beyond broadsides on social media and efforts to intimidate vulnerable groups including immigrants and transgender Americans, hallmarks of Trump's first term in office. This time, he is also withholding government assets, whether in the form of federal funding, which has been the lifeblood of scientific and medical research, or security clearances and access to federal buildings indispensable to legal and other professional work.\n\nThe consequences are severe: hiring freezes, loss of clients, abandoned clinical trials. So fear of confronting the president spreads, quieting those who might otherwise be motivated to speak out.\n\nF irst Amendment scholars and other experts say the repression is more extensive than at any other time since the McCarthy era, when anti-communist paranoia reached a fever pitch and produced blacklists, congressional hearings, and zealous prosecutions targeting Hollywood, academia, left-wing politics, and the labor movement. \"I live in an age of fear,\" E. B. White, the essayist and author of children's classics including Charlotte's Web and The Trumpet of the Swan , wrote in 1947.\n\nA similar campaign of intimidation is now taking shape against universities, law firms, and federal workers. The fear coursing through them in recent weeks is a defining feature of authoritarian societies, experts told me.\n\n\"It's a common tactic of authoritarian regimes to get people and institutions to violate their own principles out of fear, which then makes them less effective over time,\" says Lee Bollinger, a lawyer and legal scholar who served as president of Columbia University for more than 20 years and, before that, as president of the University of Michigan.\n\nFrom the March 2025 issue: Capitulation is contagious\n\nTwo developments last week revealed the depths of the fear within big law firms and prominent research universities.\n\nThe first was the move on Thursday by Paul Weiss to appease Trump so he would rescind an executive order stripping its lawyers of security clearances and barring them from government buildings-one of several similar orders targeting law firms because their members had represented his partisan opponents or aided his criminal prosecution. Then, the next day, Columbia caved to demands by the Trump administration to ban face coverings, reinforce campus policing, and overhaul its Middle Eastern-studies department as part of a standoff over $400 million in federal funding.\n\nThe concessions to Trump sent jolts through the legal and academic communities, where others suddenly felt less latitude to challenge administration actions. The \"appeasement strategy,\" as Bollinger puts it, \"is really not one that I think ever works out in the end.\" A better approach, he told me, is \"very vigorous collective resistance, especially through litigation and the courts.\"\n\nCecilia Menjívar, a sociologist at UCLA, told me that fear, as it spreads through society, can create the possibility for collective action. But it can also limit dissent. Autocrats around the world, she said, use fear and insecurity to silence opposition-\"so the only voice is that of the autocrat.\" Trump has acknowledged that fear is central to his authority. In a 2016 interview with Bob Woodward and Robert Costa of The Washington Post , he said, \"Real power is-I don't even want to use the word-fear.\"\n\nThe then-candidate was referring to fear among adversaries abroad. Now he has whole segments of American society running scared. In a statement, the White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told me, \"President Trump wasn't elected to satisfy the status quo, he was elected to upend the broken bureaucracy and bring common sense polices back to our Nation's Capital. Regardless of what anyone says, the President has a mandate for everything he's doing and the American people are on board.\"\n\nI n the two months since Trump returned to power, there have been scattered acts of dissent. But they seem only to accentuate the broader silence within major American institutions.\n\nChristopher Eisgruber, the president of Princeton University, warned in an essay for The Atlantic last week that the Trump administration's crusade against Columbia endangers all of university life and, by extension, the country. \"Every American should be concerned,\" he wrote.\n\nBut many academic leaders are \"keeping their heads down,\" Ted Mitchell, the president of the American Council on Education, a Washington-based nonprofit, told me. He described that as a \"completely rational strategy.\"\n\n\"There's a conflict there, and I feel it myself,\" Mitchell said. \"Many university presidents are saying, Let's take our time and watch where all this settles; let's pick our battles, and let's keep our powder dry. There will be a time when we're challenged to stand up for our values, but now is not the time; it's not that time yet. And I agree with that decision.\" A lobbyist working with universities describes the sentiment a different way: \"They're just happy that Columbia is the whipping boy.\"\n\nThe reaction from the medical community has also been muted. When asked if the American Medical Association has a position on sweeping cuts to medical and scientific research ordered by the Trump administration, a spokesperson for the professional group-the largest and most influential physician organization in the country-pointed to a March 5 letter to the National Institutes of Health submitted by the AMA's president and nearly 50 other similar groups warning that the damage from the administration's policy would be \"profound and generational.\" But the group's president, Bruce Scott, a Kentucky otolaryngologist, has not spoken publicly about the research cuts. And the AMA did not weigh in on the nomination of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., an outspoken vaccine skeptic, to be Trump's health secretary.\n\nRachel Cohen, a 30-year-old associate at the firm Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom, tendered her resignation last week in a firm-wide email imploring her colleagues to speak out against a demand by the Trump administration that law firms detail their hiring practices as part of a crackdown on diversity initiatives. \"Colleagues, if you question if it is as bad as you think it is, it is ten times worse,\" she wrote.\n\n\"People are terrified, but everyone understands and admits what's happening,\" Cohen, a graduate of Ohio State University and Harvard Law School who specializes in finance law, told me.\n\nUnder Trump, the business imperatives influencing major law firms are running into conflict with their professional responsibilities, says Bob Bauer, a lawyer and law professor at NYU who served as White House counsel under former President Barack Obama. \"The business side of the profession is at this point such a powerful draw away from what I'll call Atticus Finch-like behavior,\" Bauer told me, referring to the lawyer in To Kill a Mockingbird who takes a principled stand against racism in the legal system.\n\nMany business leaders are aghast at Trump's actions, according to an anonymous survey released by Yale's Chief Executive Leadership Institute, which hosted about 100 CEOs at a conclave in Washington, D.C., this month. Eighty percent of the CEOs said they found themselves apologizing to foreign partners for Trump's \"capriciousness,\" according to the survey results. Eighty-five percent said the chaos emanating from Washington is a \"gift to China.\"\n\nOn the roof terrace of 101 Constitution Avenue NW, adjacent to the Capitol, the leaders of such companies as Pfizer, JP Morgan, and American Airlines offered blunt assessments of Trump. \"CEOs are whispering, 'Is he merely a foreign asset, or is he a foreign agent?'\" Jeffrey A. Sonnenfeld, a Yale School of Management professor and president of the leadership institute, told me. \"He's at war with the country, and they know it.\"\n\nBusiness leaders will speak out publicly once they feel sufficient societal pressure, Sonnenfeld said. \"So I say, 'Where's everybody else? Where's the American Medical Association? Where's the clergy?'\" Otherwise, CEOs \"fear being targeted and forced from their positions,\" he said, pointing to the departure of Matthew Levatich as CEO of the motorcycle manufacturer Harley-Davidson after he became a focus of White House criticism during Trump's first term.\n\nFrom the April 2025 issue: The real goal of the Trump economy\n\nAt least one development would compel business leaders to speak up, Sonnenfeld said: \"They virtually all tell us if the market drops 20 percent, they'll be screaming their lungs out.\"\n\nShort of that kind of blow to their bottom line, \"not complying is not an option,\" a former senior Republican official in touch with prominent business leaders told me, speaking on the condition of anonymity to describe sensitive conversations. \"It's the same calculus as Columbia,\" the former official added, referring to the university's efforts to appease the administration. \"They are caving on everything so they can live to fight another day.\"\n\nFear of speaking out is heightened, the former official said, because Trump has effectively removed many of the institutional checks on his authority to carry out retribution-including by bringing the Justice Department and the FBI more firmly under his control and firing inspectors general, who might probe improper government-contracting decisions.\n\n\"If you're subject to unjust action by the administration, there's no one to appeal to, or the appeal will take so long that the damage will be done,\" the former official said. \"There's nothing to stop these folks in the short term from destroying entities and individuals they don't like.\"\n\nF ew are more afraid of the president destroying them than are people inside the federal government. Federal workers have been swapping stories about new software appearing on their devices, worried that Elon Musk and his deputies at DOGE are \"watching our every keystroke,\" as one U.S. official told me.\n\n\"The fear is really palpable,\" a senior government scientist told me. \"I get up every morning to see if there's something from the nameless, Kafkaesque HR department. I've stopped checking my email after 8 p.m. because if something comes at night, I won't be able to sleep.\"\n\nThe scientist said he feels compelled to stand up for the values of the federal health agencies-\"to be part of the resistance\"-but the fear is that \"if you stand up, you'll be cut down.\"\n\nSome civil servants have sued the Trump administration over their dismissal-part of a blizzard of early litigation challenging Trump's executive actions. Dozens of rulings have temporarily halted aspects of the president's agenda, including an effort to gut USAID as well as certain attempts by Musk's team to access sensitive government data.\n\n\"The fear is real, but I have a somewhat contrarian view of the current situation: My perspective is that Trump's flood-the-zone approach has been met and indeed surpassed by rule of law shock and awe,\" says Norm Eisen, a lawyer who helped manage the first impeachment of Trump and, recently, has helped bring cases against the president contesting his efforts to dismantle the federal workforce and expand his own powers. Trump has taken notice, singling out Eisen during remarks at the Justice Department earlier this month: \"He's been vicious and violent.\"\n\nTrump last week took steps to scare off lawyers who would dare oppose him, directing his attorney general to identify firms associated with \"frivolous\" lawsuits so they can be targeted with executive actions-a move, a Washington lawyer told me, \"designed expressly to make law firms think three times before suing the administration.\"\n\nMeanwhile, firms are taking steps to protect themselves. One Washington firm hired a vendor to scan right-wing message boards for threats that might bubble up to the White House and occasion an attack from the president. The firm also modified its document-retention policy in preparation for possible government probes.\n\nThe question haunting the firm and prompting these actions, according to one of its members, who insisted that the firm not be identified to avoid reprisal, is: \"Where are we on the list?\""

The killer, aided by his girlfriend, burned Guillén's body. Guillén's remains were discovered two months later, buried in a riverbank near the base, after a massive search.\n\nIn the meeting, Trump maintained a dignified posture and expressed sympathy to Guillén's mother. \"I saw what happened to your daughter Vanessa, who was a spectacular person, and respected and loved by everybody, including in the military,\" Trump said. Later in the conversation, he made a promise: \"If I can help you out with the funeral, I'll help-I'll help you with that,\" he said. \"I'll help you out. Financially, I'll help you.\"\n\nNatalie Khawam, the family's attorney, responded, \"I think the military will be paying-taking care of it.\" Trump replied, \"Good. They'll do a military. That's good. If you need help, I'll help you out.\" Later, a reporter covering the meeting asked Trump, \"Have you offered to do that for other families before?\" Trump responded, \"I have. I have. Personally. I have to do it personally. I can't do it through government.\" The reporter then asked: \"So you've written checks to help for other families before this?\" Trump turned to the family, still present, and said, \"I have, I have, because some families need help ... Maybe you don't need help, from a financial standpoint. I have no idea what-I just think it's a horrific thing that happened. And if you did need help, I'm going to-I'll be there to help you.\"\n\nThis article was featured in the One Story to Read Today newsletter. Sign up for it here .\n\nA public memorial service was held in Houston two weeks after the White House meeting. It was followed by a private funeral and burial in a local cemetery, attended by, among others, the mayor of Houston and the city's police chief. Highways were shut down, and mourners lined the streets.\n\nFive months later, the secretary of the Army, Ryan McCarthy, announced the results of an investigation. McCarthy cited numerous \"leadership failures\" at Fort Hood and relieved or suspended several officers, including the base's commanding general. In a press conference, McCarthy said that the murder \"shocked our conscience\" and \"forced us to take a critical look at our systems, our policies, and ourselves.\"\n\nAccording to a person close to Trump at the time, the president was agitated by McCarthy's comments and raised questions about the severity of the punishments dispensed to senior officers and noncommissioned officers.\n\nIn an Oval Office meeting on December 4, 2020, officials gathered to discuss a separate national-security issue. Toward the end of the discussion, Trump asked for an update on the McCarthy investigation. Christopher Miller, the acting secretary of defense (Trump had fired his predecessor, Mark Esper, three weeks earlier, writing in a tweet, \"Mark Esper has been terminated\"), was in attendance, along with Miller's chief of staff, Kash Patel . At a certain point, according to two people present at the meeting, Trump asked, \"Did they bill us for the funeral? What did it cost?\"\n\nAccording to attendees, and to contemporaneous notes of the meeting taken by a participant, an aide answered: Yes, we received a bill; the funeral cost $60,000.\n\nTrump became angry. \"It doesn't cost 60,000 bucks to bury a fucking Mexican!\" He turned to his chief of staff, Mark Meadows, and issued an order: \"Don't pay it!\" Later that day, he was still agitated. \"Can you believe it?\" he said, according to a witness. \"Fucking people, trying to rip me off.\"\n\nKhawam, the family attorney, told me she sent the bill to the White House, but no money was ever received by the family from Trump. Some of the costs, Khawam said, were covered by the Army (which offered, she said, to allow Guillén to be buried at Arlington National Cemetery) and some were covered by donations. Ultimately, Guillén was buried in Houston.\n\nShortly after I emailed a series of questions to a Trump spokesperson, Alex Pfeiffer, I received an email from Khawam, who asked me to publish a statement from Mayra Guillén, Vanessa's sister. Pfeiffer then emailed me the same statement. \"I am beyond grateful for all the support President Donald Trump showed our family during a trying time,\" the statement reads. \"I witnessed firsthand how President Trump honors our nation's heroes' service. We are grateful for everything he has done and continues to do to support our troops.\"\n\nPfeiffer told me that he did not write that statement, and emailed me a series of denials. Regarding Trump's \"fucking Mexican\" comment, Pfeiffer wrote: \"President Donald Trump never said that. This is an outrageous lie from The Atlantic two weeks before the election.\" He provided statements from Patel and a spokesman for Meadows, who denied having heard Trump make the statement. Via Pfeiffer, Meadows's spokesman also denied that Trump had ordered Meadows not to pay for the funeral.\n\nThe statement from Patel that Pfeiffer sent me said: \"As someone who was present in the room with President Trump, he strongly urged that Spc. Vanessa Guillen's grieving family should not have to bear the cost of any funeral arrangements, even offering to personally pay himself in order to honor her life and sacrifice. In addition, President Trump was able to have the Department of Defense designate her death as occurring 'in the line of duty,' which gave her full military honors and provided her family access to benefits, services, and complete financial assistance.\"\n\nT he personal qualities displayed by Trump in his reaction to the cost of the Guillén funeral-contempt, rage, parsimony, racism-hardly surprised his inner circle. Trump has frequently voiced his disdain for those who serve in the military and for their devotion to duty, honor, and sacrifice. Former generals who have worked for Trump say that the sole military virtue he prizes is obedience. As his presidency drew to a close, and in the years since, he has become more and more interested in the advantages of dictatorship, and the absolute control over the military that he believes it would deliver. \"I need the kind of generals that Hitler had,\" Trump said in a private conversation in the White House, according to two people who heard him say this. \"People who were totally loyal to him, that follow orders.\" (\"This is absolutely false,\" Pfeiffer wrote in an email. \"President Trump never said this.\")\n\nA desire to force U.S. military leaders to be obedient to him and not the Constitution is one of the constant themes of Trump's military-related discourse. Former officials have also cited other recurring themes: his denigration of military service, his ignorance of the provisions of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, his admiration for brutality and anti-democratic norms of behavior, and his contempt for wounded veterans and for soldiers who fell in battle.\n\nRetired General Barry McCaffrey, a decorated Vietnam veteran, told me that Trump does not comprehend such traditional military virtues as honor and self-sacrifice. \"The military is a foreign country to him. He doesn't understand the customs or codes,\" McCaffrey said. \"It doesn't penetrate. It starts with the fact that he thinks it's foolish to do anything that doesn't directly benefit himself.\"\n\nI've been interested in Trump's understanding of military affairs for nearly a decade. At first, it was cognitive dissonance that drew me to the subject-according to my previous understanding of American political physics, Trump's disparagement of the military, and in particular his obsessive criticism of the war record of the late Senator John McCain, should have profoundly alienated Republican voters, if not Americans generally. And in part my interest grew from the absolute novelty of Trump's thinking. This country had never seen, to the best of my knowledge, a national political figure who insulted veterans, wounded warriors, and the fallen with metronomic regularity.\n\nToday-two weeks before an election that could see Trump return to the White House-I'm most interested in his evident desire to wield military power, and power over the military, in the manner of Hitler and other dictators.\n\nTrump's singularly corrosive approach to military tradition was in evidence as recently as August, when he described the Medal of Honor, the nation's top award for heroism and selflessness in combat, as inferior to the Medal of Freedom, which is awarded to civilians for career achievement. During a campaign speech, he described Medal of Honor recipients as \"either in very bad shape because they've been hit so many times by bullets or they're dead,\" prompting the Veterans of Foreign Wars to issue a condemnation: \"These asinine comments not only diminish the significance of our nation's highest award for valor, but also crassly characterizes the sacrifices of those who have risked their lives above and beyond the call of duty.\" Later in August, Trump caused controversy by violating federal regulations prohibiting the politicization of military cemeteries, after a campaign visit to Arlington in which he gave a smiling thumbs-up while standing behind gravestones of fallen American soldiers.\n\nHis Medal of Honor comments are of a piece with his expressed desire to receive a Purple Heart without being wounded. He has also equated business success to battlefield heroism. In the summer of 2016, Khizr Khan, the father of a 27-year-old Army captain who had been killed in Iraq, told the Democratic National Convention that Trump has \"sacrificed nothing.\" In response, Trump disparaged the Khan family and said, \"I think I've made a lot of sacrifices. I work very, very hard. I've created thousands and thousands of jobs, tens of thousands of jobs, built great structures.\"\n\nOne former Trump-administration Cabinet secretary told me of a conversation he'd had with Trump during his time in office about the Vietnam War. Trump famously escaped the draft by claiming that his feet were afflicted with bone spurs. (\"I had a doctor that gave me a letter-a very strong letter on the heels,\" Trump told The New York Times in 2016.) Once, when the subject of aging Vietnam veterans came up in conversation, Trump offered this observation to the Cabinet official: \"Vietnam would have been a waste of time for me. Only suckers went to Vietnam.\"\n\nIn 1997, Trump told the radio host Howard Stern that avoiding sexually transmitted diseases was \"my personal Vietnam. I feel like a great and very brave soldier.\" This was not the only time Trump has compared his sexual exploits and political challenges to military service. Last year, at a speech before a group of New York Republicans, while discussing the fallout from the release of the Access Hollywood tape, he said, \"I went onto that (debate) stage just a few days later and a general, who's a fantastic general, actually said to me, 'Sir, I've been on the battlefield. Men have gone down on my left and on my right. I stood on hills where soldiers were killed. But I believe the bravest thing I've ever seen was the night you went onto that stage with Hillary Clinton after what happened.'\" I asked Trump-campaign officials to provide the name of the general who allegedly said this. Pfeiffer, the campaign spokesman, said, \"This is a true story and there is no good reason to give the name of an honorable man to The Atlantic so you can smear him.\"\n\nIn their book, The Divider: Trump in the White House , Peter Baker and Susan Glasser reported that Trump asked John Kelly, his chief of staff at the time, \"Why can't you be like the German generals?\" Trump, at various points, had grown frustrated with military officials he deemed disloyal and disobedient. (Throughout the course of his presidency, Trump referred to flag officers as \"my generals.\") According to Baker and Glasser, Kelly explained to Trump that German generals \"tried to kill Hitler three times and almost pulled it off.\" This correction did not move Trump to reconsider his view: \"No, no, no, they were totally loyal to him,\" the president responded.\n\nThis week, I asked Kelly about their exchange. He told me that when Trump raised the subject of \"German generals,\" Kelly responded by asking, \"'Do you mean Bismarck's generals?'\" He went on: \"I mean, I knew he didn't know who Bismarck was, or about the Franco-Prussian War. I said, 'Do you mean the kaiser's generals? Surely you can't mean Hitler's generals? And he said, 'Yeah, yeah, Hitler's generals.' I explained to him that Rommel had to commit suicide after taking part in a plot against Hitler.\" Kelly told me Trump was not acquainted with Rommel.\n\nFrom the November 2023 issue: The patriot\n\nBaker and Glasser also reported that Mark Milley, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, feared that Trump's \"'Hitler-like' embrace of the big lie about the election would prompt the president to seek out a 'Reichstag moment.'\"\n\nKelly-a retired Marine general who, as a young man, had volunteered to serve in Vietnam despite actually suffering from bone spurs-said in an interview for the CNN reporter Jim Sciutto's book, The Return of Great Powers , that Trump praised aspects of Hitler's leadership. \"He said, 'Well, but Hitler did some good things,'\" Kelly recalled. \"I said, 'Well, what?' And he said, 'Well, (Hitler) rebuilt the economy.' But what did he do with that rebuilt economy? He turned it against his own people and against the world.\" Kelly admonished Trump: \"I said, 'Sir, you can never say anything good about the guy. Nothing.'\"\n\nThis wasn't the only time Kelly felt compelled to instruct Trump on military history. In 2018, Trump asked Kelly to explain who \"the good guys\" were in World War I. Kelly responded by explaining a simple rule: Presidents should, as a matter of politics and policy, remember that the \"good guys\" in any given conflict are the countries allied with the United States. Despite Trump's lack of historical knowledge, he has been on record as saying that he knew more than his generals about warfare. He told 60 Minutes in 2018 that he knew more about NATO than James Mattis, his secretary of defense at the time, a retired four-star Marine general who had served as a NATO official. Trump also said, on a separate occasion, that it was he, not Mattis, who had \"captured\" the Islamic State.\n\nAs president, Trump evinced extreme sensitivity to criticism from retired flag officers; at one point, he proposed calling back to active duty Admiral William McRaven and General Stanley McChrystal, two highly regarded Special Operations leaders who had become critical of Trump, so that they could be court-martialed. Esper, who was the defense secretary at the time, wrote in his memoir that he and Milley talked Trump out of the plan. (Asked about criticism from McRaven , who oversaw the raid that killed Osama bin Laden, Trump responded by calling him a \"Hillary Clinton backer and an Obama backer\" and said, \"Wouldn't it have been nice if we got Osama bin Laden a lot sooner than that?\")\n\nTrump has responded incredulously when told that American military personnel swear an oath to the Constitution, not to the president. According to the New York Times reporter Michael S. Schmidt's recent book, Donald Trump v. the United States , Trump asked Kelly, \"Do you really believe you're not loyal to me?\" Kelly answered, \"I'm certainly part of the administration, but my ultimate loyalty is to the rule of law.\" Trump also publicly floated the idea of \"termination of all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution,\" as part of the effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election and keep himself in power.\n\nOn separate occasions in 2020, Trump held private conversations in the White House with national-security officials about the George Floyd protests. \"The Chinese generals would know what to do,\" he said, according to former officials who described the conversations to me, referring to the leaders of the People's Liberation Army, which carried out the Tiananmen Square massacre in 1989. (Pfeiffer denied that Trump said this.) Trump's desire to deploy U.S. troops against American citizens is well documented. During the nerve-racking period of social unrest following Floyd's death, Trump asked Milley and Esper, a West Point graduate and former infantry officer, if the Army could shoot protesters. \"Trump seemed unable to think straight and calmly,\" Esper wrote in his memoir. \"The protests and violence had him so enraged that he was willing to send in active-duty forces to put down the protesters. Worse yet, he suggested we shoot them. I wondered about his sense of history, of propriety, and of his oath to the Constitution.\" Esper told National Public Radio in 2022, \"We reached that point in the conversation where he looked frankly at General Milley, and said, 'Can't you just shoot them, just shoot them in the legs or something?'\" When defense officials argued against Trump's desire, the president screamed, according to witnesses, \"You are all fucking losers!\"\n\nTrump has often expressed his esteem for the type of power wielded by such autocrats as the Chinese leader Xi Jinping; his admiration, even jealousy, of Vladimir Putin is well known. In recent days, he has signaled that, should he win reelection in November, he would like to govern in the manner of these dictators-he has said explicitly that he would like to be a dictator for a day on his first day back in the White House-and he has threatened to, among other things, unleash the military on \"radical-left lunatics.\" (One of his four former national security advisers, John Bolton, wrote in his memoir, \"It is a close contest between Putin and Xi Jinping who would be happiest to see Trump back in office.\")\n\nMilitary leaders have condemned Trump for possessing autocratic tendencies. At his retirement ceremony last year, Milley said, \"We don't take an oath to a king, or a queen, or to a tyrant or dictator, and we don't take an oath to a wannabe dictator ... We take an oath to the Constitution, and we take an oath to the idea that is America, and we're willing to die to protect it.\" Over the past several years, Milley has privately told several interlocutors that he believed Trump to be a fascist. Many other leaders have also been shocked by Trump's desire for revenge against his domestic critics. At the height of the Floyd protests, Mattis wrote, \"When I joined the military, some 50 years ago, I swore an oath to support and defend the Constitution. Never did I dream that troops taking that same oath would be ordered under any circumstance to violate the Constitutional rights of their fellow citizens.\"\n\nTrump's frustration with American military leaders led him to disparage them regularly. In their book A Very Stable Genius , Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker, both of The Washington Post , reported that in 2017, during a meeting at the Pentagon, Trump screamed at a group of generals: \"I wouldn't go to war with you people. You're a bunch of dopes and babies.\" And in his book Rage , Bob Woodward reported that Trump complained that \"my fucking generals are a bunch of pussies. They care more about their alliances than they do about trade deals.\"\n\nTrump's disdain for American military officers is motivated in part by their willingness to accept low salaries. Once, after a White House briefing given by the then-chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Joseph Dunford, Trump said to aides, \"That guy is smart. Why did he join the military?\" (On another occasion, John Kelly asked Trump to guess Dunford's annual salary. The president's answer: $5 million. Dunford's actual salary was less than $200,000.)\n\nTrump has often expressed his love for the trappings of martial power, demanding of his aides that they stage the sort of armor-heavy parades foreign to American tradition. Civilian aides and generals alike pushed back. In one instance, Air Force General Paul Selva, who was then serving as vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the president that he had been partially raised in Portugal, which, he explained, \"was a dictatorship-and parades were about showing the people who had the guns. In America, we don't do that. It's not who we are.\"\n\nFor Republicans in 2012, it was John McCain who served as a model of \"who we are.\" But by 2015, the party had shifted. In July of that year, Trump, then one of several candidates for the Republican presidential nomination, made a statement that should have ended his campaign. At a forum for Christian conservatives in Iowa, Trump said of McCain, \"He's not a war hero. He is a war hero because he was captured. I like people who weren't captured.\"\n\nIt was an astonishing statement, and an introduction to the wider public of Trump's uniquely corrosive view of McCain, and of his aberrant understanding of the nature of American military heroism. This wasn't the first time Trump had insulted McCain's war record. As early as 1999, he was insulting McCain. In an interview with Dan Rather that year, Trump asked, \"Does being captured make you a hero? I don't know. I'm not sure.\" (A brief primer: McCain, who had flown 22 combat missions before being shot down over Hanoi, was tortured almost continuously by his Communist captors, and turned down repeated offers to be released early, insisting that prisoners be released in the order that they'd been captured. McCain suffered physically from his injuries until his death, in 2018.) McCain partisans believe, with justification, that Trump's loathing was prompted in part by McCain's ability to see through Trump. \"John didn't respect him, and Trump knew that,\" Mark Salter, McCain's longtime aide and co-author, told me. \"John McCain had a code. Trump only has grievances and impulses and appetites. In the deep recesses of his man-child soul, he knew that McCain and his achievements made him look like a mutt.\"\n\nTrump, those who have worked for him say, is unable to understand the military norm that one does not leave fellow soldiers behind on the battlefield. As president, Trump told senior advisers that he didn't understand why the U.S. government placed such value on finding soldiers missing in action. To him, they could be left behind, because they had performed poorly by getting captured.\n\nMy reporting during Trump's term in office led me to publish on this site, in September 2020, an article about Trump's attitudes toward McCain and other veterans, and his views about the ideal of national service itself. The story was based on interviews with multiple sources who had firsthand exposure to Trump and his views. In that piece, I detailed numerous instances of Trump insulting soldiers, flag officers and veterans alike. I wrote extensively about Trump's reaction to McCain's death in August 2018: The president told aides, \"We're not going to support that loser's funeral,\" and he was infuriated when he saw flags at the White House lowered to half-mast. \"What the fuck are we doing that for? Guy was a fucking loser,\" he said angrily. Only when Kelly told Trump that he would get \"killed in the press\" for showing such disrespect did the president relent. In the article, I also reported that Trump had disparaged President George H. W. Bush, a World War II naval aviator, for getting shot down by the Japanese. Two witnesses told me that Trump said, \"I don't get it. Getting shot down makes you a loser.\" (Bush ultimately evaded capture, but eight other fliers were caught and executed by the Japanese).\n\nThe next year, White House officials demanded that the Navy keep the U.S.S. John S. McCain, which was named for McCain's father and grandfather-both esteemed admirals-out of Trump's sight during a visit to Japan. The Navy did not comply.\n\nTrump's preoccupation with McCain has not abated. In January, Trump condemned McCain-six years after his death-for having supported President Barack Obama's health-care plan. \"We're going to fight for much better health care than Obamacare,\" Trump told an Iowa crowd. \"Obamacare is a catastrophe. Nobody talks about it. You know, without John McCain, we would have had it done. John McCain for some reason couldn't get his arm up that day. Remember?\" This was, it appears, a malicious reference to McCain's wartime injuries-including injuries suffered during torture-which limited his upper-body mobility.\n\nJeffrey Goldberg: Trump: Americans who died in war are 'losers' and 'suckers'\n\nI've also previously reported on Trump's 2017 Memorial Day visit to Arlington National Cemetery. Kelly, who was then the secretary of homeland security, accompanied him. The two men visited Section 60, the 14-acre section that is the burial ground for those killed in America's most recent wars (and the site of Trump's Arlington controversy earlier this year). Kelly's son Robert, a Marine officer killed in 2010 in Afghanistan, is buried in Section 60. Trump, while standing by Robert Kelly's grave, turned to his father and said, \"I don't get it. What was in it for them?\" At first, Kelly believed that Trump was making a reference to the selflessness of America's all-volunteer force. But later he came to realize that Trump simply does not understand nontransactional life choices. I quoted one of Kelly's friends, a fellow retired four-star general, who said of Trump, \"He can't fathom the idea of doing something for someone other than himself. He just thinks that anyone who does anything when there's no direct personal gain to be had is a sucker.\" At moments when Kelly was feeling particularly frustrated by Trump, he would leave the White House and cross the Potomac to visit his son's grave, in part to remind himself about the nature of full-measure sacrifice.\n\nLast year Kelly told me , in reference to Mark Milley's 44 years in uniform, \"The president couldn't fathom people who served their nation honorably.\"\n\nThe specific incident I reported in the 2020 article that gained the most attention also provided the story with its headline- \"Trump: Americans Who Died in War Are 'Losers' and 'Suckers.'\" The story concerned a visit Trump made to France in 2018, during which the president called Americans buried in a World War I cemetery \"losers.\" He said, in the presence of aides, \"Why should I go to that cemetery? It's filled with losers.\" At another moment during this trip, he referred to the more than 1,800 Marines who had lost their lives at Belleau Wood as \"suckers\" for dying for their country.\n\nTrump had already been scheduled to visit one cemetery, and he did not understand why his team was scheduling a second cemetery visit, especially considering that the rain would be hard on his hair. \"Why two cemeteries?\" Trump asked. \"What the fuck?\" Kelly subsequently canceled the second visit, and attended a ceremony there himself with General Dunford and their wives.\n\nThe article sparked great controversy, and provoked an irate reaction from the Trump administration, and from Trump himself. In tweets, statements, and press conferences in the days, weeks, and years that followed, Trump labeled The Atlantic a \"second-rate magazine,\" a \"failing magazine,\" a \"terrible magazine,\" and a \"third-rate magazine that's not going to be in business much longer\"; he also referred to me as a \"con man,\" among other things. Trump has continued these attacks recently, calling me a \"horrible, radical-left lunatic named Goldberg\" at a rally this summer.\n\nIn the days after my original article was published, both the Associated Press and, notably, Fox News, confirmed the story, causing Trump to demand that Fox fire Jennifer Griffin, its experienced and well-regarded defense reporter. A statement issued by Alyssa Farah, a White House spokesperson, soon after publication read, \"This report is false. President Trump holds the military in the highest regard.\"\n\nShortly after the story appeared, Farah asked numerous White House officials if they had heard Trump refer to veterans and war dead as suckers or losers. She reported publicly that none of the officials she asked had heard him use these terms. Eventually, Farah came out in opposition to Trump. She wrote on X last year that she'd asked the president if my story was true. \"Trump told me it was false. That was a lie.\"\n\nWhen I spoke to Farah, who is now known as Alyssa Farah Griffin, this week, she said, \"I understood that people were skeptical about the 'suckers and losers' story, and I was in the White House pushing back against it. But he said this to John Kelly's face, and I fundamentally, absolutely believe that John Kelly is an honorable man who served our country and who loves and respects our troops. I've heard Donald Trump speak in a dehumanizing way about so many groups. After working for him in 2020 and hearing his continuous attacks on service members since that time, including my former boss General Mark Milley, I firmly and unequivocally believe General Kelly's account.\"\n\n(Pfeiffer, the Trump spokesperson, said, in response, \"Alyssa is a scorned former employee now lying in her pursuit to chase liberal adulation. President Trump would never insult our nation's heroes.\")\n\nLast year, I published a story in this magazine about Milley that coincided with the end of his four-year term. In it, I detailed his tumultuous relationship with Trump. Milley had resisted Trump's autocratic urges, and also argued against his many thoughtless and impetuous national-security impulses. Shortly after that story appeared, Trump publicly suggested that Milley be executed for treason. This astonishing statement caused John Kelly to speak publicly about Trump and his relationship to the military. Kelly, who had previously called Trump \"the most flawed person I have ever met in my life,\" told CNN's Jake Tapper that Trump had referred to American prisoners of war as \"suckers\" and described as \"losers\" soldiers who died while fighting for their country.\n\n\"What can I add that has not already been said?\" Kelly asked. \"A person that thinks those who defend their country in uniform, or are shot down or seriously wounded in combat, or spend years being tortured as POWs, are all 'suckers' because 'there is nothing in it for them.' A person that did not want to be seen in the presence of military amputees because 'it doesn't look good for me.' A person who demonstrated open contempt for a Gold Star family-for all Gold Star families-on TV during the 2016 campaign, and rants that our most precious heroes who gave their lives in America's defense are 'losers' and wouldn't visit their graves in France.\"\n\nWhen we spoke this week, Kelly told me, \"President Trump used the terms suckers and losers to describe soldiers who gave their lives in the defense of our country. There are many, many people who have heard him say these things. The visit to France wasn't the first time he said this.\"\n\nKelly and others have taken special note of the revulsion Trump feels in the presence of wounded veterans. After Trump attended a Bastille Day parade in France, he told Kelly and others that he would like to stage his own parade in Washington, but without the presence of wounded veterans. \"I don't want them,\" Trump said. \"It doesn't look good for me.\"\n\nMilley also witnessed Trump's disdain for the wounded. Milley had chosen a severely wounded Army captain, Luis Avila, to sing \"God Bless America\" at his installation ceremony in 2019. Avila, who had completed five combat tours, had lost a leg in an improvised-explosive-device attack in Afghanistan, and had suffered two heart attacks, two strokes, and brain damage as a result of his injuries. Avila is considered a hero up and down the ranks of the Army.\n\nIt had rained earlier on the day of the ceremony, and the ground was soft; at one point Avila's wheelchair almost toppled over. Milley's wife, Holly­anne, ran to help Avila, as did then-Vice President Mike Pence. After Avila's performance, Trump walked over to congratulate him, but then said to Milley, within earshot of several witnesses, \"Why do you bring people like that here? No one wants to see that, the wounded.\" Never let Avila appear in public again, Trump told Milley.\n\nAn equally serious challenge to Milley's sense of duty came in the form of Trump's ignorance of the rules of war. In November 2019, Trump intervened in three different brutality cases then being adjudicated by the military. In the most infamous case, the Navy SEAL Eddie Gallagher had been found guilty of posing with the corpse of an ISIS member. Though Gallagher was found not guilty of murder, witnesses testified that he'd stabbed the prisoner in the neck with a hunting knife. In a highly unusual move, Trump reversed the Navy's decision to demote him. A junior Army officer named Clint Lorance was also the recipient of Trump's sympathy. Trump pardoned Lorance, who had been convicted of ordering the shooting of three unarmed Afghans, two of whom died. And in a third case, a Green Beret named Mathew Golsteyn was accused of killing an unarmed Afghan he thought was a Taliban bomb maker. \"I stuck up for three great warriors against the deep state,\" Trump said at a Florida rally.\n\nIn the Gallagher case, Trump intervened to allow Gallagher to keep his Trident insignia, one of the most coveted insignia in the entire U.S. military. The Navy's leadership found this intervention particularly offensive because tradition held that only a commanding officer or a group of SEALs on a Trident Review Board were supposed to decide who merited being a SEAL. Milley tried to convince Trump that his intrusion was hurting Navy morale. They were flying from Washington to Dover Air Force Base, in Delaware, to attend a \"dignified transfer,\" a repatriation ceremony for fallen service members, when Milley tried to explain to Trump the damage that his interventions were doing.\n\nIn my story, I reported that Milley said, \"Mr. President, you have to understand that the SEALs are a tribe within a larger tribe, the Navy. And it's up to them to figure out what to do with Gallagher. You don't want to intervene. This is up to the tribe. They have their own rules that they follow.\"\n\nTrump called Gallagher a hero and said he didn't understand why he was being punished.\n\n\"Because he slit the throat of a wounded prisoner,\" Milley said.\n\n\"The guy was going to die anyway,\" Trump said.\n\nMilley answered, \"Mr. President, we have military ethics and laws about what happens in battle. We can't do that kind of thing. It's a war crime.\" Trump said he didn't understand \"the big deal.\" He went on, \"You guys\"-meaning combat soldiers-\"are all just killers. What's the difference?\"\n\nMilley then summoned one of his aides, a combat-veteran SEAL officer, to the president's Air Force One office. Milley took hold of the Trident pin on the SEAL's chest and asked him to describe its importance. The aide explained to Trump that, by tradition, only SEALs can decide, based on assessments of competence and character, whether one of their own should lose his pin. But the president's mind was not changed. Gallagher kept his pin.\n\nOne day, in the first year of Trump's presidency, I had lunch with Jared Kushner, Trump's son-in-law, in his White House office. I turned the discussion, as soon as I could, to the subject of his father-in-law's character. I mentioned one of Trump's recent outbursts and told Kushner that, in my opinion, the president's behavior was damaging to the country. I cited, as I tend to do, what is in my view Trump's original sin: his mockery of John McCain's heroism.\n\nThis is where our conversation got strange, and noteworthy. Kushner answered in a way that made it seem as though he agreed with me. \"No one can go as low as the president,\" he said. \"You shouldn't even try.\"\n\nI found this baffling for a moment. But then I understood: Kushner wasn't insulting his father-in-law. He was paying him a compliment. In Trump's mind, traditional values-values including those embraced by the armed forces of the United States having to do with honor, self-sacrifice, and integrity-have no merit, no relevance, and no meaning."

      "text": "Trump Celebrates After Supreme Court Hands Him a Victory in Deportation Case\n\nReporter\n\nPresident Donald Trump took a victory lap Monday after the Supreme Court ruled that his hotly disputed deportations of Venezuelans could resume for now-but with a major caveat.\n\nJustices ruled in a 5-4 split that the deportation of Venezuelan nationals under a rarely invoked wartime authority could continue, but the Supreme Court also agreed unanimously that migrants must be given due process before their removal.\n\nThe justices did not address the constitutionality of Trump's invocation of the 1798 Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans accused by the government of ties to the gang Tren de Aragua. Instead, they said the migrants' counsels should have filed their lawsuit in Texas, where they are detained, rather than in Washington, D.C.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The detainees subject to removal orders under the AEA are entitled to notice and an opportunity to challenge their removal,\" the court said. \"The only question is which court will resolve that challenge. We hold that venue lies in the district of confinement.\"\n\nStill, the president saw the ruling as a victory. \"The Supreme Court has upheld the Rule of Law in our Nation by allowing a President, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself,\" Trump said in a Truth Social post. \"A GREAT DAY FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA!\"\n\nChief Justice John Roberts and Justices Samuel Alito, Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Clarence Thomas voted to lift a federal judge's order temporarily blocking deportation flights. Justice Amy Coney Barrett joined liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Ketanji Brown Jackson in dissenting.\n\nIn her dissenting opinion that blasted the majority's \"fly-by-night approach\" and \"rushed conclusion,\" Jackson said the temporary restraining order would have prevented \"immediate harm to the targeted individuals while the court considered the lawfulness of the government's conduct.\"\n\n\"The President of the United States has invoked a centuries-old wartime statute to whisk people away to a notoriously brutal, foreign-run prison,\" she wrote. \"For lovers of liberty, this should be quite concerning. Surely, the question of whether such government action is consistent with our Constitution and laws warrants considerable thought and attention from the judiciary.\"\n\nThe Supreme Court's ruling came with a caveat: that detainees must be notified about their removal \"within a reasonable time\" and in a manner that will allow them to \"actually seek\" relief in the proper venue-something the White House has previously said \"hell no\" to.\n\nSotomayor warned that the deportation of \"even one individual\" without due process would put the government \"in direct contravention of an edict by the United States Supreme Court.\"\n\nStephen Miller, White House deputy chief of staff for policy, attacked Democrats last week for demanding due process for migrants.\n\n\"They have the temerity to say that every single invader that Joe Biden let in should get their own individual judicial trial before they're deported. One at a time. Each one,\" he told Fox News .\n\n\"It's a million-dollar trial in front of a communist judge to decide whether or not we can send them home,\" Miller said. \"How about hell no? How about we pick them up and get them out of this country so they can't hurt anyone else?\"\n\nTrump administration officials have chosen to focus on their win in the high-profile legal showdown.\n\nBREAKING: The Supreme Court sides with the Trump Administration on the Alien Enemies Act. Tonight's decision is a landmark victory for the rule of law.

      "text": "Elon Musk Pleaded With Trump to Stop Tariffs While Feuding With Trade Guru\n\nElon Musk tried but ultimately failed over the weekend to convince Donald Trump to pull back his tariff plans as he feuded with a key trade adviser.\n\nIn the most public break from the Trump administration since taking office, The Washington Post reported Monday, Musk openly disagreed with Trump's decision to slap tariffs on a host of countries as the \"first buddy\" and Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro , took shots at one another over the issue.\n\nThe tit-for-tat began on Saturday after Musk replied to a video of Navarro explaining the tariffs on CNN, criticizing the 75-year-old's background. Navarro then shaded the Tesla CEO, telling Fox News , \"Elon, when he's in his DOGE lane, is great, but we understand what's going on here... Elon sells cars. He's simply protecting his own interests.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nNavarro made similar comments Monday on CNBC, while insisting that \"everything's good with Elon, I promise.\"\n\nMusk, whose car company has lost more than $100 billion in market cap in the last few days, has also publicly criticized tariffs by posting a clip of free trade economist Milton Friedman.\n\nMusk's brother also contributed to the conversation by criticizing Trump's move.\n\n\"Who would have thought that Trump was actually the most high tax American President in generations,\" Kimbal Musk wrote on X.\n\n\"Through his tariff strategy, Trump has implemented a structural, permanent tax on the American consumer,\" he continued. \"Even if he is successful in bringing jobs on shore through the tariff tax, prices will remain high and the tax on consumption will remain the form of higher prices because we are simply not as good at making all things.\"\n\nMusk himself seems to be on his way out of the administration, with Trump estimating a time frame of \"a few months.\" Like Navarro, Trump pointed to his businesses that also require his attention.\n\nAs for Navarro, all signs point to him being around for the foreseeable future. He did not respond to a request for comment from The Washington Post , but when the publication quizzed the Trump administration, it replied: \"The President has put together a remarkable team of highly talented and experienced individuals who bring different ideas to the table, knowing that President Trump is the ultimate decision maker.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not address the apparent rift, adding, \"When he makes a decision everyone rows in the same direction to execute. That's why this Administration has done more in two months than the previous Admin did in four years.\"\n\nwilliam.vaillancourt@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

Mayor Muriel Bowser estimated the parade plans are in their \"early stages,\" adding that either the Department of Homeland Security or White House reached out to the district's special events task force, reported Fox News .\n\nArlington County Board Chair Takis Karantonis told the City Paper that the White House had given the county a \"heads up\" about the parade on Friday, with only 10 weeks until the event. The White House told Fox that \"no military parade has been scheduled\" for Trump's birthday, but stopped short of saying outright there would not be one.\n\nHe said \"the parade's scope \" was \"unclear\" and that no firm details were disclosed.\n\nTrump said in his first term that he would like to see tanks as part of a parade on Pennsylvania Avenue . Bowser said she did not want to see military tanks on the streets of Washington unless it received millions in extra funding.\n\n\"Military tanks on our streets would not be good,\" Bowser said. \"If military tanks were used, they should be accompanied with many millions of dollars to repair the roads.\"\n\nOther unnamed officials told the paper that a big military parade will require a huge amount of coordination between the six branches of the armed forces, along with several federal agencies and regional officials.\n\nD.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser's office and the White House did not immediately respond to the Daily Beast's requests for comment.\n\nPresident Trump previously pushed for a grand military parade in 2018 during his first term in the White House but was stymied by estimates the event would cost $92 million, according to the Associated Press .\n\nThe event had been slated to include tanks, fighter jets, and historic military planes.\n\nThe plans emerged after Trump's 2017 visit to France where he witnessed the Paris Bastille Day celebrations which included displays of heavy military machinery. Trump said the U.S. is \"going to have to try and top\" the French display, according to the AP.\n\nWhen that parade failed to materialize, Trump pushed for tanks to be displayed in D.C. during Independence Day celebrations in 2019. The inclusion of military vehicles in the \"Salute to America\" pageant contributed to the event costing taxpayers over $13 million-double the cost of previous celebrations, according to Politico .\n\nNo tanks were included in the same event the following year.\n\nReporter\n\nBreaking News Reporter\n\nJosh.Fiallo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

We need more flights. We need more officers. We need more overtime,\" he said. \"Bottom line is: The more money we get, the more successful we will be.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nEver since coming into office, Trump has made clear that one of his top priorities was immigration, signing multiple executive orders related to immigration-including declaring a national emergency at the border and ending birthright citizenship.\n\nThough many of his orders have been legally challenged, the administration has continued its deportation efforts.\n\n\"We got a strong president, President Trump. He puts Americans first,\" said Homan.\n\nHe added: \"A lot of countries that weren't taking back their people are taking back their people because of President Trump.\"\n\nAnd if they refused to accept deportations, Homan said the administration had a \"second option\" of sending them to another nation that's \"willing to accept them.\"\n\nBut Homan might not see any substantial funding for a while.\n\nIn February, House Republicans brought to the floor a budget resolution using the reconciliation process, which is a tool that would allow them to bypass filibusters in the Senate.\n\nYet Republicans have been divided on whether or not they want a two-bill approach or Trump's preferred option: \"one, big beautiful bill.\"\n\n\"I support any approach that gives us the money we need to do this operation,\" Homan said. \"Is it taking too long? Yes, it's taking too long. I wish they would have passed it by now.\"\n\nThe two-bill approach would prioritize securing funding for border security and defense faster, with tax cuts being dealt with at a later time in separate legislation.\n\nHoman had been pushing for the Senate to approve border funding, seemingly siding with the two-bill approach, though he never explicitly backed either strategy.\n\n\"I'll leave it up to the Hill to do their job. I think the American people think President Trump [has] a mandate - this immigration issue is a number one issue,\" Homan said.\n\nThe one-bill approach was what Republicans ultimately went with, though the lengthy approval process is still underway.\n\nThe budget resolution still needs to be approved by both the House and the Senate, with any disputes between the two causing further delays.\n\nThe administration filed a request last week for contractors to submit proposals to provide $45 billion worth of new detention facilities and services, ranging from security guards to medical support, over the next two years.\n\nThis would increase ICE's budget by six times, adding to the money it would already receive from the current budget plan.\n\nKevin Landy, a former ICE official under President Barack Obama, said that this sudden request comes because \"the administration is very concerned that they don't have enough detention capacity to accomplish their immigration enforcement needs.\"\n\nLast year, Congress gave ICE funding to detain a daily average of 41,500 people, but they have already gone above capacity with around 47,900 people being detained as of March.\n\nTrump also slashed the Office of the Immigration Detention Ombudsman, which provided resources for detainees, in March. The White House's request now puts these services in private hands.\n\nHoman's haphazard approach to deportations has also angered many critics. One case in particular has landed the administration in hot water recently, with authorities admitting that they mistakenly deported a Maryland man with protected status to El Salvador.\n\nTrump administration officials have since refused to bring him back, with a federal judge calling the move \"wholly lawless.\"\n\nOn March 15, three planes of alleged gang members also landed in El Salvador, despite Judge James \"Jeb\" Boasberg ruling mid-flight that the planes had to turn around.\n\nAccording to Politico, Boasberg told government attorneys Thursday that if they \"really believed\" that \"everything you did that day was legal and would survive a court challenge, you wouldn't have operated the way you did.\"\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\nGot a tip?

I just hope this is over soon.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Thousands also took to the streets across Canada to protest Trump's repeated threats of making Canada the 51st U.S. state.

This is Mohamad Habehh from the American Muslims for Palestine.\n\nMOHAMAD HABEHH : I'm here today because for the past year and a half we have seen the utter destruction going on in Gaza, funded by American taxpayer dollars. We've seen it in the previous administration, and we see now that Donald Trump is continuing and making it worse for the people in Gaza. After a month of fasting in the month of Ramadan, we saw that the people in Gaza were suffering a famine, as well as seeing Israel break the ceasefire and begin massacring Palestinians throughout the month and on the day of Eid.

I'm with the ANSWER Coalition, and we're demanding the immediate end of the genocide in Gaza. The U.S. should stop all of its forms of complicity and facilitation of that genocide and do everything in its power to bring it to an end immediately. And we're also demanding the release of the students who have been taken off the streets, abducted and jailed simply for standing with the Palestinian people, and for all those who have been repressed because of the steps they have taken to stand up for the right of self-determination and liberation of Palestine to have all charges, all lawsuits or anything like that dropped, and allow people to speak up and speak out against this genocide.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And here in New York City, up to 100,000 people took to the streets in Manhattan, marching from Bryant Park to Madison Square Park. Democracy Now! was there. There were many issues discussed, among them, Rümeysa Öztürk, that Tufts student who was sent to Louisiana after being driven to Vermont, picked off the streets of Somerville, Massachusetts, by masked agents. A judge has ruled her case has to be sent back to Vermont. These were some of the voices.\n\nSARAH : My name is Sarah. I'm not with a group. I went to Tufts University, and that is where Rümeysa Öztürk was disappeared from. And she is owed due process and a chance to continue her education. And she was here legally, and it should never be considered illegal to write an op-ed. Whether you agree or disagree with what she said, it's her right. And I just want her to be free. And I want that for all the people who have been disappeared by the Trump administration.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Is the Tufts community active on Rümeysa's case?\n\nSARAH : Yes. So, I know the president sent out an email the other day. The university is standing with Rümeysa and her lawyers, and also many of my fellow alum have stood up, signed letters and taken action to free Rümeysa and get justice for her.\n\nCHRISTINE HARRINGTON : Christine Harrington, and I'm with lots of friends. And I'm a professor at NYU . And we're -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What do you teach?\n\nCHRISTINE HARRINGTON : I teach law and politics. So, I watched you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What do you think is happening to the universities?\n\nCHRISTINE HARRINGTON : There are - you know, some of them are caving. And the first ones are caving, not so good. Not so good at all. But that's why we're out here.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What do you think the universities should do?\n\nCHRISTINE HARRINGTON : Fight back. Make it clear this is unacceptable, it has never happened, and it will not happen. I mean, to mobilize together. But the caving we saw, starting with Columbia, and the spread, has just made some universities figure, \"Duck and cover. You know, we'll get through this.\" That's not what universities should be about.\n\nPROTESTERS : Hey hey, ho ho! Trump and Musk have got to go! Hey hey, ho ho! Trump and Musk have got to go!\n\nJANINE GEORGETTE : My name is Janine Georgette. I can't believe I still have to protest this [bleep], because I can't believe it. I mean, I've been out protesting since I was about 5, was the first time I remember holding a sign. That we are so under attack, our country is being torn down, I don't really know why. Like, I don't get what they get from tearing our country apart. But they are pulling it down. And so, I'm out here to try to keep it upright.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What does the other side say?\n\nJANINE GEORGETTE : \"Payback is a [bleep], and she votes.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Do you think a protest like this of tens of thousands of people can make a difference?\n\nJANINE GEORGETTE : You know, I saw it make a difference in the Vietnam War. When so many people get together like this, politicians notice. And so, yes, the protests around the Vietnam War stopped it. There's no doubt in my mind. And so, this kind of activism, they notice. They take note.\n\nBLANCA VALLE : I'm Blanca Valle. My sign says \"Stop the mass kidnappings with no due process, dictator wanna-be & felon Donald Trump.\" Yeah, yeah, I'm just very upset about him taking these people and sending them to El Salvador without any due process. Yeah, he says that it's because they are from Tren de Aragua, but he didn't prove this. He didn't give any of these people a chance, an opportunity to say whether they are from that gang or not. That, to me, is just BS. He's even defying the judge's orders even during appeal. That is just BS, and we can't stand for that.\n\nNIH SCIENTIST : I'm a probationary worker at the NIH , and I'm a staff scientist.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : All probationary workers weren't fired?\n\nNIH SCIENTIST : All probation - no, they weren't fired. But a good 40% or so were fired. So, I don't know the exact numbers.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what does your sign say?\n\nNIH SCIENTIST : We just need to fund science and stop the cuts and stop funding billionaires and stop going for their actual purposes, where we want to, you know, really reeducate the population. We need more funding in science. You know, new epidemics are going to start coming out, unless we actually start putting more investment in research and more investment in public health.\n\nRABBI BARAT ELLMAN : I'm Rabbi Barat Ellman. I'm out here because we're on the brink. We have to stand up against this encroaching authoritarianism and fascism. And I'm definitely scared for our democracy. And we have to be in the streets, not just this week, but every week.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : How do you feel about President Trump going after universities in the name of combating antisemitism?\n\nRABBI BARAT ELLMAN : I am so distressed and angry about that. His weaponization of antisemitism is going to make Jews - is going to be dangerous for Jews. But also, it's just a cynical use of this idea, which - from his Cabinet, which has so many people whose antisemitism is widely demonstrated, for him to then try to claim that he's on our behalf. And it's also so completely blatantly false. You know, someone protesting the war in Gaza is not endangering myself as a Jew. And frankly, I also think the whole portrayal of the safety issue on campuses for Jews has been widely, widely overrepresented, and failing to talk about, you know, the safety of Muslims and Palestinians on campus. So, I'm a rabbi, and I'm a very active Jewish - I'm very active as a Jew. And frankly, his weaponization of this, of antisemitism, I find grotesque and scary and wrong.\n\nISAAC : My name is Isaac. I made this sign to say 1825. It's because everything that we have made, 200 years of progress since 1864, is being taken away. They already went after women's rights. They already went after Latino rights. They ain't gonna stop until they come after everybody, until we get thrown back to 19th-century America again. Need I say more?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What's your name? What's your sign, and why are you here?\n\nSUSAN : My name is Susan. I'm here because this man is not fit to be president. A president doesn't tell people to digest bleach and die in parking lots instead of getting healthcare, instead of getting lunch, instead of defending our allies in Europe, defending democracy in the world.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What does your sign say?\n\nSUSAN : My sign says \"No more tariffs, no kings, and no third term.\" This is not how a president behaves.\n\nPROTESTERS : No more tariffs! No third time!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Voices from the \"Hands Off!\" protest in New York City. Estimates are up to 100,000 people marched on Saturday in the rain. Some of the million who marched around the globe.\n\nThis is Democracy Now! When we come back, we look at the impact of Trump's tariffs on heavily indebted countries in the Global South.

The move will be especially perilous for small, heavily indebted countries in the Global South who face punitive tariffs, including rates of 49% for Cambodia, 37% for Bangladesh and 48% for Laos. \"What is really striking is not the sheer stupidity of it ... but the wanton cruelty of it,\" says Jayati Ghosh, economics professor at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org. I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nGlobal stocks are continuing to fall, fears of recession of growing, after President Trump rejected calls to scale back his order to institute sweeping tariffs on most of the world. In Hong Kong, stocks fell today by 13% - biggest single-day drop since the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Taiwan's main stock index had its worst day since 1990. On Wall Street, $6.6 trillion was wiped out on Thursday and Friday. Trump is defending his tariff plan, telling reporters, quote, \"Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,\" unquote.\n\nBut there appears to be growing divisions within the Trump administration over the tariffs plan. Trump billionaire adviser Elon Musk - the world's richest man - says he wants to see the U.S. and Europe have zero tariffs. Musk has also publicly criticized Trump trade adviser Peter Navarro. Another billionaire Trump backer, Bill Ackman, was warning that Trump's tariffs could lead to an \"economic nuclear winter.\"\n\nFor more on the impact of these tariffs, especially on the poorest countries of the world, we're joined by Jayati Ghosh, economics professor at University of Massachusetts Amherst. She was previously an economics professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi, India, where she taught for 35 years. She's joining us now from Delhi, from India.\n\nProfessor, welcome back to Democracy Now! Can you lay out what is the effect of the tariffs, as you see them, on the poorest countries of the world?\n\nJAYATI GHOSH : Well, I think what's really striking about this whole tariff policy is not just the sheer stupidity of it, which I think you've already highlighted the impact that is taking place in the rich countries, but the fact - the wanton cruelty of it, because the formula that's used is bizarre. It has nothing to do with the actual kind of protection that these countries afford themselves. But many of them are really the poorest, most debt-stressed, most climate-impacted countries in the world. And to actually attack them in this completely unnecessary way is quite unbelievable.\n\nIn my own region, in South Asia, we have Sri Lanka - I've just come back from Sri Lanka - Bangladesh, Pakistan, which are facing very, very high tariff rates. They are all struggling with massive debt burden. They can barely generate enough foreign exchange to import the most essential items. They, on top of that, have to pay very, very heavy debt service, and they've not really managed significant restructuring. All of them are under IMF programs. And yet, you get then this completely unnecessary, wanton kind of attack on a little bit of foreign exchange that they're generating, because the U.S. is a major market for all of them.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, you have what some are calling Trump's \"shock and awe\" trade policy, the imposition of punitive tariffs on developing countries where you are, across Asia, like 49% on Cambodia, 37% on Bangladesh, 48% for Laos. What exactly does this mean on their end in these countries, and what it means for people in the United States when those tariffs are imposed?\n\nJAYATI GHOSH : Well, let's take Bangladesh, Laos, Cambodia, Sri Lanka. They are dominantly garment exports. Now, this is a sort of labor-intensive activity that typically developing countries take up at the early stage of their development. It's not going to shift to the U.S. And, in fact, the U.S. doesn't want those jobs. So the whole idea that you will somehow attack these countries for just a little bit of very labor-intensive export that they must generate, because they're all facing very severe crises of the other kinds that I mentioned, is really strange.\n\nNow, garments are not just a significant export and source of foreign exchange, but they are major employers, and particularly of women. So, what we're going to see now are significant layoffs. We've already seen people in Sri Lanka and companies in Bangladesh complaining that orders have stopped already, even before the tariffs actually come into effect, and that they're going to actually have to lay off hundreds of thousands of workers, in some cases possibly millions of workers. And what that will do to economies that are already reeling, under severe crises - in Bangladesh, you already have political upheaval. In Sri Lanka, you have a new government after significant political upheaval. What that will do to all of these countries is actually quite terrifying.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Why do you think President Trump is imposing these, given this isn't a situation where it hurts other countries but it really benefits the United States? I mean, he wasn't explaining this weekend. He was out golfing.\n\nJAYATI GHOSH : Well, I mean, it's because there is no explanation. We now know what the formula is. It's this completely ridiculous formula: the trade deficit that U.S. has with that country divided by the U.S. imports from that country divided by half. That's nothing, right? So the maximal you could possibly impose is 50%. Some countries have got close to that, 48, 49%, like Cambodia, like Vietnam, which is ridiculous, because these are tiny, tiny amounts. For the U.S., it's not even a drop in the ocean of their imports.\n\nBut because they have simply applied this across the board for all countries - somebody said that, basically, they obviously just asked ChatGPT or something to work this out, without thinking about the context or even what they want strategically from this. Because they just applied this across the board, all kinds of countries in Africa, in Latin America, in Asia are going to be suffering hugely. And that chaos is going to come even to countries that are not directly affected by very high tariffs. So, even countries that are facing, let's say, only 10% tariff, like Nepal, or other countries that have got away with slightly lower rates, 20%, 25% - still high, but lower - are still going to actually face the fallout of this, because there is likely to be a global recession.\n\nThere is already so much uncertainty that people are canceling orders, companies are reducing investment plans. We've seen what's happened to the stock market. We've seen what's happened to oil price. These are all indicators that there is likely to be a dramatic global slowdown and recession. Now, that affects everybody. That affects even countries that didn't get a major tariff hit. And so, all countries in the world, and particularly, as I mentioned, the poorest countries, who have a lot of difficulty generating dollars, are going to actually face a really major shock, which is completely man-made and unnecessary.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And can you talk about how this will impact workers, people around the world who work for U.S. companies?\n\nJAYATI GHOSH : Oh, absolutely. It's not just U.S. companies. It's the companies that U.S. companies - you know, there are these value chains. So, all of the major garment producers, for example, are multinationals who outsource to local companies. All of them are being hit. But it's not just that. It's going to affect the supply chains in electronics. It's going to affect the supply chains in a lot of the new machinery that is essential for, let's say, the cars that Elon Musk wants to build, and so on. So, in fact, this is also going to come back to bite the United States.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And the U.S. ultimately putting tariffs on China of over 50%, and then China retaliating with over 30% tariffs, in this last minute?\n\nJAYATI GHOSH : I think what's really significant about the Chinese response is not just the tariff response, but the fact that they have put export bans on some critical raw materials of which they are currently the only global producer. And that's going to affect all kinds of production, all of the new high-technology production that the U.S. wants to encourage. And where it feels that it wants to gain a technological advantage over China simply won't happen. Everything from EVs to solar panels to you name it, defense equipment, etc., all of this is going to be affected.\n\nSo, it's been a remarkably stupid strategic move by Trump.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In the last -\n\nJAYATI GHOSH : But I will -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Go ahead.\n\nJAYATI GHOSH : No, I just wanted to say that there's a silver lining in this for developing countries, which is that for too long, for maybe three decades, we've been told that the only way we can develop is through export-led growth. And that's really - it's been unfortunate, because we have never seen giving our own workers a fair deal as a good option. We've always seen wages as a cost, not as a source of our own domestic demand and market.\n\nIt's now time to actually change, to shift gears, to think about different trading arrangements, more regional arrangements, looking at other developing countries as markets, looking at our own population as markets, and thinking about the things we can do to create sustainable production, that's not ecologically damaging, that actually provides living wages and decent working conditions within our own countries.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We have to leave it there. Thank you so much, University of Massachusetts Amherst professor Jayati Ghosh, speaking to us from New Delhi. I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Wolff says the Trump administration's tariff strategy is borne out of an ahistorical \"notion of the United States as a victim\" despite the fact that \"we have been one of the greatest beneficiaries in the last 50 years of economic wealth, particularly for people at the top.\" In response to the growing economic fortunes of the rest of the world and the associated decline in U.S. hegemony, Trump and his allies are \"striking out at other people\" in desperation and denial of an end to U.S. imperial dominance. \"[It's] not going to work,\" says Wolff.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nGlobal stock markets are tumbling after President Trump unveiled the biggest hike in global tariffs in modern U.S. history, including a 10% blanket tariff on all imported goods from about 185 countries. In addition, many U.S. trading partners, including the European Union, China and Japan, will see even higher tariffs. China now faces a total 54% tariff. Trump announced the plan during a speech in the Rose Garden at the White House.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : My fellow Americans, this is Liberation Day - waiting for a long time. April 2nd, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed and the day that we began to make America wealthy again. We're going to make it wealthy, good and wealthy.\n\nFor decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike. American steelworkers, auto workers, farmers and skilled craftsmen - we have a lot of them here with us today - they really suffered gravely. They watched in anguish as foreign leaders have stolen our jobs, foreign cheaters have ransacked our factories, and foreign scavengers have torn apart our once-beautiful American dream.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The impact of Trump's tariffs are expected to be felt around the world. While Trump claims the tariffs will boost the U.S. economy, many economists fear it could lead to a recession or worse. Trump's trade war could also shift global alliances as countries seek new trading partners. China, Japan, South Korea have already announced plans to increase trading ties and coordinate their response to Trump's tariffs.\n\nWe begin today's show with Richard Wolff, professor of economics emeritus, University of Massachusetts Amherst, visiting professor in the Graduate Program in International Affairs at The New School. He's the founder of Democracy at Work and hosts a weekly national TV/radio program called Economic Update , the author of a number of books, including, most recently, Understanding Capitalism and The Sickness Is the System: When Capitalism Fails to Save Us from Pandemics or Itself .\n\nProfessor Wolff, it's great to have you with us again. Well, start off by responding to, and were you surprised, shocked, or did you guess that, well, about 185 countries were going to see increased tariffs?\n\nRICHARD WOLFF : On the one hand, we knew something like this was coming. On the other hand, the sweep and the scope of it does make you stop. Mr. Trump is right: It is a changing moment in American history and world history. But I think his representation of what's going on is completely fantastical and has only to do with the self-promotion that he has engaged in most of the time. It was never foreigners who did it to us, this notion of the United States as a victim. We have been one of the greatest beneficiaries in the last 50 years of economic wealth, particularly for people at the top, just like him. It has nothing to do with foreigners taking advantage of us. This attempt to make himself strong and powerful relative to others, to blame the foreigner, these are cheap shots that a real president wouldn't do.\n\nAnd there's the most important point. The American economy is in trouble. The American empire is in decline. We don't want to discuss it in this country. We engage in denial. And instead, we are striking out at other people - a sad way of handling a decline. The British Empire declined before. So did all the others. We are now at that point. We had a great 20th century. The 21st century is different. You have to face those problems. That's not being done. What's being done is to say we have difficulties, but they're all somebody else's fault, and we're going to solve it by punishing them.\n\nI would like to point out, as you suggest, quite rightly, Amy, that the rest of the world is not going to sit by. The United States does not have the power it had in the 20th century. It is not in the position it seems to imagine itself. When the secretary of the Treasury added to Mr. Trump's comments that he warned the rest of the world not to retaliate, that would imply that if they do, there would be escalation. Yes, he said, there will be escalation. Well, nothing will guarantee more escalation than if they do nothing, because then it's an invitation for Mr. Trump to keep doing it as each of these efforts doesn't work.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Given how dramatic this was yesterday, is it possible he was deciding this to the very last second, as they put this off? And explain exactly - you're a professor. You're a teacher. Most people don't even realize how tariffs work.\n\nRICHARD WOLFF : OK. A tariff is a tax. It's just a particular tax that got that name. It used to be called import duty. All it means is, when something comes into the United States that was produced outside and is brought in to be sold, it has to pay a tax, literally as it crosses our border into our country. It is paid by the American company that brings it in, which may pass it on to the consumer - usually what happens - and the tax goes to Uncle Sam. It goes to Washington. Mr. Trump loved to suggest that tariffs were paid by the others - a little bit like Mexico would pay for the wall. Never happened. It's not going to happen here, either. It's an American tax.\n\nAnd there's something remarkable that clues you in to how big a change this is, that the Republican Party, which has branded itself as the anti-tax party for a century, is now imposing the most massive tax imaginable. Why this big change? Because we have big, big problems, and this kind of slapping the rest of the world is an attempt to solve a little bit of them. But it is not going to work, because we don't have the power to do it anymore.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go to UAW President Shawn Fain, who supports Trump's new tariffs, saying last week, \"We applaud the Trump administration for stepping up to end the free trade disaster that has devastated working-class communities for decades.\" Fain spoke Sunday on CBS's Face the Nation .\n\nSHAWN FAIN : We've seen over 90,000 manufacturing facilities leave the United States. We've seen, in the Big Three alone in the last 20-plus years, 65 plants have closed. You know, and so, look, tariffs aren't the total solution. Tariffs are a tool in the toolbox to get these companies to do the right thing. And the intent behind it is to bring jobs back here and, you know, invest in the American workers. ... If they're going to bring jobs back here, you know, they need to be life-sustaining jobs, where people can make a good wage, a living wage, have adequate healthcare and have retirement security and not have to work seven days a week or multiple jobs just to scrape to get by paycheck to paycheck.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, while UAW President Shawn Fain praised Trump's tariffs, he also said he had great concerns about President Trump's move to eliminate contracts for 700,000 federal workers, the firing of workers at the National Institute of Health and other agencies.\n\nRICHARD WOLFF : I was a bit disappointed. I like Shawn Fain, and many of us do, but this was disappointing, to say, basically, \"I will support the president because he does something that might help my union,\" even though Shawn Fain knows, as most economists do, that if you put a tax on the goods coming in, they will go up in price, because we have to pay that tax now, and that will lead to domestic producers able to raise their prices because their competitors from abroad are stuck with this tax. So we expect a boost to inflation, which is going to hurt the working class of this country in a very serious way, especially if it builds on itself, which often happens when you do tariffs like this.\n\nAnd I want to remind everyone, including Shawn Fain, that the auto workers also represent workers in places that need export markets, that produce in America and sell abroad. When those countries retaliate, as they likely will, we will lose export markets, and that will mean fewer jobs. And no one - let me stress - no one now knows whether the jobs lost from this trade war will be greater or smaller than any jobs that are gained. It is a big risk being taken by Mr. Trump. And if it doesn't go well, it will be very bad for the American economy. It will produce the recession folks are worried about, because if the prices go up, people buy less, and that loses jobs.\n\nWhen you look at all of this, this is an incredibly risky effort to blame the world, punish the world, and then cross his fingers - which is what he's doing - hoping it comes out all right. Reminds me of the football metaphor: This is a Hail Mary pass. You throw it down the field. You hope it bounces into your team's hands. But that's all it is: a long shot. And it's a sign of how troubled the American economy now is.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : If you can put this in a bigger picture? Talk about the tax cuts and how they fit into the tariffs, the - what is it? - something like $4 trillion in tax cuts, and who benefits. And then talk about the other issues that President Trump keeps saying that they're not going to touch, even though what many call his co-president, Elon Musk, whether he steps back from being - you know, giving speeches or not, going after Social Security, issues like Medicaid.\n\nRICHARD WOLFF : Let me start with the tax issue. The biggest single thing that Trump did in his first presidency was the tax cut of December 2017. And when that tax cut was written into law, it had a sunset. It expires this year, 2025. If that expiration is allowed to happen, corporations and the rich, who were the big beneficiaries back then, will face a big tax [increase]. He doesn't want to do that, because that's his base, that's his donor support. He doesn't want to have those taxes go back up.\n\nWell, then, what is he going to have to do? If he keeps on spending and he doesn't let those taxes go back up, he's going to have to borrow trillions, as we have been doing. He doesn't want to be the president who keeps borrowing trillions, in part because the rest of the world is a major creditor of the United States, and they're not going to continue to do it the way they have. So he's in a jam. He has to do something.\n\nSo his hope is to savage the expenditures in this country. Look what he's doing. Mr. Musk stands there with a chainsaw to give us the clear implication, \"I'm going to solve the problem on the backs of the working class. I'm firing them all. I don't care what the rest of the working class suffers. I'm going to fire all these people, without notice, without a plan.\" Calling this efficient is a silly joke. An efficient process takes time, takes experts. You're not doing that. You're just wholesale firing. Calling that efficiency is an attempt to fool people, that shouldn't make any difference.\n\nMr. Trump is now in a jam. He can't get out of this without in some way solving the problem that has been built up. And there is no way other than the one he's doing, because it's the last gasp of how to take away from the mass of the people the ability to borrow. I mean, let's be honest. If you put a tariff, you make everything coming in from abroad more expensive. That means people will buy less of it. They'll shrink their standard of living. If American companies take advantage of the tariff, which they always do, by raising their prices, that will also hurt the working class. You are immiserating your workers in order to try to solve the problem you haven't solved before.\n\nBut here's the irony that may in the end come back to haunt us. Europe has been unable to unify under the umbrella of American alliances. The enmity of the United States is bringing Europe together better than the alliance was able to do. And as you pointed out, very important, China, Japan and South Korea, with long histories of animosity and tension, are getting together to cope with this. Wow! We are unifying the whole world.\n\nIf you want the big picture in my judgment, after World War II, George Kennan taught us about containment: \"We're going to contain the Soviet Union.\" The irony, which the philosopher Hegel would enjoy, we are becoming contained. We are isolating ourselves - the votes in the U.N. of the United States alone or the United States and Israel and two or three other countries, the isolation politically, the isolation now economically. We are the rogue nation for the rest of the world. We may not want it. We may not agree. But it doesn't really matter, if that's how they perceive us. And that's what's happening.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You talked about South Korea, Japan and China joining together. One of the biggest announcements of [tariffs] was against Taiwan. It's just a little more complicated for Taiwan to join that group.\n\nRICHARD WOLFF : And also, another one was Vietnam, which got a very heavy whack. I mean, is there no recognition of what the United States did to that country? Maybe you wouldn't want to crush them with this kind of a thing after it. As I'm saying, this is a change. This is a sign to the world that as the United States empire declines, this is a nasty place that's going to, you know, gesture and thrash around, doing damage everywhere, as it copes with its own decline.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Former Greek Finance Minister Yanis Varoufakis recently wrote a piece headlined \"Donald Trump's economic masterplan.\" He wrote, quote, \"This is what his critics do not understand. They mistakenly think that he thinks that his tariffs will reduce America's trade deficit on their own. He knows they will not. Their utility comes from their capacity to shock foreign central bankers into reducing domestic interest rates. Consequently, the euro, the yen and the renminbi will soften relative to the dollar. This will cancel out the price hikes of goods imported into the US, and leave the prices American consumers pay unaffected. The tariffed countries will be in effect paying for Trump's tariffs.\" Do you agree with that, Professor Wolff?\n\nRICHARD WOLFF : No, even though Yanis and I do a lot of work together, so normally I defer to him. He's wonderful in his analysis. I don't think this is correct. Is it a possible outcome? Yes.\n\nYou know, we're in a situation - let me put it this way. Tariffs are not new. They've been around for hundreds of years. If you teach a course in international economics, which I've done, you tell students, \"Here are a thousand books. Here are 5,000 articles. We know.\" And the answer is, when you impose a tariff, you don't know what the outcome is, because it depends on everything else going on - interest rates, exchange rates of currencies, rising or falling economies around the world. You can't know in advance. It's a very risky thing, which is why for the last 50 years we have had, administered by the U.S., something called free trade or neoliberal or globalization.\n\nAll of that is over now. The United States can't win anymore in that system, so it is reverting to economic nationalism. And that's a fundamental shift that throws the world. It was the accepted wisdom for 50 years, 50 - the last 50 years, not to do what Mr. Trump is doing now. If you want, you can think that everybody who thought that way for 50 years was wrong, and Mr. Trump, the genius, is correct, but that would be a long shot. Better bet: He's trying to save his own political life, and he's trying to cope, to his credit, with a declining economy without having to admit that that's the case.\n\nThis won't end well. It normally doesn't. And what we're going to see is the fighting against one another of the euro bloc, the Asian bloc, the American bloc, at a time when the United States is weaker than it has been economically and politically. Look at the debacle in the Ukraine, as well, the misunderstanding that the Russians could turn to the Chinese and the Indians to cope with the costs of that war in a way that hadn't been calculated and is turning out to shape the outcome. And it's not a question of which side you're on, but just watching how it lines up, that's the problem.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Thirty seconds, as you often talk about, are you seeing this as the beginning of the end of American empire?\n\nRICHARD WOLFF : Yes, I think we are already in 10 or 12 years of that decline. It can't - here's the single best statistic. If you add up the GDP , you know, the total output of goods and services in a year for a country, of the United States and its major allies, the G7, it's about 28% of global output. If you do the same thing for China and the BRICS , it's about 35%. They are already a bigger bloc of economic power than we are. Every country in the world thinking about building a railroad or expanding its health program, they used to send their people to Washington or London to get help. They still do. But when they're done, they send the same team to Beijing, New Delhi, São Paulo, and they often get a better deal. The world is changing. And the United States could cope. But as with alcoholism, you have to admit you have a problem, before you're in a position to solve it. We have a nation that does not yet want to face what this all adds up to.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Richard Wolff, professor emeritus of economics, University of Massachusetts Amherst, visiting professor at the Graduate Program in International Affairs at The New School here in New York, founder of Democracy at Work, hosts a weekly national TV/radio program called Economic Update .

Citing the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, the Trump administration deported more than 130 immigrants who have been accused, often with little to no evidence, of gang affiliation. The ACLU won a judicial order against the deportations, which the Trump administration ignored, allowing the flights to continue to El Salvador, where authoritarian leader Nayib Bukele received the deportees at a notorious supermax prison. We speak to Lee Gelernt, who argued to stop the flights on behalf of the ACLU , about Trump's attacks on established U.S. immigration law. We cover the second Trump's administration's attempts to incarcerate immigrants at the Guantánamo military prison and end birthright citizenship, as well as the ongoing effects of his previous administration's policies of family separation and countrywide travel bans.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nWe turn to look more at President Trump invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 for the first time since World War II. On Saturday, Trump used the order to deport 137 Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador, claiming they were all members of Tren de Aragua, a gang which Trump has labeled a terrorist organization.\n\nThe deportation flights came despite a temporary restraining order from U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who said, quote, \"Any plane containing these folks that is going to take off or is in the air needs to be returned to the United States. Those people need to be returned to the United States,\" he said.\n\nBut the Trump administration appeared to ignore the order and allowed the planes to continue to El Salvador. Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, a Trump ally, tweeted, \"Oopsie...  Too late.\" The comment was then retweeted by U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the White House communications director Steven Cheung.\n\nWhite House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, quote, \"A single judge in a single city cannot direct the movements of an aircraft ... full of foreign alien terrorists who were physically expelled from US soil,\" she said.\n\nWe're joined now by Lee Gelernt, deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project. On Saturday, he argued the motion that led to the temporary restraining order blocking the Trump administration from removing the immigrants from the U.S. using the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nCan you respond what the Trump administration said, that this judge doesn't have the right to stop these people from being deported?\n\nLEE GELERNT : Yeah, sure. Thanks for having me again.\n\nThis is a very, very dangerous statement. I think we're on very dangerous ground, generally. Federal courts have the right and the duty to police what the executive branch is doing, if they violate the law. And that's exactly what's happening here, is this is ultimately a separation-of-powers case, as you were talking about with the congressman before. Congress could not have been clearer. They're granting this authority to the president - I mean, it's over 200 years ago, but granting this authority to the president, only - only - if there's a foreign government or foreign nation involved. That's not what's going on here. So the president has overstepped the authority Congress has given him, so it's creating a classic separation-of-powers question. The federal courts have to be able to say, \"You have overstepped the law.\" So, federal courts can review whether the Alien Enemies Act is being used illegally, and they have to.\n\nIn terms of defying the court order and sending the planes anyway and not turning them around, you know, we're trying to get to the bottom of that. The government filed what they called a clarification notice yesterday, that left more questions than it answered. And so, we filed something at 2:15 in the morning last night asking the court to order the government to file sworn declarations stating whether they had defied the court's order by not turning around planes after the court issued the order. In both cases, the federal court is on solid, established ground to review what the administration is doing.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Didn't the same thing happen with the Brown assistant professor? She is from India. She had been in this country for years. And she was coming from - rather, she is from Lebanon. She was visiting family. And she was deported when a judge said no.\n\nLEE GELERNT : Yeah, so, I'm not involved in that case, so I don't know the specifics, but I know that there are serious allegations there, and the judge is looking into it and is very concerned. So, you know, we hope that the administration is not outwardly, explicitly defying court orders and claiming they have the right to do that. That would put us on - you know, one step further to what many people would view as a constitutional crisis, just deciding they are not going to listen to the federal courts. So, you know, we will try and get to the bottom of what's going on in the Alien Enemies Act case. We'll see what the government files, what the court does, you know, and we'll leave it there for the moment. But all the indications look like they defied the court order.\n\nBut the bigger question, as you've noted, is: Can the Alien Enemies Act now be used? It's only been used three times in our country's history, all during declared wars: the War of 1812, World War I and World War II. And that's not surprising, because this is a very serious authority that Congress has given the president, but Congress limited it to when there's a declared war with another country or another country is invading us, not anytime the president decides some gang is so dangerous, I'm going to invoke a wartime authority. The minute we start using wartime authorities during peacetime, we're on a slippery slope to a very dangerous place.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Lee Gelernt, can you also talk about the ACLU's work fighting Trump's use of Guantánamo to hold immigrants? On Friday, you argued on behalf of foreign nationals the Trump administration is trying to send to Guantánamo. Now, it looks like they have cleared people from Guantánamo at this point. And I'd like to ask if you know why. And is El Salvador, this supermax prison that is run by the president, a Trump ally, where gross human rights violations have taken place - has this new prison in El Salvador become - has this prison in El Salvador become the new Guantánamo?\n\nLEE GELERNT : Yeah, well, thanks for asking about that, Amy. You know, as you mentioned, I argued the Alien Enemies Act case on Saturday. But the day before, I argued the Guantánamo case in a long, long hearing. And ultimately, the judge decided not to rule for us, only because Guantánamo had been cleared out at that point, and there was no imminent - at least imminent indication to him that people were being sent back to Guantánamo. It's very coincidental that every time we're going to go before a federal judge on Guantánamo, they clear it out. So I think that the litigation is having the effect of forcing them to back down in a way. And so, we'll see if they send people back there.\n\nBut your point about is El Salvador the new Guantánamo? It may be. And I hope not, because as bad as Guantánamo is, sending these Venezuelan men to a Salvadoran prison is really going to put them in immediate harm. I mean, we stressed that to the judge, and the judge, fortunately, understood that and acted quickly. And as many of you have probably seen, there was a video released of how the men were treated when they got to El Salvador. And I think that only reinforces that the judge was correct to act quickly.\n\nI think that there's probably going to be, if this - if this Alien Enemies Act invocation is upheld, anybody can be designated an alien enemy, because the government is making the dangerous argument that federal courts can't review, so any immigrant can then find themselves in a Salvadoran prison. You know, we will try to stop this, obviously, and we need those men to be brought back if the court order was defied.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And is the U.S. responsible if they are abused there in Salvador? I mean, this goes to Democratic and Republican presidents of the United States in charge of Guantánamo - right? - and the whole call for Guantánamo to be closed, is that it's used as an extrajudicial place where people can be sent, and it's not clear who's in charge of them. But that's the same with Salvador. Once they're put into this prison, who's responsible? Does the U.S. bear any more responsibility?\n\nLEE GELERNT : Well, I think the U.S. always bears responsibility if they illegally deport people and then they're ultimately put in danger and harm. You know, we'll see how the court reacts to this, if in fact they defied the court order. But I think the key for us, going forward, is that no one else is sent, and we also try and deal with the people who were sent, to get them back any way we can, especially if the court order was defied. But yeah, the United States is under strict obligations not to send anybody to be persecuted or tortured anywhere. It would have been bad enough if these people were sent to Venezuela, because they were fleeing danger there and have asylum claims, you know, most of them that we know, or at least our named plaintiffs. We obviously don't know all the people, because the government is doing it in secret. But absolutely, it's the government's obligation not to send people to persecution or torture. There's no question, in these Salvadoran prisons, these people are in imminent danger.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Lee Gelernt, before we end, I wanted to ask you about your arguing some of the most high-profile immigration cases during the first Trump administration, including one to stop Trump's Muslim travel ban that he instituted within weeks of coming first into office. Now the Trump administration is reportedly considering a new, broader travel ban. The New York Times is reporting the ban could impact the citizens of as many as 43 countries. Your response?\n\nLEE GELERNT : Yeah. So, you know, as everyone knows, the Supreme Court narrowly upheld the first Muslim ban. So, given that, given that there's Supreme Court precedent, we're going to have to wait to see what is actually issued by the president, and decide whether it complies with the Supreme Court's ruling or not, before we can decide what we're going to do. So we'll wait and see. But I think our first step is going to be assessing whether, under the Supreme Court's precedent, this is lawful or not.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And birthright citizenship going to the Supreme Court, what this means?\n\nLEE GELERNT : Right. We'll have to see how the Supreme Court acts. I mean, the pace - I think the difference between the first Trump administration and the second is the first Trump administration, the pace was very, very fast, but here is that much greater. And so, there's a lot going on. And I think that's part of what the administration is doing, is trying to wear down people, either scare them into not resisting or wear them down. We'll keep fighting on all these fronts. We've been preparing for a while for this, and we'll just keep plugging along. And I would urge people not to give up on the federal courts, but I also think that everything cannot be done through the courts. So, people, if they think what's happening is illegal, really need to get out there and say so.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And finally, the dismantling of the government and what it means for the cases you've been involved with for the last years, particularly around the separation of families and now seeing families being incarcerated again? But these children, how many are still left? And what does the dismantling of government agencies - how does that affect your work to try to still get these kids back to their families?\n\nLEE GELERNT : Yeah, so, we're monitoring that very closely. And I appreciate you raising that, because I don't think the public realizes there are hundreds, maybe up to a thousand, little children still not with their parents now six years later, maybe seven years later. You know, we got this injunction stopping the family separation policy in 2018, but we're still looking for many of the families, trying to get them back together.\n\nWe hope that the Trump administration takes very seriously that they're under a court-ordered settlement to reunify these families. Things have been moving slower, but we're not at the point now where we can say the administration is explicitly saying, \"We're not going to - we're not going to comply with this order.\" But we are monitoring it very closely, and we are very worried about finding the remaining families and getting them back together. You know, as anybody knows, any parent knows, and all the medical associations say, every day the child is not with the parent is causing harm.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Lee Gelernt, thanks so much for being with us, deputy director of the ACLU Immigrants' Rights Project.\n\nLEE GELERNT : Thank you.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Coming up, we look at why some Democrats are calling on Chuck Schumer to step down as the top Democrat in the Senate, after he voted with Republicans to help avert a government shutdown. Back in 30 seconds.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

He also responds to Trump's \"illegal\" invocation of the wartime Alien Enemies Act of 1798 and his attempt to deport foreign-born university students and faculty. Trump's sweeping efforts to make the United States hostile to immigrants \"creates danger for everybody,\" warns Raskin. Finally, Raskin responds to recent divisions within the Democratic Party over a GOP spending bill. He urges congressional Democrats to present a \"unified plan\" and \"common strategy\" for resisting a Republican supermajority loyal to Trump.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The United States is moving closer to a constitutional crisis as the Trump administration refuses multiple court orders while the president vows to take revenge on political enemies and escalates his attack on the press.\n\nOn Saturday, the U.S. deported 137 Venezuelan immigrants to El Salvador after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which was last used to justify the arrest and internment of 30,000 Japanese, German and Italian nationals during World War II.\n\nMeanwhile, Columbia student protest leader Mahmoud Khalil remains locked up in an ICE jail in Louisiana for taking part in student protests against Israel's war on Gaza. A second Columbia student protester has also been arrested.\n\nOn Friday, President Trump spoke at the Department of Justice and threatened to take revenge on his political enemies.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : Our predecessors turned this Department of Justice into the department of injustice. But I stand before you today to declare that those days are over, and they are never going to come back. They're never coming back. ... So, now as the chief law enforcement officer in our country, I will insist upon and demand full and complete accountability for the wrongs and abuses that have occurred.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In a moment, we'll be joined by Democratic Congressmember Jamie Raskin of Maryland, but first let's turn to a part of his response to Trump's speech. Raskin spoke outside the Department of Justice Friday.\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : In the 18th century, the American Revolution overthrew the kings, the lords and the feudal barons to establish a nation where we would have a nation where all would be equal under the law. As Tom Paine put it, in monarchies, the king is law, but in the democracies, the law is king. But, amazingly, we now have a president in the 21st century who believes he's a king, and he believes that the king is the law once again.\n\nThe first seven weeks of this radical experiment in neomonarchism has been a disaster for the rule of law and for the Constitution and for the First Amendment. There have been 120 federal cases filed against Donald Trump all over the country, and he has lost already in more than 40 courtrooms across the land, where temporary restraining orders and preliminary injunctions have been issued against his lawless attack on the Constitution.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Congressmember Jamie Raskin of Maryland speaking outside the DOJ on Friday, responding to Trump's speech. He's joining us now from Takoma Park, Maryland. Congressmember Raskin is the top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee and a former constitutional law professor.\n\nDuring Trump's first presidency, Raskin served as a floor manager and the Democrats' lead prosecutor for Trump's second impeachment after the January 6th Capitol insurrection. He was also a member of the House January 6 committee investigating the Capitol insurrection. In January, Biden gave preemptive pardons to Raskin and other members of the January 6th House committee. Earlier today, President Trump claimed the pardons are invalid because, he said, they were done by autopen.\n\nCongressmember Jamie Raskin, welcome back to Democracy Now! Why don't we start there, with President Trump saying all the pardons that he issued that were done by autopen are invalid? That would include you. Your response?\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : First of all, thank you for having me, Amy, and that was the first time I got to hear a clip from our press conference. What you couldn't hear there was the constant berating and heckling of MAGA counterprotesters who showed up. We were being drowned out by a guy with a bullhorn. I wanted to borrow his bullhorn, because we didn't have a sound system with us. But I appreciate your running that clip where we went and appeared opposite Donald Trump.\n\nSo, but I had not seen that Donald Trump is claiming that the pardon rendered by President Biden was somehow illegitimate because of the kind of pen that was used. This sounds like classic Donald Trump stuff. You know, the pardons, of course, were necessary because of Trump's promises to prosecute Bennie Thompson and Liz Cheney, less so the rest of us, but they had already made their moves against Liz Cheney. And I have no reason to think that those were not valid any more than the humiliating and atrocious pardons that Donald Trump gave to nearly 1,600 insurrectionists, including violent felons who viciously attacked our police officers on January 6th.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, if you can talk about this almost unprecedented speech? It is very rare for a president to go to the Department of Justice and give a speech like this. I think Clinton did around some anti-crime bill, which many would dispute was actually an anti-crime bill. Obama went to say goodbye to the attorney general. But to give an hour address naming names of targets, talking about the press as enemies of the people, if you can respond, overall, to what he said?\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : Well, it was a typical rambling and hate-filled diatribe by Donald Trump. No speech like that has ever taken place at the U.S. Department of Justice, which has existed since 1870, when it was set up to try to enforce the Reconstruction amendments to the Constitution against the Ku Klux Klan and against white supremacists and insurrectionists and secessionists.\n\nBut nobody has ever taken a sledgehammer to the traditional boundary between independent criminal law enforcement, on the one side, and presidential political will and power, on the other. But here Trump made it clear that he views these people as his lawyers. They are reporting to him, according to his corrupt unitary executive theory. And far from staying out of the business of deciding who will be prosecuted and who will be let go, he's going to superintend the whole machinery of the Department of Justice.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go to a clip from President Trump speaking at the Department of Justice.\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP : I believe that CNN and MSDNC , who literally write 97.6% bad about me, are political arms of the Democrat Party. And in my opinion, they're really corrupt, and they're illegal. What they do is illegal. ... These networks and these newspapers are really no different than a highly paid political operative. And it has to stop. It has to be illegal. It's influencing judges, and it's entered - it's really changing law, and it just cannot be legal. I don't believe it's legal.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that is President Trump speaking at the Justice Department. Of course, he has sued ABC . He has sued CBS . He has sued The Des Moines Register . Because he has the backing of the wealthiest person on Earth, Elon Musk, he could do endless lawsuits. And whether or not they win, that's not the point. But he could just wipe out one news institution after another, Congressmember Raskin.\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : Well, he's obviously frustrated because he's losing everywhere in court on everything from the birthright citizenship executive order, which is blatantly unconstitutional, to the spending freeze to the sacking of thousands of probationary employees. And so, he's frustrated, so he says it's got to be illegal for the media to be covering his defeats and to be trying to expose the various constitutional violations of his administration. Of course, it's completely lawful and protected by the First Amendment.\n\nAnd he's just operating out of the authoritarian playbook, which says that the first thing you do when you get in is you crack down on the free press. And he's been doing that in numerous ways. He's been ordering the FCC to go after ABC , CBS , NBC , anybody who displeases him in any way. But he's also been personally suing media entities. There was a shakedown of $15 million against ABC because he was unhappy with coverage there. And now he's got a $20 billion lawsuit against CBS , not even because of anything they said about him, but because he thought that the coverage of Kamala Harris was too positive.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : It was about, right, a 60 Minutes interview, which in all news media you do an hour an interview, and you play 10 minutes, so things like her sneezing were taken out. And he said that was used to affect the - try to use to affect the election.\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : Of course, Fox News operates completely as an ideological arm of the Republican Party and of the Trump cult, and there's nothing unconstitutional about that. You know, it's totally fine for a newspaper entity to be endorsing Harris or Trump or what have you. So, he's just absolutely confused on the point.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about the naming of names, everyone from, oh, Norm Eisen to the organization CREW , that sues over corruption in government, to the Democratic lawyer Marc Elias to the prosecutor Mark Pomerantz, Pomerantz who worked for Alvin Bragg. He named him, as well, the Manhattan DA. What it means for the president of the United States to name check these people and talk about going after them?\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : Well, Trump has embarked upon exceedingly unpopular policy moves, including, you know, an $888 billion cut to Medicaid, increasing the tax on Social Security, coming from Elon Musk, gutting federal departments and agencies promoting environmental protection, promoting health research, promoting anti-disease campaigns. And so, the only way to try to protect these maneuvers is to shut down a free press and disable the lawyers who are in court every day holding them to account.\n\nAnd understand, Amy, we are winning in court every single day against the lawlessness, most recently against this completely illegal move to deport people outside of the provisions of immigration law by invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798, which requires that America be at war or be in the midst of an invasion. And we are not being invaded, and the Congress of the United States, which I have the privilege of serving in, has not declared war on Venezuela.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, let's go into that, Trump invoking that 18th-century law in order to deport Venezuelan nationals from the United States. On Saturday, they flew, the Trump administration, more than 260 immigrants, including 130 people accused, but not convicted, of being a member of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which Trump has labeled a terrorist organization. The flights came despite a temporary restraining order from U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who ordered any of these deportation flights that were currently in the air to be turned around. One of them was still on the ground. The Washington Post reports the three flights bound for El Salvador arrived after the judge's order. It looks like Salvador, this maximum-security prison, which is ultimately run by the Trump ally Salvadoran President Nayib Bukele, guilty of mass human rights abuses - it looks like this judge is holding a hearing today about why they disregarded his ruling. Can you talk about the significance of this? The same thing happened with the Brown University professor, the kidney doctor, who was sent back despite the judge ruling she should be allowed to at least be - her case be heard, and she should not be deported.\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : James Boasberg is an excellent judge in the District of Columbia, federal judge. He's also very conservative. And this is a pattern we note now, that it goes across Democratic and Republican appointees. The same with a bunch of prosecutors who have resigned rather than participate in a corrupt scheme like the effort to absolve and exculpate Mayor Adams.\n\nBut Boasberg's order was completely flouted and violated by the Trump administration and by the president of El Salvador, who gloated and basically mocked the judicial order online, saying, \"Oopsie... Too late.\" And I think that was retweeted by - I think it was Elon Musk who retweeted it with some glee. But, look, you're messing with federal court judges who intervene in a situation like this only when they believe there is imminent harm to people being threatened and when they think that there is a probable likelihood of success on the merits of the case. And I think it was shown, to his satisfaction, that there was all kinds of imminent harm being threatened by these deportations outside of the immigration law system that we've got by invoking the Alien Enemies Act from 1798, which was last used during World War II to round up Japanese and Japanese American citizens in the internment.\n\nAnd so, I don't know. It will be very interesting to see what Judge Boasberg does at this point, because as the president of El Salvador, the corrupt and human rights-violating president of El Salvador, said, \"Oopsie... Too late,\" when it was very clear they had the order to bring those people back and let them go through the normal process. We have no idea who was part of the contingent being deported.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And Rubio, the secretary of state, retweeted the \"Oopsie.\" Now I want to ask you about Mahmoud Khalil. There have been mass protests across the country for this Palestinian graduate student who was here on a green card - his wife, eight months pregnant, she is a U.S. citizen - to be released. Can you talk about what's happened to him? He's now still in Louisiana ICE detention. What you're calling for?\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : Well, we're calling for respect for the rule of law and for the First Amendment and for due process, and nothing more than that. I would hope, I would assume that people who support the freedom of speech and due process would be saying this is a completely unacceptable situation.\n\nFirst of all, when he was picked up, they were saying that he had a student visa, which he did not. He's a permanent resident, a green card holder, who has all of the same First Amendment rights that a U.S. citizen has. And so, you can disagree with his speech; you can agree with his speech. But in any event, he was picked up for his speech, not given due process under our immigration law system, and then deported and taken out of state. And that's just an intolerable situation.\n\nAnd if it can be done to him, it can be done to every other permanent resident. And indeed, because he's never been charged with anything, there have never been criminal charges, and he's not being charged with anything now, it creates danger for everybody, both noncitizens and citizens alike. And, of course, that's the history of this, Amy. If you go back to the Alien and Sedition Acts from the 1790s, Thomas Jefferson was able to observe, along with other people who were the targets of the Alien and Sedition Acts, that the attack on immigrants very quickly becomes an attack on citizens, as the incumbent party thinks that they're absolutely invulnerable and they can jail people and prosecute people just for being in the political opposition.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, can you talk about some of the things you're calling for, calling on people to submit an open records request to DOGE for your own data, for people's own data, to see what they have on you, like Social Security, student loans, etc., the meaning of this? And your overall, as a constitutional lawyer - the role of the richest man on Earth, of Elon Musk, firing thousands of people, using his own social media platform X to do this? What role does he have in the U.S. government?\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : Well, we don't know exactly what role he has. That's an excellent question, because they're very slippery and elusive about this. Sometimes the president describes him as the head of DOGE , as the leader of DOGE . In court, they've said he's not involved in an administrative capacity with DOGE ; he's just an adviser to the president. So we'd like to know.\n\nWe did get this victory in court last week, where a federal judge determined that DOGE is a federal agency, and they cannot slime away from that reality. It is a federal agency. That means that they are subject to FOIA and to the Privacy Act.\n\nAnd I immediately sent in a request for all of the private records of mine, private data of mine, that DOGE has. And under FOIA and under the Privacy Act, we all have that right to find out what information they've got from Social Security, from the Department of Education, if there's college loans, if there's military service. Whatever it might be, all of that belongs to the people since the Privacy Act of 1974. So, I sent it in. I put it up online. I think more than 8,000 or 10,000 people have followed. And we're going to launch a campaign this week, because more than 300 million people have that right, and people need to understand that you've got a right to the data, not Elon Musk and DOGE . And we want to know what's happened to it. Has it gone to his artificial intelligence private business, to Grok? Has it been shared with other third parties? The people have a right to know that.\n\nAnd so, you know, my grandfather was in politics, and he told me when I was a little boy, he said that duck hunting is a lot of fun, until the ducks start shooting back. And I think people are going to insist that our rights be vindicated within American constitutional democracy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Finally, Congressmember Raskin, your comments on what Chuck Schumer, the ranking Democratic member in the U.S. Senate, did, both supporting what was going to be called - the Trump administration threatened to call it the \"Schumer shutdown,\" but, actually, not so much that as having said to the end he would not go along with it, then switching, and the rifts in the Democratic Party now?\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : Well, I took a very strong position against that continuing resolution, which was packed with more efforts to dismantle the American social safety net, attacks on Medicaid, attacks on healthcare. And it also provided - and this was very troubling to me - retroactive validation, at least implicitly, of all of the assaults on the federal agencies and on the federal workers. So there was no way I could go along with it. Schumer took an opposite position after different twists and turns in his journey.\n\nBut I've got to say, Amy, what troubled me the most resembled what troubled me the most about what happened to us when Donald Trump showed up for the joint session of Congress. It's that we did not have a unified plan across the House and the Senate within the Democratic Party to decide what to do. And I had said I would stick with any unified plan we had. We could boycott it. We could hold up signs. We could stage a walkout, whatever. But we needed to have a plan. We needed to call a play. And I think that's the real political sin here, that House and Senate Democrats are acting like we occupy different galaxies. We've got to get together and decide what our common front and what our common strategy is. I'm an old, washed-up football quarterback. It's like going out onto the field without any play at all.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, do you think Schumer should step down as the ranking Democrat of the Senate?\n\nREP . JAMIE RASKIN : You know, they're going to go through that. I think we're going through a period of tremendous upsurge and ferment and change in terms of political leadership across the board. And because we've been so separated, the Senate and the House Democrats, I really know very little about the internal dynamics that led to what took place there. So, I'll reserve judgment on that. But I will say this is a moment where new political leadership is popping up everywhere, and that's all to the good.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Congressmember Jamie Raskin of Maryland, top Democrat on the House Judiciary Committee, former constitutional law professor, thanks so much for joining us.\n\nComing up, we'll speak to the ACLU , which sued President Trump after he invoked the Alien Enemies Act of 1798 for the first time since World War II. Back in 30 seconds.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Folk musician Nora Brown with Stephanie Coleman singing \"The Unicorn\" last week at the Kennedy Center. In the middle of their performance, they unfurled banners saying \"Reinstate Queer Programming\" and \"Creativity at the Kennedy Center Must Not Be Suppressed\" in protest of Trump's takeover of the Kennedy Center. On Thursday night, Vice President JD Vance was booed.

Top officials in the administration have brushed aside fears of a recession and reiterated the tariff policy will be implemented as planned.\n\nHere are the key stories at a glance:\n\nExtreme volatility plagued global stock markets on Monday, with Wall Street swinging in and out of the red as Donald Trump defied stark warnings that his global trade assault will wreak widespread economic damage, comparing new US tariffs to medicine.\n\nA renewed sell-off began in Asia, before hitting European equities and reaching the US. It was briefly reversed amid hopes of a reprieve, only for Trump to threaten China with more steep tariffs , intensifying pressure on the market.\n\nRead the full story\n\nThe EU has said it offered the US a \"zero-for-zero\" tariff deal on cars and industrial goods weeks before Donald Trump launched his trade war , but that it would not wait to defend itself. Maros Šefčovič, the EU commissioner for trade, said he had proposed zero tariffs on cars and a range of industrial goods, such as pharmaceutical products, rubber and machinery on 19 February.\n\nHe said the EU and US were in early stages of talks while EU commission president Ursula von der Leyen said the offer remained on the table. However, later on Monday Trump appeared to quash any such discussions, telling reporters zero-zero tariffs were not on the cards.\n\nRead the full story\n\nDonald Trump may continue using a 1798 law to deport alleged gang members to Venezuela, the supreme court ruled on Monday, however it will apply certain limits.

      "text": "Americans braced for era of uncertainty as Trump doubles down on tariffs\n\nRecession fears are mounting, and anxiety is high - but the president remains unmoved by criticism of his trade plans\n\nS ince Donald Trump returned to the White House, Americans have grown used to high drama and rapid-fire headlines, as executive orders from the Oval Office have reshaped the US, from stripping back LGBTQ+ rights to gutting environmental regulations amid a sense that the US is slipping into authoritarianism.\n\nBut even against that backdrop, last week stood out, as Trump launched a fierce global trade war , imposed tariffs on its trading partners and triggered a global market meltdown , including on Trump's own cherished Wall Street , where hundreds of billions of dollars of stock values evaporated.\n\nNow, with all eyes nervously on Monday's markets amid fears that the calamitous drops will continue, recession fears are mounting in America. JP Morgan analysts last week boosted their odds on a global recession to 60% and Americans are bracing for a return of inflation - the thing that above all else likely doomed Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nBut Trump remained unmoved by market drops and the global political condemnation - and even rare criticism from his own Republican party - saying now is a \"great time to get rich\" and that \"China played it wrong - they panicked\".\n\nOn the streets of New York too, there was panic among some. In Washington Square Park, two sisters from Detroit were sitting on a park bench nearby the magnolia trees now in bloom. Kathleen, a primary school teacher, said she worried about whether there was a plan in place before changes are made.\n\n\"I want to be optimistic, but I live under an umbrella of worry with this administration,\" Kathleen said. \"I worry about the leadership, worry about a lack of continuity within the leadership, and so many changes at once without a plan.\"\n\nHer sister, Elizabeth, said she'd grown so anxious she'd stepped back from the news. \"Our mum definitely had a huge jump in anxiety over this past week over her investments. She worked hard for those and she lives on them - a retired schoolteacher, and the drop in stocks very much impacts her day-to-day feeling of security.\"\n\nBut Leo Ezekiel, 39, had a different perspective. As a financier, he wasn't so worried about the stock markets. \"It's mostly that big corporations are deciding to sell off, and that will affect people, but in the long run, if stocks go down, it gives room for them to move up. It's part of the game - and it's always been like that in the United States.\"\n\nTrump made his move because he dreams of a return of American manufacturing might, convinced that tariffs will force factories home to the US, even though almost all economists think that is highly unlikely.\n\nYet, for such a momentous decision which has rattled the entire world economy, Trump reportedly only made up his mind at the last minute. According to the Washington Post , Trump didn't arrive on an exact plan until just three hours before the Rose Garden announcement.\n\nThe \"liberation day\" announcement from the White House was a choreographed event, and his speech drew cheers from audience, largely made up cabinet members and blue-collar workers from manufacturing sectors that have for decades been economically pummeled by foreign competition. He offered up a vision that tariffs would bring back an older American economy, reopening factories and returning prosperity to ordinary workers.\n\n\"Taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years,\" Trump complained. \"But it is not going to happen any more.\"\n\nVice-President JD Vance said : \"We've seen closing factories, we've seen rising inflation. We've seen the cost of housing so high that most Americans can't afford to buy a home right now,\" Vance said. \"President Trump is taking this economy in a different direction.\"\n\nAmerica's largest trading partners, Mexico, Canada, China, Germany and Japan, were less enthusiastic, to say the least. China has announced retaliatory duties of 34%; the Canadian prime minister Mark Carney announced a limited set of counter-measures and called the US moves a \"tragedy\" for 80 years of \"free and open exchange of goods and services\", led by the US.\n\nThe British PM Keir Starmer said nothing would be \"off the table\" when it came to the UK's response to the tariffs - the UK imports $76.2bn in US services - but that \"just as with defence and security\" the world was \"entering a new era\" in economy and trade.\n\nIt is one where answers to even the most basic questions remain unknown. Will Trump's tariffs on US trade partners go down as an act of economic self-sabotage? Or are tariffs merely a negotiating ploy to influence other nations - war by other means? Or is Trump finally getting to express his long-held economic view that the US has been making bad deals for decades?\n\nSign up to Headlines US\n\nGet the most important US headlines and highlights emailed direct to you every morning\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nThe next few months may provide some clues. But, in an effort to get ahead of the US tariffs coming into effect next week, some effects were already being felt. The cost of flying goods into the US from China are reported to have risen 40% in four weeks. One car factory in Canada has already shuttered.\n\nOn Friday, Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, warned that Trump risked stoking even higher inflation and slower growth. \"It is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,\" he said. \"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.\"\n\nAs the financial markets continued to convulse on Friday, the Washington Post reported that Trump is unbowed by negative headlines, criticism from foreign leaders, and was determined to listen to a single voice to secure what he views as his political legacy. That voice was of course his own.\n\n\"He's at the peak of just not giving a fuck any more,\" a White House official with knowledge of Trump's thinking told the newspaper. \"Bad news stories? Doesn't give a fuck. He's going to do what he's going to do. He's going to do what he promised to do on the campaign trail.\"\n\nBut even some former Trump economic officials privately expressed doubts that returning the US to an era of manufacturing self-sufficiency was likely impossible.\n\nThe author Michael Wolff, who has published four books about Trump in power, says the US president will now be keenly gauging how his interruption into global trade norms is going down, with updates and live-action replays provided by aides. Trump, Wolff says, is likely caught between two opposing instincts.\n\n\"It's great for him - he's dominating the news once again. Nobody is talking about anything else except tariffs. Suddenly, tariffs, an arcane piece of trade policy, are the most dramatic thing in the world that he's imbued with reality-show stuff. He'll be really pleased with that.\"\n\nBut on the other hand, Wolff predicts, Trump will be watching the financial markets. \"He'll have the business guys calling up saying: what the fuck are you doing? I'm sure he hasn't come to any conclusion. So on the one hand it's great - he's the world's leading guy again. On the other, it might collapse in on him.\"\n\nAnd that, he adds, is the essence of Trump. \"He's fundamentally self-destructive, but that self-destructive impulse is exactly what keeps him at the forefront of the news.\""

      "text": "Rightwing group backed by Koch and Leo sues to stop Trump tariffs\n\nNew Civil Liberties Alliance says president's invocation of emergency powers to impose tariffs is unlawful\n\nA libertarian group that has been funded by Leonard Leo and Charles Koch has mounted a legal challenge against Donald Trump's tariff regime, in a sign of spreading rightwing opposition to a policy that has sent international markets plummeting.\n\nThe New Civil Liberties Alliance filed a suit against Trump's imposition of import tariffs on exports from China, arguing that doing so under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) - which the president has invoked to justify the duties on nearly all countries - is unlawful.\n\nThe group's actions echo support given by four Republican senators last week for a Democratic amendment calling for the reversal of 25% tariffs imposed on Canada.\n\nLast Wednesday's amendment passed with the support of Mitch McConnell, the former Republican Senate majority leader, and his fellow GOP members Rand Paul, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, who argued that tariffs on Canada would be economically harmful.\n\nThe action from the alliance has the potential to be even more emblematic, given its past backing from Koch, a billionaire industrialist, and Leo, a wealthy legal activist who advised Trump on the nomination of three conservative supreme court justices during his first presidency, which has given the court a 6-3 rightwing majority. The group received money from organisations affiliated with Leo and Koch in 2022. A spokesperson for Stand Together, a group partially funded by Koch and that has supported the alliance, said it was not involved in the legal case.\n\nThe alliance has tabled its action on behalf of Simplified, a Florida-based home goods company whose business is heavily reliant on imports from China. It argues that the president has exceeded his powers in invoking the IEEPA to justify tariffs.\n\n\"This statute authorizes specific emergency actions like imposing sanctions or freezing assets to protect the United States from foreign threats,\" the alliance said in a statement . \"It does not authorize the president to impose tariffs. In its nearly 50-year history, no other president - including President Trump in his first term - has ever tried to use the IEEPA to impose tariffs.\"\n\nThe alliance also argues that power to impose tariffs lies not with a sitting president, but with Congress, and warns that those imposed by Trump could run afoul of US supreme court rulings.\n\n\"His attempt to use the IEEPA this way not only violates the law as written, but it also invites application of the supreme court's major questions doctrine, which tells courts not to discern policies of 'vast economic and political significance' in a law without explicit congressional authorization,\" its statement said.\n\nMark Chenoweth, the alliance's president, said the court in Pensacola - where the suit has been filed - would have to observe this legal precedent.\n\n\"Reading this law [IEEPA] broadly enough to uphold the China tariff would transfer core legislative power,\" he said. \"To avoid that non-delegation pitfall, the court must construe the statute consistent with nearly 50 years of unbroken practice and decide it does not permit tariff setting.\"\n\nThe suit argues that there is no connection between the fentanyl epidemic - which Trump has cited as a reason for invoking the emergency powers - and the tariffs.\n\n\"The means of an across-the-board tariff does not fit the end of stopping an influx of opioids, and is in no sense 'necessary' to that stated purpose,\" the complaint filed on behalf of Simplified argues.\n\n\"In fact, President Trump's own statements reveal the real reason for the China tariff, which is to reduce American trade deficits while raising federal revenue.\"\n\nThe legal case adds to rumbling disquiet on tariffs among some of Trump's usually vocal supporters, including the billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman .\n\nPaul, a senator from Kentucky who has been one of the most consistent congressional anti-tariff voices, told the Washington Post that other Capitol Hill Republicans shared his concern.\n\n\"They all see the stock market, and they're all worried about it,\" Paul said. \"But they are putting on a stiff upper lip to try to act as if nothing's happening and hoping it goes away.\"\n\nSpeaking in support of last week's Democratic amendment, sponsored by the Virginia senator Tim Kaine, Paul said: \"I don't care if the president is a Republican or a Democrat. I don't want to live under emergency rule. I don't want to live where my representatives cannot speak for me and have a check and balance on power.\"\n\nTrump attacked Paul and the three other Republican senators who backed the amendment and suggested they were driven by \"Trump derangement syndrome\".\n\nIn another sign of Republican concern, the GOP senator from Iowa Chuck Grassley - along with a Washington Democrat, Maria Cantwell - introduced a bill that would limit Trump's ability to impose or increase tariffs by requiring Congress to approve them within 60 days. The White House budget office said on Monday that Trump would veto the bill.\n\nThis article was amended on 8 April 2025 to correct the spelling of Maria Cantwell's surname."

We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. \"This is an economic revolution, and we will win,\" he added. \"Hang tough, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic.\"\n\nTrump's 10% tariff on UK products came into force on Saturday, as global stock markets continued to fall in response to the imposition of import taxes. The FTSE 100 plummeted on Friday in its worst day of trading since the start of the pandemic, while markets on Wall Street also tumbled. Australia , Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia are also among the countries first hit with the 10% tariff.\n\nThe initial 10% \"baseline\" tariff took effect at US seaports, airports and customs warehouses at 12.01am ET (0401 GMT) . Many other countries will see their tariff rates increase above that next week - including the EU, which will be hit with a 20% rate. A 25% tariff imposed on all foreign cars imported into the US came into effect on Thursday.\n\nJaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed it will \"pause\" shipments to the US in April as it works to \"address the new trading terms\" of Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe UK prime minister, Keir Starmer, is expected to spend the weekend speaking to foreign leaders about the tariffs , after calls with the prime ministers of Australia and Italy on Friday in which the leaders agreed that a trade war would be \"extremely damaging\".\n\nDowning Street said that Starmer had \"been clear the UK's response will be guided by the national interest\". A spokesperson said officials will \"calmly continue with our preparatory work, rather than rush to retaliate\".\n\nRalph Goodale, the high commissioner for Canada in the UK , told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme on Saturday that \"action taken by the US government is completely illogical\". He added: \"It will damage the United States itself.\"\n\nThe Italian economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti , warned on Saturday against the imposition of retaliatory tariffs on the US in response to Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on trade partners. Speaking at a business forum near Milan, Giorgetti said Italy was aiming for a \"de-escalation\" with the US. \"We should avoid launching a policy of counter-tariffs that could be damaging for everyone and especially for us,\" Giorgetti said.\n\nThe stock market plunge has more to do with the emergence this year of China's DeepSeek artificial intelligence tool than with Trump's policies, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in an interview released on Friday that signalled little concern about the ongoing nosedive. \"For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president's economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,\" Bessent told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\nBangladesh's interim leader called an emergency meeting on Saturday after textile leaders in the world's second-largest garment manufacturing nation said US tariffs were a \"massive blow\" to the key industry. Trump on Wednesday slapped punishing new tariffs of 37 % on Bangladesh, increasing duties from the previous 16% on cotton and 32% on polyester products.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss recently announced tariffs with Trump, three Israeli officials said on Saturday. As part of a sweeping new tariff policy announced by Trump, unspecified Israeli goods exports to the US face a 17% tariff.\n\nChina has taken and will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, the foreign ministry said on Saturday, citing a Chinese government stance on opposing US tariffs. The US should \"stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China's economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people\", the ministry said.\n\nNissan Motor is considering shifting some domestic production of US-bound vehicles to the US, the Nikkei reported on Saturday. As early as this summer, Nissan plans to reduce production at its Fukuoka factory in western Japan and shift some manufacturing of its Rogue SUV to the US to mitigate the impact of Trump's tariffs, the business newspaper said, without citing the source of its information.\n\nThe president of Taiwan, Lai Ching-te, met tech executives on Saturday to discuss how to respond to new US tariffs, promising to ensure Taiwan's global competitiveness and safeguard its interests. Lai met the executives at his official residence to discuss the response to \"the global economic and trade challenges brought about by the reciprocal tariff policy\", his spokesperson Karen Kuo said in a statement. She did not say which companies were present, only that there were several representatives from the information and communications technology, or ICT, industry.\n\n\"Today, America is not only humiliating Iran, but also the world,\" the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said on Saturday, in an apparent reference to recent policies adopted by Trump, including imposing tariffs on imported goods. Pezeshkian said his country was willing to engage in dialogue with the US as equals, without clarifying whether Tehran would participate in direct talks.\n\nChina has said \"the market has spoken\" in rejecting Trump's tariffs, and called on Washington for \"equal-footed consultation\" after global markets plunged in reaction to the trade levies that drew Chinese retaliation. Trump introduced additional 34% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most US trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54%.\n\nAway from tariff news, left-leaning organisations in the US say that more than 500,000 people are expected to take to the streets to protest in Washington DC, Florida and elsewhere around the country on Saturday to oppose Donald Trump's \"authoritarian overreach and billionaire-backed agenda\". MoveOn, one of the organisations planning the day of protest they're calling Hands Off along with dozens of labour, environmental and other progressive groups, said that more than 1,000 protests are planned across the US, including at state capitols.\n\nDonald Trump on Saturday doubled down on the sweeping tariffs he unleashed on countries around the world, warning Americans of pain ahead, but promising historic investment and prosperity. \"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post', but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. \"This is an economic revolution, and we will win,\" he added. \"Hang tough, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic.\"\n\nTrump's 10% tariff on UK products came into force on Saturday, as global stock markets continued to fall in response to the imposition of import taxes. The FTSE 100 plummeted on Friday in its worst day of trading since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, while markets on Wall Street also tumbled. Australia, Colombia, Argentina, Egypt and Saudi Arabia are among the countries also hit with the 10% tariff.\n\nThe initial 10% \"baseline\" tariff took effect at US seaports, airports and customs warehouses at 12.01am ET (0401 GMT). Many other countries will see their tariff rates increase above that next week - including the EU, which will be hit with a 20% rate. A 25% tariff imposed on all foreign cars imported into the US came into effect on Thursday.\n\nJaguar Land Rover (JLR) has confirmed it will \"pause\" shipments to the US in April as it works to \"address the new trading terms\" of Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nKeir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron discussed their \"concerns about the global economic and security impact , particularly in South East Asia\" in the wake of Donald Trump's tariffs, Starmer's office said. In a post on X, Macron, said: \"A trade war is in no one's interest. We must stand united and resolute to protect our citizens and our businesses.\"\n\nElon Musk said he hoped in future to see complete freedom of trade between the US and Europe. He spoke via video-link at a congress in Florence of Italy's right-wing League party, which is part of the ruling coalition, Reuters reports. \"At the end of the day, I hope it's agreed that both Europe and the United States should move, ideally, in my view, to a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America,\" said Musk.\n\nRalph Goodale, the high commissioner for Canada in the UK, told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme on Saturday that the \"action taken by the US government is completely illogical\". He added: \"It will damage the United States itself.\"\n\nThe Italian economy minister, Giancarlo Giorgetti, warned on Saturday against the imposition of retaliatory tariffs on the US in response to Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs on trade partners. Speaking at a business forum near Milan, Giorgetti said Italy was aiming for a \"de-escalation\" with the US. \"We should avoid launching a policy of counter-tariffs that could be damaging for everyone, and especially for us,\" Giorgetti said.\n\nThe stock market plunge has more to do with the emergence this year of China's DeepSeek artificial intelligence tool than with Trump's policies, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said in an interview released on Friday that signalled little concern about the ongoing nosedive. \"For everyone who thinks these market declines are all based on the president's economic policies, I can tell you that this market decline started with the Chinese AI announcement of DeepSeek,\" Bessent told former Fox News host Tucker Carlson.\n\nBangladesh's interim leader called an emergency meeting on Saturday after textile leaders in the world's second-largest garment manufacturing nation said US tariffs were a \"massive blow\" to the key industry. Trump on Wednesday slapped punishing new tariffs of 37 % on Bangladesh, increasing duties from the previous 16% on cotton and 32% on polyester products.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss recently announced tariffs with Trump, three Israeli officials said on Saturday. As part of a sweeping new tariff policy announced by Trump, unspecified Israeli goods exports to the US face a 17% tariff.\n\nChina has taken and will continue to take resolute measures to safeguard its sovereignty, security and development interests, its foreign ministry said on Saturday, citing a Chinese government stance on opposing US tariffs. The US should \"stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China's economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people\", the ministry said.\n\nNissan Motor is considering shifting some domestic production of US-bound vehicles to the US, the Nikkei reported on Saturday. As early as this summer, Nissan plans to reduce production at its Fukuoka factory in western Japan and shift some manufacturing of its Rogue SUV to the US to mitigate the impact of Trump's tariffs, the business newspaper said, without citing the source of its information.\n\nThe president of Taiwan, Lai Ching-te, met tech executives on Saturday to discuss how to respond to new US tariffs, promising to ensure Taiwan's global competitiveness and safeguard its interests. Lai met the executives at his official residence to discuss the response to \"the global economic and trade challenges brought about by the reciprocal tariff policy\", his spokesperson, Karen Kuo, said in a statement. She did not say which companies were present, only that there were several representatives from the information and communications technologyindustry.\n\n\"Today, America is not only humiliating Iran, but also the world,\" the Iranian president, Masoud Pezeshkian, said on Saturday, in an apparent reference to recent policies adopted by Trump, including imposing tariffs on imported goods.

Trump introduced additional 34% tariffs on Chinese goods as part of steep levies imposed on most US trade partners, bringing the total duties on China this year to 54%.\n\nKeir Starmer is preparing to rethink key elements of the government's economic policy in an emergency response to Donald Trump's tariff blitz , amid growing concern in Downing Street that the US president's trade war could do lasting damage to the UK, writes Toby Helm and Phillip Inman .\n\nThe prime minister believes, say allies, that \"old assumptions should be discarded\" in the UK's response, suggesting he and the chancellor, Rachel Reeves, may be preparing to raise taxes again - despite having promised not to do so - or even possibly change their \"iron clad\" fiscal rules to allow more borrowing and fire up economic growth at home in the event of recession.\n\nAlmost $5tn (£4tn) was wiped off the value of global stock markets after Trump launched his tariff offensive last Wednesday on the rest of the world, including a 10% base tariff on imports into the US from the UK.\n\nOn Friday, the FTSE 100 closed more than 7% lower than last Monday, after what was its worst week since the height of panic over the Covid pandemic in March 2020.\n\nUnderlining the potential impact on UK businesses of a global trade war, Britain's luxury carmaker Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) said on Saturday that it would \"pause\" shipments to the US in April as it considered how to respond. \"As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are taking some short-term actions, including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid- to longer-term plans,\" said JLR.\n\nThis week, Starmer, who has refused to criticise Trump or his tariffs directly, will focus on how to frame an economic response to a global economic shock that protects working people, and their incomes and jobs - as well as the UK's public services.\n\nHe believes that the last few days have ushered in a \"new era\", that the \"world has changed\" and that a global trade war risks \"undermining a proud, hard-working nation\".\n\nIn a post on X, France's president, Emmanuel Macron, said: \"In these times of upheaval, one certainty remains: in the face of the world's great shocks, we must move forward together.\n\n\"Today, I spoke with British Prime Minister @Keir_Starmer, following my conversation two days ago with President @vonderleyen.\n\n\"As the global economy feels the impact of the tariffs imposed by the United States, we reaffirmed our determination to closely coordinate our positions in the ongoing discussions with President Donald Trump .\n\n\"A trade war is in no one's interest. We must stand united and resolute to protect our citizens and our businesses.\"\n\nElon Musk said on Saturday he hoped in future to see complete freedom of trade between the U S and Europe .\n\nMusk spoke via video-link at a congress in Florence of Italy's right-wing League party, which is part of the ruling coalition, Reuters reports.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I hope it's agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero tariff situation, effectively creating a free trade zone between Europe and North America,\" Musk said.\n\nUnder Trump's plans announced on Wednesday, Italy, which has a large trade surplus with the US, will be subject to a general tariff of 20% along with other EU countries.\n\nInterviewed by League leader Matteo Salvini, Musk, who has repeatedly expressed support for right-wing parties across Europe, said he also hoped to see greater freedom of movement between Europe and the US.\n\n\"If people wish to work in Europe or wish to work in North America, they should be allowed to do so in my view,\" Musk said, adding that this \"has certainly been my advice to the president\".\n\nThe US president wants to revive the manufacturing sector with a mix of protectionist policies, tax cuts and deregulation. Higher tariffs on foreign imports are supposed to encourage investment by US companies and overseas businesses that want to avoid the tariffs.\n\nThe cash generated by the tariffs will be the source of funds for tax cuts, unlike Trump's first administration when tax cuts were funded, Liz Truss-style, by extra borrowing.\n\nRightwing groups that bankrolled Trump in 2024 want him to bring down debts, insisting the president work harder to balance the books. That's also the rationale behind cutting government staff numbers.\n\nThere is much more to Trump's tariff scheme. He has yet to apply tariffs to pharmaceuticals and rare-earth minerals. He also intends to end a \" de-minimis \" rule that allowed goods worth less than $800 (£620) into the US tariff free. The rule is widely considered to be something Chinese makers of household goods and clothes, such as Shein, exploit.\n\nThese extra tariffs are expected to be tailored so they hit China and affiliated countries the hardest.\n\nA prolonged downturn in the US is a possibility that is rapidly becoming more certain as countries react to US tariffs with countermeasures of their own. China's rapid response, which was to impose a like-for-like 34% increase in import charges on US goods from 10 April, could be the start of a broader tit-for-tat that harms all major trading nations, including the UK.\n\nRachel Reeves cannot know the outcome for the UK because such sweeping protectionist policies have not been tried in the modern era. In the 1930s, most economic activity was generated by manufacturing and activities like mining, but today 75% of the UK economy is services, which are untouched directly by tariffs.\n\nStill, there is the potential for economic growth to take a battering from the short-term shock and the uncertainty caused by the on-off tariff policy. Slower growth will undoubtedly force the government to review its tight spending rules.\n\nIf Keir Starmer rebuffs calls for retaliatory tariffs, inflation may fall. Oil and gas traders have already cut futures prices in the belief that there will be lower demand. Goods suppliers shut out of the US could look to redirect sales to the UK at a discounted rate. The government will be wary of allowing China and other badly hit countries in east Asia to dump goods, but it should, nonetheless, keep prices from rising.\n\nIsrael's prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is expected to visit the White House on Monday to discuss recently announced tariffs with the US president, Donald Trump , Reuters reports.\n\nThe impromptu in-person visit could mark the first by a foreign leader to meet with Trump and try to negotiate a deal to remove tariffs.\n\nNetanyahu's office has not confirmed the visit that would also include discussions on Turkey's growing influence in neighbouring Syria, Iran, and Israel's war against Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza, one of the officials said.\n\nThe visit was first reported by Axios.\n\nAmong the protesters in London was Clarke Reinstein, 73, from Rhode Island, who told the PA news agency he was \"disappointed in my fellow Americans\" over the election of Donald Trump .\n\n\"I've been in London for two months and I like being over here because people think a little differently,\" he said.\n\n\"They made a mistake over Brexit - but they didn't fall over like the Americans have.\"\n\nA 37-year-old woman from Philadelphia was draped in the American flag that had been presented to her second world war veteran grandfather.\n\nThe woman, who did not wish to be named, told PA she was protesting because of the \"absolute, mind-blowing insipidness\" of Trump's presidency.\n\n\"I don't want to alienate the rest of the world,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not going to be useful for anyone in the long run. I felt powerless and I needed to come out and say something.\n\n\"I have friends in the United States who are marching in protest, and I wanted to march with them in solidarity.\"\n\nBrent Robertson, 56, from Albuquerque, criticised Trump's tariffs.\n\nRobertson said: \"Stupid is not the word.\n\n\"He is shooting himself and all of us as Americans, just so he can make himself look like a tough guy.\"\n\nSome 1,200 demonstrations are planned across the US on Saturday in what organisers expect to be the largest single day of protest against president Donald Trump and his billionaire ally Elon Musk since they launched a rapid-fire effort to overhaul government and expand presidential authority.\n\nThousands were streaming into downtown Washington DC as the protests got underway. Organisers told Reuters that more than 20,000 people were expected to attend the rally at the National Mall.\n\nThe protests in the US will give Trump opponents an opportunity to demonstrate their displeasure en masse in response to Trump's raft of executive orders.\n\nSome 150 activist groups have signed up to participate, according to the event's website. Protests are planned in all 50 states, as well as Canada, Mexico and the UK.\n\nProtesters were lining Connecticut Avenue in Washington DC, awaiting buses to take them downtown. They were carrying signs with slogans such as \"No Kings in the USA\" and \"Deport Musk\".\n\nTerry Klein, a retired biomedical scientist from Princeton, New Jersey, was among hundreds who gathered early in front of the stage below the Washington Monument.\n\nShe said she drove down to attend the rally to protest Trump's policies on \"everything from immigration to the DOGE stuff to the tariffs this week, to education\".\n\n\"I mean, our whole country is under attack, all of our institutions, all the things that make America what it is,\" she added.\n\nDavid Madden, a 75-year-old army veteran and retired trial lawyer, said he flew from Dayton, Ohio, to demonstrate against \"the injustice that is dominating this country, the institutions that are being stolen from the American people, the confusion in the courts, the fact that we have a population that I believe is essentially racist\".\n\nDonald Trump's sweeping tariffs are roiling global financial markets, with stocks tumbling across the board from New York to London.\n\nWall Street suffered its worst week since the onset of the Covid-19 crisis five years ago as investors worldwide balked at the US president's risky bid to overhaul the global economy with the vast tariffs.\n\nExperts are all but unanimous that the impact on global growth of Wednesday's extraordinary Rose Garden press conference will be negative - but just how bad remains highly uncertain.\n\nJaguar Land Rover (JLR) will pause shipments of its UK-made cars to the US for a month as it considers how to mitigate the cost of Donald Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe 25% tariff imposed by the US on imported cars and light trucks took effect on 3 April.\n\nA JLR spokesperson said: \"The USA is an important market for JLR's luxury brands. As we work to address the new trading terms with our business partners, we are enacting our short-term actions including a shipment pause in April, as we develop our mid to longer-term plans.\"\n\nJLR, which is owned by India's Tata Motors, is one of Britain's biggest producers, selling 400,000 Range Rover Sports, Defenders and other models annually.\n\nExports to the US account for almost a quarter of those sales and JLR is at the centre of Britain's car industry, accounting for £1 in every £8 of the country's exports.\n\nThe Sunday Times reported that JLR is thought to have a couple of months' supply of cars already in the US, which will not be subject to the new tariffs. Shipping vehicles across the Atlantic takes about 21 days.\n\nHundreds of protesters gathered in central London as part of global demonstrations against Donald Trump's administration.\n\nCrowds gathered in Trafalgar Square on Saturday afternoon with banners that read \"No to Maga hate\" and \"Dump Trump\".\n\nThe rally is one of hundreds of so-called \"hands off\" demonstrations around the world - including in cities across the US, Paris and Berlin.\n\nThe movement has been organised by more than 150 groups, including civil rights groups and trade unions.\n\nA 25% levy on all foreign cars imported into America came into force on Thursday, and a wider \"baseline\" 10% tariff on goods imported from around the world kicked in on Saturday morning.\n\nKeir Starmer and Emmanuel Macron discussed their \"concerns about the global economic and security impact, particularly in South East Asia\" in the wake of Donald Trump's tariffs, Starmer's office said.\n\nThe UK's prime minister spoke to the French president on Saturday, the latest in a series of calls with world leaders following the announcement of the US levies .\n\nIssuing a readout of the call, a Downing Street spokesperson said: \"The prime minister spoke with President Macron following this week's announcement that the US will impose additional tariffs. They agreed that a trade war was in nobody's interests but nothing should be off the table and that it was important to keep business updated on developments.\n\n\"The prime minister and president also shared their concerns about the global economic and security impact, particularly in South East Asia.\n\n\"Following discussions between military planners in Ukraine this week, they discussed the good progress that has been made on the Coalition of the Willing.\n\n\"The prime minister and president agreed to stay in close contact over the coming weeks.\"\n\nHere is a summary of the latest developments so far:\n\nDonald Trump on Saturday doubled down on the sweeping tariffs he unleashed on countries around the world, warning Americans of pain ahead, but promising historic investment and prosperity. \"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post', but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform. \"This is an economic revolution, and we will win,\" he added. \"Hang tough, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic.\"\n\nTrump's 10% tariff on UK products came into force on Saturday, as global stock markets continued to fall in response to the imposition of import taxes.

A spokesperson said officials will \"calmly continue with our preparatory work, rather than rush to retaliate\".\n\nRalph Goodale, the high commissioner for Canada in the UK , told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme on Saturday that \"action taken by the US government is completely illogical\".

Maga refers to Trump's \"Make America great again\" political slogan.\n\nUS stocks have tumbled by about 10% in the two days after Trump announced a new global tariff regime that was more aggressive than analysts and investors had been anticipating.\n\nIt is a drop that market analysts and large investors themselves have laid at the feet of Trump's aggressive push on tariffs, which most economists and the head of the Federal Reserve believe risk stoking inflation and damaging economic growth, reports Reuters.\n\nStocks did take a hit in late January when Chinese startup DeepSeek launched a free AI assistant that it says uses less data at a fraction of the cost of incumbent services. It resulted in a record one-day loss of nearly $600bn in value from the shares of AI chipmaker Nvidia , one of the \"Magnificent 7\". But the market soon found its footing again and by mid-February, the benchmark S&P 500 index had regained a record-high level.\n\nThen stocks turned south again starting in late February after a widely followed survey of consumers showed households growing broadly pessimistic about the economy's prospects and fearful that Trump's push for tariffs would drive up inflation, reports Reuters.\n\nA raft of other surveys of businesses and consumers since then have flagged similar concerns, and other data has shown the pace of activity has slowed over the course of the first quarter of 2025. The S&P has lost nearly 14% since 19 February, and nearly $10tn of US stock market value has been erased.\n\nThe US commerce secretary, Howard Lutnick , has been dismissive of the drop as well.\n\nTrump himself on Friday retweeted a social media post bearing the caption \"Trump is Purposely CRASHING The Market\" and featuring images of the president pointing at a large downward red arrow and of him signing executive orders at the White House .\n\nMeanwhile, Bessent also told Carlson the administration retains a \"strong dollar\" policy and dismissed assertions by some analysts that the tariff drive was a deliberate effort to weaken the dollar to make US goods more competitive on global markets.\n\n\"No one should listen to anyone in the markets talk about the US dollar other than President Trump or myself,\" Bessent said. \"We are the only ones that speak for this administration, the United States government on dollar policy.\"\n\n\"We have a strong-dollar policy and we are putting in all of the necessary ingredients to make sure the dollar is strong over the long run,\" he said.\n\nThe dollar has shed nearly 6% of its value against major trading partners' currencies since Trump's inauguration on 20 January, reports Reuters.\n\nDonald Trump on Saturday doubled down on the sweeping tariffs he unleashed on countries around the world, warning Americans of pain ahead, but promising historic investment and prosperity.\n\nThe comments came as the US president's widest-ranging tariffs took effect in a move that could trigger retaliation and escalating trade tensions that could upset the global economy.\n\n\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before,\" Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform, Agence France-Presse (AFP) reports.\n\n\"This is an economic revolution, and we will win,\" he added. \"Hang tough, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic.\"\n\nA 10% \"baseline\" tariff came into place just after midnight, hitting most US imports except goods from Mexico and Canada as Trump invoked emergency economic powers to address perceived problems with the country's trade deficits.\n\nThe trade gaps, said the White House , were driven by an \"absence of reciprocity\" in relationships and other policies like \"exorbitant value-added taxes\".\n\nCome 9 April, about 60 trading partners - including the European Union , Japan and China - are to face even higher rates tailored to each economy.\n\nAlready, Trump's sharp 34%tariff on Chinese goods, to kick in next week, triggered Beijing 's announcement of its own 34% tariff on US products from 10 April.\n\nBeijing also said it would sue the US at the World Trade Organization (WTO) and restrict the export of rare-earth elements used in high-end medical and electronics technology.\n\n\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close,\" Trump said in his post. \"They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly.\"\n\nBut other major trading partners held back as they digested the unfolding international standoff amid fears of a recession.\n\nOn the topic of garments and Donald Trump 's tariffs, my colleague, the Guardian's deputy fashion and lifestyle editor, Chloe Mac Donnell , has written about how from farmers to designers, the entire fashion supply chain will be hit. It is unclear what duties apply to a finished product, she writes in this piece:"

      "text": "Trump tariffs live: US markets see worst day in five years as president claims 'stock is going to boom' - as it happened\n\nThe New York stock exchange has closed on its worst day of trading since June 2020 - during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nThe main indices saw their worst one-day falls in five years as Donald Trump claimed that \"the markets are going to boom\" in response to his sweeping tariffs.\n\nThe S&P 500 index is down 4.9% at the close, which Reuters flags is the biggest one-day drop since June 2020.\n\nThe Dow has also posted its biggest one-day drop since June 2020, down 4%.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nasdaq tumbled 5.9%, its worst single-day performance since March 2020.\n\nThe scale of the sell-off, wiping trillions of dollars off the value of US companies, highlights just how alarmed investors are by the tariffs, and the fears they could lead to a recession.\n\nSpeaking to reporters earlier on Thursday, Trump denied market turmoil presented a problem. The president said:\n\nI think it's going very well. It was an operation like when a patient gets operated on and it's a big thing. I said this would be exactly the way it is ... We've never seen anything like it. The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom. The country is going to boom.\n\nClosing Summary\n\nOur live coverage is ending now. In the meantime, you can find all of our live US politics coverage here . And you can also follow along with our continuing coverage of the United States's tariffs announcment here . Here is a summary of the key developments from today:\n\nThe New York stock exchange closed on its worst day of trading since June 2020 - during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. The main indices saw their worst one-day falls in five years as Donald Trump claimed that \"the markets are going to boom\" in response to his sweeping tariffs. As Friday morning dawned in Asia, markets opened lower there as well.\n\nThe 500 richest people in the world lost a combined $208 bn today as stock markets plunged, Bloomberg reports.

But Trump did criticize Australia by name during his speech for not importing more American beef.\n\nCalla Wahlquist in Australia has more on the US-Australia meat trade war:\n\nAustralia introduced a ban on US beef imports in 2003, in response to an outbreak of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease.\n\nIt was technically lifted in 2019, subject to an ongoing biosecurity review that in practice means no imports of fresh beef. The sticking point is the US's reliance on live cattle imports from Canada and Mexico to bolster its national herd.\n\nRead on below for more:\n\nThe 500 richest people in the world lost a combined $208 bn today as stock markets plunged in response to Donald Trump's sweeping tariff announcement yesterday, Bloomberg reports.\n\nAccording to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index, which has been active for 13 years, this is the fourth largest one-day drop in billionaires' wealth.\n\nUS billionaires - and Trump allies - like Mark Zuckerberg and Jeff Bezos were the most affected.\n\nIn an interview with Newsmax this evening, JD Vance said he thought the stock market response \"could be worse\" after Donald Trump announced his administration's \"reciprocal\" tariffs yesterday.\n\nUS stock markets saw their worst day of trading since 2020 today as investors grappled with the implications of Trump's sweeping tariffs.\n\n\"Look, one bad day in the stock market compared to what President Trump said earlier today - and I think he's right about this - we're going to have a booming stock market for a long time because we're reinvesting in the United States of America,\" Vance said. \"We're feeling good.\"\n\nAs Friday morning dawns in Asia, markets are opening lower as investors respond to Donald Trump's sweeping \"reciprocal\" tariffs, the highest of which were levied against Asian nations.\n\nJapan's Nikkei 225 index dropped 2.o7% and South Korea's Kospi index fell 1.15%.\n\nMeanwhile, in Australia, the S&P/ASX 200 fell 1.06%.\n\nThe Health secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr says some personnel let go from and programs shuttered at the Depart ment of Health and Human Services on Tuesday will be reinstated.\n\nHe said the cuts were meant to streamline the agency but that \"there were a number of instances where studies that should not have been cut were cut, and we've reinstated them. Personnel that should not have been cut were cut. We're reinstating them. And that was always the plan.\n\n\"We talked about this from the beginning. We're going to do 80% cuts, but 20% of those are going to have to be reinstalled because we'll make mistakes,\" he added.\n\nTed Cruz, the Republican senator from Texas, says he is \"not a fan of tariffs\" and that he hopes Donald Trump's are \"short-lived\".\n\nSpeaking with Fox Business, Cruz said: \"I think it is a mistake to assume that we will have high tariffs in perpetuity. I don't think that would be good economic policy.\"\n\nHe added that he hoped the president would use the duties as \"leverage to lower tariffs across the globe\".\n\nThe head of the International Monetary Fund says Donald Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs \"clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook\".\n\n\"It is important to avoid steps that could further harm the world economy,\" said IMF managing director Kristalina Georgieva. \"We appeal to the United States and its trading partners to work constructively to resolve trade tensions and reduce uncertainty.\"\n\nThe fund will meet with the World Bank later this month to discuss global economic issues, including the recent US tariffs.\n\nThe Trump administration is reportedly now taking aim at Brown University, widening its threats to withhold federal funding for schools deemed to be in conflict with its edicts.\n\nAs the fifth university to potentially face a financial hit from the administration, Brown stands to lose $510m over several years, the New York Times reported Thursday, a sizable blow that could seriously impact research.\n\nBrown administrators have not confirmed the news, which was first published by the right-wing website The Daily Caller. But provost Frank Doyle said the university was aware of \"troubling rumors emerging about federal action on Brown research grants\", in an email sent to school officials.\n\nFrom the NYT:\n\nLike many of its Ivy League peers, Brown was the site of clashes over the war in Gaza. But it was also one of a small number of universities that made deals with students to end their protest encampments in the spring, agreements that came under criticism for being too soft on students.\n\nBrown became one of only a handful of universities to agree to a board vote on divesting from Israel . The Brown Corporation, the school's governing board, ultimately voted against divestment, saying it held no direct investments in companies protesters had named as having ties to Israel.\n\nIn recent weeks, as other universities faced backlash over their perceived acquiescence to the Trump Administration, Brown's leaders spoke out, vowing steadfast commitment to their academic freedoms.\n\nIn a letter shared publicly on the university's site, President Christina H Paxson promised that Brown would not buckle under pressure.\n\n\"The nation has witnessed what many in higher education fear may be only the first examples of unprecedented government demands placed on a private university as a condition for restoring federal funding,\" she said.\n\nPaxson outlined three core values and the school's response to protect them: following the law, defending academic freedom and freedom of expression, and a commitment to providing resources to international community members.\n\n\"If Brown faced such actions directly impacting our ability to perform essential academic and operational functions,\" she said, \"we would be compelled to vigorously exercise our legal rights to defend these freedoms, and true to our values, we would do so with integrity and respect.\"\n\nA coalition of 19 Democratic attorneys general filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration on Thursday, arguing that a recent executive order signed by the president seeking to overhaul the nation's elections was unconstitutional.\n\nThe lawsuit accuses the president of overstepping his authority with last week's action, which they say amounts to an \"unconstitutional, antidemocratic, and un-American attempt to impose sweeping voting restrictions across the country\".\n\nThe lawsuit is the latest challenge to the president's order , which includes proof-of-citizenship requirements for voter registration and new ballot deadline rules. the order threatens states that don't comply with federal funding cuts.\n\nIt lists President Trump, the attorney general Pam Bondi as defendants. The attorneys general are asking a judge to declare the provisions \"unconstitutional and void\".\n\n\"My fellow attorneys general and I are taking him to court because this Executive Order is nothing but a blatantly illegal power grab and an attempt to disenfranchise voters, California attorney general Rob Bonta said in a statement. \"Neither the Constitution nor Congress authorize the President's attempted voting restrictions. We will not be bullied by him. We will fight like hell in court to stop him.\"\n\nTrump's elections order also faces legal challenges brought by the Democratic National Committee, the Democratic Governors Association, and Senate and House Democratic leaders, as well as a separate lawsuit filed by two nonprofit organizations, The Campaign Legal Center and the State Democracy Defenders Fund. Both of these lawsuits were filed in the US district court for the District of Columbia.\n\nWhen Trump signed the order, Will Scharf, the White House staff secretary, called the order \"the farthest-reaching executive action taken\" in the country's history.\n\nDespite Trump's public anti-tax stance, his decision to sharply increase tariffs would amount to the largest tax hike in decades, Reuters reports.\n\nThe intel comes from a JP Morgan note, which concluded that the tariffs account for a 22% increase and warns that \"sustained restrictive trade policies and reduced immigration flows may impose lasting supply costs that will lower U.S. growth over the long run\".\n\nTrump's trade policies have spiked risks of a global recession according to the bank, which raised chances to 60% from 40% .\n\nThe US stock market closed today on the worst day of trading since 2020, with all three major index funds down as Apple and Nvidia lost a combined $470bn.\n\nOur colleagues have more on the financial fallout of Donald Trump's massive \"reciprocal\" tariffs announced yesterday:\n\nThanks for joining our coverage of US politics, and particularly the fallout from Donald Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs announcement yesterday. Here are the key headlines we've been following so far today:\n\nThe New York stock exchange closed on its worst day of trading since June 2020 - during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic. The main indices saw their worst one-day falls in five years as Donald Trump claimed that \"the markets are going to boom\" in response to his sweeping tariffs.\n\nCanada will retaliate against \"unjustified, unwarranted\" tariffs imposed by the United States with a 25% taxes on US vehicles, Mark Carney announced on Thursday. The US has placed 25% taxes on Canadian steel, aluminum and vehicles.\n\nMitch McConnell, the Kentucky Republican senator and former Senate majority leader, has criticized Donald Trump's latest tariffs, saying that they are \"bad policy and trade wars with our partners hurt working people most\". Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One today that tariffs on imported semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals will be coming \"soon\".\n\nThe US agriculture secretary Brooke Rollins said that the administration is \"months away\" from making a decision about whether to make payments to farmers to offset any impact from tariffs. Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs were mostly criticized by farm and food groups for their potential to shrink markets for farmers and raise prices for consumers.\n\nA federal judge said she will temporarily block the Trump administration from cutting $11bn in federal public health funding. US District Judge Mary McElroy in Rhode Island said she will approve a temporary restraining order while hearing a case brought by 23 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nMike Pence will receive the John F Kennedy Profile in Courage Award in May for his refusal to go along with the 6 January attack on the US Capitol. The JFK Library Foundation shared the announcement today, saying the award will recognize Trump's former vice-president \"for putting his life and career on the line to ensure the constitutional transfer of presidential power on Jan. 6, 2021.\"\n\nThe Pentagon's inspector general's office announced it was opening an investigation into defense secretary Pete Hegseth's use of an unclassified commercial texting application to coordinate the 15 March launch of US strikes on Yemen's Houthis. Hegseth outlined details of a US airstrike in Yemen in a Signal group chat that included the vice-president, JD Vance , as well as Trump's national security adviser, Mike Waltz , who mistakenly added Jeffrey Goldberg , editor-in-chief of the Atlantic, to the chat.\n\nSeveral members of Donald Trump's embattled national security council have been fired, Axios reports . The firings come a day after conspiracy theorist Laura Loomer visited the Oval Office and pressed Trump to fire specific NSC staffers for disloyalty.\n\nUS secretary of state Marco Rubio told Nato allies on Thursday that Washington remained committed to the alliance but expected them to spend far more on defence and would give them some time to do so. Rubio met fellow Nato foreign ministers gathered in Brussels, with some European officials saying they were reassured by the renewed commitment to the alliance at a time of rising tensions over Trump's new trade tariffs.\n\nA federal judge said she will temporarily block the Trump administration from cutting $11bn in federal public health funding.\n\nUS District Judge Mary McElroy in Rhode Island said she will approve a temporary restraining order while hearing a case brought by 23 states and the District of Columbia.\n\nNew York Attorney General Letitia James reacted to the judge's decision on social media, saying: \"We're going to continue our lawsuit and fight to ensure states can provide the medical services Americans need.\"\n\nThe $11bn in cuts that the Trump administration had proposed would have predominantly affected funding for Covid-19 related initiatives, mental health and substance use treatment.\n\nWhile speaking with reporters aboard Air Force One, Trump also mentioned tariffs could give him the power to make a deal with China over TikTok.\n\n\"We have a situation with TikTok where China will probably say we'll approve a deal but will you do something on the tariffs. The tariffs give us great power to negotiate,\" he said. He then clarified that he was not currently in talks with China and was just using TikTok as an example.\n\nHe added \"we're very close to a deal with a very good group of people\" with \"multiple\" investors interested in the social media platform.\n\nDonald Trump told reporters aboard Air Force One today that tariffs on imported semiconductor chips and pharmaceuticals will be coming \"soon\".\n\nHe added that the \"reciprocal\" tariffs he announced yesterday have put the US \"in the drivers seat.\"\n\n\"Every country is calling us. That's the beauty of what we do,\" he said. \"If we would have asked these countries to do us a favor. They would have said no. Now they will do anything for us.\"\n\nThe Senate has confirmed Mehmet Oz - a former heart surgeon and TV personality - as the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.\n\nOz will take the lead at the agency, which provides health care coverage to more than 160 million Americans - but which is facing significant changes as Congress debates cuts to the Medicaid coverage.\n\nFor more, read on below:"

      "text": "'Fundamentally wrong, brutal and paranoid': how will the world respond to Donald Trump's tariffs?\n\nThe US president's sweeping, unprecedented tariffs on countries around the world are threatening to reshape the global economy - so, what exactly happens next?\n\nO n Thursday evening, towards the end of a long week at a textiles factory on the outskirts of Ho Chi Minh City, Nguyen Thi Dieu and her husband were watching the news. More than 8,700 miles away, US president Donald Trump was announcing sweeping, unprecedented tariffs on every country around the world. Nowhere was safe, even the uninhabited Heard Island and McDonald Islands off the western coast of Australia that, for some unexplained reason, were hit with a 10% tariff.\n\nHis announcement launched a fierce global trade war and triggered a global market meltdown, including on Trump's own cherished Wall Street, where hundreds of billions of dollars of stock values evaporated.\n\nAnd for Dieu and her husband, it could mean they lose their jobs. They both work for a Taiwanese company making footwear in Vietnam for an American company, that exports them around the world. It is hard to find a better example of modern globalisation - and now, as the US enters a new age of protectionism, a speech in the White House Rose Garden means that Dieu doesn't know how her family will survive.\n\n\"Nothing is clear,\" said Dieu on Saturday night, as she browsed a roadside market in one of Ho Chi Minh City's industrial zones, home to tens of thousands of people who work in the city's factories. \"I feel confused and worried that my job may not be stable.\"\n\nOfficials in Vietnam are concerned. The US is Vietnam's biggest market, with exports making up 30% of the country's GDP and fuelling its economic growth. Hours after the announcement, Vietnam's prime minister ordered the creation of a \"rapid response team\" and said the deputy prime minister, Ho Duc Phoc, would head to the US for a \"working visit\".\n\nEvery country around the world has had a similar reaction. In Europe, leaders condemned Trump's tariffs as \"fundamentally wrong\" (Olaf Scholz), \"brutal and unfounded\" (Emmanuel Macron) and \"contrary to the interests of millions of people, on both sides of the Atlantic\" (Pedro Sánchez).\n\nEuropean media were similarly brutal. \"Filled with paranoia, vengeance and coerciveness\" was the verdict of Le Monde , while Italy's Corriere della Sera urged the EU to threaten \"counter-tariffs ... to bring the US to the table. Clearly, the EU is being put through what amounts to a stress test. It will need to demonstrate unity.\"\n\nBut while Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission chief, said Europeans felt \"let down by their oldest ally\" and warned the tariffs were \"a major blow to the world economy\" with \"dire consequences\", the EU did not immediately respond.\n\nPartly, that is because - in the words of Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia group consultancy - the bloc's \"ultimate aim is to prevent a further escalation, bring the US to the table, and explore paths to mutually rolling back transatlantic trade barriers\".\n\nBrussels still hopes that over the coming weeks, \"a combination of counter-duties, threats and offers\" will bring results, Rahman said, limiting the damage to an EU-US trade relationship that was worth more than €1.6tn (£1.3tn) in 2023.\n\nThere is a lot for Europe to lose if it doesn't. Trump's \"liberation day\" tariff of 20% on almost all EU exports to the US came after 25% levies on steel, aluminium, cars and car parts. In total, about 70% - or €380bn - of EU exports to the US will be affected.\n\nEU officials calculate that would raise about €80bn for the US treasury if trade remained unchanged, which it most probably won't: economists have estimated that in the medium term, EU exports to the US could fall by 50% because of the tariffs.\n\nBut if Brussels hopes a staggered approach to retaliation will encourage the US to negotiate, there is another reason it is not rushing to respond: getting 27 member states, each with national interests to defend, to agree on a single strategy is not easy.\n\nThe EU's response to Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs, which were announced six weeks ago, will probably include levies on emblematic American products such as orange juice, blue jeans, bourbon whiskey and Harley-Davidson motorcycles.\n\nDue to be unveiled in mid-April, however, its exact details have still not been decided. Still less, the bloc's retaliatory response to the 25% duties on EU cars and car parts that came into force on 3 April - let alone the latest liberation day tariffs.\n\nMember states are nervous. France, Italy and Ireland, for example, are campaigning hard to have bourbon removed from the list - because Trump has threatened to hit European wines and spirits with a 200% duty if the EU includes it.\n\nTargeting the US whiskey, they argue, would do more economic harm than good: EU countries import barely €500m of bourbon annually, but export €8bn of wine and spirits to the US - and some EU winemakers rely on the US for up to 20% of sales.\n\n\"What matters,\" said Ignacio García Bercero, a former senior EU trade negotiator, \"is that you maximise the political impact [on the US], and limit the economic impact [to the EU]\". It is a delicate balancing act.\n\nThe EU does, however, have one strong hand to play in services. Trump is obsessed with the $236bn US trade deficit with the EU in goods, but less well known is that the US runs a trade surplus in services with the EU of €109bn.\n\nIf necessary, limiting US companies' access to EU public procurement tenders or to European markets ranging from banking and other financial services to big tech could prove a powerful riposte. For the time being, though, it has not come to that.\n\n\"We are buying the space we need to negotiate, and looking at targeting our response in the most effective way possible,\" an EU official said: not just \"how we impact the US\", but also \"saving our member states and our industry the pain wherever possible\".\n\nAs Europe reeled from the shock of the tariffs, the unspoken message from Beijing was: welcome to our world. \"There are no winners in trade wars, and there is no way out for protectionism,\" the commerce ministry said on Thursday.\n\nFor Xi Jinping's government, there was no Brussels-style hesitancy - they immediately hit back. On Friday, China announced that it would be imposing retaliatory tariffs of 34% on US imports, starting on 10 April. China also added US entities to its export control list, restricting their ability to do business in China.\n\nChinese companies have been figuring out how to circumnavigate Trump's tariffs since 2018, when Trump's first US-China trade war started. Companies have been moving their supply chains to south-east Asia, while the government has been signing trade deals with global south countries with increasing gusto.\n\nEven with countries without a free trade agreement, such as Brazil, Chinese bilateral trade has soared in the past seven years. In 2023, China-Brazil trade reached a record $157.5bn.\n\nEconomists noted that the US tariffs on Chinese goods did not change the fact that the US is a net importer of products that China produces, such as fast fashion, electronics and clean energy equipment. \"If the US shifts around its importing pattern without changing its net imports, it's not going to make much of a difference to the world,\" said Michael Pettis, a professor of finance at Peking University. \"You'll see trade shift around, but the basic imbalances will remain there.\"\n\nTrump and his team have tried to tackle this problem by imposing tariffs on the countries that have been used by Chinese companies to reroute their supply chains, such as Vietnam, Thailand and Cambodia. Those countries are being hit with even higher tariffs than China, at 46%, 36% and 49%, respectively.\n\nWhether or not the tariffs have the desired effect from the US perspective, there is one clear strategic victory - for China. China, once again, can present itself as the stable global partner for third countries, in contrast to the capricious US.\n\nBack in Washington, Trump was claiming on social media that \"China played it wrong - they panicked\", insisting that despite the market drops, global political condemnation and even rare criticism from his own Republican party, his tariffs had made it a \"great time to get rich\".\n\nBut with all eyes nervously on Monday's markets amid worries that the calamitous drops will continue, recession fears are mounting in America. JP Morgan analysts last week boosted their odds on a global recession to 60% and Americans are bracing for a return of inflation - the thing that above all else probably doomed Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden.\n\nOn the streets of New York too, there was panic among some. In Washington Square Park, two sisters from Detroit were sitting on a park bench nearby the magnolia trees now in bloom. Kathleen, a primary school teacher, said she worried about whether there was a plan in place before changes are made.\n\n\"I want to be optimistic, but I live under an umbrella of worry with this administration,\" Kathleen said. \"I worry about the leadership, worry about a lack of continuity within the leadership, and so many changes at once without a plan.\"\n\nHer sister, Elizabeth, said she'd grown so anxious she'd stepped back from the news. \"Our mum definitely had a huge jump in anxiety during this past week over her investments. She worked hard for those and she lives on them ... a retired schoolteacher, and the drop in stocks very much affects her day-to-day feeling of security.\"\n\nTrump made his move because he dreams of a return of American manufacturing might, convinced that tariffs will force factories home to the US, even though almost all economists think that is highly unlikely.\n\nYet, for such a momentous decision which has rattled the entire world economy, Trump reportedly only made up his mind at the last minute. According to the Washington Post , Trump didn't arrive on an exact plan until just three hours before the Rose Garden performance.\n\nThe \"liberation day\" announcement from the White House was a choreographed event, and his speech drew cheers from the audience, largely made up cabinet members and blue-collar workers from manufacturing sectors that have for decades been economically pummelled by foreign competition. He offered up a vision that tariffs would bring back an older American economy, reopening factories and returning prosperity to ordinary workers.\n\n\"Taxpayers have been ripped off for more than 50 years,\" Trump complained \"But it is not going to happen any more.\"\n\nVice-president JD Vance said : \"We've seen closing factories, we've seen rising inflation. We've seen the cost of housing so high that most Americans can't afford to buy a home right now. President Trump is taking this economy in a different direction.\"\n\nMost observers would probably agree that the US economy was heading in a \"different direction\", but would not be quite as enthusiastic as the vice-president.\n\nOn Friday, Jerome Powell, the chair of the Federal Reserve, warned that Trump risked stoking even higher inflation and slower growth. \"It is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,\" he said. \"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.\"\n\nAs the financial markets continued to convulse on Friday, the Washington Post reported that Trump was unbowed by negative headlines, criticism from foreign leaders, and was determined to listen to a single voice to secure what he views as his political legacy. That voice was his own.\n\n\"He's at the peak of just not giving a fuck any more,\" a White House official with knowledge of Trump's thinking told the newspaper. \"Bad news stories? Doesn't give a fuck. He's going to do what he's going to do. He's going to do what he promised to do on the campaign trail.\"\n\nBut even some former Trump economic officials privately expressed doubts that returning the US to an era of manufacturing self-sufficiency was probably impossible.\n\nThe author Michael Wolff, who has published four books about Trump in power, says the US president will now be keenly gauging how his interruption to global trade norms is going down, with updates and live-action replays provided by aides. Trump, Wolff says, is probably caught between two opposing instincts.\n\n\"It's great for him - he's dominating the news once again. Nobody is talking about anything else except tariffs. Suddenly, tariffs, an arcane piece of trade policy, are the most dramatic thing in the world that he's imbued with reality-show stuff. He'll be really pleased with that.\"\n\nBut on the other hand, Wolff predicts, Trump will be watching the financial markets. \"He'll have the business guys calling up saying: what the fuck are you doing? I'm sure he hasn't come to any conclusion. So on the one hand it's great - he's the world's leading guy again. On the other, it might collapse in on him.\"\n\nAnd that, he adds, is the essence of Trump. \"He's fundamentally self-destructive, but that self-destructive impulse is exactly what keeps him at the forefront of the news.\"\n\nBack in Vietnam, Trump's image as a successful businessman chimed with many in the country, where entrepreneurship is prized. Several of his books have been translated into Vietnamese, including The Art of the Deal . During his first term, many Vietnamese also welcomed his tough stance on China, and polling suggests Vietnam was one of the few countries where most of the population was confident in his leadership.\n\n\"I view him all the time on TV,\" said Dieu, who adds that she also likes him. Will her mind change after his tariff announcement? There's a pause. \"It's hard to say.\"\n\nAdditional reporting by Nguyen Thanh Hue in Ho Chi Minh City\n\nThis is the archive of The Observer up until 21/04/2025.

      "text": "More than 80 ex-staffers of top law firm express 'deep outrage' over Trump deal\n\nFormer Skadden, Arps, Meagher & Flom employees say firm has 'caved' to the administration's 'bullying' in letter\n\nMore than 80 former employees of Skadden, Arps, Meagher & Flom sent a letter to the law firm on Friday expressing \"deep outrage\" over its decision to reach an agreement with Donald Trump in order to avoid an executive order punishing the firm.\n\nSkadden, a top-ranked law firm, reached an agreement, announced on 28 March, to commit at least $100m in pro-bono services to causes both the firm and the president support, including assisting veterans, law enforcement, local government officials and combatting antisemitism. The agreement also says Skadden won't engage in race-based hiring.\n\nIn exchange, Skadden will avoid being the subject of one of Trump's executive orders punishing law firms. The president has issued orders targeting several firms, threatening to cripple them by revoking security clearances, barring attorneys from access to government buildings, and forcing clients to disclose their relationship to the firm if they do business with the government.\n\nExperts see Trump's efforts to intimidate lawyers from taking on cases adverse to the president's interests as deeply anti-democratic, and employees and former employees of many of the firms targeted by the president have pushed back.\n\n\"As attorneys, we all took an oath to uphold the Constitution of the United States,\" the letter from former Skadden employees said. \"As one of the country's most powerful and most profitable law firms, Skadden's influence over the legal profession cannot be understated. In light of Skadden's position, it is outrageous and self-interested that rather than fulfilling the legal profession's oath and standing in solidarity with fellow law firms that were fighting to uphold the Constitution, Skadden caved to bullying tactics instead.\"\n\nMany of the country's biggest and most profitable firms have stayed largely silent on the executive orders. The firms, which include places like Kirkland & Ellis, Latham & Watkins, and Cravath, Swaine & Moore - notably did not join more than 500 US law firms that signed onto an amicus brief on Friday in support of a challenge to the order.\n\n\"Those Orders pose a grave threat to our system of constitutional governance and to the rule of law itself. The judiciary should act with resolve - now - to ensure that this abuse of executive power ceases,\" said the brief , which was authored and signed by Donald Verrilli Jr, who served as the solicitor general under Barack Obama.\n\nSkadden reached the preemptive agreement after Perkins Coie, another firm targeted by Trump, successfully got a court to issue an injunction blocking most parts of the order. Skadden's agreement was also announced the same day two other prominent firms, Jenner & Block and WilmerHale, sued over executive orders targeting them. Both firms were also able to secure court orders blocking most of the provisions in Trump's orders against them.\n\nSome lawyers at major law firms have been so angry over the position their employers have taken that they have quit.\n\n\"I believe, as I know many of you do, that what the current presidential administration is doing is wrong,\" Thomas Sipp, a Skadden associate, who quit this week wrote in a departure email . \"That we are sliding into an autocracy where those in power are above the rule of law. Skadden's agreement with the Trump administration sent our country deeper down this descent.\"\n\nLaw students and attorneys are also closely monitoring which firms are heeding Trump. A spreadsheet circulating online lists more than a dozen firms who have taken action to accommodate the administration in some way, even if they haven't been targeted.\n\nOne first-year law student at one of the country's top law schools told the Guardian on Thursday that he was tracking how firms were responding and it was influencing where they were applying for a job.\n\nSign up to This Week in Trumpland\n\nA deep dive into the policies, controversies and oddities surrounding the Trump administration\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nSkadden's capitulation, the alumni wrote in their letter, had only paved the way for Trump to further bully other firms into settling. Two other firms, Wilkie, Farr, and Gallgher and Milbank LLP have also reached preemptive deals with Trump.\n\n\"We were shocked to hear about Skadden's concessions, concessions given under the threat of an executive order whose substance had already been blocked by a federal court,\" the letter said. \"The deals Willkie Farr and Milbank struck with President Trump this week evinces the deeply disturbing behavior that Skadden helped normalize.\"\n\nThe agreement also takes aim at the firm's prestigious Skadden fellowship, in which 25 to 30 lawyers a year from the nation's top law schools work on social justice issues. Under the agreement with Trump, lawyers in the fellowship have to \"represent a wide range of political views, including conservative ideals\". At least five lawyers from the fellowship have to be assigned to \"assisting Veterans; ensuring fairness in our Justice System; combatting Antisemitism, and other similar types of projects\".\n\n\"As alumni who have proudly represented Skadden in a variety of practice areas, we call on you to clearly affirm the firm's commitment to reject the administration's attacks on the judiciary, the Constitution, and rule of law before it's too late,\" the letter said."

      "text": "The Trump Administration Has Launched A War On Kids\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost National Desk\n\nPresident Donald Trump loves to boast about protecting America's children. But when you strip away his party's \"pro-life\" rhetoric and ignore the carefully crafted family photos of Elon Musk or JD Vance, you see an administration that has declared war on wide swaths of American children.\n\nDuring Trump's speech to a joint session of Congress in February, the president introduced a boy named DJ Daniel, who was diagnosed with brain cancer in 2018. The 13-year-old wore a law enforcement uniform because \"he has always dreamed of becoming a police officer,\" Trump explained. DJ and his father sat in the gallery overlooking the House chamber filled with some of the most powerful people in the world.\n\nThe president invited DJ so he could spotlight his administration's goal to curb child cancer rates. \"Since 1975, rates of child cancer have increased by more than 40%,\" Trump said while highlighting DJ's story. \"Reversing this trend is one of the top priorities for our new presidential commission to Make America Healthy Again.\"\n\nIn reality, however, the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which Trump created to slash government spending, wants to cut about $4 billion in funding that goes toward cancer research, including research for childhood cancers . Trump is trying to dismantle efforts to develop cures for the very type of pediatric cancer DJ has experienced. DJ's doctors, who have kept him alive for the last seven years, are now facing potentially devastating federal funding cuts .\n\nSince Trump took office, this pattern has repeated again and again. The promise to safeguard kids has become a main pillar of Trump's second term, with the administration insisting that \"President Trump will always protect American children.\"\n\n\"President Trump was resoundingly elected by millions of parents that trusted him with the safety and prosperity of the their children, something the previous president neglected with open borders, radical DEI policies, and an economy that held back families,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields told HuffPost. \"In less than 70 days, President Trump has made good on his promises to put America First and protect America's children.\"\n\nYet, proposed funding cuts would take away free school lunches for millions of kids and could make it harder for foster children to be placed in stable, permanent homes. The 20-plus state abortion bans that have gone into effect since the fall of Roe v. Wade - one of Trump's favorite policy rollbacks to take credit for - have forced children to give birth to children .\n\nTrump has also signed a slew of executive orders that target kids - perhaps most notably, one that would abolish the Education Department , cutting crucial infrastructure that supports millions of public school students nationwide.\n\nProtecting kids from cultural bogeymen is another key Trump theme, whether it's measures to shield children from the imagined perils of \" transgender ideology \" or the alleged \" murderers, human traffickers, gang members \" crossing over the southern border. His actions in this realm convey no meaningful benefit, since the dangers he describes are greatly exaggerated or outrightly imagined - but his administration has visited tremendous harm on children from marginalized groups.\n\nThe president signed an executive order banning transgender athletes in sports, including in elementary schools, ostensibly to keep girls safe. But the ban is likely to put both transgender and cisgender kids under a microscope, and could encourage practices like gynecological exams to determine a child's sex.\n\nTrump's pledge to crack down on immigration is also hurting kids: An executive order targeting birthright citizenship threatens certain children born in the U.S., and a rollback of a crucial policy is discouraging kids from attending school .\n\nFamilies across the United States are starting to feel the pressure of Trump's brazen attacks on some of the country's most vulnerable residents: kids.\n\nMonica and her husband are living in the United States because of its promise of freedom - and because they couldn't stay in Venezuela. \"We were at risk of being killed,\" she told HuffPost recently, through a translator.\n\nThe couple were critical of Nicolás Maduro's regime, and in 2019, they were no longer safe. So they fled to the United States, pursuing asylum and making a new life. Six years later, a miracle. Monica was pregnant.\n\n\"There's always happiness each time you wake up in the morning, because you can physically see that the baby is growing,\" said Monica, who is being identified by a pseudonym due to her ongoing asylum case. \"I don't think anything can make a mother happier than seeing each morning how your baby grows.\"\n\nThen Trump took office. Among his first actions: signing an order to end birthright citizenship, the constitutional right that any baby born in the United States is an American citizen, except in rare cases such as the children of diplomats. \"We're the only country in the world that does this,\" Trump declared as he signed the order. In reality, the vast majority of countries in North and South America have birthright citizenship.\n\n\"I could not believe it,\" Monica said. \"I've always seen this as a fundamental, constitutional right that protects children. ... We want our child to be born into liberty.\"\n\nMonica was a medical doctor in Venezuela and knew how stress could affect her pregnancy. Yet, in the first days of Trump's term, she landed in the hospital due to a medical emergency that her doctor attributed to stress. She has since recovered.\n\n\"The first trimester was really, really hard on me,\" Monica said.\n\nIt's hard to comprehend the threat Trump poses to her child. Venezuela does not have a consulate in the United States. And as an asylum-seeker in the United States, Monica cannot leave the country. If Trump's order is upheld, then, it will not only rewrite centuries of American legal precedent , it might also render Monica's child - and an untold number of other children who may be born in the U.S. - stateless.\n\n\"He would have no nationality,\" she said.\n\nTrump has placed hundreds of thousands of children at risk of becoming part of what some call a \"permanent underclass.\" In 2022, \"there were approximately 255,000 births of citizen children to non-citizen mothers without lawful status (undocumented) and approximately 153,000 births to two undocumented parents,\" one group of Democratic attorneys general noted .\n\nFor an administration that calls itself pro-child and pro-family, \"it's sometimes hard for me to see some of the humanity in these policies,\" Monica said. \"It's so terrifying that people would be against families.\"\n\nAs a member of the Asylum Seeker Advocacy Project , an advocacy group for nearly 700,000 members seeking asylum in the United States, Monica became a plaintiff in a lawsuit against the administration. On Feb. 5, the federal judge in that case paused Trump's order , as have other judges .\n\nMonica was relieved for the moms with imminent due dates who were protected by the order. But she and so many others are still at risk.\n\n\"I know there are millions of moms that are so scared, and that have the same fear that I do,\" she said. \"It gives me strength to know that we as immigrants have these rights because the U.S. Constitution protects our babies - not us, but them.\"\n\nEach year, the Department of Education spends billions of dollars educating and protecting the 7.5 million children with disabilities who make up 15% of public school students in the U.S.\n\nThis money goes toward the myriad of things that can help a child with disabilities succeed at school, including paying special education teachers and providing resources like interpreting services and physical therapy.\n\nBut the Education Department has been at the top of Trump's chopping block since his campaign. He has spoken frequently about dismantling the department entirely, which Education Secretary Linda McMahon has supported . Last month, he signed an executive order expressing his intent to completely do away with the department. Doing so would require an act of Congress - but in the meantime, the department has announced sweeping layoffs that affect nearly half of employees.\n\nAdvocates worry that kids with disabilities will bear the brunt of these cuts. Even if the programs that are required by law continue to operate, education experts are concerned there won't be enough staff to effectively run special education programs.\n\nIn 1975, Congress passed the Education of All Handicapped Children Act, which was renamed the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act in 1990. It mandates that children with disabilities should be able to access a free and equal education. Prior to the landmark law, treatment of and services available to disabled children were left up to states - and about 1.8 million disabled children weren't educated at all.\n\n\"You had some states that embraced students with disabilities and some states who said, 'It's not our problem,'\" said Robyn Linscott, the director of education and family policy at the Arc, a nonprofit that protects the rights of people with disabilities.\n\nUnder IDEA, public schools must have individualized education plans, which lay out the specific needs of a student and what they require to succeed. The law also ensures that children with disabilities aren't segregated from their nondisabled peers, as well as makes sure that they aren't unfairly disciplined. The Department of Education spent $15 billion on students with disabilities last year.\n\nBut many of the gains made for students with disabilities could be lost if the Trump administration has its way.\n\nProject 2025, the Heritage Foundation-backed blueprint for a second Trump term, calls for doling out IDEA funding to states as \"no strings attached\" block grants, meaning those states would have flexibility in how to spend the money on students with disabilities and would no longer be subject to federal oversight. Without federal government mandates, education access for disabled children could, once again, be dependent on ZIP code.\n\nThis could happen even as the Trump administration makes it harder for disabled students and their families to file complaints about rights violations through the Office for Civil Rights. Even with the implementation of IDEA, students with disabilities still face more discrimination at school than able-bodied kids and are suspended at higher rates than their peers .\n\nThe Department of Education abruptly paused investigations of about 12,000 complaints that were pending at the OCR when Trump's second term began, according to ProPublica . More than half of those complaints were from children with disabilities who alleged they received unequal treatment in their classrooms.\n\nThe department's layoffs have hit the OCR hard, and its 12 regional offices have been cut down to five.\n\nThe administration has indicated that IDEA oversight could be moved to the Department of Health and Human Services, where it was administered prior to the creation of the Department of Education. McMahon brought up the idea during her confirmation hearing, and after signing the executive order to dismantle the department, Trump told reporters that he planned to \"immediately\" move \"special needs\" programs under HHS. (He also said student loans would move to the Small Business Administration.)\n\n\"Pell Grants, Title 1, funding resources for children with disabilities and special needs will be preserved, fully preserved,\" Trump said.\n\nBut advocates are worried that moving special education programs under HHS would mean losing institutional knowledge and crucial expertise.\n\n\"It undermines all of the gains made in the last 50 years,\" Linscott said.\n\nHHS has not been immune from the significant job cuts across the federal government either, and the agency recently announced it would cut about 20,000 employees. Even before it was clear how deep the HHS cuts would be, Linscott said she was worried that students with disabilities may fall through the cracks at an already understaffed agency.\n\n\"They have to administer Medicaid, Medicare, the National Institute of Health, the Centers for Disease Control. ... Would special education become an afterthought?\" Linscott said.\n\nEven before the major Education Department layoffs, the Trump administration was already making cuts at the agency. DOGE cut millions of dollars' worth of contracts for research programs. Such research allows educators to understand best practices for positive educational outcomes such as which teaching method can help children learn how to read or problem-solve.\n\nMany of the canceled contracts were close to being completed, meaning the federal government had already spent the money - but will have nothing to show in return.\n\n\" This is the equivalent of setting money on fire,\" Antoinette Flores, the director of higher education accountability and quality at New America, a nonpartisan policy organization, told HuffPost. \"How can you help students improve without knowing what's working?\"\n\nOne of the canceled contracts was for a program that helps children with disabilities make the transition from high school to college , Chalkbeat reported . One parent told Chalkbeat the cancellation was causing \"heartbreak\" for her family. As a result, schools were also stuck trying to reassign teachers to other jobs in the district whose salaries were covered by the program.\n\nThe Department of Education did not respond to a HuffPost request for comment about the changes it's making.\n\nRepublicans envision replacing the Education Department with a school voucher program, which would mean giving public money to families to send their children to private schools of their choosing.\n\nIn particular, Project 2025 lays out a plan for an increase in private school vouchers for disabled children, even though private schools aren't required to have individualized plans or abide by federal rules regarding protecting disabled students from unfair punishment.\n\nEducation advocates are worried that sweeping cuts at the Department of Education and Trump's plan to \"send education back to the states\" could undo progress made on equal access to education for kids with disabilities.\n\n\"It harkens back to 50 years ago when students with disabilities were educated in separate institutions - if at all,\" Linscott said.\n\nAfter several local apartment complexes were raided by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials in February, Alex Marrero, the superintendent of Denver Public Schools, went to some schools to see how the students were doing.\n\n\"Is that one of them?\" Marrero says a student asked in Spanish when he entered the classroom dressed in a suit and tie. The child had just seen immigration officials banging on apartment doors demanding people come out of hiding, and he was afraid more had come to the school.\n\nBefore Trump returned to power, most people wouldn't be worried that an ICE official may be conducting operations at a public school. For years, including during Trump's first term, ICE and Border Patrol agents were barred from entering \"sensitive areas\" including churches, hospitals and schools. But in its zeal to make good on the campaign promise to deport millions of people, the Trump administration rescinded the rule - and now the approximately 600,000 undocumented children who attend school in the U.S. are technically fair game.\n\nThe fear that ICE officials will do sweeping raids at schools has not yet been realized - but the possibility is causing dread and panic among immigrant families, and some kids are missing out on an education because of it. Schools across the country reported a drop in attendance after the guidance about sensitive zones was rolled back .\n\n\"A school that was well over 90% on a daily basis is in the 80s now, and that's not by chance,\" Marrero told HuffPost. \"My principals are already asking me to be cognizant and lenient on attendance goals for this year.\"\n\n\"I think the removal of the rule was to initiate fear,\" Marrero added, \"and I think they've been successful.\" (DPS has filed a lawsuit against the Trump administration, demanding the sensitive location rule be reinstated. A federal judge in February blocked ICE from operating in certain places of worship after being sued by a group of largely Quaker religious organizations.)\n\nICE did not respond to HuffPost's request for comment.\n\nThe fear of what Trump is threatening is likely to have adverse effects on children. Increasing anxiety surrounding immigration law can lead to poor educational outcomes in students who come from immigrant families. And a study looking at the impact of a strict anti-immigrant law in Arizona found that some children were so worried about being targeted by ICE that they were afraid to leave their houses at all .\n\n\"This is supposed to be a safe haven, but I don't know if it is anymore.\"\n\nIn February, Border Patrol agents reportedly boarded a bus carrying students on a high school swim team in Las Cruces, New Mexico. They allegedly questioned the driver, who did not speak English, and then attempted to question students. The school district later released a statement saying the students were on an unmarked charter bus and administrators were working with federal officials to prevent similar incidents from happening in the future.\n\nJust weeks earlier, Mike Banks, the head of U.S. Border Patrol, said during a Fox News interview that it was \"absurd\" to think agents would board school buses. He was responding to a school district in Texas that had sent home a letter warning parents that Border Patrol officials could board buses taking students to after-school activities.\n\nUndocumented children are guaranteed the right to attend public school thanks to the 1982 Supreme Court case Plyler v. Doe. But Republicans, emboldened by Trump's pledge to deport 12 million people, seem to be trying to get the current conservative-majority court to reconsider the issue.\n\nSeveral states, including Texas, Oklahoma and Tennessee, have introduced bills that would block undocumented kids from attending school. The Heritage Foundation wrote last year that states should pass such laws to trigger a lawsuit that could make its way to the Supreme Court.\n\nWhat was once a place of safety is turning into yet another source of concern, fear and anxiety for undocumented children.\n\nMarrero said that, on the day of the Denver raids, two students who got to school early said their mother had told them to run there - implying that they would be OK once they were at school. Marrero reluctantly thought to himself, \"This is supposed to be a safe haven, but I don't know if it is anymore.\"\n\nLess than two weeks into his second term, Trump signed an executive order threatening to halt federal funding for schools that provide instruction on \"gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology\" - vague phrases that advocates say could lead to any discussion about race or LGBTQ+ topics being cut from classrooms across the country.\n\nFederal funding can buoy programs that assist all kinds of students, including those who are low-income. Many states rely heavily on federal funds, and losing this financial support could have disastrous consequences for K-12 students.\n\nThe order also directed Attorney General Pam Bondi to work with state law enforcement to investigate K-12 teachers and school officials who \"violate the law\" by \"facilitating the social transition of a minor.\" This directive came after months of Trump pushing baseless lies about kids undergoing surgery during the school day without parental consent.\n\nIn reality, social transition - where a person begins to publicly express their gender identity through a change in name, pronouns, hairstyle or clothing - is often the first step for a trans kid who may consider medical transition later in adolescence. A supportive environment while kids socially transition can be critical to alleviating feelings of dysphoria as well as isolation and depression. Trans youth who were affirmed by peers and adults with the use of their accurate name and pronouns reported a significant drop in symptoms of severe depression, a 2018 study found. But more often than not, trans and nonbinary youth do not have welcoming school or home environments. They experience higher levels of school bullying and violence, and are more likely to have unstable housing due to unsupportive families, when compared with cisgender students.\n\nNow Trump's order on education could make learning environments more hostile to trans and gender-nonconforming students, as well as educators who openly support them. Parents fear the order - which builds on the yearslong attack by Republican state lawmakers who have advanced bills to muzzle any instruction on LGBTQ+ topics and promoted harmful rhetoric likening teachers with trans-inclusive materials to \"groomers\"- will have a chilling effect on trans and nonbinary students.\n\nBrigit Stevens said the current administration's targeting of trans youth, coupled with attacks in her state, have already made Iowa \"less livable\" for her nonbinary and gender-fluid teen.\n\nStevens said that when her child, Berry, now 14, came out in sixth grade, her family was \"fully on board\" and their school quickly updated Berry's school records to reflect their change in name and pronouns. But over the next three years, Berry's classmates began to bully them, intentionally misgendering them and using their deadname. When Stevens went to the principal, she was taken aback when she was told that \"there's two sides\" and a limit to the ways a teacher could intervene as there were \"parents on both sides of this issue.\"\n\n\"This isn't actually an issue where there are sides,\" Stevens recalled saying. \"What this is, is my kiddo's name and pronouns and we expect them to be respected.\"\n\nParents and teachers alike fear that these instances are going to become more common - and that the Trump administration will stifle any recourse. The massive cuts at the Education Department's Office for Civil Rights have left fewer avenues for families of LGBTQ+ youth and youth of color to file Title IX complaints around instances of sex- and race-based discrimination.\n\nSkye Tooley, a public school teacher in Los Angeles, has witnessed firsthand some of the challenges of being a trans person in education. Tooley, who is trans and nonbinary, said that in the past parents have complained and removed students from their classroom because they didn't like Tooley's identity. Other times, Tooley said, school administrators have misgendered or deadnamed them even with multiple reminders.\n\nTooley believes school districts should take a greater stand to show support for trans youth these days. In the meantime, Tooley said they refuse to hide their identity in the classroom.\n\n\"Every year I 'come out' and tell families and students who I am,\" Tooley said. \"My presence itself is teaching LGBTQ+ existence.\"\n\nTrans athletes have perhaps been the biggest target of Trump's anti-trans campaign. During his joint address to Congress, Trump welcomed a former high school volleyball player who claimed she had been severely injured by a trans player, even though it is unclear if the player who spiked a ball toward her was trans.\n\nIn early February, Trump signed an executive order threatening to withhold funding from schools that allow trans athletes to play on women's teams or use women's locker rooms, stating that these actions amount to Title IX violations.\n\nSoon after, the Department of Education began investigating several school districts that had signaled they would continue allowing trans athletes to participate. And after Maine's governor told the president that the state would follow its own law prohibiting discrimination based on gender identity - thereby defying Trump's executive order - six federal agencies targeted the state. Just two trans high school girls are playing on girls sports teams in the state this year.\n\nTrump has repeatedly claimed that the existence of trans athletes poses a major threat to girls and women who play sports. But there are only a handful of openly trans athletes in the entire country. The NCAA president estimates there are fewer than 10 trans athletes competing at the collegiate level, and the American Civil Liberties Union estimates there are about five trans girls playing on K-12 girls teams.\n\nLGBTQ+ advocates and some Democrats have cautioned that Trump's ban on trans athletes could hurt all kids, as it could open the door to greater policing of gender in any kind of sex-segregated activity or space for children. Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) warned that Trump's order and a similar bill in Congress targeting trans athletes' participation in sports could lead to \"gender and genital examinations into little girls.\"\n\nSara, the mother of a 16-year-old trans soccer player in New Hampshire, is keenly aware that her daughter could become a target. Her daughter is just like every other teenage girl: She has Sabrina Carpenter-style curtain bangs, loves dancing and goofing around with her teammates, and wears sparkly dresses to school dances. She has a supportive team, and when she's running around on the field, it's hard to pick her out of the crowd.\n\nEven before Trump was reelected, Sara said, there were moments when her daughter was singled out, often during away games. Sara remembers one game where opponents painted \"PGS\" on their faces to connote \"protect girls sports.\" At another, some rowdy parents wore wristbands with XX on them to signal female chromosomes and caused a scene until they were asked to leave.\n\nInstances like these have become far too common, and the vitriol against trans girls has translated into backlash against cis girls and other athletes who are gender-nonconforming. In 2022, a Utah high school athletics organization secretly investigated a female athlete after receiving complaints from parents, and in 2023 a parent harassed a 9-year-old girl at a track meet demanding she prove her gender.\n\nBefore Trump's second term began, Jill Bjorklund, the mother of a 9-year-old trans girl, was considering moving her family out of Iowa. The state, once a Midwestern bastion for gay rights, passed a law two years ago banning gender-affirming care for minors and barring trans students from using bathrooms or locker rooms that correspond with their gender identity. Earlier this year, Iowa became the first state to remove gender identity from its civil rights code.\n\nBjorklund's family has been traveling to Minnesota to establish a relationship at a gender clinic, as their daughter may soon be eligible for treatments like puberty blockers.\n\nBjorklund said it makes her \"physically ill\" to consider moving to a different state where gender-affirming care for minors is currently legal - especially since uprooting their lives and moving to an entirely different state may not guarantee their daughter will be able to access care.\n\nIn January, Trump signed an executive order that threatened to withhold federal funding from hospitals that provide puberty blockers, hormone therapy and surgeries for people under 19. (Gender-affirming surgeries for minors are exceedingly rare.) Some hospitals in New York, Colorado, Massachusetts and California began to halt care for new and established patients .\n\nTwo federal judges temporarily blocked this order from going into effect - and some hospitals have resumed care for new and established pediatric patients. But the future of access to this care remains in limbo. The Supreme Court is expected to deliver a decision this summer on whether a Tennessee ban on gender-affirming care for youth violates the Constitution, and advocates say the decision will not only impact trans youth but also provide legal clarity on the future of bodily autonomy.\n\nBjorklund's family decided to legally change their daughter's name ahead of the 2024 election, as well as secure her a new passport and Social Security card. Their decision was a good one. On his first day back in the White House, Trump signed an executive order declaring there were only \"two sexes, male and female,\" which swiftly prompted the State Department and the Social Security Administration to bar trans and nonbinary people from updating their federal documents.\n\n\"When you put everything together,\" Bjorklund said, referencing Trump's orders threatening trans kids' ability to access health care, play sports, use restrooms and live openly, \"it really is closing in on our children.\""

      "text": "Trump Is Issuing A Flurry Of Executive Orders, Not Laws - Here's How They Differ\n\nSenior Lifestyle Reporter, HuffPost\n\nOutside of two Big Macs and a couple of Filet-O-Fish, there may be nothing President Donald Trump loves more than signing an executive order.\n\nIn his first 100 days in office, Trump issued a record 100 executive orders on everything from defining gender to ending birthright citizenship and instituting sweeping tariffs.\n\nIn his first term as president, Trump signed a total of 220 executive orders, though some of them were revoked by his successor, Joe Biden . (Naturally, Trump returned the favor when he was back in office, rescinding over a dozen Biden-era executive orders, including one that had raised the minimum wage for federal workers. )\n\nHas there ever been a president more executive order-happy? We asked Andrew Rudalevige , a professor of government at Bowdoin College and senior fellow at the Miller Center at the University of Virginia.\n\n\"Trump's 2025 executive order count will wind up being very high by recent standards. Previously, Franklin D. Roosevelt had the record for most executive orders ― 99 ― in his first hundred days,\" Rudalevige said.\n\nHistorically, a lot of executive orders are focused on pretty mundane or logistical affairs: notices that government agencies will observe a holiday on a certain calendar day, for instance, or an executive order banning smoking in federal buildings. (President Bill Clinton signed that one in 1997 .)\n\nBut they also can have major consequences for everyday Americans; as the ACLU notes , some of the federal government's worst actions have come via executive order. FDR, for example, used an executive order to force the relocation and internment of Japanese Americans to concentration camps during World War II.\n\nEvery single president from George Washington onward has issued executive orders, but their use has actually gone down in recent presidencies, according to Rudalevige.\n\n\"That's partly because there are other means of unilateralism a president can use now, but also partly because things that used to require executive orders like land transfers or civil service matters are now delegated elsewhere,\" he said.\n\nClearly, Trump is still very much in his \"issue-as-many-executive-orders-as-possible\" era, though. (As Rudalevige put it, \"President Trump loves signing executive orders because he loves ordering.\")\n\nAnd those who've been impacted by Trump's flurry of EOs ― the thousands of federal employees let go from their jobs , immigrants separated from their families and sent to detention centers ― know these orders can have serious impact, endangering people's lives and livelihoods.\n\nBut there's still a lot of confusion about executive orders ― and rightly so. What is an executive order, and how do they differ from a law? When is a president actually able to carry out policy plans outlined in executive orders? Can an order be stopped, and if so, by whom?\n\nWe asked legal and government experts like Rudalevige to answer all these questions and more.\n\nArticle II of the Constitution vests the president with executive power over all executive branch officials, aka the president gets to tell officials in departments like the Treasury and Defense and in regulatory agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency and the Food and Drug Administration how to do their jobs. (Or not do their jobs, in the case of the federal workers who've been impacted by DOGE cuts.)\n\nThe Constitution says that the president has an obligation to ensure that the laws are \"faithfully executed.\" To that end, an executive order (EO) is a written directive, signed by the president (in Trump's case, in big Sharpie pen script), instructing government officials on how to implement or enforce statutory law. While the president cannot write a new statute with an EO, he can tell federal agencies how to implement an existing statute.\n\nBut here's the thing: An executive order is only valid if it draws on authority granted to the president by the Constitution or by a law, Rudalevige explained.\n\n\"Now, there are plenty of laws on the books, and presidents have made a habit of scouring old laws in hopes they can give them new meaning,\" he told HuffPost.\n\nThe Trump administration is pretty loosey-goosey with its interpretation of the law and finding new meaning. \"When President Trump decrees a certain scientific definition of gender or interpretation of the Civil Rights Act, that is simply his interpretation - it's not binding on the courts, who ultimately decide the meaning of the laws in question,\" Rudalevige said.\n\nWhen an executive order doesn't have legal basis either in laws or in the Constitution, that's when it gets challenged in the courts: A number of federal judges have slowed Trump's sweeping agenda , at least for now: For example, last month, a judge in California ordered the rehiring of thousands of federal workers let go in mass firings across several agencies. (The Trump administration is currently fighting back, asking the Supreme Court to halt the judge's order.)\n\n\"An executive order cannot override state law, unless a federal court ultimately finds the president's interpretation to be correct and the state's to be wrong,\" Rudalevige said.\n\nExecutive orders are laws but only with respect to the executive branch, said Jodi Short, a professor who teaches constitutional law at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco. They are an internal form of law, she explained, and do not bind private parties outside the government.\n\n\"This can be confusing for the general public, because EOs often have significant consequences for the general public,\" she said. \"If an EO tells an agency to change the way it is implementing statutory law, that change might be felt by members of the public who deal with that agency.\"\n\nFor instance, last month Trump called for Secretary of Education Linda McMahon to cut staff and move forward with an executive order to dismantle the Education Department and send \"education back to the states.\"\n\nCongress would need to act to fully eliminate the critical agency, but Trump is still able to stop many of the agency's key functions, and many parents and students are already feeling the ripple effect of that: Parents of kids with disabilities ― there's 7.5 million such students in the U.S. ― have been especially vocal about Trump's plans to do away with the Department of Education because their kids rely on an Individualized Education Program (IEP) to succeed in schools.\n\nAs we mentioned, federal courts can review executive orders and overturn them if deemed unconstitutional. Congress can also overturn an EO. And as we saw with Biden after Trump's first term, any future president can issue a new executive order that rescinds or amends a previous executive order.\n\nAn administration can achieve policy change relatively quickly with an EO as the Trump White House has, but major, lasting change requires action by Congress.\n\nAnd at least in principle, the executive branch itself can be a check on legally questionable executive orders, Rudalevige said: Since the 1930s, there's been a presidential practice, currently codified in a 1962 executive order by President John F. Kennedy ( EO 11030), that a draft order should be be approved by the director of the Office of Management and Budget and by the Justice Department.\n\n\"OMB has a longstanding practice of 'central clearance' that allows a sort of peer review of an EO to make sure it is workable and helps build consensus among the agencies the order impacts,\" Rudalevige said. \"DOJ checks for 'form and legality.\"\n\nUnfortunately, there's little evidence that the Trump administration is conducting either of these reviews in any systematic way, the professor said.\n\n\"It is possible that the central clearance process has prevented even more extreme EOs from seeing the light of day - that happened in Trump's first term, and frequently in presidential history,\" he said. \"But certainly the 'lawyering' for many of them seems slipshod at best.\"\n\nMany of Trump's executive orders are openly contrary to statutory law, Short said.\n\n\"They are not, and do not purport to be, reasonable interpretations consistent with statutory law,\" she explained. \"Rather, they assert that what the president says is the law. This is flat-out wrong, and it is deeply subversive of our Constitution and rule of law.\"\n\nRudalevige thinks Americans should be worried when the president \"isn't bothered by ordering things that are not within their power to order,\" like issuing de facto amendments to the Constitution, or using executive orders to punish specific political opponents (law firms, for instance).\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Trump Tariff Scheme A Great Opportunity For Even More Presidential Corruption\n\nSenior White House Correspondent, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON - In addition to hitting Americans with trillions of dollars in new taxes and cratering the stock market, Donald Trump 's arbitrary tariff regime offers yet another opportunity for a president who has already shown his willingness to use his office for personal gain, critics fear.\n\nThe new tariffs, which started taking effect Saturday, already have exemptions for specific industries, establishing the precedent for corporations or even entire countries to win carve-outs for themselves.\n\nAnd, government watchdogs and other experts worry, with Trump having long demonstrated a willingness to take official actions in return for private or political benefit, a vast new field of potential corruption has opened.\n\n\"There are concerns around additional graft and cronyism,\" said Melinda St. Louis, global trade director at Public Citizen.\n\nRajeev Goel, an Illinois State University economist, co-authored a 2023 paper finding that multilateral trade agreements help fight \"public sector corruption\" by creating transparent, level playing fields for buying and selling goods across borders.\n\n\"The current tariffs are doing the reverse of what we studied earlier,\" he said.\n\n\"If you define corruption as making side deals with the Trump administration for special exemptions, that is certain to happen on a grand scale, and may well be the intent of the tariff imposition itself,\" said Bill Megginson, a finance professor at the University of Oklahoma's business school and a co-author of a 2025 paper that studied political \"distortions\" of Trump's first-term tariffs.\n\nTrump's White House, responding to HuffPost queries about whether he would be amenable to quid-pro-quo arrangements that benefit him in exchange for exemptions from the new tariffs, said he was only interested in helping the country.\n\n\"The only people President Trump is currying favor with are the American people who have faced the devastating consequences of backward, 'America Last' trade policies that have led to millions in job losses, vulnerabilities to our national security, and a weakening of our dominance,\" White House spokesperson Harrison Fields said in a statement.\n\nTrump, though, has over the years established a history of such transactional behavior and of mixing his official duties with his personal financial interests ― actions that are the very definition of corruption . Thursday evening, for example, Trump traveled at taxpayer expense to Miami to attend a closed-door dinner for the Saudi-backed LIV golf tour - a business entity he profits from.\n\nTrump not long ago called cryptocurrencies \"a scam,\" but changed his position last summer after industry leaders began making massive donations to help get him elected. As president, Trump is creating a \"strategic\" Bitcoin reserve, giving the U.S. government's imprimatur to an \"asset\" that has zero intrinsic value. He also pardoned the creator of a website designed for the sale of drugs and other contraband after promising crypto enthusiasts he would do so if they voted for him.\n\nIn his first term, Trump pushed Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenskyy to open an investigation into his Democratic opponent, Joe Biden , using congressionally approved military aid as leverage. Had a federal official who did not have presidential immunity done the same thing, he would have been charged with extortion , former prosecutors have said.\n\nAnd unlike previous presidents who made a point of separating themselves from their private businesses and financial holdings during their time in office, Trump has done the opposite. In his first term, his party and officials in his administration made his hotel just blocks from the White House a gathering place for meetings with both foreign and domestic interest groups. Foreign delegations would book rooms and, occasionally, even large blocks of rooms during their stays.\n\nAt one point, Trump even tried to hold the G7 summit of leaders from the world's largest democratic economies at Doral, his troubled golf resort near the Miami airport.\n\nTrump began his second term with an even more flagrant use of his office for his personal gain by selling a crypto \"coin,\" a vehicle that those seeking his favor could use to enrich him without a public trace.\n\nThen, in office, among his first acts were to fire all the independent inspectors general at executive branch agencies and to order the Justice Department to suspend enforcement of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which made it illegal for Americans to bribe officials overseas.\n\n\"It's going to mean a lot more business for America,\" Trump said .\n\nPublic Citizen's Melinda St. Louis said that if Trump starts making exclusions to the tariffs based on appeals from well-connected businesses, it will be no different from what he did in the first term.\n\nThat, in fact, is the topic of the paper Megginson and his co-authors published earlier this year titled \"The Political Economy of Tariff Exemption Grants.\" It found that companies requesting waivers from tariffs in Trump's first term were twice as likely to succeed if their CEOs had donated to Republicans than if they had donated to Democrats .\n\n\"The big takeaway for us is that the U.S. institutions are not robust to an administration choosing to impose utterly complex and confusing tariffs, and then deciding to extract benefits in exchange for exemptions,\" said Veljko Fotak, a finance professor at the University of Buffalo and a paper co-author.\n\nNorm Eisen, the top ethics lawyer in Barack Obama 's White House, agreed that Trump's tariff scheme is an easy vehicle for corruption. \"By asserting these imperial whims, Trump opens himself up to unseemly influence attempts from foreign countries to try to get tariffs reversed,\" Eisen said. \"It can be as simple as buying his meme digital coin or as complicated as providing patronage or favors for his foreign or domestic properties. It is a grave corruption risk on top of many others that have hit.\"\n\nA report by Public Citizen last month pointed out that sanctioned Russian oligarch Oleg Deripaska won an exemption from Trump's aluminum tariffs not long after Trump met privately with Deripaska's friend, Russian dictator Vladimir Putin. That waiver was reversed after a public outcry.\n\nIndeed, even a Department of Commerce inspector general's report in 2019 found evidence of an \"unofficial appeals process\" for waivers and undocumented discussions between petitioners and government officials. \"We believe these issues give the perception that the Section 232 exclusion request review process is neither transparent nor objective,\" the report stated.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Trump added that Boardman \"must have lost her talent as she got older\" and posted that he preferred having no portrait in the Colorado Capitol to that one.\n\nLegislative leaders announced the next day that they would take the portrait down. It was gone from a wall of past presidents' portraits the next morning, relegated to museum storage.\n\nIn an emailed statement Saturday, Boardman denied intentionally distorting Trump.\n\nWhile Trump posted that \"many people\" from Colorado had complained about the portrait, Boardman wrote she \"got overwhelmingly positive reviews and feedback\" over the six years it hung in the Capitol.\n\nThat has changed for the worse since Trump's comments, Boardman wrote.\n\n\"President Trump is entitled to comment freely, as we all are, but the additional allegations that I 'purposefully distorted' the portrait, and that I 'must have lost my talent as I got older' are now directly and negatively impacting my business of over 41 years which now is in danger of not recovering.\"\n\nA Colorado Capitol advisory committee commissioned the portrait, approved the reference photo for the portrait and approved her work in progress, Boardman wrote.\n\n\"I completed the portrait accurately, without 'purposeful distortion,' political bias, or any attempt to caricature the subject, actual or implied. I fulfilled the task per my contract,\" Boardman wrote.\n\nShe would not be commenting further, Boardman concluded.\n\nBoardman also painted the portraits of former presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama in the state Capitol. Trump posted that Obama \"looks wonderful\" in his portrait but that his own painting - paid for with $10,000 raised by Colorado Republicans - is \"truly the worst.\"\n\nColorado Senate Minority Leader Paul Lundeen, a Republican, has said that the Trump portrait should be replaced with one \"that depicts his contemporary likeness.\" The process of commissioning a replacement has not yet begun .\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "Angry Protesters From New York To Alaska Assail Trump And Musk In 'Hands Off!' Rallies\n\nCrowds of people angry about the way President Donald Trump is running the country marched and rallied in scores of American cities Saturday in the biggest day of demonstrations yet by an opposition movement trying to regain its momentum after the shock of the Republican's first weeks in office.\n\nSo-called Hands Off! demonstrations were organized for more than 1,200 locations in all 50 states by more than 150 groups, including civil rights organizations, labor unions, LBGTQ+ advocates, veterans and elections activists. The rallies appeared peaceful, with no immediate reports of arrests.\n\nThousands of protesters in cities dotting the nation from Midtown Manhattan to Anchorage, Alaska, including at multiple state capitols, assailed Trump and billionaire Elon Musk 's actions on government downsizing, the economy, immigration and human rights. On the West Coast, in the shadow of Seattle's iconic Space Needle, protesters held signs with slogans like \"Fight the oligarchy.\" Protesters chanted as they took to the streets in Portland, Oregon, and Los Angeles, where they marched from Pershing Square to City Hall.\n\nDemonstrators voiced anger over the administration's moves to fire thousands of federal workers , close Social Security Administration field offices , effectively shutter entire agencies , deport immigrants , scale back protections for transgender people and cut funding for health programs .\n\nMusk, a Trump adviser who runs Tesla, SpaceX and the social media platform X, has played a key role in the downsizing as the head of the newly created Department of Government Efficiency. He says he is saving taxpayers billions of dollars.\n\nAsked about the protests, the White House said in a statement that \"President Trump's position is clear: he will always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. Meanwhile, the Democrats ' stance is giving Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush American seniors.\"\n\nKelley Robinson, president of the Human Rights Campaign advocacy group, criticized the administration's treatment of the LBGTQ+ community at the rally at the National Mall in Washington, D.C., where Democratic members of Congress also took the stage.\n\n\"The attacks that we're seeing, they're not just political. They are personal, y'all,\" Robinson said. \"They're trying to ban our books, they're slashing HIV prevention funding, they're criminalizing our doctors, our teachers, our families and our lives.\"\n\n\"We don't want this America, y'all,\" Robinson added. \"We want the America we deserve, where dignity, safety and freedom belong not to some of us, but to all of us.\"\n\nIn Boston, demonstrators brandished signs such as \"Hands off our democracy\" and \"Hands off our Social Security.\"\n\nMayor Michelle Wu said she does not want her children and others' to live in a world in which threats and intimidation are government tactics and values like diversity and equality are under attack.\n\n\"I refuse to accept that they could grow up in a world where immigrants like their grandma and grandpa are automatically presumed to be criminals,\" Wu said.\n\nRoger Broom, 66, a retiree from Delaware County, Ohio, was one of hundreds who rallied at the Statehouse in Columbus. He said he used to be a Reagan Republican but has been turned off by Trump.\n\n\"He's tearing this country apart,\" Broom said. \"It's just an administration of grievances.\"\n\nHundreds of people also demonstrated in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, a few miles from Trump's golf course in Jupiter, where he spent the morning at the club's Senior Club Championship. People lined both sides of PGA Drive, encouraging cars to honk and chanting slogans against Trump.\n\n\"They need to keep their hands off of our Social Security,\" said Archer Moran of Port St. Lucie, Florida.\n\n\"The list of what they need to keep their hands off of is too long,\" Moran said. \"And it's amazing how soon these protests are happening since he's taken office.\"\n\nThe president golfed in Florida Saturday and planned to do so again Sunday, the White House said.\n\nActivists have staged nationwide demonstrations against Trump and Musk multiple times since Trump returned to office . But before Saturday the opposition movement had yet to produce a mass mobilization like the Women's March in 2017 , which brought thousands of women to Washington after Trump's first inauguration, or the Black Lives Matter demonstrations that erupted in multiple cities after George Floyd's killing by police in Minneapolis in 2020.\n\nIn Charlotte, North Carolina, protesters said they were supporting a variety of causes, from Social Security and education to immigration and women's reproductive rights.\n\n\"Regardless of your party, regardless of who you voted for, what's going on today, what's happening today is abhorrent,\" said Britt Castillo, 35, of Charlotte. \"It's disgusting, and as broken as our current system might be, the way that the current administration is going about trying to fix things - it is not the way to do it. They're not listening to the people.\"\n\nAmong thousands marching through downtown San Jose, California, were Deborah and Douglas Doherty.\n\nDeborah, a graphic designer, is a veteran of the 2017 Women's March and was nervous that fewer people have turned out against Trump this time. \"All the cities need to show up,\" she said. \"Now people are kind of numb to it, which is itself frightening.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press journalists Julie Carr Smyth in Columbus, Ohio, Fatima Hussein in West Palm Beach, Florida, Erik Verduzco in Charlotte, North Carolina, Nicholas Riccardi in San Jose, California, and Mark Thiessen in Anchorage, Alaska, contributed.\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

      "text": "'Prices Are Gonna Come Up': GOP Not Loving Donald Trump's Tariff 'Liberation Day'\n\nSenior Politics Reporter, HuffPost\n\nWASHINGTON - President Donald Trump has dubbed April 2 \"Liberation Day,\" promising to unveil a new round of aggressive tariffs on Wednesday, which he claims will free the U.S. from its reliance on foreign goods and bring hundreds of billions of dollars to the government.\n\nBut many congressional Republicans aren't feeling very excited about being liberated. Like most economists, they worry about the negative effects of imposing across-the-board taxes on imports from other countries, fearing they will hike prices for their constituents and wreck the economy.\n\n\"Probably not,\" Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) said when asked if he'll be joining in Trump's celebrations. \"It's a high-risk move on his part. I don't know what his strategy is, but look at what the market's reaction is. I have a similar reaction. I'm concerned.\"\n\nOther Republicans said they weren't planning anything special for\"Liberation Day.\"\n\n\"Every day is a reason for celebration,\" Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) deadpanned.\n\nMarkets have nosedived amid uncertainty over what Trump intended to do this week. Two of the three major U.S. markets closed out their worst quarter in March since 2022, back when Trump spent a large amount of his time blaming his predecessor, former President Joe Biden, anytime there was a selloff on Wall Street.\n\nEven Sen. Tommy Tuberville (R-Ala.), a stalwart Trump ally, acknowledged that his constituents would feel pain if the president's reciprocal tariffs are levied on nearly all American trading partners around the world.\n\n\"My people back in Alabama, you know, they're all concerned about car tariffs, all those parts,\" Tuberville said. \"We have seven car manufacturers in our state, so you got parts that are coming in, it's gonna raise prices. Prices are gonna come up.\"\n\nTrump defended his approach over the weekend, saying he \" couldn't care less \" if his looming 25% tariffs raise the prices of foreign-made vehicles for Americans.\n\n\"I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars. We have plenty,\" he told NBC News.\n\nNo cars sold to American consumers are fully made in the U.S. Most vehicles are assembled with imported parts that cross the country's borders, sometimes several times, particularly across the U.S.-Canada border.\n\nRepublicans will get an opportunity to rebuke Trump over his tariffs on Canada, a longtime U.S. ally the president has threatened to annex, on Tuesday. The Senate is set to vote on a privileged legislation offered by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) that would block them from going into effect.\n\n\"President Trump's taxes on Canadian goods have sent our economy into chaos, and Americans aren't buying what he's selling,\" Kaine said in a statement ahead of the vote. \"They know they will pay the price with higher costs for everyday items, and their confidence in the economy is the lowest it has been in recent years.\"\n\nThe bill has no chance of making it to Trump's desk even if it passes in the Senate, however. The GOP-controlled House changed its rules to disallow the possibility of taking up such a challenge to the president's trade authorities in the government funding bill Congress passed last month.\n\nStill, a few Republicans could join Democrats in voting against the Canada tariffs, including Sens. Rand Paul (R-Ky.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine), and possibly others. If the measure does pass, it would mark the first time Congress has pushed back against the Trump administration's policies, even if symbolically.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

The groups have filed a number of complaints and grievances that have slowed Trump's effort to fire employees and shutter federal agencies.\n\nThe executive order Trump signed last week would strip away union rights from a huge chunk of the federal workforce, tossing out contracts at a slew of agencies in the name of \"national security.\" Trump made clear when he issued the order that he was angry federal unions are standing up to him.\n\n\"Certain Federal unions have declared war on President Trump's agenda,\" an administration \" fact sheet \" stated.\n\nEverett Kelley, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, said in a statement Friday that his union is \"not going anywhere.\" The AFGE was one of six unions that filed the lawsuit on behalf of nearly a million members they represent.\n\n\"AFGE is not going to be intimidated by a bully who is throwing a temper tantrum because our union is beating them in the court of law and in the court of public opinion,\" Kelley said.\n\nThe Trump administration was expected to try to carve certain federal workers out of collective-bargaining law, on the grounds they work primarily in intelligence, investigations or national security work, as the law allows. The proposal was even included in Project 2025, the conservative transition blueprint drawn up by the Heritage Foundation.\n\nBut the order Trump signed is so sweeping that it would exclude workers who have little, if anything, to do with national security functions, including nurses, biologists, public-land rangers and others. Among the more than a dozen agencies listed are the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Food Safety and Inspection Service.\n\nThe unions argue in their lawsuit that the exclusions are overly broad and have no basis in reality. They also note that many civilian employees, including at the Department of Defense, \"have served their country while retaining collective bargaining protections\" for decades until now.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Timothy Haugh, who headed both the National Security Agency and U.S. Cyber Command until Thursday - when he was let go without a single reason divulged to voters.\n\n\"The White House fired one of our best generals and the smartest on cyber operations, and with no explanation,\" Bacon told Fox News senior congressional correspondent Chad Pergram on Friday . \"Russia and China are laughing at us.\"\n\nChief Pentagon spokesperson Sean Parnell said in a statement Friday to CBS News that the \"Defense Department thanks General Timothy Haugh for his decades of service\" and that the DoD wishes \"him and his family well\" - providing no further detail about his exit.\n\nSeveral senior members of the National Security Council were also fired .\n\nHaugh and NSA deputy Wendy Noble were both ousted after Trump met with far-right activist Laura Loomer on Wednesday, The Washington Post reported . Loomer, who has frequently shared QAnon conspiracy theories and is one of Trump's staunchest social media supporters, told the Post she had advocated for the firings.\n\nLoomer elaborated on the matter Friday on X, formerly Twitter, arguing that Haugh and Noble \"have been disloyal to President Trump\" and \"that is why they have been fired.\"\n\nShe also slammed retired Gen. Mark Milley , who called Trump \"a total fascist\" in October.\n\n\"As a Biden appointee, General Haugh had no place serving in the Trump admin given the fact that he was HAND PICKED by General Milley, who was accused of committing treason by President Trump,\" she wrote.\n\n\"Given the fact that the NSA is arguably the most powerful intel agency in the world, we cannot allow for a Biden nominee to hold that position,\" she added. \"Thus, Haugh was fired today, along with his Obama loving protege, Wendy Noble. This is called VETTING.\"\n\nLoomer gave Trump a list of supposedly disloyal officials during their closed-door meeting Wednesday, and successfully called for them to be fired despite national security adviser Michael Waltz reportedly pushing back, The New York Times reported Thursday .\n\nThe report was based on interviews with eight people with knowledge of the events.\n\nBacon, who previously criticized Trump for berating Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy during their televised meeting in February and called Trump's stance on Russia \"too conciliatory,\" shared an additional statement on Haugh's exit Friday on X.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Trump Might Get Unfettered Surveillance Powers. How Did We Get Here?\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nFor a decade, Congress has failed to rein in the surveillance state. Now Trump is promising to use the government against his foes.\n\nIf Donald Trump wins on Tuesday, he will regain the keys to a global surveillance apparatus with few limits.\n\nPrivacy advocates have warned since Edward Snowden's revelations in 2013 that the government's surveillance tools could be misused by presidents of any stripe. In the intervening decade, however, Congress has failed to rein in those powers.\n\nNow, Trump is preparing to retake office with a plan that includes deploying the military on domestic enemies . He would have at his disposal a program that compels American companies to cooperate with the National Security Agency, rules for \"foreign\" surveillance that changed at the stroke of a pen, and data peddlers who sell location information to the government .\n\n\"The only thing that really stands between a president misusing all of these authorities and not are the individuals who work in these agencies, who have sets of rules and standards that they follow,\" said Cindy Cohn, executive director of the Electronic Frontier Foundation. \"But one of the things we have seen, on the side of President Trump, is that is something he is trying to eliminate.\"\n\nTrump spoke out loudly this spring against the reauthorization of a key spying law, the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.\n\n\"KILL FISA, IT WAS ILLEGALLY USED AGAINST ME, AND MANY OTHERS. THEY SPIED ON MY CAMPAIGN!!!\" Trump said on social media.\n\nTrump was right that the law was used, by FBI agents who lied to a court to obtain warrants, to spy on his campaign. The debate raging in Congress when Trump sent out his message, however, centered on another part of the law that allows warrantless surveillance.\n\nUltimately, some Trump-aligned Republicans in Congress warmed up to the surveillance bill thanks to concessions that included a two-year \"sunset\" allowing Trump the chance to help rewrite the bill if he wins .\n\nStill on the books: a section of the law that allows \"backdoor\" searches of Americans' phone calls, emails, and text messages collected without a warrant because the government was ostensibly trying to collect foreign intelligence. The FBI alone conducted 200,000 such searches in 2022.\n\nAfter the Snowden revelations, advocates fought hard to pry open a window into warrantless surveillance. The view they gained has been troubling.\n\nThe FBI has violated its own rules thousands of times, including when searching for information on January 6 rioters and demonstrators protesting against the murder of George Floyd. The bureau also searched for information on 19,000 donors to a congressional campaign, according to a partially declassified document released in 2023.\n\nStill, the House of Representatives this year narrowly failed to approve a warrant requirement for searches about Americans, long one of the highest priorities for privacy advocates. The vote scrambled party lines, with some MAGA Republicans lining up with progressives in favor of a warrant.\n\nIf Trump wins, he would have a chance to haggle with Congress over the program. Many advocates, though, are skeptical that he would try to rein in warrantless surveillance. They note that he signed a similar spying law in 2018.\n\nPatrick Eddington, a senior fellow at the Cato Institute and former congressional aide, said he anticipates that Trump would try to purge perceived enemies rather than curb spying.\n\n\"He only hates the so-called deep state because the FBI went after him,\" Eddington said. \"So how do you solve that problem? You 'reform' the FBI. And I don't think there's any question that's what they have in mind.\"\n\nCohn said she fears in particular surveillance being misused to target immigrants - but she will fight for stricter limits on spying whether Trump or Kamala Harris is in office.\n\n\"I think EFF will be fighting this regardless of who wins the election,\" she said. \"The Democrats and Harris especially, they're not standing up for reforms of these things either. The Biden administration was supportive of this (FISA) extension.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nAdvocates have won some victories since 2013, including greater oversight from a special surveillance court and more transparency. The latest reauthorization from Congress, however, includes a section that gives the government even greater power to compel companies to comply with its orders.\n\nApparently in an attempt to bring data centers under the law's reach , Congress rewrote it so broadly, critics say, that almost anyone could be forced to help the government spy.\n\n\"Whoever the next president is can go to the cleaning crew for the New York Times or The Intercept and compel them under gag without a warrant to 'facilitate' NSA access to those communication systems,\" said Sean Vitka, the policy director for Demand Progress. \"And it is incredibly dangerous.\"\n\nSen. Mark Warner, D-Va., says he is trying to pass a \"fix\" for the law this year, but it is unclear whether he will succeed.\n\nWhile government critics have fought a decadelong battle for a warrant requirement in FISA, they warn there are other government authorities and emerging technologies that may pose just as big a threat.\n\nOne is Executive Order 12333 , signed in 1981 by President Ronald Reagan, which is supposed to provide a framework for surveillance focused abroad.\n\n\"It's not a statute, it's not a law,\" Vitka said. \"In the executive branch's mind, it's the executive branch's own set of limits on its own inherent authority. However, the next president has a terrifying ability to rewrite those rules in secret and without notice.\"\n\nThen there is the government's growing reliance on private data brokers who have amassed massive quantities of data on ordinary Americans. Apps ranging from navigation to dating sell their data to the brokers, who turn around and sell it to the federal and local law enforcement agencies. The brokers' clients include the FBI , the DEA, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement .\n\nThe data also gets sold to private actors: One broker sold information about people who had visited Planned Parenthood clinics to an anti-abortion group.\n\nAs of now, the government argues that the information it buys from those brokers does not require a warrant.\n\n\"Even though you need a warrant to put a GPS tracker on a car for a month, they\" - courts - \"have not said the same thing about buying that information from a data broker scraping it out of your car or out of your phone,\" Vitka said.\n\nBeyond the programs that privacy advocates are already concerned about are the ones that haven't yet come to light.\n\nAdvocates noted that the Snowden revelations shocked the same members of Congress who had voted for the laws authorizing the surveillance, and that the George W. Bush administration used twisted legal interpretations to justify domestic surveillance for years before being exposed.\n\n\"It's been the failures of previous Congresses, Republican and Democrat, and previous administrations, Republican and Democrat, to recognize the absolutely toxic danger that a centralized, imperial presidency represents to the republic,\" Eddington said. \"We're perhaps on the cusp of seeing the effects of that, whether it's Trump or somebody like Trump down the road, being able to seize power and behave in fascistic, autocratic or even totalitarian ways.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "As Cops Scrambled at Trump Rally Shooting, Operators Assured 911 Callers Police Were in Control\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nButler County finally released 911 recordings of the chaotic aftermath of the Trump rally shooting after a lawsuit filed by The Intercept.\n\nOn Wednesday, more than three months after the apparent assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump, Pennsylvania county officials finally released 911 recordings from the July 13 rally. The Intercept filed a lawsuit in September for the recordings, which Butler County refused to provide without a court order.\n\nThe calls began flooding the Butler County emergency services one minute after shots rang out at the Butler Farm Show grounds, the recordings show. Callers expressed fear, terror, and confusion in the chaotic aftermath. Relatives of attendees called the emergency lines in alarm, afraid for their loved ones.\n\nDespite police and Secret Service agents having identified the shooter as a suspicious person at least 25 minutes prior to the shooting, 911 operators assured worried callers that law enforcement was aware of and handling the situation.\n\n\"Gunshot at the Trump rally,\" a woman told the Butler County 911 operator on one of 15 audio files of 911 calls released to The Intercept. The operator told the caller police were on their way. \"Better get here quick,\" they said. In another call, the operator told a different caller that the situation was being handled.\n\nButler County redacted callers' names and phone numbers from the recordings.\n\nPeople can be heard screaming in the background of several calls, adding to the sense of chaos that unfolded that day as attendees waited for police to respond to the shooting. \"We are at the Trump assembly and there's a guy shooting. He's been shooting up the place,\" one woman told the 911 operator on another call. The operator told her the police were aware of the shooting and were taking care of the situation. \"No one's injured, but I'm scared,\" she said.\n\nIn another call, a woman who said her husband was shot at the rally can be heard trying to figure out which hospital he was taken to for treatment. \"I called Butler hospital, he's not there. They told me to call 911,\" the woman said. The operator told her he could not get any information at that time but would call her back when they could.\n\nCorey Comperatore, a 50-year-old firefighter, was shot and killed at the rally. Two other people were injured : 57-year-old David Dutch and 74-year-old James Copenhaver.\n\nAnother woman called 911 asking about her mother, who was in attendance at the rally. The operator assured her police were handling the shooting. \"What am I supposed to do?\" she asked. The operator said police would start getting people out of the vicinity of the shooting.\n\n\"They just tried to kill President Trump,\" said a man who called for a paramedic to assist a woman who fainted after law enforcement started evacuating the grounds. \"You might want to make a note of that.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nSoon after the shooting, The Intercept submitted a request under Pennsylvania's Right-to-Know Law for copies of recorded 911 calls during the rally. Multiple outlets requested the same materials, including reporters from Scripps News and NBC News, who also filed lawsuits against the county alongside The Intercept.\n\nButler County denied all three outlets' requests on identical grounds, citing part of the public records statute that generally exempts 911 recordings from disclosure. The county argued that releasing the 911 calls might jeopardize law enforcement investigations, but it ignored another crucial provision that allows officials to release recordings if \"the public interest in disclosure outweighs the interest in nondisclosure.\"\n\nBy contrast, police from Butler Township released body camera footage showing their frantic real-time response to the shooter from multiple perspectives. Video footage showed police blaming the Secret Service for failing to secure the building on which the shooter was found. One sergeant is heard making calls to family members at the rally to make sure they got out safely.\n\nIn August, the state Office of Open Records found there was \"a compelling argument concerning the heightened public interest\" in the 911 tapes but deferred to Butler County's decision to withhold them.\n\nIn a consent order issued Wednesday, Judge Kelley T. D. Streib of the Butler County Court of Common Pleas wrote that the balancing test under Pennsylvania law favored releasing the recordings given \"the unique, historical circumstances.\"\n\n\"The release of public records should be a top priority of government, not a reluctant one that happens only after the threat of litigation,\" said David Bralow, The Intercept's general counsel. \"On a personal level, I am saddened when non-profit news organizations have to endure the delay and expense that arises from the government's reluctance to provide what is obviously public information.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Trump Leans on WWII Japanese Incarceration Law to Deport Immigrants\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act provides sweeping powers to detain or deport foreign nationals. It's ripe for abuse, experts say.\n\nIn his inaugural address last Monday, President Donald Trump dug deep into the archives to unearth a law that would empower his campaign against immigrants. \"By invoking the Alien Enemies Act of 1798,\" Trump announced , \"I will direct our government to use the full and immense power of federal and state law enforcement to eliminate the presence of all foreign gangs and criminal networks bringing devastating crime to U.S. soil, including our cities and inner cities.\"\n\nA wartime authority that allows the president to detain or deport the \"natives\" and citizens of an enemy nation, the Alien Enemies Act has been invoked just three times in American history, each during a major conflict: the War of 1812, World War I, and World War II. It is best known for its role in Japanese incarceration during World War II, a shameful part of U.S. history for which Congress and several presidents have apologized .\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act provides sweeping powers to detain or deport foreign nationals and is ripe for abuse, according to experts. The archaic law discriminates against immigrants based on their country of citizenship and, more broadly, based on their ancestry. It also requires no evidentiary thresholds and provides no due process protections, like the right to a hearing or the right to appeal. \"What else has been so aggressively rejected - by presidents, Congress, and the judiciary - and considered one of the most shameful episodes in American history and then revived?\" asked Katherine Yon Ebright of the Brennan Center's liberty and national security program and one of the foremost experts on the Alien Enemies Act. \"President Trump should leave the Alien Enemies Act in the dustbin of history.\"\n\nWhen the law was last invoked in World War II, the Alien Enemies Act provided the legal authority for incarcerating noncitizens of Japanese, German, and Italian descent. It allows presidents to target people because of their identity , not their conduct or the threat they pose to national security. Last week, Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., and Sen. Mazie Hirono, D-Hawaii, reintroduced the Neighbors Not Enemies Act, legislation that would repeal the AEA.\n\n\"We cannot allow antiquated laws to continue enabling discriminatory practices that harm immigrant communities. The Alien Enemies Act has been used to target immigrants based solely on their nationality, leading to shameful chapters in our history,\" said Omar. \"President Trump's new administration is also threatening to use this law for sweeping detentions and deportations of immigrants without due process based solely on national origin. Repealing this law is a necessary step toward creating an immigration system rooted in justice and compassion.\"\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act is the last remaining portion of the notorious 18th-century Alien and Sedition Acts, which made it illegal to criticize the president or Congress and were excoriated by founding fathers Thomas Jefferson and James Madison .\n\nIn 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt used the Alien Enemies Act to arrest and detain citizens of Japan, Germany, and Italy without due process in Department of Justice \"internment\" camps. In 1942 , he followed this up with Executive Order 9066, which ultimately forced 120,000 men, women, and children of Japanese descent - nearly 70,000 of them American citizens - from their homes and into detention centers. Framed as a national security issue, it was rooted in racism and xenophobia. \"We want to keep this a white man's country,\" said Bert Miller, Idaho's attorney general, at the time . \"All Japanese [should] be put in concentration camps for the remainder of the war.\"\n\nIn the decades that followed, Roosevelt's successors came to roundly condemn internment. \"This action was taken without trial, without jury. It was based solely on race,\" President Ronald Reagan observed in 1988, signing a bill to provide reparations for the incarceration of Japanese Americans, which he deemed \"a mistake.\" That same year, Congress acknowledged that the policy was based on \" racial prejudice, war hysteria and the failure of political leadership .\" The Department of Justice later determined that German noncitizens had been targeted \" based on their ancestry ,\" and Congress described Italian internment as a \" fundamental injustice .\"\n\nIn 1990, nine former detainees of America's incarceration camps received the first $20,000 reparations payments as well as a formal apology signed by President George H.W. Bush which declared: \"We can never fully right the wrongs of the past. But we can take a clear stand for justice and recognize that serious injustices were done to Japanese Americans during World War II.\" Last year, President Joe Biden continued the tradition by \"reaffirming the Federal Government's formal apology to Japanese Americans. And by stating unequivocally: Nidoto nai yoni - to 'Let It Not Happen Again.'\" Read Our Complete Coverage The War on Immigrants\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nOn inauguration day, Trump signed an executive order directing, within two weeks, the attorney general and the secretary of homeland security, in consultation with the secretary of state, \"to make operational preparations regarding the implementation of any decision I make to invoke the Alien Enemies Act.\" The White House also announced that the president would \"begin the process of designating cartels, including the violent Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, as foreign terrorist organizations and use the Alien Enemies Act to remove them.\" Last year, the Biden administration designated Tren de Aragua as a transnational criminal organization akin to MS-13 from El Salvador and the Mafia-like Camorra in Italy.\n\nWhite House spokesperson Taylor Rogers acknowledged The Intercept's questions about Trump's decision-making process on the Alien Enemies Act but did not provide answers prior to publication.\n\nEbright, who has written extensively on the AEA for the Brennan Center, notes that during World War I and II, the law was used to target anyone \"deemed dangerous.\" That, however, is a designation without definition. \"There is no evidentiary threshold for showing that someone, in fact, is dangerous. The Alien Enemies Act has no due process protections that would ensure that Venezuelans detained and deported actually have a criminal history or are a public safety threat,\" Ebright explained. \"When the president deems someone dangerous, the law does not provide any due process protections. There is no guarantee of a hearing, a right to appeal, or a right to counsel.\"\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act covers not only the citizens of a foreign belligerent, but also all its \"natives,\" including individuals who were born in the designated nation but have renounced their citizenship and no longer owe any allegiance to that state. \"If the president declared that all Venezuelans who have not achieved U.S. citizenship are subject to detention or deportation, that is within the scope of the Alien Enemies Act,\" Ebright said. \"So that would be discrimination based on the citizenship someone holds, but also on the place of birth of a person, in essence, their ancestry.\"\n\n\"It doesn't allow them to target the Sinaloa Cartel, it allows them to target all Mexicans.\"\n\nOmar echoed this in an email to The Intercept. \"The Alien Enemies Act targets people based on their nationality, not based on their behavior,\" the Minnesota representative wrote. \"It doesn't allow them to target Tren de Aragua, it allows them to target all Venezuelans. It doesn't allow them to target the Sinaloa Cartel, it allows them to target all Mexicans. This includes green card holders. It includes people who are themselves victims of the cartels and gangs.\"\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nTrump's embrace of the Alien Enemies Act has both traumatized and galvanized victims of incarceration during World War II and their descendants. \"I miss my parents every day, but I'm thankful that they didn't live to experience this. I really did not expect to see this in my lifetime,\" said Mike Ishii, whose mother's family was incarcerated in the camps and whose father's family fled the West Coast to avoid detention. Ishii is the co-founder of Tsuru for Solidarity , an activist organization composed of Japanese American concentration camp survivors, their descendants, and allies that formed during Trump's first term to oppose immigrant detention. He said the community was still dealing with intergenerational trauma born of the internment experience. \"If you want to understand a deeper Japanese American emotional and psychological response, you have to look at our history,\" Ishii told The Intercept. \"We were a group of people that were targeted because of our race, forcibly removed at gunpoint, stripped of our rights, and imprisoned for years.\"\n\nDespite his embrace of the Alien Enemies Act, Trump has tacitly acknowledged the injustice of the incarceration of Japanese Americans during the 1940s by comparing them with a group he sympathizes with. Last year, Trump drew fire by comparing Japanese Americans forcibly removed to detention camps without due process to rioters convicted of charges after storming the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. \"Why are they still being held? Nobody's ever been treated like this,\" Trump said in an interview with conservative commentator Dan Bongino in October. \"Maybe the Japanese during Second World War, frankly. They were held too.\"\n\nOn his first day in office, Trump granted clemency to more than 1,500 people charged in the January 6 insurrection, including more than 200 who pleaded guilty to assaulting police.\n\nIshii expressed outrage at Trump's comparison of the two groups. \"It's disingenuous and utterly offensive for Donald Trump to make a correlation between Japanese Americans who were forcibly removed at gunpoint from their neighborhoods during World War II, detained in U.S. concentration camps, denied their civil liberties and stripped of their human rights with Trump supporters who willfully attempted to overthrow the U.S. government in a violent coup,\" he told The Intercept. \"The seditionists of January 6th were not martyrs or victims. They have no moral authority. They're violent criminals.\"\n\nEbright noted that, over the past decades, official apologies for Japanese incarceration cited not only the need to express regret and provide reparations for moral reasons and in recognition of past violations of constitutional rights, but also to \"discourage the occurrence of similar injustices and violations of civil liberties in the future,\" she said. \"They meant to instruct future generations to never do this again.\"\n\nThe White House did not provide answers to questions citing experts' concerns over the Alien Enemies Act, specifically the propriety of reviving a law with such a dark history and whose use has been roundly rejected by previous presidents.\n\n\"The Alien Enemies Act is a relic of a xenophobic past - a draconian law that empowers presidents to target immigrants without due process,\" Omar, who warned that employing the 18th-century law again would be \"another moral stain on our country.\"\n\nWAIT!

Over the last 24 hours, Russian troops took control of the village of Vovkove in eastern Ukraine's Donetsk region, inflicting \"more than 510 casualties on Ukrainian troops,\" TASS, Russia's state-run news agency reported on Tuesday , citing the Russian Ministry of Defense. Kyiv said it fired a wave of drones at Russia overnight, sparking a blaze at an oil depot in the western Voronezh region bordering Ukraine. Between Monday and Tuesday, Ukraine counted hundreds of \" combat losses \" of enemy personnel.\n\nAn attack earlier this month in Ukraine's city of Zaporizhzhia caused the most civilian casualties - 13 killed, 110 injured - in a single incident in almost two years, according to the U.N. Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine. Last year, Russia carried out close to 15,000 airstrikes , including drone attacks, in Ukraine, according to ACLED, a international nonprofit organization that tracks data on violent conflicts.\n\nAt least 2,064 Ukrainian civilians were killed in Russian attacks in 2024. Another 9,089 were injured, according to the United Nations. Almost 7 million people from Ukraine are now refugees and 3.5 million are internally displaced, according to the U.N. Refugee Agency.\n\nTrump's incoming administration is already began tempering expectations. Earlier this month, retired Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg, Trump's pick to serve as the special envoy to Ukraine and Russia, walked back his boss's bombast. \"Let's set it at 100 days,\" he said , moving the goal posts for ending the conflict.\n\n\"It's going to be the official policy of the United States that the war has to end and we're going to do everything possible to bring that about,\" said Marco Rubio , Trump's new secretary of state, on Tuesday. During his confirmation hearings, Rubio said, \"There is no way Russia takes all of Ukraine,\" but warned that Ukraine would need to make \"concessions.\"\n\nThe State Department press office acknowledged a request for comment from The Intercept on the status of efforts to end the war in Ukraine but did not provide one prior to publication.\n\nIn rambling remarks after his inauguration speech on Monday, Trump was uncharacteristically critical of Russian President Vladimir Putin. \"I think he's destroying Russia by not making a deal,\" Trump said of the Russian autocrat. \"I would hope he wants to make a deal.\"\n\n\"There are some voices around Trump delivering disinformation or pro-Russian messages,\" President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine told the World Economic Forum on Tuesday. \"Will President Trump listen to Europe or will he negotiate with Russia and China without Europe?\"\n\nKremlin foreign policy aide Yuri Ushakov told reporters in Moscow that Russia is \"ready for dialogue with the new U.S. administration on the Ukrainian conflict.\"\n\nLast week, Trump took credit for the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas . \"This EPIC ceasefire agreement could have only happened as a result of our Historic Victory in November, as it signaled to the entire World that my Administration would seek Peace and negotiate deals to ensure the safety of all Americans, and our Allies,\" he announced on Truth Social. On Monday, however, Trump seemed to back away from the deal. \"I'm not confident,\" Trump responded when asked if he could keep the ceasefire in effect. \"It's not our war. It's their war.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Trump Directed Diplomat to Ask Ukraine to Probe Biden in Overheard Cellphone Call\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nTrump told a U.S. diplomat who called him from a restaurant in Kyiv that he wanted Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden, according to a State Department witness.\n\nIn a jaw-dropping operational security lapse, President Donald Trump discussed his demand for Ukraine to open investigations of Joe Biden and other Democrats in a cellphone conversation with an American diplomat who was in a restaurant in Ukraine at the time, the House impeachment inquiry was told on Wednesday.\n\nDuring that call with Gordon Sondland, the U.S. ambassador to the European Union, Trump spoke so loudly about \"the investigations\" that someone in the restaurant who was not on the phone could hear his words, according to Bill Taylor, the senior American diplomat in Ukraine.\n\nIt is highly likely that others were listening too. Russia's intelligence services have previously demonstrated the capability to intercept the phone calls of American diplomats in Ukraine and make recordings that can be used to compromise or embarrass those officials.\n\nRead our Complete Coverage All the President's Crimes\n\nRead our Complete Coverage\n\nTaylor described the incident in his opening statement at the public impeachment hearing, explaining that a member of his staff who had accompanied Sondland to a meeting with a senior Ukrainian official and then the restaurant in Kyiv, the Ukrainian capital, was the one who overheard Trump.\n\nAmb. Taylor: \"Following the call with President Trump, the member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought about Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for.\" pic.twitter.com/7kynboGObB\n\n- CSPAN (@cspan) November 13, 2019\n\nAccording to Taylor's sworn statement, \"in the presence of my staff at a restaurant, Ambassador Sondland called President Trump and told him of his meetings in Kyiv. The member of my staff could hear President Trump on the phone, asking Ambassador Sondland about 'the investigations.' Ambassador Sondland told President Trump that the Ukrainians were ready to move forward.\"\n\nThat cellphone call took place on July 26, one day after Trump had pressed Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to do him the \" favor \" of boosting right-wing conspiracy theories about Biden and other Democrats by opening criminal investigations on them.\n\nAt the time, Sondland was leading the secret effort directed by the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, to get Zelensky to announce investigations of both Burisma - a Ukrainian gas company that once employed Biden's son Hunter - and supposed meddling in the 2016 election by Ukrainian officials to undermine Trump.\n\nAfter the call, Taylor said, \"The member of my staff asked Ambassador Sondland what President Trump thought of Ukraine. Ambassador Sondland responded that President Trump cares more about the investigations of Biden, which Giuliani was pressing for.\"\n\nSondland told Ukrainian television that day that he \"had a great lunch with my team, but before that I had a wonderful, hour-long meeting with President Zelensky - that followed on the heels of his telephone call yesterday with President Trump.\" Photographs of the meeting that day between American diplomats and Zelensky show that Sondland sat directly across the table from the Ukrainian president, appearing to be the head of the delegation.\n\n. @SpecRepUkraine Volker and @USAmbEU Gordon Sondland met with President @ZelenskyyUa to discuss U.S.-Ukraine cooperation and to express unwavering U.S. support for Ukraine's democracy, security, and prosperity. pic.twitter.com/YvCy0Net7e\n\n- U.S. Embassy Kyiv (@USEmbassyKyiv) July 26, 2019\n\nAfter the hearing, the embassy staff member who overheard the call was identified by NBC News as David Holmes, a counselor for political affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine. Earlier on Wednesday, Holmes was summoned by the House impeachment inquiry to give non-public testimony - a deposition now scheduled for Friday. That means Sondland will not know what Holmes said about the call when he testifies in public next week.\n\nOn Thursday, The Associated Press reported that a second embassy official who was in the restaurant also \"overheard President Trump's call with Sondland about need for Ukraine investigations.\" The second official sitting at the table was identified by The A.P. as Suriya Jayanti, a foreign service officer based in Kyiv.\n\nJayanti was scheduled to be deposed by House impeachment investigators in a closed session last month, but her appearance was canceled because of the funeral for former House Oversight Chair Elijah Cummings and has not yet been rescheduled.\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

Sondland and Taylor have testified that Trump withheld nearly $400 million in U.S. aid to Ukraine's military to extort a promise from Zelesnky to go on CNN and announce the investigations of his political rivals.\n\n\"Sondland calling Trump on a cellphone from Kyiv is extraordinary for all sorts of reasons,\" Michael McFaul, a former U.S. ambassador to Russia, observed on Twitter . \"Normally EU Ambos don't call presidents. They never do so to discuss Ukraine policy. Doing so on a cellphone from Kyiv means whole world was listening in.\"\n\nTrump's appalling operational security is notable because, during the 2016 presidential campaign, he frequently accused Hillary Clinton of having committed a crime and compromised national security by using a private email account as secretary of state. Since taking office, however, Trump has reportedly continued to make calls on his iPhones, even after warnings from American intelligence officials that Russian and Chinese spies are regularly eavesdropping on his calls.\n\nLast Updated: Thursday, Nov. 14, 12:30 p.m. ET This article was updated to reflect new reporting that identified the American diplomat who overheard President Trump ask Gordon Sondland if Ukraine was willing to pursue \"the investigations\" he had demanded. On Thursday, The A.P. reported that at least one other American embassy official also overheard the conversation in the restaurant.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Rigged: The Acquittal of Donald J. Trump\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nSens. Jeff Merkley and Brian Schatz join Mehdi Hasan to discuss the implications of Wednesday's Senate vote finding the president not guilty on both articles of impeachment.\n\nAs predicted, the Republican-controlled Senate voted on Wednesday to find President Donald Trump not guilty on both articles of impeachment brought by the House of Representatives. It was a party-line vote, with one notable exception: Utah Sen. Mitt Romney became the first senator in U.S. history to vote to remove a president of his own party. Democratic Sens. Jeff Merkley of Oregon and Brian Schatz of Hawaii, who both voted to remove the president, joined Mehdi Hasan by phone shortly after the vote to discuss the implications of Trump's acquittal for the future of the Senate.\n\nMehdi Hasan: Hello, this is Mehdi Hasan - a quick announcement before we start the show today: if you're in LA this coming Monday, February 10th, we're recording a special episode of Deconstructed on the massive issue of criminal justice reform and mass incarceration and racism in front of a live audience at the Writers Guild Theater, and with special, oh very special guests John Legend, yeah, that John Legend, and Black Lives Matter co-founder Patrisse Cullors. Go to the Intercept website or to my Twitter feed for details on how to buy tickets, before they're all gone - and if you're NOT in LA, well make sure you tell your friends and family in LA about it. You do not want to miss this show. Now, on to the show.\n\nJeff Merkley: I don't believe you can truly be acquitted if you haven't had a fair and full trial. This is the first time in the history of the United States of America that the majority leader conspired to ensure there was not a fair trial.\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nMH: Welcome to a special early edition of Deconstructed at the end of the Senate impeachment trial. I'm Mehdi Hasan.\n\nDonald Trump is in the clear. He may be an impeached president - only the third in American history - but he wasn't convicted or removed from office on Wednesday. No, he was acquitted by the United States Senate - or, I should say, by every single Republican senator bar Mitt Romney.\n\nBrian Schatz: Mitt Romney changed the equation. This is now the first instance of a United States senator voting to convict a president of his or her own party.\n\nMH: That was the voice of Democratic Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, who is one of my guests on the show today, as is the Democratic Senator from Oregon, Jeff Merkeley, both of whom, like every other Democrat voted to remove the president from office. But they failed. And Trump lives to fight another day. So now what? What does this all mean?\n\nJohn Roberts: The Senate having tried Donald john Trump, President of the United States, upon two articles of impeachment, exhibited against him by the House of Representatives, and two thirds of the senators present not having found him guilty of the charges contained therein, it is therefore ordered and adjudged that the said Donald John Trump be, and he is hereby acquitted of the charges in said articles.\n\nMH: There you have it. The Senate voting to acquit Donald John Trump, 45th president of the United States, on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress, charges for which he was impeached in the House of Representatives.\n\nIn the Senate though, it wasn't really a trial. I mean, have you ever heard of a trial with no witnesses in it? None. Nada. Zero. In fact, it was the first Senate impeachment trial in American history not to feature any witnesses. Even though one potential witness, John Bolton, the president's own former national security adviser, one-time hero of the Republican Party, volunteered to testify in the Senate, and even has a book coming out filled with his eye-witness testimony. He, by the way, says in that book, yeah Trump did do what the Democrats accuse him of doing, of holding up aid to Ukraine in order to get the Ukrainians to investigate the Bidens - ergo he was not called by Republican senators. They didn't wanna know. You remember that old saying: \"See no evil, hear no evil and then do...lots of evil.\"\n\nRepublicans bent over backwards to try and defend Trump or justify keeping him in office: yeah he did bad things, but they're not impeachable. They're not crimes - and you have to commit a crime to be impeached and removed - a position, by the way, shared by no constitutional scholars or legal experts on this subject with the exception of former Jeffrey Epstein lawyer Alan Dershowitz.\n\nMeanwhile, House Democrats, who I criticized on this show for not going bigger on impeachment -not going after Trump for all his other high crimes and misdemeanors, from his corruption and violation of the Emoluments Clause, to his obstruction of justice over the Russia investigation, to his kidnapping of migrant children from their parents at the border - those House Democrats, to be fair to them, led by Adam Schiff, did make a pretty strong case for convicting Trump over abuse of power and obstruction of Congress in relation to his attempt to extort and pressure the president of Ukraine, to use U.S. aid money to try and trigger a bogus corruption investigation into a domestic political rival.\n\nAdam Schiff: Donald Trump has betrayed his oath to protect and defend the Constitution but it's not too late for us to honor ours, to wield our power to defend our democracy.\n\nMH: But the whole thing was rigged from the get-go. Not just in terms of no witnesses, even when John Bolton was volunteering in the midst of the Senate trial to testify, and dodgy Trump donor and indicted Rudy Giuliani associate Lev Parnas was producing secret recordings of Trump ordering the taking out of the US ambassador to Ukraine, but also in terms of the trial itself and the \"jurors\" themselves. Because that's what senators were supposed to be: independent and impartial jurors, they took an oath to that effect, and yet before it even began you had Senate Majority Leader Republican Mitch McConnell saying:\n\nMitch McConnell: Everything I do during this, I'm coordinating with White House Counsel. There will be no difference between the president's position and our position.\n\nMH: And Republican Senator Lindsey Graham saying:\n\nLindsey Graham: I am trying to give a pretty clear signal I've made up my mind. I am not pretending to be a fair juror here.\n\nMH: Got that? Jurors, on tape, bragging that they have no intention of being fair or impartial and that they're openly coordinating with the defendant. That's the \"trial\" we just had in the Senate - surely a low point in the modern history of that body. I mean, first confirming Brett Kavanaugh and now acquitting Donald Trump.\n\nSo what happens now? Well, giving leaders impunity, especially reckless power-hungry rulers like Trump, has consequences and they tend not to be good ones. Do you remember what happened the day after Robert Mueller testified in Congress last July and then... nothing happened? There were no consequences for Trump, no impeachment of the president. Well, the next day, the very next day, an emboldened Trump made his \"perfect\" phone call to the Ukrainian president asking him to investigate the Bidens. One can only imagine what the acquitted yet still very corrupt and crooked president will be doing on Thursday, the morning after he's acquitted: who he'll be calling, what he'll be demanding.\n\nIt is not an overstatement, it's not hyperbole, to say that American politics, American democracy, is in crisis. I mean: How can a presidential system like America's survive when you have a president who isn't constrained by any constitutional checks or balances? When his own party says he can do what he likes and he won't be stopped, he won't be touched?\n\nListen to presidential history Jon Meacham speaking the other day on television:\n\nJon Meachem: President Trump is functionally a monarch at this point. If the king does it, it's okay that's what we're seeing unfold in Washington right now.\n\nMH: But, with this shameful vote, the Republicans have decided, and announced to the world, that their party is officially the Trump Party, the Trump Cult, that the constitution doesn't matter, that Congress doesn't matter, checks and balances don't matter, foreign policy and national security doesn't matter.\n\nWell, Republicans with the exception of Mitt Romney. On Wednesday, the junior Republican senator from Utah, former Republican presidential candidate, decided to do the right thing and voted to convict and remove Donald Trump becoming the first senator in U.S. history to vote to remove a president of his own party from office:\n\nMitt Romney: Corrupting an election to keep oneself in office is perhaps the most abusive and destructive violation of one's oath of office that I can imagine. With my vote, I will tell my children, their children that I did my duty to the best of my ability believing that my country expected it of me.\n\nMH: I want to say a couple of things about Mitt Romney. First off, and I never thought I'd say this: but respect to Romney. It's not easy to go against your own friends, colleagues, many of your own constituents, your own political party, especially one as intolerant and cultish as the modern Republican Party. I've been a massive and long-standing critic of Romney. I thought he ran an awful campaign against Obama in 2012, and I thought he was a bit of a hypocrite for taking money and an endorsement from Trump in 2012, then attacking Trump in 2016, then trying to get a job in the Trump administration after Trump won, and getting Trump's endorsement when he ran for the Senate in Utah. But, credit where credit's due, he did the right thing today. He voted with his conscience - the only Republican to do so.\n\nSecondly, though, what's so ironic about the Romney vote is that almost immediately Don Jr, the president's failson, took to Twitter, demanding Romney be expelled from the GOP. And yet, just a week ago, Republicans were clutching their pearls and pretending to be outraged when Adam Schiff referred to a CBS News report saying they were too afraid of voting against Trump because they'd been told \"your head will be on a pike.\"\n\nJames Landford: One of the most remarkable moments of the entire day was when Adam Schiff ended the night by saying \"Republicans have been told their head will be on a pike by the president if they vote against him.\" That is completely, totally false and all of us were shaking our heads like where in the world did that story come from?\n\nMH: Well, turns out Trump and co do indeed want Romney's head on a pike. They can't tolerate the fact that even one Republican senator voted against the absolute monarch. Voted against King Trump.\n\nLook, I know it's fashionable to say that Americans don't care about impeachment, it's all very technical, it's not a kitchen table issue, it's too complicated, and it's too distant from ordinary people's lives, but let me be clear: if you care about democracy in this country, if you care about accountability, the rule of law, checks and balances, the constitution, if you care about the ongoing slide into full blown authoritarianism and open criminality, then you need to care about what happened today, you need to be angry and outraged that this trial was rigged by a Republican Party who wanted to impeach Hillary Clinton over Benghazi but give Donald Trump, who's a thousand times more lawless and a million times more corrupt, a complete pass. So yes, please, get angry.\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nMH: Joining me now to discuss this, from Capitol Hill, where the Senate trial of Donald Trump has just ended, is Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregon. Senator, great to have you back on the show, shame it's under these circumstances.\n\nJM: Yes, yes. Well, I'm feeling the weight of this dark and tragic day.\n\nMH: I'm looking at a screen in front of me saying Donald Trump Acquitted is the banner headline on all the new sites. You've just come out of that trial and the voting. How do you feel about that?\n\nJM: Well, I don't believe you can truly be acquitted if you haven't had a fair and full trial. And certainly, this is a tragic day because this is the first time in the history of the United States of America that the majority leader conspired, as he put it, hand in glove to work with the defendant to ensure there was not a fair trial. This is not doing impartial justice. And as every American knows a trial is not a trial if it does not have witnesses and documents. So, this was a cover up and it should be considered nothing more than that.\n\nMH: Completely agree with you on your analysis of the cover up. But here's a question for you as someone who deals with Republican senators, they're your colleagues on Capitol Hill every day, even if they'd voted for witnesses, let's say John Bolton had turned up and said, \"Yes, the President told me last summer hold back the aid until we get the investigations into the Bidens,\" do you think that they still wouldn't have voted to acquit him?\n\nJM: I believe that once the door was open to all of the machinations that were going inside, among the cabinet secretaries, among the Office of Management and Budget, we would have seen the profile of a much more extensive scandal, something that would have persuaded much of America that indeed, this was a crime against the Constitution, and that would have had a big impact on the vote.\n\nMH: Now I understand what you're saying and you might be right. I'm just looking at the polling which shows you know, half of Americans already so supported conviction and removal. Three quarters of Americans supported witnesses. The evidence the House managers brought forward from Trump employees, from members of you know, the administration was pretty damning. And yet you couldn't get more than one Republican senator to join you in the vote today. That's how they've doubled down behind Donald Trump, the Republicans in the Senate.\n\nJM: Well, think about it this way: the more the scandal penetrated various departments of President Trump's administration, the Secretary of State or the State Department, the Department of Defense, you of course, had the Foreign Service engaged in this. You had the Department of Energy engaged in this, the more determination of this administration to apply pressure to make sure that the lid was not lifted on this can of worms. And that pressure in this very partisan age, won out over the oath to do impartial justice and the oath to honor the constitution and of course, the constitution in calling for the Senate to hold a trial envisioned all of the protections of a trial for full justice, and that is witnesses and documents. So, people violated their oath to the constitution and violated their oath of impartial justice because of that pressure, and that's what makes this a very tragic day in America.\n\nMH: One person who says he had to break with his party because of his oath to the Constitution, he said, because of his conscience, because of his faith was former Republican presidential candidate, the Senator from Utah, Mitt Romney. What did you make of his vote today to convict and remove a president from his own party?\n\nJM: It was a powerful statement that he delivered. I happened to be walking by a television as he came on to the screen. So, I heard at least a share of his statement and this is extraordinarily difficult to do. Remember you have the combined force of Mitch McConnell, who said he'd work hand in glove with the president to produce exoneration, you had all of these officials that serve the president, you have this extraordinary pressure to show that you are a member of the team, not the American team, not the team of senators assigned to do impartial justice but the Republican team assigned to defend the president. And that individual, Mitt Romney, did something remarkable that will be remembered through the decades to come as an act of extraordinary courage and fidelity to an oath that he took as he put it, not just to the Constitution and not just impartial justice, but to do so before God.\n\nMH: And just on the House Democrats who brought the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate, do you think there's anything they could have done differently either in the House or in terms of making their arguments in the Senate? What do you think about the Democratic approach to this whole thing?\n\nJM: I don't believe there's anything else that they could have done that would have made a difference. Would I suggest to them that they had brought in Emoluments Clause? Yes. Would I suggest to them they should have brought forth an article of impeachment that addressed the four cases in the Mueller report, in which Muller found substantial evidence on all three key points of the law for obstruction of justice, including one obstruction of justice that included witness tampering? Absolutely. In fact, on those four cases, we received a letter from over 1,000 former federal prosecutors who said anyone else America would be indicted. I really disagreed with their decision not to lay out that set of cases. I would have liked to seen the House absolutely lay out the criminal issues. It is a crime to solicit foreign interference in an election. If that interference is worth over $25,000, it is a felony and if you're holding up over $300 million of aid, you can anticipate the value of that contribution you're seeking is over $25,000. This was a felony act. The House did not make that clear. I do not believe any of those things would have changed the outcome. But I do believe it would have been a much fuller exploration addressing the criminal conduct of Donald Trump.\n\nMH: Do you think Democrats now should let go or there's talk of actually expanding investigations back in the House, subpoenaing John Bolton, do you support that?\n\nJM: That's a decision for the House to make. I do feel that the window to explore this effort has from my perspective, closed. And that now we turn to the court of judgment that will occur in November with the election in the United States of America.\n\nMH: And in that election, that's coming up. We saw the Iowa caucuses. A little bit of a disaster for your party this week. What did you make of the fallout from Iowa?\n\nJM: You know, time and again, I've seen software rolled out when it hadn't been fully tested, and create a fiasco. The City of Portland, Oregon, had a water billing system that was a complete disaster. The State of Oregon was not prepared for a clean roll-out of the Affordable Care Act and we had to resort to paper because the website was such a mess. In this case, had we not - It's just frustrating that they hadn't learned the lessons of that, that you have to do a full test. It's great to run a pilot project. It's great to make the use optional, but be prepared for it not to work. I know that those who are evaluating this right now are going to make sure that it runs like clockwork four years from now. I don't consider this a major flaw in the course, think of this is the first lap of a 50-lap race. And the track was messed up on that first track, on that first loop around the track, but it will be in good shape for the next 49.\n\nMH: Senator, last time you were on the show back in 2018, you said you were considering running for president yourself you ended up deciding not to run? Do you have a candidate? Do you have a favorite? Have you picked anyone yet?\n\nJM: No, I decided not to endorse, at least for now in the near future. And I must say it's partly to celebrate the tremendous number of folks who are bringing their talents to bear who have so much to say about putting our nation back on track, about taking on the challenge of carbon pollution that's destroying our planet. We see the ramifications all over my home state of Oregon, about taking on equality of opportunity for every American and certainly for the LGBTQ community and passing Equality Act, for taking on the fundamentals for families to thrive, because there's four foundations, there's healthcare, there's education, there's housing, and there's good paying jobs, and there's so much work to be done. And so I celebrate the many ideas that have been put forward, the dialogue that's happened in this primary.\n\nMH: That group that you're celebrating, do you include in that former Republican mayor of New York, former George W. Bush supporter, Michael Bloomberg?\n\nJM: Well, he will soon be entering the contest. And I do have reservations about the fact that we've reached the point in the extraordinary maldistribution of wealth, where a few individuals who have benefited so much from the infrastructure laid down by the preceding generation are in a position to essentially take a shortcut to prominence in the election. I don't want to see a country and basically where you have to be a mega-millionaire to to run for office because we will not get the view of ordinary Americans expressed. I live in a blue collar community. I grew up in that blue collar community. My dad was a mechanic. We need more people who live in communities where families are experiencing the challenges of the shortcomings of government over the last four decades.\n\nMH: One last question before I let you go, just circling back to the president and impeachment, now that he's been \"acquitted,\" are we going to see an even more emboldened and reckless Trump who thinks \"I can get away with anything?\" Is he going to do even more crazier, more criminal things between now and November because he believes there are no constraints on him?\n\nJM: Well, I do think that those around him will try to constrain the craziest acts he might embark on. But that's never worked to date. In fact the lesson that he can take from this is not that be wary about abusing your office, but that if you abuse your office, you have a partisan team that will make sure that neither the judicial process nor the impeachment process can hold you accountable. That is a horrific lesson. That's another reason today is a very dark and tragic day.\n\nMH: On that note Senator Jeff Merkley. Thanks for joining me on deconstructed You're welcome. Thank you.\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nMH: That was Senator Jeff Merkley of Oregan, speaking to me from the Senate. One of the most fascinating and depressing things about watching this trial has been the way in which Republicans and their enablers in the media have been gaslighting us on a near daily basis, making demonstrably false claims, about how Republicans weren't allowed to question witnesses in the House, which is a lie, or how the impeachment process itself is a violation of the Constitution, which is of course a lie.\n\nOne of the Democrats who has been best at calling at Republican hypocrisy, mendacity and gaslighting, and calling at the media's failure to fully hold Trump and Co. to account is Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii, who I would add is a very amusing politician to follow on Twitter. He joins me now on his way out of Capitol Hill, on the phone, after the vote:\n\nSenator Brian Schatz thanks for joining me on Deconstructed.\n\nBS: Happy to be here.\n\nMH: You've just come out of the Senate vote. Donald Trump has been acquitted. What's your first reaction?\n\nBS: Well, it's mixed feelings and I'll tell you why. This was horrifying for American democracy. And partly because of the Dershowitz arguments that were being made over the final week. It became even more worrisome not just for Trump, but for any president and the idea that undergirds their theory of executive power is really dangerous for our constitutional order. So, that's one thing. The other thing is that just on a personal level, I was deeply disappointed in some of my Republican colleagues, with whom I, by necessity have a functional working relationship, but to see them through this process, disappoint me and not be willing to even vote for something that would resemble a fair trial had gotten me down.\n\nNow, let me tell you the good news. The good news is that Mitt Romney changed the equation. This is now the first instance of a United States senator voting to convict a president of his or her own party and that was an extraordinary act of courage. I worked really hard for Barack Obama and against Mitt Romney but Mitt has become my friend. Mitt is an example of the Republican Party of the 70s and 80s and 90s, with which I disagreed vehemently, but they were not doing the institutional damage that that Trump's party is doing. So, it was just personally gratifying for me to see that and I think it's got political implications too because they now have a bipartisan guilty vote. And also Doug Jones, who represents Alabama, Joe Manchin, who represents West Virginia, Kyrsten Sinema, who represents Arizona they all voted guilty on both counts.\n\nMH: All Democrats in swing states.\n\nBS: All democrats in swing states, all did the right thing and did it for the right reasons. And so perhaps unusually, but perhaps auguring well for unity and moral clarity, all of the Democrats were together, and the Republicans were at least ever so slightly split because I think what Adam Schiff tried to attempt to do was really smart. He knew he wasn't going to win a conviction, but he just wanted to prick the consciences not just of the nation, but of individual senators and I thought it was extraordinary. And I was, for the first time in probably several weeks, I was, again, proud to be part of this institution.\n\nMH: So let me just pick up you made a couple of points there. I'll come back to Mitt Romney in a moment and that was a fascinating vote by him. But just in terms of you mentioned, kind of the implications for presidential power. You also mentioned your Republican colleagues. Let's just start with the Republican colleagues, you said you were disappointed. Isn't that a bit of an understatement given, it's not just that all of them but Romney voted to clear the president. But they spent the last week or two and you saw this up close and personal, not just saying \"Oh, we're going to defend the president, we're not going to vote to convict him,\" but just lying and not just like gaslighting on a daily basis saying things like there's no new evidence and there's no need for witnesses and there are no witnesses and just the number of sheer lies they told over the last couple of weeks.\n\nBS: Sure, but those are not the ones that disappointed me. I know Tom Cotton and Marsha Blackburn and all of these folks who make a living in that sort of fever swamp universe. They're not capable of disappointing me.\n\nMH: Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski, they're still capable of disappointing even now?\n\nBS: Susan did not disappoint me and I will just leave it there. But Lisa and I are friends and she was there on the Brent Kavanaugh vote and she was there on the Affordable Care Act vote and she was personally not sure what to do all the way to the end. That was a personal disappointment to me. But I think you're right that the behavior, to characterize what happened as disappointing is to understate the sort of venal, craven dishonest thing that's going on right now and to underestimate the potential impact. Now, the silver lining on the Dershowitz theory of the case is that I mean, even the President's Counsel basically benched him after he had that riff late at night. It was sort of, I likened it to a, you know, a sort of a self indulgent guitar solo, which starts out kind of interesting, but then sort of takes the song in a direction and everyone wants him to stop. I mean, that was about Alan Dershowitz.\n\nMH: Just to clarify for our listeners, you're referring to when Alan Dershowitz said, basically, if the president does something because he thinks he's gonna get reelected, it's in the public interest, whatever the President thinks is good for him is good for the country.\n\nBS: Yeah, well, there were actually two arguments. That was sort of so outrageous that I don't know that anybody really embraced it. But the other one is a little more insidious because what they're basically saying is the president possesses power. And if he uses that power lawfully then it can't be impeachable, and that is exactly upside down because the reason you give the impeachment authorities in Congress is because you're giving a president this extraordinary Constitutional power. So let me give you an example. If a president decided to use the pardon power, which is total, which is plenary, which is sort of unquestioned as a matter of law, if he decided to pardon in people only in blue states or red states are only people who were for him or punish those who are against them, no one could say that he was unlawfully using his power. What we would say is he's abusing the authority in his possession and therefore must be impeached. And what Dershowitz does is turn that whole thing on its head and say no, as long as it's an Article Two power, it cannot be abused and that is terrifying.\n\nMH: It's terrifying also amusing. Of course, as you know, once there's a Democratic president in office, they won't be pushing these legal theories at all. It's only lots of executive power if you're a Republican president.\n\nBS: Well, fair enough. I think that's absolutely right. And, you know, one of our structural disadvantages is they are able to accomplish a lot of their goals, destroying the government's - Doing everything they can to deregulate industries, getting a lot of federal judges through. They don't need institutions to work in order to get what they want. We need institutions to work in order to pass our agenda. So the kind of maximalist sort of game theory, you know, the kind of internet strategist that says, \"Why don't you guys kick more ass and be more tough?\" Fair enough, I think sometimes we are a little bit too focused on decorum and stability, but we do have to remember that we need these institutions and these guys don't. They have what they need just as long as they can stack the federal judiciary and gut -\n\nMH: But you don't need, for example, a filibuster, which, you know, Republican behavior in recent days is another reminder of why candidates like Elizabeth Warren who say get rid of the filibuster probably are more practical about what needs to be done under a Democratic president than maybe other candidates who think I could still work with the Republicans.\n\nBS: Yeah, I think, you know, listen, I think that we'll see whose theory of the case ends up being right, but I have a strong, strong suspicion that the moment we have a Democratic president whether it's anywhere anywhere from Joe Biden to Elizabeth to Amy Klobuchar to Bernie that they will treat them the same which is to block everything and then we'll have some decisions to make.\n\nMH: And let me just circle back to Lisa Murkowski and Mitt Romney. You mentioned that you know, you were disappointed, what happened. One of the things Lisa Murkowski said, \"I was was very upset when Adam Schiff mentioned -\" You know, a lot of these senators came out and said \"We're horrified that Adam Schiff could say that we're being threatened by the White House, that our heads will be on pikes,\" was a CBS News report. The irony is today after Mitt Romney voted to convict and remove Donald Trump, Donald Trump's failson, Don Jr. took to Twitter to say he should be expelled from the GOP. Oh, the irony.\n\nBS: Yeah, well, I mean, look, it was, yes, of course, they have heads on pikes. And by the way, I don't know. I work in politics. Heads on pikes is not an uncommon phrase. I hate to say it when you're talking about consequences politically, electorally, that's one of the things people say maybe they shouldn't, but it's not so beyond the pale to imagine that a White House political advisor, whether it's Eric Ueland or Rahm Emanuel, frankly, would talk like that. So, that's number one. But I think the broader point is, remember, it was first that Nancy Pelosi used too many signing pens, right?\n\nAnd then it was Jerry Nadler used the word treachery and then it was heads on pikes, and then it was Elizabeth Warren, asked the question of the Chief Justice that got someone's nose out of joint. And my friend Sheldon Whitehouse, you know, we were sort of ruminating on what they do here because certainly you don't want to give them any openings to claim grievances and outrage but in the end, you can't execute perfectly and give them the aperture for outrage because they're looking for one.\n\nAnd especially in that moment, when Adam Schiff had the room and I could feel their guilt emanating almost had a physical sensation of how they were experiencing their conscience for that moment. And then he quoted the heads on pikes thing, and then Tom Cotton started shouting and James Lankford, you know, and what they found was, what Sheldon Whitehouse called the \"outrage offramp\". That whatever Trump is doing, it is only just as bad as whatever the Democrats did.\n\nMH: That's their get out, obviously. And one the reasons I enjoy following you on Twitter, Senator, is you're one of the few high profile Democrats who's willing to basically call out the fact that the Republicans now, the vast majority of them, are bad faith actors, you can't really take seriously a lot of what they say and their media enablers.\n\nBS: Yeah, I mean, it's  sad for me to say but there are no moderates. You know, now the Cable News World characterizes the moderate as someone who doesn't decide instantly the most right wing thing, but eventually comes around. Pat Toomey's a moderate. Rob Portman's a moderate. Pat Roberts is a moderate. I mean, they're not. I mean, that doesn't mean I'm never able to work with any of them. But the idea that you get your moderate card by not immediately racing to the Ted Cruz position is a sign of how much we've lowered the bar and I certainly hope that people who used to find themselves attracted to conservative principles understand that it's not really a small-c Conservative Party, this is a corporatist party and they are Trump's party.\n\nMH: It's a Trump party indeed. Just before we finish on Trump himself, now that he's got this acquittal from his party, with the exception of Mitt Romney, what does this mean politically for him? Is this good for him? Is he emboldened? Can he kind of do a victory lap? Or is he going to do more reckless, crazy criminal stuff, like he did after the Mueller report failed to land a blow?\n\nBS: I have a hard time seeing around too many corners right now. I think there are a lot of variables here both in terms of his behavior and what he believes to be his political imperatives. I mean, the one thing that I think is worth remembering, you know, there's a lot of retrospective analysis of the 2016 race. But one of the things that people forget is that - I don't want to, I'm not sure whether it's three or five weeks or even less, I don't know, I don't remember. But at the end of the race, Donald Trump stuck to a script. And so I think when he needs to, he's going to contain his worst political instincts and do poll-tested stuff and look plausible for just long enough to try to capture back, you know, high income white women and the suburbs. So, I don't think we should, I really believe that our strategy cannot depend on Donald Trump doing insane things because while that may happen, he may pull it together for seven weeks that he knows his political life and possibly his freedom depends on it.\n\nMH: And you have no regrets about anything to do with his impeachment, how it was handled by the Democrats?\n\nBS: No, I mean, I think in the big picture, we got everything right. I think the House managers did really well. You know, everybody who's a lawyer or like an amateur lawyer, like me, has an idea of what should have been included in the articles like, my hobby horse was always the Emoluments Clause of the Constitution because I think there's such a clear violation but I think part of what what ended up in the articles was a function of what could get a majority in the House, and I don't think that those moderate Democrats who were just elected lots of with national security credentials were ready to impeach on emoluments. They were particularly offended by this because it had foreign policy and national security implications and it's a Democratic process so you know, I lost out on that, but overall I thought manager Schiff, Jefferies, Zoe Lofgren, the whole team was extraordinary and I'm proud to be a Democrat and I would just say we just have to go win this election.\n\nMH: And on that note, last last question, who's gonna win the election for you? Do you have a candidate?\n\nBS: I have no candidate and that's just me being careful. I don't have a candidate. I like a lot of them personally. I work with a lot of them personally. I would be thrilled to charge up the mountain for any of the major frontrunners.\n\nMH: Including Bernie?\n\nBS: Yes.\n\nMH: Okay, Senator Brian Schatz, thanks so much for joining me on Deconstructed.\n\nBS: Thank you very much.\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nMH: That was Senator Brian Schatz of Hawaii. Reminding us that this impeachment trial has not just been about Ukraine or foreign policy or national security or the Bidens, but it's also reminded us of the importance of having checks and balances of having limits on presidential power, so that you have an elected president bound by the Constitution, not a functional monarch, and that you have a party in Congress that stands up for the country, and isn't just a Trump cult.\n\nAnyways, next week, we won't be talking impeachment, but we will be talking law and order, crime and punishment, mass incarceration, and the crisis in America's prison system. How do you fix the criminal injustice system in the United States? That's the question I'll be asking my special guests: John legend, musician, activist, philanthropist, and Patrisse Cullors, activist, co-founder of Black Lives Matter. You can get tickets to be in the audience in LA next Monday, February 10. That special edition of Deconstructed will air later in the week.\n\n[Music interlude.]\n\nMH: That's our show for today!

The bad guys.\"\n\n\"I thought you said Kurds,\" a sheepish Trump replied.\n\nRead Our Complete Coverage\n\nGot that? Candidate Trump confused the Quds Force, an elite Iranian military unit then led by high-profile Maj. Gen. Qassim Suleimani, with the Kurds, a high-profile ethnic group in the Middle East.\n\nNow fast forward four years and four months to yesterday, when President Trump ordered the assassination of Suleimani from his golf course . In an official statement that misstated the name of the organization that Suleimani was in charge of, the Pentagon said the strike was \"aimed at deterring future Iranian retaliation plans.\"\n\nThis is not a column, however, about the consequences of the U.S. government assassinating the second-most powerful man in Iran (spoiler: they're going to be dire !). Nor is it a column about the legality of such a deadly strike on a foreign official on foreign soil (spoiler: it's hard to justify !).\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nRather, this is a column that allows me to express my ongoing astonishment that Donald Trump is president of the United States ; my ongoing bewilderment with a world in which an unhinged, know-nothing former reality TV star and property developer, with zero background in foreign affairs or national security, may have just kicked off World War III. (From his golf course, no less.)\n\nIt's also a column that allows me to revisit what I have long considered to be the most unforgivable take of the 2016 presidential race: \" Donald The Dove, Hillary the Hawk .\" That was the ridiculous headline to the New York Times column from Maureen Dowd in April 2016, in which she falsely claimed that Trump had opposed the Iraq War \"like Obama,\" and then credulously suggested that, in contrast to Clinton, \"he would rather do the art of the deal than shock and awe.\"\n\nA reminder: Trump pulled out of the landmark Iran nuclear deal less than 18 months after assuming office. He replaced his predecessor's nuclear diplomacy with a \" maximum pressure \" campaign on Tehran, which had pushed the United States and the Islamic Republic to the brink of war even before this latest dangerous escalation.\n\nDowd was wholly, utterly, and embarrassingly wrong - as some of us tried to explain at the time. But it wasn't just her. Plenty of other people across the political spectrum foolishly bought into the ludicrous premise that Trump would be some sort of dove , a noninterventionist , an old-fashioned isolationist .\n\nAnd plenty of my colleagues in the media continue to push this deluded view. Remember: Trump has twice bombed the Assad regime in Syria; reduced Mosul and Raqqa to rubble; vetoed a congressional attempt to end U.S. involvement in the Saudi bombardment of Yemen; and overseen a fivefold increase in drone strikes throughout the region and beyond. Yet on New Year's Eve, the New York Times still insisted on bizarrely referring to \"the president's reluctance to use force in the Middle East.\"\n\nThat line, of course, hasn't aged so well. Less than 72 hours later, the commander of Iran's Quds Force and the deputy head of the Iran-backed militias in Iraq, are dead. Killed via drone .\n\nThe United States has now effectively declared war on Iran. This is no longer a \" cold \" war or a \" shadow \" war. It's a war-war. And here's what so terrifying about it: The current commander-in-chief of the U.S. military as it readies for open conflict with Tehran is the guy who last week accused Canada's prime minister of cutting him out of a Canadian TV version of \"Home Alone 2\"; who regularly retweets QAnon, Pizzagate, and white nationalist accounts on Twitter; who believes that Ukraine is in possession of a nonexistent Democratic National Committee server; who thinks climate change is a Chinese hoax; who wants to use nuclear weapons to stop hurricanes; and who is willing to take a Sharpie to an official government map in order to prove he was right about the weather (when he was, in fact, 100 percent wrong ).\n\nDeconstructed Podcast Mehdi Hasan unpacks the most consequential news of the week. Listen and subscribe.\n\nDeconstructed Podcast\n\nHere's the twist, though: There were two recent amendments to the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, in the House of Representatives that might have prevented this week's escalation with Iran: Rep. Ro Khanna's amendment to block funding for any military action against Iran that lacks congressional approval, and Rep. Barbara Lee's amendment to repeal the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force. Both of these amendments, however, were stripped from the final NDAA that passed the House and Senate - with the approval of elected Democrats in both chambers.\n\nShame on those Democrats.\n\nAnd God help the rest of us.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Trump's State of the Union Address Reveals His Growing Anxiety Over Encroaching Left-Wing Populism\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nWithout being able to point to policies that have materially improved lives, Trump is forced to argue that his paltry efforts have made America great.\n\nPresident Donald Trump arrives before delivering the State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol Building on Feb. 5, 2019 in Washington, D.C.\n\nLast night's State of the Union address and rebuttals were a fight over what constitutes \"real America.\" They weren't a rehash of the debate about whether American authenticity is clustered at the coasts or spread out over the heartland. Rather, it was a contest for which politician, party, or movement has the most accurate assessment of what it feels like to be American today.\n\nThis is Trump's home turf, or it used to be. Since he launched his presidential bid in June 2015, he's painted a picture of an America in disarray. \"Our country is in terrible trouble,\" he said back then. \"We don't have victories anymore.\" He evoked Mexicans invading and Chinese people stealing jobs. \"When was the last time you saw a Chevrolet in Tokyo? It doesn't exist, folks. They beat us all the time,\" he said.\n\nThe media at the time hashed and rehashed Trump's remarks, fact checking lies and condemning his racism, laughing all the way . Trump's candidacy was a joke, they said - a clumsy Charybdis of falsehoods and xenophobia that would swallow itself before it caused too much trouble. But of course, those predictions were wrong.\n\nWhat most missed then, but which should be obvious now, is that between his bigoted bromides, Trump was painting a picture of an America that felt more familiar to millions of viewers than anything they'd been served for years.\n\nHe acknowledged that although unemployment numbers were low and declining, the \"real unemployment\" numbers were higher - \"anywhere from 18 to 20 percent.\"\n\n\"Don't believe the 5.6,\" he warned during that first Trump Tower address. \"Don't believe it.\"\n\n\"A lot of people up there can't get jobs,\" he said. Health care costs were going up. We spent relatively more on education, with fewer returns. Deductibles were \"going through the roof.\" Obamacare needed to be replaced with something \"much better for everybody.\" The infrastructure, airports, roads, \"everything\" was like \"a third world country.\" And the thing is, he wasn't all wrong.\n\nHe struck his darkest note on his first day in office, during his inaugural address:\n\nMothers and children trapped in poverty in our inner cities; rusted-out factories scattered like tombstones across the landscape of our nation; an education system, flush with cash, but which leaves our young and beautiful students deprived of knowledge; and the crime and gangs and drugs that have stolen too many lives and robbed our country of so much unrealized potential.\n\nTrump was successful in large part because he is impressively adept at diagnosing America's problems. \"Make America Great Again\" is not only a regressive slogan that recalls more prejudiced and unequal historical periods fondly; it's also an acknowledgement that America, as it is, needs improvement. Or as Barack Obama put it, it could be \" more perfect .\" In 2016, the Democratic Party at times lost sight of the fact that making America great was a goal shared by both parties. Instead, it defaulted into \" America is already great , \" offering a platitude which couldn't compete with the reality of unpaid bills and soaring health care costs.\n\nIncreasingly, however, Trump is in a political pickle - one that flows from a promise made during that inaugural address: \" This American carnage stops right here and stops right now.\" Trump's brand is diagnosing America's ills, but as he ages into his incumbency, those ills increasingly manifest on his watch, and he's forced to lean more heavily on new manufactured crises that can't be attributed to his leadership.\n\nAs in his January Oval Office address, Trump's State of the Union remarks were full of inaccurate fearmongering about the border . He criticized the high cost of health care and, in a somewhat unexpected turn, the scourge of childhood cancers and HIV.\n\nBut now it is Trump who must defend his record. It's Trump who feels pressured to make the case that America is already great.\n\nIn the first portion of his remarks, he did exactly that. He celebrated combat veterans from WWII (when America presumably was great) and then lauded American astronauts who are \"once again\" going into space, drawing a rhetorical line between these achievements. He bragged about an \"unprecedented economic boom\" - a boom that started before his presidency and continues despite it - and held up low unemployment numbers as evidence of his leadership prowess.\n\nThe Trump who advised Americans to consider \"real unemployment\" numbers is long gone. In his place stands a man so eager to defend his record that he reported employment statistics, his best Trump card, four different ways so as to magnify the impression of his success: \"5.3 million new jobs\"; \"600,000 new manufacturing jobs\"; blue-collar jobs, growing faster than anyone else thought possible; more people working than at any time during American history. Jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs, jobs.\n\nTrump's focus on jobs numbers is understandable given how little else he has to brag about: Cutting more regulations in two years than any other administration had done in four; a transparent greed-driven tax cut for millionaires and billionaires that's growing more difficult to spin as tax season approaches and Americans start to see the consequences on their returns; America becoming the world's No. 1 oil producer at a time when scientific consensus says that oil dependence is a death sentence. The accomplishments enumerated during last night's address were underwhelming at best.\n\nBut what's important to note here is that Trump is facing is the impotence of incumbency. Without being able to point to policies that have materially improved people's lives, he's forced to argue that his paltry efforts have made America great. And given the state of the nation, that's no enviable position to be in.\n\nIn her reply , former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams was able to capitalize on Trump's new posture. To justify his lack of accomplishment, Trump had to invent a twisted fantasy-scape of marauding Mexican murderers, while tiptoeing around his broken promises with vague references to health care costs that didn't directly implicate his attacks on existing health care infrastructure.\n\nBut Abrams was free to fill the role Trump once played so well, accurately identifying America's problems: Voter suppression; farmers hobbled by a tariff war; factories closing; children caged at the border. Even Fox News pundits had to acknowledge : \"She seemed to get more to what people's lives are like in the reality.\" With a diverse crowd standing behind her and a message that gave voice to a broad range of concerns, Abrams won the fight over what America really looks like.\n\nAbrams deftly ran through the panoply of policy issues ignored by Trump, and offered a warm, compassionate alternative to Trump's drowsy teleprompter recital. Our strength as a country, she argued, is our ability to pull together to advance common goals. \" We may come from different sides of the political aisle, but our joint commitment to the ideals of this nation cannot be negotiable.\" Unfortunately, Abrams argued, Republicans have bargained away their commitment to the ideals shared by most Americans. \"Under the current administration, far too many hard-working Americans are falling behind, living paycheck to paycheck, most without labor unions to protect them from even worse harm. The Republican tax bill rigged the system against working people. Rather than bringing back jobs, plants are closing, layoffs are looming, and wages struggle to keep pace with the actual cost of living.\"\n\nHer message was concise and effective: \"With a renewed commitment to social and economic justice, we will create a stronger America together. Because America wins by fighting for our shared values against all enemies, foreign and domestic. That is who we are, and when we do so, never wavering, the state of our union will always be strong.\"\n\nAnd while centrist hacks (and complicit mainstream media outlets ) attempted to construe Sen. Bernie Sanders's State of the Union response as a racially motivated upstaging, his State of the Union response, which he has given for the past two years, was, in fact, a complement to Abrams's successful rebuttal.\n\nWhereas Abrams had only 10 minutes to respond, a limitation intrinsic to the party's official address, Sanders had the space to articulate, in detail, exactly where Trump went wrong. If winning the game is about accurately diagnosing the country's problems, then Bernie came to play.\n\n\"I want to talk to you about the major crisis facing our country that, regrettably, President Trump chose not to discuss,\" began Sanders. America is great again, he offered, appropriating Trump's thesis before flipping it on its head: At least it is \"for the members of his Mar-a-Lago country club.\"\n\n\"For many of President Trump's billionaire friends, the truth is they have never ever had it so good,\" argued Sanders. \"As Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. said, 'This country has socialism for the rich, and rugged individualism for the poor.'\" Today, as then, the economy is great for the rich. Twenty-five hedge fund managers on Wall Street made nearly twice as much as all 140,000 kindergarten teachers in America, explained Sanders. Meanwhile, the \"real wages for the average American worker are lower today then they were in 1972 ... 46 years ago.\" If Trump once wanted Americans to focus on \"real wages,\" Sanders was happy to oblige.\n\nSanders adroitly undermined Trump's claim that his leadership resulted in low unemployment numbers, pointing out that job creation tapered off during Trump's first year. He explained that the average worker received a raise of merely $1.60 a week, while \"the three richest people in America saw their wealth increase by more than $68 billion.\" He argued that Trump was right to want to address infrastructure, but wrong to try to privatize our highways - selling them off to the highest bidder for individual gain at the cost of citizens.\n\nSanders painted a clear picture of the winners and losers of the Trump era. Under this administration, Walmart, Pfizer, and other big corporations have paid out big bonuses to their CEOs while laying off employees - many of whom were already struggling to get by with the support of the social safety net. And the Vermont senator called Trump out for vowing to protect that social safety net as he supported cuts to Medicare, Medicaid, and Social Security.\n\nSanders pointedly highlighted Trump's hypocrisy about violence committed by undocumented immigrants, explaining that they commit less crime than natural-born Americans. He called out Trump for talking about the murder of Americans by an undocumented man in Nevada while staying silent about the deadliest incident of gun violence to ever happen in America, which also took place in Nevada in 2017. Sanders castigated Trump for failing to mention climate change, and for undermining the security of \"Dreamers.\"\n\nBut in the most powerful part of his address, Sanders didn't merely react to Trump. In an ad lib not captured in the official transcripts , Sanders asked the only question that really matters: \"Why don't you do what the American people want you to do rather than what wealthy campaign contributors want?\"\n\nWhat do the American people want? Sanders ran down the stats:\n\n... And on and on and on.\n\nA $15 minimum wage; free public college; government assistance for child care - what Americans want are progressive policies . So, Sanders asked, \"why isn't Congress and the White House doing what the American people want them to do?\"\n\nThe answer is not complicated, he explained in a familiar but still salient refrain. \"The answer has everything to do with the power of the monied interests.\" Greed is destroying the nation, says Sanders, not Mexicans. The 1 percent is the source of American hardship, not the border.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIn a separate response for the Working Families Party, Mandela Barnes, Wisconsin's new lieutenant governor and a rising progressive star, hit some of the same notes as Sanders, singling out the wealthy few as a barrier to social justice advocacy. \" We need a movement that sees our fights for economic justice, and racial justice, and climate justice, and for a real and reflective democracy as all bound up together,\" he said . \"Our movement seeks not only to change what is possible, but what is expected. We must commit ourselves to an America that works for the many, not the few.\"\n\nSenator Bernie Sanders looks at his notes as he watches the State of the Union address at the U.S. Capitol Building on Feb. 5, 2019 in Washington, D.C.\n\nThere was perhaps no greater testament to the power of Sanders's reframing than the fact that Trump's remarks seemed to anticipate not the official Democratic Party's response, but rather the rhetoric most famously advanced by Sanders and fellow democratic socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\n\" Here, in the United States,\" said Trump, \"we are alarmed by new calls to adopt socialism in our country. America was founded on liberty and independence - and not government coercion, domination, and control. We are born free, and we will stay free.\"\n\nBut Sanders, who was spotted scribbling notes during Trump's address, was prepared to respond to this line of attack: \" Trump said, 'We are born free, and we will stay free.' Well, I say to President Trump: People are not truly free when they can't afford to go to the doctor when they are sick. People are not truly free when they cannot afford to buy the prescription drugs they desperately need. People are not truly free when they are unable to retire with dignity. People are not truly free when they are exhausted because they are working longer and longer hours for low wages. People are not truly free when they cannot afford a decent place in which to live. People certainly are not free when they cannot afford to feed their families.\"\n\nBy the end of Sanders's remarks, it was clear why Trump felt the need to call out socialism. Genuine, progressive populism - messaging that put society's and people's interests first - is a threat to Trump's oligarchy-dressed-in-populist-clothing. Ocasio-Cortez agrees.\n\n\"I think that he needs to do it because he feels like - he feels himself losing on the issues,\" Ocasio-Cortez told Rachel Maddow following Trump's remarks. \"Every single policy proposal that we have adopted and presented to the American public has been overwhelmingly popular, even some with a majority of Republican voters supporting what we're talking about.\"\n\n\"I think he sees himself losing on the issues, he sees himself losing on the wall in the southern border, and he needs to grasp at an ad hominem attack, and this is his way of doing it. What we need to realize is happening is this is an issue of authoritarian regime versus democracy. In order for him to try to dissuade or throw people off the scent of the trail, he has to really make and confuse the public. And I think that that's exactly what he's trying to do.\"\n\nOcasio-Cortez is right; fear tactics and money only go so far. To paraphrase both Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders: They've got money, but we've got people.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Democrats, Please Don't Mess This Up. Impeach Trump for All His Crimes, Not Just for Ukraine.\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nImpeaching Trump only for Ukraine would give him a clean bill of health on everything else, like his obstruction of the Mueller investigation.\n\nSpeaker of the House Nancy Pelosi speaks to the media on Sept. 25, 2019, after meeting with the House Democratic caucus one day after announcing that the House will start a formal impeachment inquiry against President Donald Trump.\n\nAre Democrats preparing to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory? Speaker Nancy Pelosi's announcement on Tuesday that the House of Representatives would hold an \" official impeachment inquiry \" over Trump's phone call with the president of Ukraine, and his request for dirt on Joe Biden and his son Hunter, was a welcome one. But on Wednesday, according to several reports , \"Pelosi and senior House Democrats agreed in a private meeting ... that they should narrow their impeachment investigation of President Trump to his dealings with the president of Ukraine.\"\n\nTo be clear: There is now a majority in the House for impeachment, especially with the publication of the whistleblower complaint on Thursday, which reveals how \"the President of the United States is using the power of his office to solicit interference from a foreign country in the 2020 U.S. election.\" House Democrats - even in swing seats - have united on this issue and see Trump as a clear threat to national security. It looks like a slam dunk.\n\nRead our Complete Coverage All the President's Crimes\n\nRead our Complete Coverage\n\nSo how then might this end up as a defeat, and not a victory? Think about it. For House Democrats to wait this long and then impeach a reckless, lawless, racist, tax-dodging president only over his interactions with the president of Ukraine would be to effectively give Trump a clean bill of health on everything else . Going into an election year, Democrats would be unilaterally disarming - unable to offer further substantive criticisms of Trump's crimes and abuses of power across the board. \"Why didn't you impeach him for it?\" Republicans will ask.\n\nForgive me if I have no faith in the House Democratic leadership, which has never missed an opportunity to miss an opportunity. The same political geniuses who dragged their feet on impeachment until 48 hours ago, after ridiculously having suggested the president was \" goading \" his opponents into impeaching him, are now telling us to trust them, that they know best, that Ukraine is the be-all and end-all of this impeachment inquiry.\n\nDeconstructed Podcast\n\nThankfully, not all Democrats agree. On Deconstructed this week, Julián Castro - who in April became the first Democratic presidential candidate to call for Trump's impeachment - told me he wants to see congressional Democrats go for a broad impeachment inquiry because of \"clear evidence that there may be other violations of the law.\" As Castro explains, the ultimate goal of impeachment is not to score a political or partisan point but to \"show the American people that nobody is above the law.\"\n\nSo what's the reason to narrow the scope of what should be a historic inquiry? \"I think we need to focus on what this very clear threat to national security and to our Constitution is,\" Rep. Debbie Dingell, a close ally of Pelosi, told the Washington Post , referring to the Ukraine angle. \"I think we need to focus on something that everybody understands.\"\n\n\"We are going to focus on this particular matter,\" announced House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, adding that it's \"not hard to understand.\"\n\nDo these Democrats take the public for fools? Few would dispute the uniqueness or seriousness of these Ukraine revelations. But are they really saying \"everybody understands\" Trump's quid pro quo with the president of a foreign country, and the details of the specific case involving Hunter Biden, but not the illegal payment of hush money to a porn star? Or all of the corrupt behavior on display in front of their eyes? The brazen self-dealing ? The daily violation of the emoluments clause?\n\nRead a poll. A majority of Americans happen to agree with ( literally ) 1,000 former federal prosecutors that the president obstructed justice and don't believe the Mueller report exonerated Trump. A majority also agree that Trump is a racist and a liar , and that corruption has increased on his watch. Trump is a historically unpopular and disliked president - and for a variety of reasons.\n\nRead a history book. In 1868, Andrew Johnson became the first president to be impeached and, in his case, the House of Representatives adopted 11 articles of impeachment , ranging from his violation of the Tenure of Office Act to his attempt to \"disgrace\" Congress. A little over a century later, in 1974, the House Judiciary Committee passed three lengthy and detailed articles of impeachment against Richard Nixon, covering obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and contempt of Congress. The first of those articles even cited Nixon's \"false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States\" and his efforts \"to cause prospective defendants, and individuals duly tried and convicted, to expect favored treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony, or rewarding individuals for their silence or false testimony.\" (Sound familiar?)\n\nRead Trump's tweets. Since Tuesday afternoon, the president who was supposedly going to \" self-impeach \" has been ranting and raving online, calling Pelosi's announcement a \" total witch hunt ,\" \" scam ,\" \" garbage ,\" and \" presidential harassment .\" Trump, who was 17 when John F. Kennedy was assassinated, even claimed , \"There has been no President in the history of our Country who has been treated so badly as I have.\"\n\nDoes this sound like a president who wants to be impeached? Or, rather, a president who is (rightly) concerned that a wide-ranging impeachment inquiry could uncover a wide range of new scandals and crimes?\n\n\"He looks hunted,\" wrote MSNBC's Chris Hayes. So why hold back now? Why put all the impeachment eggs in the Ukraine basket? Why not make the strongest case possible and dig deep into Trump's record over the past 2 1/2 years as a whole? Did Democrats learn no lessons from the Russia investigation? \"We're here in the first place because the exclusive approach failed with Mueller,\" tweeted the New Republic's Osita Nwanevu.\n\nAnd what's with the rush to get this done \"by the end of the year or even sooner,\" as Politico reports? Is there somewhere else that House Democrats need to be? Are they in a hurry to get back to passing bills that then get blocked by the same Republican-controlled Senate that will be voting down their articles of impeachment? Why not take a lesson from the GOP playbook? During the Obama presidency, the Republican-led Benghazi Select Committee held \"33 hearings over more than two years into a topic that had already been investigated by seven other Congressional committees.\"\n\nWe're independent of corporate interests - and powered by members.

Whether or not he is removed from office is beside the point; the point is for Congress to hold the president to account by demanding documents and scheduling televised hearings on a range of potentially impeachable offenses - and winning over public opinion in the process.\n\nFor House Democrats to try and hive off Trump's corrupt, lawless, and authoritarian behavior over Ukraine and Biden from his corrupt, lawless, and authoritarian behavior over his taxes, or Mueller, or Stormy Daniels, or Puerto Rico , or the Squad , or Amazon - I could go on and on - is madness.

The move could strip hundreds of thousands of federal workers of their union protections.\n\nPresident Donald Trump speaks to the press before signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on March 26, 2025. (Win McNamee / Getty Images)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has taken significant steps to limit union rights for many federal workers through a new executive order . The Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announced Thursday that Trump's order instructs numerous government agencies to terminate their collective bargaining agreements and cease union negotiations, potentially stripping hundreds of thousands of federal employees of union representation.\n\nA White House fact sheet accompanying the order states that the Civil Service Reform Act of 1978, which allowed government workers to unionize, \"enables hostile Federal unions to obstruct agency management.\"\n\nThe administration is invoking an arcane provision in the Civil Service Reform Act claiming that collective bargaining rights can be terminated in instances where unions pose a national security threat. The administration's sudden reliance on this never-before-used rule - coming at the crescendo of open conflict with federal employee unions - suggests the national security justification is merely a convenient pretext for a strong-arm tactic in a broader power struggle against the federal workforce.\n\nThis executive order marks a dramatic escalation in the administration's hostility toward organized labor, reflecting a broader pattern of undermining worker protections . By dismantling decades of labor relations infrastructure overnight, the administration has signaled its contempt for the principle that workers deserve a say in their workplace conditions. The sweeping nature of the order - targeting eighteen departments under the guise of national security - reveals the administration's true aim: to silence dissent and weaken institutions that challenge presidential power. The administration has made similar national security claims , and likewise reached for arcane anti-immigrant laws , to justify detaining and deporting Palestine solidarity activists.\n\nUnion leaders see the move as politically motivated retaliation for standing up to the Trump administration's attacks on the federal workforce, including aggressive layoffs prompted by Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). Colin Smalley, president of Local 777 of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers (IFPTE) and an organizer with the Federal Unionists Network (FUN), told Jacobin that Trump's order is \"absolutely a brazen political attack on workers.\"\n\n\"You don't have to look further than the fact sheet that the White House put out on this, which at the bottom talks about how the president feels slighted by federal unions and is offended by the fact that we assert our rights,\" Smalley said. \"This isn't so much about a legitimate exercise of executive power as it is an act of political retribution.\"\n\nThe language in the White House fact sheet indeed contains confrontational rhetoric, which Smalley describes as \"belligerent.\" The document claims that \"certain Federal unions have declared war on President Trump's agenda\" and describes the largest federal union as \"fighting back\" against Trump. It also states that \"President Trump refuses to let union obstruction interfere with his efforts\" and \"will not tolerate mass obstruction,\" framing the issue as a direct conflict between the president and federal workers.\n\nThe American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), representing 800,000 civil servants, strongly condemned the action , calling it illegal and saying it was preparing legal challenges. AFGE president Everett Kelley called it \"a disgraceful and retaliatory attack\" on workers \"simply because they are members of a union that stands up to [Trump's] harmful policies.\"\n\nAFL-CIO president Liz Shuler also condemned the order , saying it is \"the very definition of union-busting.\" Shuler characterized Trump's order as \"punishment for unions who are leading the fight against the administration's illegal actions in court\" and a \"blatant attempt to silence\" workers critical of the Trump administration and unwilling to endure budget cuts and mass layoffs without fighting back\n\nThe executive order represents the latest chapter in Trump's long-standing conflict with the federal workforce, against which he has long nursed a grudge, considering it part of the \"deep state.\" As the New York Times reported last November, predicting the assault on the federal workforce that indeed began nearly immediately after Trump retook office, \"Few notions have consumed the once and future president more than the belief that his executive power has been constrained by a cabal of unelected bureaucrats.\"\n\nTrump began his 2024 election campaign with a rally in Waco, Texas , where he framed the federal bureaucracy as a national adversary, declaring, \"Either the deep state destroys America, or we destroy the deep state.\" Waco is famously the site of the 1993 siege and deadly standoff between federal agents and the Branch Davidian religious group, an event that became a rallying symbol for anti-government movements and right-wing militia groups that viewed it as federal government overreach and abuse of power.\n\nWhile the current labor struggle is inflected with Trump's views about the federal bureaucracy specifically, its implications extend beyond government employment. According to Joseph A. McCartin, director of Georgetown University's Kalmanovitz Initiative for Labor and the Working Poor, the current administration's actions against federal workers could have far-reaching consequences for workers' rights. \"As the nation's largest employer, the federal government's labor relations policies inevitably ripple across the economy, influencing how employers of all kinds behave,\" McCartin wrote in Dissent magazine last month.\n\nThe move echoes President Ronald Reagan's 1981 firing of over 11,000 striking air traffic controllers , which historians widely view as a turning point that emboldened private sector union busting. Unlike Reagan, who targeted one specific union as a show of force during a strike, Trump's executive order broadly eliminates collective bargaining rights across many agencies. But the actions are similar, broadcasting a zero-tolerance policy on worker organizing that challenges the president's authority and sending a clear message to employers that aggressive anti-union tactics have the administration's blessing.\n\nSmalley points to a power struggle dating back to Trump's first administration, when the White House frequently clashed with federal unions. \"There were a number of things that [Trump and his team] tried to accomplish that were frustrated by the process that's been established in the federal sector labor relations statute,\" Smalley told Jacobin . \"The fact that they have to comply with the rules and can't just do whatever they want really bothered them the first time around. And this time, they are moving to do it anyway.\"\n\nThe administration is using national security as a pretext, but the scope of its order extends far beyond agencies explicitly concerned with security matters. While it includes the departments of Homeland Security, Defense, State, and Veterans Affairs, it also covers the Treasury Department, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Science Foundation, and the General Services Administration, among others. It follows a similar directive from the Department of Homeland Security specifically targeting the Transportation Security Administration workers' union.\n\nFollowing the termination of collective bargaining agreements, the administration has outlined several immediate changes. These include shortening the timeline for performance improvement plans to no more than thirty days, requiring a swift return to in-person work, and ending government collection of union dues.\n\nWhile the executive order represents a major setback for federal unions, Smalley notes that workers have faced similar challenges before and have continued to organize effectively. The rights that are currently being stripped were won through decades of struggle .\n\n\"Federal workers didn't have legally recognized collective bargaining rights until the 1970s. It's been a little less than fifty years that this law has been on the books,\" Smalley said. \"Prior to that, for more than half a century, federal workers still formed unions, and they still turned to each other to achieve gains in their working conditions through collective action.\"\n\nSmalley emphasized that despite the order, organizing efforts will continue. \"We're going to be taking our cues from history,\" he told Jacobin . \"We're still going to be just as aggressive in trying to make sure that our agencies are able to deliver for the American public, and we're going to be just as aggressive in protecting all of the various workplace rights that workers have won over the years.\"\n\nWhile national unions are \"focused on the logistics and the legal arguments they're going to be making in response to this,\" Smalley said, the Federal Unionists Network will \"be focusing on how we turn our attention to the work of organizing with each other and supporting each other even when the whole terrain of how we assert our rights is shifting.\"\n\nMeagan Day is an associate editor and former staff writer at Jacobin .

The cuts are starting to mobilize the conservative-leaning demographic against the administration.\n\nMary Jean Burke, first executive vice president of the American Federation of Government Employees National VA Council, speaks during a rally against Donald Trump's policies, outside the Department of Veterans' Affairs headquarters in Washington, DC, on February 13, 2025.

Their shock and dismay surfaced in Washington, DC, this month during the legislative conference of the reliably conservative and hawkish Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW), which has 1.4 million members.\n\nIn the run-up to that annual event, VFW national commander Al Lipphardt urged his members to \"march forth\" and \"engage with lawmakers\" to \"stop the bleeding\" at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Thanks to Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), the VA now faces disruption of its benefit claims handling , health care delivery , data security, critical medical research , and stable employment for one hundred thousand former service members.\n\nThe VFW's resulting Capitol Hill visit on March 4 was not exactly the second coming of the militant march on Washington, in 1932, by 30,000 jobless World War 1 vets. During that confrontation, leaders of the VFW and American Legion provided political cover for Herbert Hoover, the conservative Republican president who ignored veteran unemployment (and, like Trump, championed small government). Now the VFW's condemnation of Trump's mass firing of vets is such a welcome break with past Veteran Service Organizations (VSO) subservience to the White House that even some VSO critics are impressed. Iraq War vet and VFW life member Kris Goldsmith calls it \"historic\" and \"nothing short of extraordinary.\"\n\nNevertheless, as Goldsmith argues, it will take a lot more than issuing press statements, presenting hearing testimony, and politely lobbying legislators to stop the further \"bleeding\" that will result from a VA \"reorganization\" first reported March 5.\n\nAccording to an internal memo , Trump's new VA secretary, Doug Collins, intends to cut 80,000 more jobs - contrary to the confirmation hearing testimony he gave to the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee (SVAC) on January 21. On that occasion, the ex-congressman from Georgia assured his former Capitol Hill colleagues that \"we're not going to sacrifice veterans' benefits to do a budget.\" This helped the right-wing Air Force Reserve chaplain get confirmed, with virtually no SVAC opposition, and by a 77-23 Senate vote in his favor.\n\nDespite the leaked document from VA headquarters, President Trump insists that he will still \"take good care of our veterans\" and wants to keep the total number losing their federal jobs \"as small as possible.\" Meanwhile, he boasted of \"having great success at slimming down our government,\" which was a major focus of his recent joint address to Congress. During the hundred-minute rant, Trump didn't mention veterans or Collins even once, despite his various shout-outs to cops, firefighters, border patrol officers, and other cabinet members.\n\nAs part of the Democrats' response to what Sen. Tim Kaine calls a \"war on veterans,\" Kaine and others in Trump's audience brought along guests who served in the military. All were just fired by the VA and other federal agencies, where vets comprise about 30 percent of the workforce.\n\nWhen one dismissed Forest Service worker, Iraq War vet Jacob Bushno, approached his congressman back home for help, he got no response from Mike Bost, the Republican chair of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee. (Instead, Bushno heard from the office of Sen. Tammy Duckworth, the Illinois Democrat and former Army helicopter pilot who became a double amputee when she was shot down in Iraq.) Noting that Republicans like Bost always wrap themselves in the flag, Bushno told the New York Times that \"he hadn't seen any patriotism out of them since this has been going down.\"\n\nThis emerging rift between right-wing Republicans and one part of their electoral base might be further deepened through more grassroots activism by veterans and their organizations, VA caregivers and their patients, federal worker unions, and even their often- unreliable Democratic allies.\n\nOn February 19, there was plenty of blue-state outrage on display when members and friends of the Federal Unionists Network (FUN) protested DOGE in rallies from the West Coast to New York City, where one thousand people gathered in Lower Manhattan's Foley Square to hear speakers like longtime VA defender Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.\n\nOutside a Tesla dealership in San Francisco, Army veteran and VA patient Ricardo Ortiz told a crowd of three hundred about the struggle of working-class vets to create a health care system, based on public provision of care instead of for-profit medical treatment. That achievement is now at risk, he warned, because of bipartisan efforts to privatize the VA-run Veterans Health Administration.\n\nNow many red-state victims of the Trump-Musk purge are speaking out as well, taking their personal stories to media outlets and public meetings around the country. Army veteran Nelson Feliz Sr lost his job in the first wave of VA layoffs, which Collins claimed would \"not negatively impact VA healthcare, benefits, or beneficiaries.\"\n\n\"We've been betrayed,\" Feliz told Channel 2 News in Atlanta : \"I was a first sergeant. My job was to take care of troops, making sure they were paid, fed, and slept. Why is this happening to us? I've been here too long for this to be happening.\"\n\nBoth Bushno, the now unemployed National Forest Service worker in Illinois, and Feliz were among the 6,000 vets affected by the dismissal of 20,000 federal workers still in probationary status. In Bushno's case, he was let go seven days before his one-year probationary period ended, a decision he is appealing.\n\nFeliz was fired despite having been a VA employee for more than twelve years; he had recently started a new position but had not completed the required probationary period for that. The \"Notice of Termination\" he received via email stated that \"the agency finds, based on your performance, you have not demonstrated that your further employment would be in the public interest.\" This and other indiscriminate dismissals have been the subject of an ongoing legal challenge by the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), the progressive veterans' group Common Defense, and other plaintiffs.\n\nAFGE local union leaders like Rebecca Reinhold, vice president of Local 85 at the VA in Leavenworth, Kansas, have been taking the fight directly to Republican members of Congress when they dare to show up for constituent meetings in their districts. This is already a risky decision for many of these congresspeople due to growing popular anger about impending Medicaid and Medicare cuts.\n\nIn Reinhold's recent video-taped confrontation with Rep. Mark Alford at a town hall gathering, she reminded Alford that her 1,200 members provide critical services. \"We make sure veterans are cared for from the moment they become a veteran,\" she said. \"But you want to cut my job.\" In response, Alford insisted there would be \"appropriate funds for veterans\" and that any VA cuts \"would not affect services\" because \"we're going to make sure veterans are supported.\"\n\nIn Oakley, Kansas, Sen. Roger Marshall abruptly ended an already contentious town hall meeting when local resident Chuck Nunn questioned the wisdom of laying off so many veterans. His concern was shared by another member of the crowd who declared, \"I'm not a Democrat, but I'm worried about the veterans.\" Marshall did not respond to either comment and left the room hurriedly, amid jeers and boos.\n\nIn other House member encounters with voters in the southwest recently, it was the same story. Veteran Louis Smith drew approving applause from an East Texas audience when he warned Congressman Pete Sessions that \"the guy from South Africa [Elon Musk] is not doing you any good - he's hurting you more than he's helping.\" Rep. Stephanie Bice from Oklahoma heard, during a telephone town hall, from a self-identified Republican and former Army officer who demanded to know how \"some college whiz kids with a computer terminal in Washington, DC . . . have determined that it's OK to cut veterans benefits.\"\n\nThose skirmishes took place even before Secretary Collins doubled down on the bad news contained in the leaked memo from his chief of staff, Christopher Syrek, who comes to the VA from KPMG, a corporate consulting firm specializing in outsourcing strategies. In a March 5 video statement , Collins pledged his fealty to further elimination of \"waste and bureaucracy.\" He claimed that VA health care delivery would not be disrupted because no \"mission critical positions\" would be impacted. \"We'll be making major changes, so get used to it,\" he said.\n\nIn response, SVAC ranking member Sen. Richard Blumenthal displayed some buyer's remorse of his own. He accused Collins of planning job cuts to \"roll back the PACT Act\" - which expanded health care access to nearly a million post-9/11 veterans - and impeding the agency's \"ability to meet increased demand in order to justify privatizing VA.\"\n\nJust two months ago, Blumenthal and his fellow veteran on the committee, Sen. Ruben Gallego from Arizona, were among the twenty-two Senate Democrats voting to confirm Collins, along with longtime VA privatization foe Bernie Sanders (I-VT). As penance for that misguided display of VA-related bipartisanship on Capitol Hill, they will hopefully be holding town meetings soon themselves to rally their own distressed constituents, many of whom once donned military uniforms but are now feeling double-crossed by Chaplain Collins.\n\nSteve Early has been a DSA member for forty-two years, active in the Communications Workers of America even longer, and authored a book called Refinery Town: Big Oil, Big Money, and the Making of an American City , which profiled Jovanka Beckles and other leaders of the Richmond Progressive Alliance.\n\nSuzanne Gordon is the author of several reports and books on veterans' health care, including Wounds of War .

An enormous number of schools all around the country were either closed or had assemblies where students heard about the life and accomplishments of the martyred civil rights crusader.\n\nIt was also the first day of Donald Trump's second administration, and Trump signed an unprecedented number (twenty-six) of executive orders. Some were merely silly, like renaming the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America.\" Others are vastly more ominous, like the order mandating far more aggressive use of the death penalty .\n\nThe worst of the lot attempts to deny citizenship to people born in the United States whose parents aren't American citizens. While this isn't a homogeneous group, a large majority is presumably composed of the children of people from Mexico and Central America, hence the long-standing hostility to \"birthright\" citizenship by immigration hawks who seek to reduce this population.\n\nThe legal ground on which Trump stands on this issue could hardly be any shakier. The first sentence of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution baldly states that \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside.\" That seems fairly clear.\n\nThe White House is trying to find legal wiggle room within the phrase \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof,\" but this makes no sense on its face (as well as contradicting more than a century of consistent legal precedents). It's not as if either noncitizen immigrants or their American-born children have diplomatic immunity. A Mexican immigrant, with or without a green card, who's accused of a non-immigration-related crime in the United States will definitely be treated by the police and the courts as \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\" If Trump got his way and the estimated 150,000 children born in the United States to noncitizen parents every year were deprived of American citizenship, nothing would change in this regard.\n\nThe courts will almost certainly slap down this attempt to totally remake the meaning of the Fourteenth Amendment by presidential fiat. Indeed, by Tuesday, twenty-two states were suing the president (in two separate lawsuits) to block the order. But it says everything about the Trump White House's ugly plans for the next four years that one of the first acts of the newly sworn-in president was to celebrate Martin Luther King Jr Day by attempting to take away citizenship from millions of members of a racial and ethnic minority group.\n\nTrump's defenders often paint him as (a) an \"anti-interventionist\" in foreign policy and (b) an economic \"populist\" who sides with the working class (or at least the nonimmigrant portion of the working class) against \"elites.\" His track record during his first years in office is hard to square with either half of that picture, but many observers have let themselves dream that this time will be different. The day-one executive orders should dash this fantasy into a million pieces.\n\nOne order authorizes the domestic use of the military to stop the \"invasion\" of immigrants illegally crossing the US-Mexico border (although such crossings recently sunk to a four-year low ). Even more ominously, another designates Mexican drug cartels as \"foreign terrorist organizations.\" This could set the stage for exactly the kind of military intervention in Mexico that Trump has long contemplated in private and in public. Many of his most fervent supporters in the \"MAGA wing\" of the conservative movement make a big point of differentiating themselves from \"neocons\" and claiming to have learned from George W. Bush's disastrous wars in the Middle East. Yet here, to a chorus of their cheers, we have President Trump repeating the basic Bush-era pattern of waving around the magic word \"terrorism\" to open up the door to military adventurism.\n\nAnother order canceled Joe Biden's sanctions on the most violent Israeli settlers in the West Bank, who are apparently not \"terrorists\" despite their violent and politically motivated attacks on civilians. He also seems to be laying the legal groundwork to carry out his campaign promise to deport foreign students who participated in antiwar protests as Israel systematically drove millions of Gazans from their homes and killed more children in that tiny territory than had died in all the war zones in the world for years before.\n\nOh, and he restored the nonsensical designation of Cuba as a \"state sponsor of terrorism,\" which Biden had lifted at the end of the term. No one has bothered to explain what \"terrorism\" Cuba is responsible for, but no explanation is necessary. Like his rambling in his inauguration speech about taking back the Panama Canal and his appointment of the extremely hawkish Marco Rubio as Secretary of State, it's a sign that Trump plans to ferociously pursue American dominance of the empire's historic \"sphere of influence\" in Latin America.\n\nAnd if the orders make a mockery of \"Trump the dove,\" the same is true of \"Trump the pro-worker populist.\" America is the only country in the developed world and one of the only countries, period, that doesn't mandate that bosses provide even one lousy day of paid time off. Our regime of labor laws is , by global standards, bizarrely unfavorable to workers trying to band together and organize for better wages and working conditions, and we accordingly have a staggeringly low rate of private sector unionization. But the only obviously labor-related executive order in that very large pile was one to . . . force federal employees whose bosses currently allow them to work remotely to return to the office full time.\n\nElon Musk, the wealthiest man in the world and one of Trump's closest associates, crowed on the social media platform he owns that this is \"about fairness\" since most workers in the private sector (even ones whose job tasks could easily be done this way) aren't allowed to telecommute. The thought that fairness could be achieved by giving private sector workers more rather than public sector workers less is presumably unthinkable to Musk. \"Fairness,\" it seems, means a billionaire president tightening the screws on people who actually have to work for a living.\n\nIf these twenty-six orders are a good indication of what's coming, and there's no reason to think they're not, we're in for a grim four years.\n\nBen Burgis is a Jacobin columnist, an adjunct philosophy professor at Rutgers University, and the host of the YouTube show and podcast Give Them An Argument .

Trump claims to back the working class, but he has abandoned them at every turn.\n\nRight now, there are millions struggling to make ends meet, victims of circumstance who've lost their ability to work for a wage, or have seen their earnings dwindle for other \"Covidepression\"-related reasons, and are struggling to access adequate relief from a broken system.\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn early August, President Trump signed a series of executive orders aimed at providing economic relief to people struggling with lost earnings during the coronavirus pandemic. These allowed him to briefly play the hero, doing for struggling Americans what Congress couldn't or wouldn't do.\n\nBut as the pandemic drags on, it's clear that Trump's interventions were grossly inadequate to the scale of the crisis. If Congress doesn't act boldly and quickly on behalf of the tens of millions of Americans now experiencing acute financial distress, the economy is headed off a cliff and huge numbers of people will needlessly suffer.\n\nTrump's executive actions included student loan deferral and an eviction moratorium that basically amounted to rent deferral. Both are better than nothing, though they both also fall short : deferral is not forgiveness, and these measures essentially kick penalties down the road.\n\nIn his executive memorandum , Trump also noted that the CARES Act, which had provided an automatic $600 a week federal unemployment check on top of regular state unemployment, had expired in July without renewal or replacement from Congress, leaving tens of millions of people without money or options. In response to this failure, Trump ordered FEMA to step in and give unemployed workers $300 a week. This benefit is called Lost Wages Assistance (LWA).\n\nBut the LWA has proven insufficient for four reasons. First, the difference between $300 and $600 a week is stark. The $600 benefit was a considerable booster shot that kept twelve million people out of poverty and even lifted some out of it. The $300 LWA is certainly preferable to making people survive on state unemployment benefits alone - which is actually not possible anywhere in America - but it doesn't have nearly the same ameliorative effect.\n\nConsider that average rent for a two-bedroom apartment in the United States is over $1,300. The $600 benefit results in $2,400 a month, which means a single parent would be paying more than half of their federal unemployment check to rent, then using what's leftover plus weekly state unemployment benefits for groceries, utilities, etc. That's hardly tenable to begin with, but if the federal benefit plummets to $300 a week, or $1,200 a month, that's not even enough to cover rent. The state benefit has to make up the difference and cover all other living costs. That's a dramatic difference.\n\nSecond, not everyone who was eligible for the $600 benefit is eligible for the LWA payment. This means that the federal government isn't disbursing half of the benefits it was previously disbursing, but instead far less - an analysis by the Century Foundation actually shows that the federal payout is about a quarter of what it would be if the $600 a week benefit were renewed by Congress. Tens of thousands of people are boxed out of federal unemployment benefits entirely in the transition from the $600 benefit to the LWA.\n\nThird, the LWA rollout has been really slow. While the money for the benefits comes from the federal government, the benefits themselves are distributed through chaotic and dysfunctional state unemployment systems. The overwhelming majority of states that signed on to the program (which not every state did) either said they would start paying out the $300 LWA in mid-September or later, or gave no date at all, reporting that they needed to reprogram their computer systems.\n\nThe sluggish inefficiency has left many people relying solely on state unemployment benefits ever since the $600 federal unemployment benefit expired in July. \"That means most people on UI are now are forced to get by on the meager benefits that are in place without the extra payment, benefits which are typically around 40% of their pre-virus earnings,\" writes Heidi Shierholz at the Economic Policy Institute. \"It goes without saying that most folks can't exist on 40% of prior earnings without experiencing a sharp drop in living standards and enormous pain.\"\n\nAnd fourth, the LWA benefit was intended to be a stopgap measure until Congress approves another coronavirus relief package, which means it only lasts for six weeks. For those who accessed the benefit early, that time is already up. For others, their weekly income will be temporarily elevated, providing only a brief moment of respite, before it plummets back down to unsustainable levels. And Congress still hasn't budged.\n\nMeanwhile, many workers are exhausting their state unemployment benefits, which are often capped at six months. They can roll over to an extended benefits program, but it will last just over three months. Likewise, workers who are not eligible for ordinary state unemployment benefits (like gig workers) have been receiving a federal unemployment check, but that benefit is set to expire at the end of the year. All of this means that come the end of 2020, if significant and decisive action is not taken, there will be hell to pay.\n\nCongress must pass a bold coronavirus relief package before that happens. In fact, Congress must act immediately. Right now there are millions of people struggling to make ends meet through no fault of their own, victims of circumstance who've lost their ability to work for a wage, or have seen their earnings dwindle for other \"Covidepression\"-related reasons, and are struggling to access adequate relief from a broken system. The US government has already failed them, but every day that passes without comprehensive legislation makes the problem worse.\n\nIn truth, the best way to save the economy from collapse and make people's lives livable for the duration of the pandemic is to give every American $2,000 a month until the crisis is over, essentially \"deep-freezing\" the economy so it can thaw out when the crisis passes. Unfortunately, our politicians are too shortsighted and austerity-minded to do what needs to be done. At the very least, Congress must renew the $600 a week unemployment benefit - and it must do so now.\n\nMeagan Day is a staff writer at Jacobin .

Former Bernie Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver argues that we all deserve the type of high-quality public care the president received.\n\nPresident Trump returns to the White House from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on October 5 after three days hospitalized for coronavirus.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nThis week, following his diagnosis as COVID-infected, President Trump showed the nation what he thinks of \"socialized medicine.\" He apparently trusts it with his life. Needing hospitalization, President Trump chose to go to a government-run hospital rather than one of a large number of private institutions in the Washington, DC area. After all, it's not like he doesn't have the money to go wherever he wants.\n\nIt's difficult to reconcile the image of Trump walking in to get \"government health care\" with his attempts during the first presidential debate to denigrate \"socialized medicine.\" To be clear, Trump was using that term as a slur against Joe Biden. Biden's proposal to expand the Affordable Care Act (ACA) is not \"socialized medicine.\" The Democratic nominee has been more than clear both in the general election and the primary season that his program will maintain the largely private health care system, including the private health insurance companies, while increasing ACA subsidies and creating a public health insurance option.\n\nIn truth, there's no widespread call for making all doctors and nurses employees of the federal government or for hospitals to be nationalized. Such a reform would give us something similar to Britain's National Health Service. But progressives, and increasingly not so progressive voters, have largely coalesced around Medicare for All instead. Medicare for All is a form of universal health insurance where actual delivery of health care remains as it is now. It differs from Biden's plan in that Medicare for All eliminates private insurance - but not the private provision of health care - along with all copayments, deductibles, and premiums.\n\nThat leaves Donald Trump as America's leading poster boy for socialized medicine. By all accounts, he received top-tier care from an outstanding team. He even received treatments largely unavailable to most Americans who find themselves infected with COVID-19. So much for government involvement being an impediment to innovation in health care.\n\nHere's the other thing Donald Trump didn't have to deal with that most Americans do. As has been widely reported, Americans hospitalized with COVID-19 are facing enormous medical bills in the tens and tens of thousands of dollars. Trump isn't going to receive a gigantic bill. Nor is he going to have to pay a co-payment or deductible. Nor did his doctors have to argue with a private health insurance company over whether they would cover the innovative treatments that the doctors apparently believed were medically necessary, but that are not widely prescribed currently. If only the American people had access to this kind of health care coverage when they and their families face a terrible illness or injury.\n\nFrankly, this entire episode exposes the deep hypocrisy health reform opponents who want to keep the American people from even getting guaranteed government-administered health insurance. Trump's hospitalization at Walter Reed is not the only example. Republican Senators and House members routinely rely on the Attending Physicians Office on Capitol Hill. They are more than willing to avail themselves of high quality \"socialized medicine\" while they denigrate efforts at providing universal health insurance to ordinary Americans.\n\nThis socialism for the privileged and powerful, and rugged individualism for everyone else is really the heart of the Republicans' so-called love of freedom.\n\nIn their America, you are free to make the choice between buying your child's medicines and your own; you are free to be paid starvation wages; and you are free to retire in poverty. And while you are making those hard choices, they will be feeding at the public trough - whether that be your garden variety billions in tax breaks and subsidies, or, as Trump demonstrated, availing themselves of the type of tax payer-funded health care that they like to tell the rest of us is just so terrible.\n\nJeff Weaver is a political strategist who served as campaign manager for the Bernie Sanders 2016 presidential campaign and as an advisor for the Bernie Sanders 2020 presidential campaign.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Yet now that we stand on the brink of a possible US war of aggression, Democratic leaders are feigning concern that Trump is leading a march to war without congressional approval, and using a faulty strategy to do so. These objections, however, are grounded in process critiques, rather than moral opposition - and belie Democrats' role in helping lay the groundwork for the growing confrontation.\n\nThe US drone assassination of Major General Qassem Soleimani, the commander of Iran's Quds Force and a ranking official of the Iranian government, takes confrontation with Iran to new heights, inching the United States closer to the war the Trump administration has been pushing for. While Trump deserves blame for driving this dangerous escalation, he did not do it on his own.\n\nAs recently as December 2019, the House overwhelmingly passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2020 with a vote of 377-48 . Two amendments were stripped from that bill before it went to a vote: Rep. Ro Khanna's (D-CA) amendment to block funding for a war with Iran barring congressional approval and Rep. Barbara Lee's (D-CA) amendment to repeal 2001's Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists (AUMF). That AUMF effectively allows the government to use \"necessary and appropriate force\" against anyone suspected of being connected to the 9/11 attacks, and has been interpreted broadly to justify US aggression around the world. Officials from the Trump administration have suggested that the 2001 AUMF may give them authority to go to war with Iran.\n\nOf the 377 Representatives who voted for the $738 billion defense bill, 188 were Democrats. Just forty-one Democrats opposed the legislation. The bill cleared the Senate with a tally of 86-8, with just four Democrats voting against it. None of the senators running for the 2020 Democratic nomination were present for the vote. Before the vote, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) took to the Senate floor to brag about the fact that \"partisan demands\" had effectively been removed from the bill and declared that \"sanity and progress\" had won out. \"Reassuringly, the past few days have finally brought an end to bipartisan talks and produced a compromise NDAA,\" said McConnell.\n\nAt the time of the bill's passage, thirty-one organizations, including Yemeni Alliance Committee and the National Iranian American Council Action, put out a joint statement condemning the NDAA as a looming disaster destined to be abused by the Trump administration. \"The NDAA is a massive blank check,\" reads the statement. \"The authorization of $738 billion is obscene. Further inflating the Pentagon's overstuffed coffers does not make us safer - it perpetuates a system that treats military intervention as the solution to all world problems.\" Despite these concerns, Democrats did not put up much of a fight, and the Congressional Progressive Caucus declined to whip the vote against the NDAA.\n\nDemocrats' complicity doesn't stop with bloated war budgets. In July 2017, Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) was the only lawmaker in both the House and the Senate who caucused with the Democrats to vote against a bill that bundled together sanctions on Iran, Russia, and North Korea. Proponents of the bill, meanwhile, used anti-Russia rhetoric to ram it through Congress. Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) told the Intercept at the time, \"I just looked at the sanctions, and it's very hard, in view of what we know just happened in this last election, not to move ahead with [sanctions].\"\n\nSanders was clear that he opposed the bill because of his opposition to sanctions on Iran, but supported sanctions against Russia and North Korea, which are also aggressive and harmful to the people of those countries. Still, he was demonized by some in the Democratic establishment. As we previously reported , Adam Parkhomenko, former Hillary Clinton aide and founder of the Ready for Hillary PAC, said on Twitter at the time, \"Feel the Bern? Bernie Sanders voted against Russian sanctions today. 98 Senators voted for Russian sanctions today. Sanders voted the same way anyone with the last name Trump would vote if they were in the Senate. No excuses - stop making them for him.\"\n\nWhen Trump - surrounded by hawkish advisers - pulled out of the Iran nuclear deal in May of 2018, the Democratic establishment roundly criticized him, often citing the supposed threat posed by Iran, even though the country has no nuclear weapons program, according to US intelligence agencies' own assessments . \"The president's willingness to shatter the international consensus, forged over years of arduous negotiations, on how to constrain Iran's nuclear program only makes sense as part of a campaign to erase his predecessor's legacy, regardless of the consequences to our national security,\" Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), the ranking Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, said at the time.\n\nYet Democrats' previous support for sanctions already violated the Iran deal, whose benefits for the Iranian people were almost entirely premised on relief from devastating sanctions. In December of 2018, high-profile Democrats, including Elizabeth Warren, called for the United States to return to the Iran nuclear deal. While such a move would certainly constitute a de-escalation, these calls were bereft of accountability for the role that Democrats played in emboldening Trump to impose even more sanctions - and ultimately walk away from the agreement.\n\nThese failures are consistent with a troubling pattern: Democrats tee up the ball for Trump's aggressive maneuvers, and then express outrage when his administration takes a swing. The Trump administration has been on a course toward confrontation with Iran for three years. He's hired notorious Iran war fanatics Gen. James Mattis, John Bolton, and Elliott Abrams. His biggest donor is anti-Iran, radical billionaire Sheldon Adelson. His State Department appears to have staffed out some of its Iran policy to the pro-Israel, right-wing think tank Foundation for Defense of Democracies. He's signaled from day one his goal was to march the United States toward war. Yet Democrats still padded his war budgets, voted for his appointments, baited him to have a tougher stance against Iran's most important ally, Russia, and did nothing to curb his support for anti-Iran forces in the Middle East. Democrats have, for the most part, been not only unwilling to spend their political capital trying to change this course, but have actively encouraged it through their support for proxy battles against Iran in Syria and Iraq. And we must not forget that it was President Obama who, in 2014, sent troops back to Iraq as part of the war against ISIS.\n\nAlthough many Democrats were quick to criticize Trump's deadly drone strike, most of the statements were qualified with assertions about the murderous nature of Soleimani. \"No American will mourn Qassem Soleimani's passing,\" begins Joe Biden's statement . \"He deserved to be brought to justice for his crimes against American troops and thousands of innocents throughout the region. He supported terror and sowed chaos.\" Initial statements from Sens. Elizabeth Warren and Amy Klobuchar began with similar declarations. The first statement that has even referred to the killing as an \"assassination\" has been from Bernie Sanders. Warren later followed up her initial statement with remarks that also used the language of assassination.\n\nSome Democrats who voted for the NDAA and handed the Trump administration a blank check suddenly expressed concern about the president's powers. \"Soleimani was an enemy of the United States. That's not a question,\" tweeted Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy (D-CT) - who voted or the bill. \"The question is this - as reports suggest, did America just assassinate, without any congressional authorization, the second most powerful person in Iran, knowingly setting off a potential massive regional war?\"\n\nOther Democrats are also expressing concern that Trump is deploying the wrong strategy against a dangerous enemy, while accepting the premise that intervention could be justified. This approach is reflected in presidential hopeful Pete Buttigieg's statement , released yesterday: \"Before engaging in military action that could destabilize an entire region, we must take a strategic, deliberate approach that includes consultation with Congress, our allies, and stakeholders in the Middle East.\" This statement presumes that a destabilizing war of aggression could be justified, conceding Trump's moral justifications, even as Buttigieg hand-wrings about the method.\n\nWe can't stop a war with Iran unless we recognize US aggression is not the product of failed strategy, or the Republican Party alone. It's the product of a system where it's normal bipartisan politics to lay the building blocks of war with no public account of the profound harm that is being done. And then, on the eve of said war, those Democrats who have been setting its course feign outrage and shock - if a Republican is in the White House, that is. We saw this script play out with the Iraq War, and we're seeing it again now. In a US political establishment where killing people abroad comes with little political cost, the politicians who contributed to the US climate of belligerence are never forced to face the consequences. It costs nothing to jockey for war, but everything to stand against it - including war's precursors, such as sanctions, bloated military budgets, and CIA meddling. Our only hope is to change this.\n\nSarah Lazare is web editor at In These Times.

A careful study breaks down how Trump spoke to economic grievances and personal experiences.\n\nFormer US president Donald Trump greets supporters before offering remarks during an event on August 21, 2024, in Asheboro, North Carolina.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nIn the wake of Teamsters chief Sean O'Brien's remarks at the Republican National Convention (RNC) in July, liberal commentators were aghast at the very idea of a labor leader validating Donald Trump's popularity with American workers.\n\nWriting in the Atlantic , for instance, David Graham describes Trump's working-class appeals as the \"Fakest Populism You Ever Saw,\" while Rolling Stone summed up July's RNC as an attempt to court \"the working class with hollow, populist rhetoric.\"\n\nOn one level, there is obvious truth to these assessments. While Trump can point to a few examples where he helped save jobs and project American workers as president - such as his partial success in saving jobs at an Indiana Carrier plant and his renegotiation of NAFTA to include stronger labor protections - overall his record on labor hardly inspires confidence.\n\nTo take just a few examples: Trump stacked the National Labor Relations Board with anti-union corporate lawyers and failed to deliver on his promise to bring back significant manufacturing jobs to rust belt states like Pennsylvania , Michigan, and Ohio . He threatened to veto the union-friendly PRO Act (which, by the way, none of the MAGA Republicans in the senate, including J. D. Vance, voted for), and he pushed through regressive tax cuts that were massively skewed toward the rich and failed to deliver broader economic benefits for ordinary Americans.\n\nWhile Trump did increase import tariffs with the goal of bringing back American manufacturing jobs, there is no evidence that this policy had a net-positive effect on American jobs.\n\nGiven Trump's less than stellar record on jobs, is his strong support among working-class voters (especially, but far from exclusively, white workers) simply a reflection of his shrewd capacity to get these voters to forget their own economic self-interest by doubling down on appeals to their worst xenophobic, sexist, and racist tendencies? Many liberal commentators are absolutely certain that the answer is yes. Writing in Vox shortly after Trump's surprise 2016 victory, German Lopez boldly asserts \" Trump won because of racial resentment ,\" while NPR's Rich Barlow asserted that \" Racial Resentment, Not Economics, Elected Trump .\"\n\nThere is little doubt that cynical, fear-based appeals to the worst impulses of working-class whites are an important part of the story. But if we look at the content of Trump's appeals to working-class voters, we see that a narrow focus on the darkest aspects of Trump's rhetoric belies consistent and often quite powerful appeals that tap directly into decades of economic dislocation experienced by millions of American workers.\n\nMy analysis of Trump's 2016 campaign speeches and statements reveals that, however disingenuously these messages may have been deployed, he talked a lot about bread-and-butter issues many working-class Americans care deeply about and feel that Democratic and Republican politicians alike have been ignoring for decades.\n\nLet's start with a 30,000-foot view of Trump's rhetoric on the 2016 campaign trail. To get a basic sense of how much Trump focused on different kinds of rhetorical appeals during the 2016 campaign, I collected all available Trump campaign statements and speeches from 2015 until election day on November 8, 2016. I then identified the number of times Trump mentioned key words and phrases to capture different policy bundles and rhetorical styles.\n\nContrary to conventional wisdom, it was jobs and trade - and not immigration or any other divisive social or cultural issue - that had top billing in Trump's 2016 rhetoric. On average, Trump invoked jobs and trade (\"jobs,\" \"manufacturing,\" \"unfair trade deals,\" etc.) 10.3 times per statement or speech, compared to the 8.3 times he invoked immigration (21 percent fewer average mentions) and the less than one time per statement or speech he referenced controversial social issues (excluding immigration), from abortion to trans rights and Black Lives Matter. Indeed, Trump used pro-worker rhetoric nearly three times as often - and anti-economic elite rhetoric more than twice as often - as he brought up controversial social issues.\n\nThere were certainly speeches where candidate Trump focused more on immigration than anything else, and predictably these speeches were littered with hateful vitriol against immigrants. Among many other blatant falsehoods, he lied about immigrants and their children being convicted of terrorist activities in the United States; he falsely claimed Hillary Clinton wanted to spend hundreds of billions resettling Middle Eastern refugees in US cities; and he erroneously claimed that Clinton would implement an \"open borders\" immigration policy.\n\nBut even in these speeches, Trump spent as much time connecting immigration to the economic well-being of American workers as he did demonizing undocumented workers per se, as in a June 2016 speech when he claimed that \"Hillary's Wall Street immigration agenda will keep immigrant communities poor and unemployed Americans out of work. She can't claim to care about African American and Hispanic workers when she wants to bring in millions of new low-wage workers to compete against them.\" Regardless of whether Trump's controversial claims were empirically true or false, the point is that his remarks framed immigration in terms of protecting American workers, not in overtly bigoted terms based on the condemnation of an entire class of people.\n\nTrump's discussion of jobs and trade focused on three key themes: mass job loss due to bad trade policies, life getting harder and harder for American workers, and blaming elites for doing nothing to stop the decline of the working class.\n\nFirst, Trump regularly invoked the harm free trade policies have had on American workers. In a series of speeches the month prior to election day in 2016, Trump repeatedly argued that \"we are living through the greatest jobs theft in the history of the world.\" In an October 16 speech in New Hampshire, for instance, he explained that \"the state of New Hampshire has lost nearly one in three manufacturing jobs since NAFTA. . . . Since China entered the World Trade Organization . . . 70,000 factories have shut down or left the United States. That's fifteen factories closing a day, on average. . . . If I win, day one, we are going to announce our plans to renegotiate NAFTA. If we don't get the deal we want, we'll leave NAFTA and start over to get a much better deal.\" These remarks could just as easily have come from Bernie Sanders or AFL-CIO head Richard Trumka and are consistent with legitimate research on the negative impacts of trade policies on American manufacturing jobs in the 1990s and 2000s .\n\nNext, Trump focused his remarks time and again on how it's become harder for working Americans to keep their heads above water economically than in the past. In an October 18, 2016, speech in Colorado, he again sounded indistinguishable from Bernie Sanders, exhorting that \"many workers are earning less today than they were eighteen years ago, they are working harder and longer, but making less. Some of them are working two, three jobs but still taking home less money.\" This, again, reflects the actual experiences of millions of working-class Americans since the 1970s who have seen their wages stagnate or fall, their share of America's wealth drop precipitously, and their chances of achieving a higher standard of living than their parents crater.\n\nAfter identifying and empathizing with the economic struggles facing working Americans, Trump consistently put the blame for \"a wave of globalization that wipes out our middle class and our jobs\" squarely on the shoulders of large corporations and \"elites in Washington\":\n\nThe political establishment has brought about the destruction of our factories and our jobs. . . . Just look at what this corrupt establishment has done to our cities like Detroit and Flint, Michigan - and rural towns in Pennsylvania, Ohio, North Carolina, and across our country. They have stripped these towns bare and raided the wealth for themselves and taken away their jobs.\n\nFinally, Trump not only invoked classic economic populist messages to call out elites for their role in shattering the American dream for so many, but he also raised up the inherent dignity of working Americans and stressed that they needed more voice in Washington. In a speech in Michigan that August, for instance, he told listeners that his campaign was \"going to be a victory for the people, a victory for the wage earner, the factory worker. Remember this, a big, big victory for the factory worker. They haven't had those victories for a long time. A victory for every citizen and for all of the people whose voices have not been heard for many, many years. They're going to be heard again.\"\n\nAnd even though it may sound absurd in the abstract given his superelite class background, Trump managed to identify with workers on a personal level, as in a speech in Eerie, Pennsylvania, on August 12:\n\nI grew up, you know they say, \"You know you're really rich. How come you sort of relate to these [working-class] people?\" Well, my father built houses, and I used to work in these houses and I got to know the electricians. I got to know all these people. I got to know the plumbers, the steamfitters - I got to know them all. And I liked them better than the rich people that I know.\n\nHe reprised this theme a month later in Asheville, North Carolina:\n\nWhile my opponent slanders you as deplorable and irredeemable, I call you hardworking American patriots who love your country and want a better future for all of our people. You are mothers and fathers, soldiers and sailors, carpenters and welders.\n\nTaken together, these appeals make it pretty clear why so many disaffected working- and middle-class voters - who either experienced these economic crises directly or, in the case of many comparatively more affluent Trump voters, saw it all playing out in their communities - would find Trump appealing. Unlike virtually any politician they had ever heard before, Trump not only spoke over and over again to the economic pain felt by so many working-class Americans but also called out the elite culprits by name, something that traditional politicians typically shy away from.\n\nNearly a decade later, progressives once again ignore the economic foundations of Trump's working-class support at their own peril. Yes, of course, it's too late to reach most Trump voters, whose loyalty to the former president has become a core feature of their identities. And yes, of course, shameful appeals meant to activate latent racial and xenophobic proclivities were a key tool in Trump's electoral playbook.\n\nHowever, many past and likely future Trump voters saw something unique in his brash economic populist message and rewarded him for it. Progressives can and must compete for these voters by making the same kinds of economic appeals. But in sharp contrast to President Trump, they must deliver on that rhetoric by implementing policies that will actually help workers rather than the 1 percent.\n\nIt's been eight years since Trump first won the presidency. If progressives want to keep him out of office, they should start by taking his working-class appeal seriously - right now - before it's too late.\n\nJared Abbott is a researcher at the Center for Working-Class Politics and a contributor to Jacobin and Catalyst: A Journal of Theory and Strategy .\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

Penny Schwinn, an alum of Teach for America who kicked off her career in education reform interning for Dianne Feinstein, was a porn-loving authoritarian and diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) ideologue, warned a growing chorus on the Right.\n\n\"President Trump needs the full story on Penny Schwinn's education history\" in Tennessee, conservative activist Robby Starbuck posted on X, citing Schwinn's controversial tenure as the state's schools chief. \"Anytime someone claims their desired outcome is equity, understand they're pushing a communist agenda,\" anti-trans-athlete crusader Riley Gaines chimed in: \"NO to Penny Schwinn.\" Even country star John Rich, best known for being half of the duo behind \"Save a Horse (Ride a Cowboy),\" weighed in, describing a meeting he'd had with Schwinn about porn in Tennessee schools. \"She refused to abolish it. She is not our friend.\"\n\nBefore long, none other than Christopher Rufo would got involved , in an effort to douse the flames of the latest culture war fire. Rufo had met with Schwinn and was here to assure her critics that they had it all wrong. And while skepticism of education officials was warranted, chided Rufo, \"we have to be accurate with the facts and considered in our judgements [ sic ].\" President Trump had picked Penny for a reason. Now it was time for the bomb-throwers and naysayers to fall in line.\n\nIn the early days of the second Trump administration, the fault lines and fissures are already coming into view. But while the split between nationalist populists and tech oligarchs about immigration policy may be getting more headlines, conflicts over Trump's education agenda could get just as nasty. That's because many of the policy punchlines that were reliable applause generators at Trump's rallies are actually deeply unpopular with the public.\n\nTrump's plan to eliminate the Department of Education, apparently on hold for now, turns out to be opposed by majorities of voters in both parties - numbers that are likely to grow as the implications of funding cuts, which will fall hardest on Trump's own red-state base, begin to sink in. And Trump's threat to withhold federal funding from schools with vaccine mandates is even more of a political loser. According to a recent survey , just 15 percent of adults identified this as a top priority, while nearly half said that the cuts \"should not be done.\"\n\nEven the calls for mass deportations, which so thrilled many of his supporters, run afoul of public opinion when it comes to schools. Just 18 percent of voters support arresting undocumented students at schools.\n\nSwirling around these unpopular policy specifics is an education \"vision\" that is more contradictory than any administration's in recent memory. Does Making America Great Again entail a massive investment in STEM education à la the US response to the Soviets launching the Sputnik satellit e ? Or is the relentless focus on STEM actually the product of a hundred-year-old progressive conspiracy to boot God from the schools and turn the kids into corporate drones, as both Heritage Foundation head Kevin Roberts and Defense chief nominee Pete Hegseth have argued? Do we need a kind of affirmative action so that right-thinking youngsters gain a foothold in the nation's elite universities? Or is the goal to radically reduce the number of youngsters with bachelor's degrees, as Rufo himself recently argued ?\n\nSuch tensions promise more than just online fireworks. Deep divisions within the GOP base over education policy also represent an opening for Democrats. Will they recognize the opportunity? The signs so far are not auspicious.\n\nThere may be no issue that divides the GOP base from the party's leaders and major donors like school vouchers. In recent years, the powerful and deep-pocketed \"school choice\" lobby has succeeded in making the issue a \"litmus test\" for Republican candidates, akin to abortion. \"Self-proclaimed conservatives who oppose school choice are nothing short of political whores, and we will find and support challengers to these RINOs ['Republican in Name Only'],\" David McIntosh, head of the conservative advocacy group Club for Growth, declared in 2022.\n\nSince then, expansive school choice policies that pick up the tab for private religious school tuition for even the wealthiest parents have been passed in nearly a dozen states, including Florida, Iowa, and North Carolina. That list is likely to grow in the next year. ALEC, the influential right-wing legislative advocacy group, has set an ambitious goal of having twenty-five states adopt \"education freedom\" by the end of 2025. Meanwhile, a federal school voucher bill is steadily advancing and is widely expected to be tucked into the Trump tax cut package.\n\nBut elite policy consensus and grassroots support are not the same thing, something that lopsided defeats at the polls for voucher measures demonstrated in November.\n\nIn Kentucky, voters from every single county rejected a change to the Constitution that would have allowed public dollars to fund private religious education, despite a marquee endorsement from Trump. \"Kentuckians agree with Donald Trump,\" proclaimed one ad, featuring Trump broadcasting his support for school choice. \"If you do too, vote yes on [Amendment] 2.\"\n\nThe appeal landed with a thud. The same rural counties that supported Trump most emphatically also rejected the voucher amendment by outsize margins. Voters in Monroe County, which borders Tennessee, supported Trump by nearly 90 percent while rejecting the voucher amendment by 70.5 percent. And in the state's tiniest county, eight out of ten voters went for Trump, nearly the same margin by which they opposed Amendment 2. In Nebraska, vouchers were defeated by an equally lopsided margin.\n\n\"If the ox has got to get gored, it's got to come out of the wealthy. It's got to come out of the billionaire class,\" Steve Bannon menaced recently.\n\nWhile the specter of tech billionaires , worth an estimated $1.3 trillion in combined net worth, swarming Trump's inauguration would seem to undercut the administration's populist appeal, the issue of school vouchers is similarly nettlesome. After all, a passion for privatizing the nation's schools unites the very wealthiest among us like few other causes besides not paying taxes. Betsy DeVos, Jeff Yass, Richard Uihlein, and the remaining brother Koch are all devoted to \"funding students, not systems,\" as the current sales pitch for vouchers puts it.\n\nIncreasingly, these oligarchs are devoting their fortunes to remaking state legislatures in order to till the land for voucher expansion. Yass, the richest man in Pennsylvania, was the single largest contributor to candidates in the last election cycle, with donations including $10 million to Texas governor Greg Abbott - the single largest donation ever to a Texas politician - and $5 million toward the failed voucher effort in Kentucky. The school choice organization founded and funded by DeVos has, according to one recent investigation , spent more than a quarter billion dollars to advance the cause of school privatization.\n\nIn recent years, that largesse has been devoted to knocking out the so-called RINOs, mostly rural Republicans representing areas where the argument for dismantling local schools falls flat. But that big-money push to buy up legislators is also hard to square with the sort of anti-billionaire rhetoric that is increasingly common in the MAGA sphere.\n\n\"Vouchers aren't MAGA. Not even close,\" says Brett Guillory. A welding teacher in Houston, Guillory was so convinced that the 2020 election was stolen that he contemplated a run for Congress. These days, he is a vocal opponent of the effort to bring vouchers to Texas. \"To me, MAGA is building up the middle class. When you talk about a wealth transfer, it's going from the hard-working class to the wealthy,\" Guillory told me when I interviewed him for a podcast about rising resistance to school privatization on the Right.\n\nGuillory is referring to a growing body of data showing that the \"universal voucher programs\" that have been enacted in red states mostly benefit parents who already sent their kids to private schools. \" If you look at all the numbers, all the statistics, they all say the same thing, that over three-quarters of people who use vouchers are the wealthy.\" Concludes Guillory: \"Vouchers are essentially welfare for the rich.\"\n\nThe money gushing into states like Texas and Tennessee, the current targets of the school choice billionaires, is spurring a populist revolt on the Right. These days, the loudest voices opposing school vouchers are conservative, bemoaning that their elected officials have been bought and that vouchers are part of a \" billionaire globalist agenda .\"\n\nIf Democrats are aware of this potential vulnerability within the MAGA coalition, there are few signs so far. Tim Walz initially came out swinging against \"robber barons like Donald Trump and J. D. Vance,\" accusing them of wanting to privatize rural schools. \"Where in the heck are you going to find a private school in a town of four hundred?\" Walz asked in a viral interview this summer. But his prairie populist case for public education quickly fell by the wayside, another casualty of the Kamala Harris campaign's broader shift away from economic populism and back toward the familiar \" opportunity economy \" rhetoric that has been the party's mainstay since the Bill Clinton era\n\nYet Walz was clearly onto something. In Nebraska's Boyd County, where Walz attended high school, six of ten voters rejected private school vouchers even as they cast nearly 90 percent of their votes for Trump.\n\nDemocrats have given little indication that they will exploit the GOP's weakness here. In the seemingly endless election postmortems, none have mentioned Republican resistance to school vouchers as an opportunity. Meanwhile, in the internecine struggle to control the party's future direction, the old Democratic Leadership Council get-tough-on-teachers-and-their-unions crowd appears ascendant, even as their cause has grown steadily less popular.\n\nRahm Emanuel urged his fellow Democrats to lean into education as an issue by reminding voters that schools are failing and students are falling short. Jorge Elorza, head of the once-influential Democrats for Education Reform, pointed to a surefire way for the party to reconnect with its working-class base: by embracing school choice. Inveterate centrist pundit Jonathan Chait who, bemoaning that Democrats no longer run on education, counseled them to rally around the issue of closing down under-enrolled urban schools - a cause so unpopular that it drove Emanuel's reelection prospects as mayor of Chicago into the ground.\n\nIn the coming months, the Trump administration will be rolling out one unpopular and divisive plan for the nation's schools after another, including a federal voucher plan just like the one Trump's own supporters voted against in November. Democrats have a golden opportunity here to expose the faux populism at the heart of the MAGA movement. They should seize it.\n\nJennifer C.

      "text": "While Fallen Soldiers Returned Home, Trump Hit the Golf Course\n\nIsrael Anta/Zuma\n\nPresident Trump's absence at the dignified transfer of four US servicemen who died during a training exercise in Lithuania is being noticed. While thousands gathered in Lithuania-including the Lithuanian president-to send the soldiers off, our commander in chief was busy (as he has been for over a quarter of his second presidency) playing in his Saudi-backed golf tournament at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nA post shared by Mother Jones (@motherjonesmag)\n\nThis is not the first time that Trump has missed a dignified transfer-he only attended four out of 96 during his first term, per an investigation by HuffPost . Presidents are not required to be at the transfers and generally only attend a handful each term. (These four were met on US soil by Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and several Democratic senators.)\n\nHowever, there is a particular ire since Trump is missing the transfer for such a trivial reason. Chris (who asked us not to use his last name) is an Air Force veteran who spoke to my colleague Peter Berger at a Hands Off rally in San Francisco on Saturday, calling Trump's choice \"the ultimate lack of respect to our military.\" He held a sign that said \"4 US Soldiers bodies returned home, where is their Commander in Chief? In Florida-Golfing.\"\n\nHe also decried the administration's cuts to the Veterans Affairs. \"[Trump] really needs to look at what he is doing to the VA because after these military service members leave the military, it's our duty as a nation to take care of them.\"\n\nThe Trump Administration has announced plans to cut 80,000 employees from the VA. It has already announced the end of a program that saved the homes of 17,000 military veterans facing foreclosures and ended specific healthcare for trans and intersex veterans.\n\nI spoke to T Dianne Smith, a Navy vet, at a protest in Eugene, Oregon. As a retiree, Trump's tariffs and proposed changes to Social Security and Medicaid threaten her entire income.\n\nShe felt most compelled to come not because of the effects on her, but because it was her duty. \"When you enter the military, you take an oath to defend the Constitution and to obey the orders of the president, but the Constitution comes first,\" she explained. \"If someone gives you an unlawful order, you are required by law to not follow that order and to follow your conscience.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "\"I'm Not Joking\": Trump Again Floats Running for Anti-Constitutional Third Term\n\nTrump said on Sunday that he's \"not joking\" about running for a third term-despite the fact that would be unconstitutional. Jacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nPresident Donald Trump has repeatedly teased running for a third term in violation of the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution, which limits presidents to two terms.\n\nUntil now, it has been unclear whether he was making such comments seriously. But in a phone call with Meet the Press moderator Kristen Welker of NBC News on Sunday, Trump gave his clearest indication yet that he is indeed serious. \"I'm not joking,\" he reportedly said. \"But I'm not-it is far too early to think about it.\"\n\n\"There are methods which you could do it,\" Trump continued. NBC reports that when Welker asked about the plausibility of Vice President JD Vance running for office and then passing power to Trump (who would try to run as VP in 2028, and then take over when Vance resigns, according to the theory ) Trump replied, \"That's one,\" adding, \"but there are others too.\" He declined to provide specific examples, NBC reported.\n\nWhite House Communications Director Steven Cheung did not respond directly to a question from Mother Jones about what \"methods\" Trump specifically was referring to; instead Cheung sent a statement claiming: \"Americans overwhelmingly approve and support President Trump and his America First policies. As the President said, it's far too early to think about [a third term] and he is focused on undoing all the hurt Biden has caused and Making America Great Again.\" (Polls do not indicate \"overwhelming approval\" for Trump: The latest CBS/YouGov poll shows Americans split down the middle, and several recent others others show that majorities of Americans disapprove of him.)\n\nWhen asked by Welker if he would like to serve a third term, Trump replied, \"I like working.\"\n\nLarry Sabato, director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, said in a post on X that there may be three ways Trump could attempt to \"grab\" an illegal 3rd term: 1) Ignore the Constitution and dare anyone to stop him. 2) Have GOP-run states just appoint Trump electors since any state not voting Trump is by definition 'corrupt'. 3) Military coup and martial law-i.e., a successful January 6.\"\n\nNBC reports that Trump also claimed, \"A lot of people want me to do it. But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it's very early in the administration.\"\n\nSome public figures have indeed voiced sycophantic support for this idea of an illegal power grab. They include longtime Trump adviser Steve Bannon , who has claimed Trump may be able to get around the 22nd Amendment and told NewsNation's Chris Cuomo that \"Trump will run and win again in 2028.\" In January, Republican Rep. Andy Ogles of Tennessee introduced a farfetched resolution proposing to amend the 22nd Amendment so that Trump could serve a third term. Additionally, GOP activists behind an initiative called the Third Term Project are advocating for amending the constitution to allow Trump to run again in 2028, or to have Trump run as VP with the understanding that the presidential candidate on the ticket would resign after being elected, to allow Trump to retake power.\n\nSuccess in amending the Constitution-especially to set up a possible third term for Trump-would be extremely unlikely, as it would require approval from two-thirds of both chambers of Congress, and then ratification from three-fourths of state legislatures.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trump's Bureau of Land Management Pick Is a Pit Bull for the Fossil Fuel Industry\n\nWestern Energy Alliance president Kathleen Sgamma, at a Senate hearing. Rod Lamkey/CNP/Zuma\n\nThis story was originally published by Public Domain , a Substack publication to which you can subscribe here .\n\nWhen rancher Ammon Bundy and his armed posse stormed into Oregon's Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in January 2016 in a failed attempt to seize public land for themselves, Kathleen Sgamma, then the vice president of the Western Energy Alliance, issued a brief condemnation. She described the militants as \"serious lawbreakers.\" Sgamma reserved the bulk of her ire, though, not for the armed men in Oregon, many of whom were inspired in part by a fringe Mormon theology , but for the US government itself.\n\nIn a 2016 blog post that appears to have been deleted, she went on a lengthy diatribe against the land management policies of the United States that, in her view, led to the Bundy takeover. Among her chief complaints: \"The situation arises from too much federal ownership of land in the West,\" she wrote. \"Whereas in the East and Mid-West lands were transferred as private property to individuals for farms, by the time the West was settled the government retained a vast amount of land.\"\n\nSgamma, who thinks there is too much federal public land, is now President Trump's choice to lead the federal government's largest land management agency. Trump nominated her in mid-February to be the next director of the Bureau of Land Management, an agency that oversees more than 246 million acres on behalf of all Americans. In addition to enforcing bedrock environmental laws like the National Environmental Policy Act, the BLM director oversees oil and gas drilling on federal land. The agency is also responsible for the conservation of iconic western species, including the greater sage grouse. In all of these realms, and others too, Sgamma will have to contend with a thicket of conflicts of interest.\n\nSgamma is best known as a passionate activist on behalf of oil and gas corporations. She is a long-time leader and current president of the Western Energy Alliance (WEA), a litigious trade group that represents drillers and other fossil fuel companies that operate on federal land. In that role, she has served as industry muscle, so to speak, attacking in court, in the media, and in the halls of power any policy, rule or regulation that hinders the oil industry's ability to profit on public lands. Her organization's methods have sometimes sparked controversy.\n\nIn Project 2025's manifesto, Sgamma and others accuse Joe Biden of waging a \"war on fossil fuels\" and bemoan the amount of land and minerals under federal ownership.\n\nIn 2014, for instance, a secret recording of the WEA's annual meeting revealed that the trade group had invited the Washington, DC, public relations operative Richard Berman to speak to its members. Berman was there to solicit money to fund a PR campaign called Big Green Radicals that would target environmentalists opposed to the oil industry.\n\nDuring his speech, Berman told the audience they should think of their fight against environmental organizations as \"an endless war.\" He told them that they could either \"win ugly or lose pretty.\" He assured the assembled oil industry operatives that if they funded his campaign he could protect their anonymity while going on the offensive against environmentalists, using emotions like \"fear\" and \"anger\" to try to turn public opinion against green groups.\n\nIn the end, Berman's Big Green Radicals campaign did just that. Among other things, it put out a report titled \"From Russia with Love\" that portrayed American environmental groups as the puppets of shadowy Russian interests. Republicans in Congress quickly latched onto the report despite its thin sourcing, recycling many of its claims to argue that groups like the League of Conservation Voters and the Sierra Club are the \"useful idiots\" of Russia.\n\nThe Western Energy Alliance used similar tactics to undermine greater sage grouse conservation in the American West. When the Obama administration was considering listing the greater sage grouse under the Endangered Species Act due to the species's precipitous population decline , WEA launched a PR campaign, running ads that disparaged grouse advocates and scientists. The Obama administration ultimately declined to list the species under the ESA, instead opting to have the BLM and Forest Service issue land-use regulations that could help prop up the species. Though those regulations have not stopped the continued loss of grouse habitat across the West, they are likely to be further weakened under the new Trump administration.\n\nWEA frequently turns to the courts to prevent new rules, regulations or fees that could inconvenience public land oil drillers. In May of last year, for instance, the group and its industry allies sued the Bureau of Land Management after the Biden administration raised royalty rates on public land drillers, from 12.5 percent to 16.7 percent.\n\nIf she is confirmed, Sgamma's appointment will likely raise thorny questions about conflicts of interest. She will have substantial influence over sage grouse policy, royalty rate policy, public lands oil leasing, and many other issues that have been at the center of her work for the fossil fuel industry. Will she sign an ethics pledge that recuses her from these and similar policy matters? Will she be too conflicted to function?\n\nSgamma's appointment to the helm of BLM also complicates Trump's attempts to distance himself from Project 2025, the sweeping policy blueprint that MAGA operatives compiled to guide Trump in a second term. Sgamma co-authored a section of the manifesto's chapter on the Interior Department, in which she and others accuse Biden of waging a \"war on fossil fuels\" and bemoan the amount of land and minerals under federal ownership.\n\nThe Project 2025 chapter that Sgamma contributed to was authored by William Perry Pendley, who served as acting director of BLM during Trump's first term and has a long record of advocating for federal lands to be transferred to states or sold to private interests. It stops short of calling for the outright pawning off of federal lands. Instead, Pendley casts the federal government as a bad landlord and argues that a Republican president should \"draw on the enormous expertise of state agency personnel\" and \"look for opportunities to broaden state-federal and tribal-federal cooperative agreements.\"\n\nWhen it comes to how federal lands are managed, Project 2025 contains a comprehensive fossil fuel industry wish list written by Sgamma and two other industry allies. The manifesto calls for opening vast swaths of the federal estate to increased drilling, rolling back already-protected landscapes, expediting permitting, slashing the royalties that oil and gas companies pay to drill on federal lands, and weakening regulations that might complicate increased development. If confirmed as BLM director, Sgamma would play a pivotal role in carrying out Trump's pro-fossil fuel energy vision to the direct benefit of her trade group's members.\n\nAs she prepares to lead the BLM, does Sgamma still believe there is too much federal land? Is she a partisan of the so-called land transfer movement, a movement led by Utah politicians who would like to divest the American public of their ownership stake in millions of acres of federal land? Will she seek to sell off BLM land? Given her record, how will she avoid conflicts of interest as she oversees the government's vast onshore oil and gas leasing program? Will she manage public lands for multiple use, including conservation and recreation, or will extractive industries be her sole priority?\n\nSgamma did not respond to these and other questions, nor did the WEA make her available for an interview. Berman's organization did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSgamma's confirmation hearing is scheduled for Thursday, April 10 before the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trump Tells SCOTUS There's a \"Rigorous Process\" for Deporting Venezuelan Migrants. Yeah, Right.\n\nAP Photo/Evan Vucci\n\nOn Friday, the Trump administration asked the Supreme Court to lift a lower court ruling blocking the mass deportation of thousands of detained Venezuelan migrants under the controversial Aliens Enemies Act of 1798, claiming in a filing that it has a \"rigorous process\" for identifying gang members.\n\nHowever, Mother Jones ' reporting suggests that the Trump administration is detaining people without due process on the flimsiest evidence, including their tattoos.\n\nSince March, Donald Trump has been using the Alien Enemies Act to give himself the power to send migrants to El Salvador under the loosest of suspicion that they're connected to Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang that the president has designated as a \"global terrorist group.\" Despite claiming to have a strict vetting process of identifying alleged TdA members, the Trump administration has provided little to no evidence that this is the case. As my colleagues Noah Lanard and Isabela Dias reported,\n\nWhen pressed on the criteria used for their identification, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt pointed to unspecified \"intelligence\" deployed to arrest the Venezuelans she has referred to as \"heinous monsters.\" Trump's border czar Tom Homan has insisted -without providing specific details-that the public should trust ICE to have correctly targeted the Venezuelans based on \"criminal investigations,\" social media posts, and surveillance.\n\nThe administration's Supreme Court filing likewise does little to provide evidence of careful vetting, simply describing the process as \"weeks of work by President Trump and his cabinet.\"\n\nLanard and Dias spoke with the families, friends, and lawyers of 10 men detained in El Salvador by the Trump administration, all of them contesting that their loved ones were profiled based on their tattoos and have no connection with gang or terrorist activity. As Lanard and Dias report :\n\nThe families have substantiated those assertions to Mother Jones , including-in many cases-by providing official documents attesting to their relatives' lack of criminal histories in Venezuela. Such evidence might have persuaded US judges that the men were not part of any criminal organization had the Trump administration not deliberately deprived them of due process.\n\nOne of these men is Frizgeralth de Jesus Cornejo, who co-owns a streetwear clothing brand.\n\n\"I never imagined being imprisoned just for getting a tattoo,\" Cornejo wrote. \"I never imagined being separated from my family. I wouldn't wish this on anyone, not even my worst enemy if I had one. It's horrible, it's mental torture every day.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trump Officials Are Keeping Ties to His Social Media Company\n\nMother Jones illustration\n\nFor Donald Trump, TruthSocial, his unsuccessful and money-losing Twitter competitor, has mainly been a place to retreat to when banned from the former, and a megaphone to trumpet his many opinions on his enemies, golf, and the music of Paul Anka . But the company that owns TruthSocial, Trump Media & Technology Group, has also been a way for the president to draw his political allies closer, through payments, board seats, and generous stock rewards. While the publicly-traded TMTG is unlikely to ever become a real success outside the Trump universe, it provides a window into his transactional second presidency and its unprecedented mingling of his corporate and political fiefdoms.\n\n\"The road to influence in the United States runs through Trump Media.\"\n\nThree people who have held shares or served on the board of TMTG have been appointed to high-profile positions in the Trump administration: Attorney General Pam Bondi, FBI director Kash Patel, and Secretary of Education Linda McMahon. The president has named at least four others with TMTG ties to federal roles. While some of these officials promised in federal ethics filings to divest from Trump's company after taking office, they have yet to file paperwork showing they've done so.\n\nSince Trump's reelection, TruthSocial is private business being used in a quasi-official capacity. Trump takes to TruthSocial to announce appointments, publicize his executive orders, and complain about judges-all of which makes it more or less necessary for journalists, politicians, and watchdogs to check the site. TMTG's stock (which trades as DJT, the president's initials) has been as volatile as Trump's presidency . It clocked a small increase last week after Trump announced the company would launch a series of cryptocurrency products .\n\nAs my colleague Russ Choma recently noted , the company struggles to remain profitable as it spends money \"in odd and unhelpful ways.\" For instance, TMTG paid Donald Trump Jr. $813,000, a quarter of TMTG's 2024 annual revenue, \"just for showing up at board meetings,\" Choma wrote. CEO Devin Nunes, a former California Republican congressman, has made at least $6.3 million running the company since 2022-\"a stunning figure for a firm that is struggling to earn any money,\" Choma noted.\n\nNow, a new analysis by Accountable U.S., a nonprofit corporate and government watchdog group, has found that few of the administration officials with ties to TMTG have filed documentation proving they've divested from the company. While McMahon and Bondi still have more time to complete their promises to divest within 90 days of their appointments, Patel previously suggested to senators weighing his nomination that he has nothing to divest. (The Department of Education, Bondi's office, and the FBI did not respond to requests for comment.) As for Trump himself, the president said before the election that he wouldn't divest from his businesses if he took office again. In December, he transferred his shares of TMTG, then worth around $4 billion, into a revocable trust of which he is the sole beneficiary.\n\nAccording to TMTG's Securities and Exchange Commission filings , several Trump-appointed officials have owned large amounts of shares in the company, which are valuable despite the company's often uninspiring stock market performance. June 2024 SEC filings show Bondi holding 106,250 shares, worth about $2 million today. On archived versions of the company's website , both Patel and McMahon were listed as \"directors\" of TMTG's board until sometime in mid-March, weeks after both were sworn in to run federal agencies. McMahon was replaced on the board by former GOP congressman George Holding ; Patel's spot was filled by former Trump Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt .\n\nWhile Patel told senators in written testimony that he'd never been paid as a TMTG director, according to SEC documents, Patel earned $120,000 annually as a consultant beginning in 2022 . When asked during his Senate confirmation how many shares he owned in TMTG and if he would divest them, he wrote only, \"I have never accepted compensation for serving as a board member for Trump Media and Technology Group, and as such, I do not have any ownership or stake in this company.\" The same day, a SEC filing revealed that Patel was gifted about $826,000 worth of TMTG stock at a board meeting in January, with a quarter immediately available and the remainder to vest over the following two years, though he told a Senate committee that he would not accept the shares.\n\n\"Even though this represented compensation for past services I had provided,\" Patel wrote, \"out of an abundance of caution and to avoid any appearance of any conflict, I did not and will not accept that compensation.\" On March 21, Patel divested himself of a number of other stocks, according to an Office of Government Ethics filing obtained by Mother Jones , including shares in Rumble, Palantir, Apple, Caterpillar, Cigna, and Eli Lilly, and Bitcoin from the cryptocurrency management company Grayscale. He didn't list having any TMTG stock to divest.\n\nLinda McMahon was gifted the same roughly $826,000 in stock at the same January board meeting as Patel, and also said she wouldn't accept it. She wrote in a federal ethics agreement that while she had accepted a \"$55,200 cash retainer payment for work that I performed in 2024,\" she would resign her director position and divest her shares. While she's done the former, there's no sign yet of paperwork proving she has divested her stock; she has until June 1 before the 90-day period in which she promised to do so expires.\n\nThere's no sign of paperwork proving Bondi or McMahon have divested their stock.\n\nBondi, meanwhile, wrote in her own ethics agreement that she worked as a consultant for a company called Renatus LLC, a company founded by Eric Swider, who was also the CEO of Digital World Acquisition Corp (DWAC), for whom Renatus provided administrative support. DWAC merged in 2024 with TMTG in a process that Forbes called \" drama-filled .\" While the shares Bondi received of  DWAC, were converted to interest in TMTG during the merger, she wrote in the agreement that she does not \"hold restricted stock, stock options, or any other equity interest in\" TMTG. She added that she would \"divest my interests in Trump Media & Technology Group, as soon as practicable but not later than 90 days after my confirmation.\" Thus far, she hasn't filed any paperwork proving she's done so; the 90-day window closes on May 5.\n\nBesides Patel, McMahon, and Bondi, other lower-ranking Trump officials also have ties to TMTG. None have explicitly promised to divest their stocks, nor are they legally required to. They include Nunes, who is TMTG chairman and CEO, and now also serves as the head of the President's Intelligence Advisory Board . In a TruthSocial post announcing Nunes' appointment to the position, Trump made it clear that Nunes would simultaneously be \"continuing his leadership of Trump Media & Technology Group.\" Nunes owns roughly $4.4 million in TMTG stock, and the company paid him a $1.6 million salary in 2024, and said it issued an \"executive promissory note\" to pay him $1.15 million more.\n\nScott Glabe, who also serves on the intelligence board, owns 297,498 shares of TMTG stock, according to documents filed with the SEC . Kari Lake, Trump's special advisor overseeing the gutting of the US Agency for Global Media, reported owning a small number of shares of TMTG in 2024, when she unsuccessfully ran for a Senate seat in Arizona. White House Deputy Chief of Staff Dan Scavino has also been associated with the company, serving as a board director from February 16, 2023 until March 25, 2024, the month the company became publicly traded . He also had a $240,000 consulting contract with TMTG in 2024, plus expenses, received a $600,000 retention bonus, and holds a promissory note with the company worth $4 million, according to a TMTG SEC filing .\n\nDivesting business interests before taking public office used to be fairly standard; a 2023 review of the Biden Administration's compliance with divestiture and other ethics rules by the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington found most senior Biden officials not only exhibited a \"high\" degree of compliance, but offered \"examples of cabinet members going beyond required divestiture.\" Trump administration officials and Trump's own family, meanwhile, have not shown the same scruples, with predictable results: during Trump's first term, for instance, Jared and Ivanka Kushner earned some $640 million in outside income while serving in official White House roles. At the time CREW recommended that cabinet members and senior White House staff should be banned from \"owning and trading individual stocks and from retaining personal interests in family businesses that could make them susceptible to influence-peddling.\"\n\nTMTG is unlikely to become a broad source of personal enrichment, primarily because it's losing money. But as Politico has noted , the company gives \"corporate interests and foreign actors\" a route to influence the administration by purchasing shares or entering into other business relationships with TMTG.\n\nTrump's social media company is yet another way, Accountable U.S. argues, that Trump has invited and furthered the perception that his presidency is for sale.\n\n\"The unprecedented situation of President Trump rewarding investors and executives in his media company with administration jobs sends a clear message to the wealthy, corporate lobbyists and foreign interests that the road to influence in the United States runs through Trump Media,\" Accountable U.S. executive director Tony Carrk told Mother Jones . \"No one should be surprised that President Trump's first weeks in office have been about removing barriers to corruption and dismantling oversight, not about lowering costs for working families. Trump cares more about lining his own pockets and his wealthy friends' than putting money back into yours.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Trump Escaped Consequences. Now He's Running From the Truth.\n\nDonald Trump during a news conference at Mar-a-Lago, Tuesday, January 7, 2025. Evan Vucci/AP\n\nDonald Trump has won. He is set to be inaugurated on January 20, and he has convinced many Americans not only that his attempt four years ago to carry out a self-coup is not disqualifying, but that mentioning it now is kind of gauche.\n\nEveryone feels they know what happened on January 6. It was on TV. So were the January 6 committee hearings. Special Counsel Jack Smith charged Trump in 2023 for four crimes related to his effort to subvert the 2020 election and revealed new information about Trump's alleged crimes in a superseding indictment in October. There isn't much left to learn.\n\nThe same, to a lesser extent, goes for Smith's charges against Trump for obstructing government efforts to recover classified documents he lifted from the White House and the Trump's Friday sentencing in New York following his conviction for falsifying documents to hide hush money payments.\n\nAnd yet, Florida district court Judge Aileen Cannon's latest comically pro-Trump ruling, her order Tuesday that temporarily blocks the public release of Smith's report on his two criminal investigations of Trump, remains a big deal. So does New York Judge Juan Merchan's scheduled sentencing of Trump on Friday, despite Merchan's indication that he will not impose an actual penalty. That hearing remains on after a New York appeals court refused Trump's last-ditch attempt to block it.\n\nTrump has evaded consequences for his crimes-those alleged and those for which he was convicted-but his efforts to evade the truth, or at least to suppress it, continue.\n\nThat is what is at stake in Trump lawyers' frantic recent attempts to block Smith's report and Trump's sentencing. Those efforts are part of the incoming president's campaign to impose a public narrative in which his election equals his \"complete exoneration\" from the criminal charges against him, as his lawyers recently suggested in a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland. That isn't true. Trump's election did cause to Smith drop his cases to comply with DOJ's policy against prosecuting presidents, and it seems to have led Merchan to plan to avoid penalizing Trump. But Trump's narrow election victory does not make him innocent of the crimes he was convicted of and charged with.\n\nA president conspiring to steal an election, in particular, remains bad, even if he wins the next one. Releasing Smith's report, should Garland do that, would be a reminder of that truth.\n\nCannon on Tuesday dutifully complied with a heated demand from Trump's lawyers. \"The release of any confidential report prepared by this out-of-control private citizen unconstitutionally posing as a prosecutor would be nothing more than a lawless political stunt, designed to politically harm President Trump,\" they wrote .\n\nJustice Department regulations call for special counsels to submit confidential reports to the Attorney General at the conclusion of their investigations. Smith has prepared a two-volume report that is expected to detail his separate investigations into Trump's efforts to steal the 2020 election and to keep classified government documents he removed from the White House after his defeat. Cannon has no role in the January 6 case and only an arguable one in the documents one, which she already dismissed in a widely-faulted ruling Smith is contesting before an appeals court in Atlanta. Still, Cannon's order applies to Smith's findings in both of his investigations.\n\nTrump, in a news conference Tuesday highlighted by his refusal to rule out preemptive wars to seize Greenland and Panama, reacted to Cannon's order by calling her \"a very strong and very brilliant judge.\"\n\nIt's not clear if Smith's report will remain suppressed. Cannon, in her ruling, said she was blocking publication of Smith's report only until the appeals court rules on a separate request to prevent publication of the report. The Justice Department, which said in a filing Tuesday that it has no plans to release either report before Friday, has not said if it plans to publish either volume of the report.\n\nBut as Trump prepares to limit dissent once he's in office, Garland releasing the report, like Merchan going through with Trump's sentencing, would be a modest but notable assertion of the limits of the aspiring autocrat's power to dictate reality.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Country's Most Famous Houseplant Is Missing. What Did Trump Do With It?\n\nStephanie Mencimer March 8, 2025\n\nMother Jones; Barry Thumma/AP; Evan Vucci/AP\n\nMother Jones; Barry Thumma/AP; Evan Vucci/AP\n\nAfter the Washington Post ran a front-page photo of President Trump and Benjamin Netanyahu sitting in front of the Oval Office fireplace on February 4, careful reader Thomas M. Sneeringer fired off a letter to the editor. \"It appears the fireplace mantel in the Oval Office has been subjected to President Donald Trump's Midas touch,\" he wrote . Sneeringer observed that the spray of Swedish ivy that has adorned the mantle for more than half a century had vanished, replaced by what he speculated might be... golf trophies?\n\n\"I was instantly offended and instantly understood how it happened,\" Sneeringer told me in an interview. \"It was just so consistent about what we know about Trump's taste.\"\n\nHe knew that the missing ivy was no ordinary plant. Irish ambassador Thomas J. Kiernan had given it to President John F. Kennedy as a gift in 1961, and ever since it has been a consistent backdrop to some of the most famous White House meetings. Back in 1984, during the Reagan administration, Kurt Anderson wrote a tribute to \"The Plant\" in Time magazine :\n\n\"The Oval Office may be the headiest place in America. When the President, sitting in his desk chair at the southern tip of the Oval, stares dead ahead to the far wall, he sees The Plant. Anywhere else it would be a robust but unremarkable Swedish ivy. But there on the marble mantelpiece, day after consequential day, it basks in the power and the glory. No matter who has been inaugurated since 1961, The Plant has always stayed...The Swedish ivy, given its potential for leaks, is an Administration team player first and last.\"\n\nThe hardy plant's scalloped green leaves are center stage in photos of Ronald Reagan meeting Gorbachev, George H.W. Bush schmoozing with Bruce Willis and Nelson Mandela, and Jimmy Carter conferring with Yitzhak Rabin or having lunch with his wife Rosalynn. Nelson Shanks painted Bill Clinton leaning next to the ivy in his official presidential portrait.\n\nThe plant survived Trump's first term, and it was even there to bear witness to that awkward meeting between Trump and Joe Biden after the 2024 election.\n\nBut no more.\n\nSo where is it now? The White House did not respond to several inquiries about the plant's whereabouts or the gold statues that replaced it.\n\nLike so many things that Trump and his DOGE team are heedlessly destroying, the Oval Office ivy has a constituency that may not be immediately obvious to those wielding the chainsaws. With its own Instagram account and generations of progeny that even Elon Musk can't rival, the humble houseplant enjoys a cult following.\n\nNot really an ivy but closer to mint, and native to South Africa, not Sweden, Plectranthus verticillatus grows like a weed, making it well-suited to sharing. White House staffers over the years have given away clippings to visitors, interns, and many other lucky beneficiaries. Those gifted with a clipping have in turn passed along clippings to others. I have one that came from the Clinton Oval Office, and now my daughter has its offspring.\n\nJournalist Gabriela Riccardi got her cuttings by way of a White House official who convened a sendoff for her current and former staff at the end of Obama's second term. As a parting gift, the official gave away cuttings from the Oval Office mother plant. Riccardi's co-worker at the Atlantic scored one, and in turn shared clippings with two friends, one of whom passed a stem on to Riccardi. She told the story in Quartz in 2023:\n\n\"The staff gift came with legacy. It came with gravitas. And it came with just one request: Grow the plant yourself, then pass a cutting of it on to someone else. In that way, the ivy would spread from person to person, a symbol of the connection between a government and its people.\"\n\nDuring Covid, Riccardi's small cutting had wildly proliferated, so she decided to do something useful with the excess. She raffled off five clippings to anyone who donated $10 to When We All Vote , the civic group started by Michelle Obama to increase voter participation. The plants were so sought after that Riccardi raised more than $2,200. She was unaware that the original plant had recently gone MIA. \"It's a heartbreaker to hear that it's not there anymore,\" she told me after I gave her the bad news. \"I think it's just such a beautiful tradition.\"\n\nRiccardi and Sneeringer hope that the original plant has not been abandoned but is only in exile, being nurtured nearby  until a more tradition-conscious president returns to the Oval Office.\n\nBack in 1984, Kurt Anderson had interviewed Dale Haney, then the Supervisory White House Horticulturalist in charge of spritzing and pruning the country's most famous houseplant. Haney reverently dubbed his charge \"amazing\" for its resilience and resistance to pests. In 2008, he ascended to the job of White House grounds superintendent, and in 2022, the Bidens celebrated his 50 years of White House service with a photo with them and their dog, Commander. (A year later, Haney was immortalized in another photo when a tourist witnessed the dog bite Haney on the arm.) Haney picked out this year's White House Christmas tree , but the press office did not respond to an email asking whether he still works there.\n\nSneeringer hopes he does, as Haney seems like someone who'd orchestrate an ivy rescue mission. \"Wouldn't it be great if he was keeping it somewhere?\" he asked hopefully.\n\nWith all the terrible things happening in the country right now, Sneeringer admits that complaining about the missing ivy may seem \"sort of petty.\" But he sees the plant as much more than White House décor. The ivy, he told me, \"symbolized to me continuity and stability and all the things we value about how we change power in the country.\"\n\nFor him, the plant's disappearance is emblematic of Trump's assault on the federal government. \"He's completely unconcerned that this represents a break from tradition,\" he said. \"Or maybe no one bothered to tell him.\"\n\nCorrection, March 10: An earlier lead image for this story featured a grape ivy.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Gavin Newsom upon arrival in Los Angeles to see the Palisades and Eaton fire areas.. Photo by Mandel NGAN / AFP via Getty Images via Grist\n\nThis story was originally published b y Grist a nd is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration .\n\nWhile President Donald Trump has issued a flurry of far-reaching decrees during his first week in office, one relatively niche issue has received a disproportionate share of the president's ire and attention: California water policy. That might make sense if the remedies he's pursuing could help stem deadly fires like those that have killed at least 29 people in the Los Angeles area in recent weeks. Indeed, the president has claimed that \"firefighters were unable to fight the blaze due to dry hydrants, empty reservoirs, and inadequate water infrastructure.\"\n\nBut unfortunately for future fire victims, the sole apparent aim of the president's new policies is to deliver more water to farmers hundreds of miles away from the state's fire zones.\n\nOn his first day as president, Trump issued an executive order that directed his Interior Department to \"route more water\" to the southern part of the state. Then, on Sunday he issued another order that directed the department to immediately \"override\" the state's management of its water, even if it meant overruling California law. The order also suggested Trump could withhold federal wildfire aid if the state failed to comply to his satisfaction.\n\nTrump's order is \"unrecognizable as anything that anybody who knows anything about California water would write.\"\n\nBut the new measures wouldn't deliver any more water to Los Angeles at all. Instead, his attempt to relax water restrictions would move more water to large farms in the state's sparsely populated Central Valley, a longtime pet issue for the president, who attempted a similar maneuver during his first term. This time he's going further, proposing to gut endangered species rules and overrule state policy to deliver a win for the influential farmers who backed all three of his campaigns .\n\nNone of this has any relation to wildfires in Los Angeles. For one thing, the city isn't experiencing a water shortage. It was ferocious, hurricane-force winds that fanned the Palisades and Eaton Fires-not a lack of water to contain the blazes. While some local water tanks in the neighborhood of Pacific Palisades did run out of water, that was only because the city couldn't pump new supplies up to the hillside neighborhood fast enough to keep up with skyrocketing demand during the fire, not because there wasn't enough water available to send there.\n\nEven if Los Angeles were low on water, Trump's executive orders wouldn't help with that, because the federal government's canal system doesn't actually deliver any water to the Los Angeles area. More than 90 percent of that water goes to farms in the Central Valley, with the rest going to far-away cities around San Francisco and Sacramento. All this water is already spoken for, and during dry years the government can't even fulfill all its existing contracts. The most it can do is potentially ease environmental rules that limit some of the pumping, which farmers have long opposed.\n\nBut even some farm advocates are skeptical of the sweeping scope of Trump's most recent order, and its specious connection to wildfire.\n\n\"I am always appreciative of attempts to create more flexibility for moving water around the state, but [federal] water by and large goes to agricultural contractors,\" said Alex Biering, the senior policy advocate at the California Farm Bureau Federation, the state's leading agricultural lobby. \"I don't believe that any amount of additional water coming from the federal project would be able to be applied to stop that fire. It's an attempt to tie water supply to a natural disaster, but those connections don't exist in reality.\"\n\nEnvironmental groups, meanwhile, have blasted Trump's attempt to strongarm California water policy, saying his most recent order would be devastating for the state's vulnerable fish species-and the integrity of the federal Endangered Species Act as a whole.\n\n\"It's unrecognizable as anything that anybody who knows anything about California water would write,\" said Jon Rosenfield, the science director at San Francisco Baykeeper, an environmental nonprofit in the Golden State. \"It's not from this planet.\n\nCalifornia's water system has been the subject of heated political debate for decades. Over the course of the 20th century, the federal government and the state of California built a complex series of dams and canals designed to move water from the northern parts of the state, which see substantial precipitation and snowmelt, down to the agriculture-rich Central Valley and the Los Angeles metropolitan area.\n\nThe federal government operates dams, canals, and pumping stations that push water south through the valley, and then the state operates the canal that extends down to Los Angeles. The system provides water to around 30 million Californians and irrigates around 4 million acres of the nation's most productive farmland.\n\nThe crux of this transport system is the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, a sensitive marshland region where two of the state's largest rivers converge and flow out into the San Francisco Bay. This area is also the point where endangered fish species like Chinook salmon enter from the Pacific and swim upstream to spawn.\n\nIf the federal and state pumps move too much water out of the Delta for farms and cities, they reverse current flows, pulling fish toward their predators or sucking them into the pumps. This is a violation of the Endangered Species Act. One of these vulnerable fish species, the 2-inch gray baitfish known as the Delta smelt, is particularly sensitive to these current changes, and the government often limits its pumping to protect it.\n\nOn Monday night, Trump erroneously claimed in a Truth Social post that he had the military \"turn on the water...flowing abundantly from the Pacific Northwest, and beyond\" by activating the pumps, which had been offline for a few days for maintenance. The pumped water does not come from the Pacific Northwest, and because the federal government already controls the pumps and uses them all the time, such an action does not require the involvement of the military.\n\nIt's California's own state-run canal system that actually delivers water to Los Angeles and numerous other cities in Southern California-and the federal government has no jurisdiction over this. The state government curtails these water deliveries somewhat during dry years to maintain a robust supply, and it seldom provides all the water that each city requests. However, deliveries to Los Angeles were typical last year, and reservoir levels in the state are above average. (Furthermore, the Los Angeles metro gets a larger share of its water from other sources, like the Colorado River and the Owens Valley.)\n\nDespite his East Coast upbringing, Donald Trump has fixated on Central Valley water issues for years. He chose David Bernhardt, who has lobbied for the influential Westlands Water District, to lead the Department of the Interior during his first administration. He also hosted multiple rallies in the region during his 2020 campaign, during which he frequently foregrounded water policy. During his appearance on the Joe Rogan podcast last year, then-candidate Trump led the host through a diatribe about water, describing dried-out farmland he saw while traveling through the region with Central Valley members of Congress years earlier.\n\n\"We're driving up, and I had never seen it before,\" he said. \"I said, 'Do you have a drought? They said, 'No...in order to protect a tiny little fish, the water gets routed into the Pacific.' So I see this, and I said, 'You've got to be kidding.'\"\n\nDuring his first term, Trump did draft new rules in an attempt to accelerate water deliveries from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. Those rules proposed that pumping should be limited only when smelt-friendly turbid waters are present in the Delta, but they also contained a few provisions that farm groups said led to wasted water during recent wet periods, and failed to prevent salmon death even by their own metrics. After Joe Biden succeeded Trump in office, the Democratic president tweaked those rules in a joint effort with the state of California-and many environmental groups have criticized Biden's rules as worse for fish than Trump's.\n\nTrump may go much further this time. His most recent executive order calls for another wholesale rewrite of the pumping rules, proposes building new dams around the state, and even suggests that his administration could declare the Delta smelt functionally extinct. It also proposes to convene the federal committee known colloquially as the \"God Squad,\" a group of agency heads that can grant exemptions to the Endangered Species Act. This has only happened a few times since the law took effect, but in theory the \"God Squad\" could allow the government to pump much more water to farms, even if it means jeopardizing the very existence of smelt or salmon runs-or drying out the Delta.\n\nSome of California's most powerful water districts, which are typically run by large agricultural landowners, have praised the executive order, although they haven't followed Trump in connecting it to the fires. For instance, the Westlands Water District, which covers more than half a million acres on the west side of the Central Valley, said in a statement that they \"welcomed\" Trump's \"leadership in addressing the barriers to water delivery.\"\n\nBut despite the bluster of the White House actions, it's far from clear that any of these changes will come to pass, at least in the short term. California water is one of the most heavily litigated issues in the United States, and even small tweaks to the state's pumping system would likely raise legal challenges.\n\n\"They can try a lot of this stuff,\" said Biering, the California Farm Bureau advocate. \"It's just about: How many times do you want to get sued?\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "There's something big missing from Trump's post-war manufacturing fantasy\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nMany Trump supporters are celebrating his new tariffs on the hope that they'll make America great again by bringing manufacturing back to the U.S . \"For four years, Americans couldn't afford groceries, let alone a house,\" Department of Housing and Urban Development Secretary Scott Turner wrote on X last Wednesday, \"This Liberation Day, @POTUS is bringing manufacturing and jobs back. President Trump is making the American Dream achievable again!\" That same day, Republican Sen. Jim Banks of Indiana said in a CNN interview that, \"The decision by President Trump today to impose reciprocal tariffs will be so good for Indiana.\" Banks went on to talk about his father's job at plant making axles for cars, saying, \"Those are the manufacturing jobs that President Trump is bringing back from overseas.\"\n\nThe problem is: those who credit manufacturing jobs for a glorious past America mistake correlation for causation. They think their parents and grandparents had the \"good life\" because of jobs in manufacturing. In reality, their parents and grandparents had that life because of unions, pensions, high marginal tax rates, and strong social policies - with a little post-war exceptionalism and a lot of racism and sexism thrown in.\n\nThe negotiation of a living wage was only possible thanks to the power that trade unions wielded at the time.\n\nThe decades following World War II represented the heyday of domestic manufacturing in the U.S., with more than a quarter of all U.S. workers employed in the sector at the time. Those decades are also the ones that Americans associate with the \"good life\" - getting married, living in a \"nice\" house in a \"nice\" neighborhood, raising kids on one breadwinner's income, taking slideshow-worthy summer vacations, and retiring comfortably at age 65, all without going to college, let alone taking on mountains of debt in student loans.\n\nToday, many Americans perceive that lifestyle as harder to access than it used to be, and they often assume that they can't have it because of declines in domestic manufacturing . Yet, even in manufacturing's heyday, that \"good life\" wasn't open to just anyone, wasn't good for everyone and wasn't actually the product of factory jobs.\n\nFrom the 1950s through the 1970s, for example, Black men and white men in the U.S. were employed in manufacturing at roughly similar rates. Yet, the average white man working the industry was paid substantially more than his Black counterpart - a difference of more than $10,000 a year in today's dollars. On top of those wage differences, Black families also faced further discrimination in access to education , low-cost mortgages , and rapidly growing suburban neighborhoods .\n\nMeanwhile, the women who had stepped in to staff the factories during World War II were pushed out of manufacturing jobs and often out of the workforce entirely . Policymakers and union leaders told women it was their womanly purpose and patriotic duty to either go back to the home front or fill the jobs that men didn't want. Even Woodie Guthrie, in the last verse of \" Union Maid ,\" sang, \"You gals who want to be free, just take a tip from me // Get you a man who's a union man // And join the ladies' auxiliary. // Married life ain't hard when you've got a union card // A union man has a happy life // When he's got a union wife.\"  That lack of competition from women made it easier for men - especially U.S.-born white men - to negotiate for a family wage . That family wage offered women - especially U.S.-born white women - a path out of precarity, but it also incentivized them to accept roles where they were economically dependent on and socially subservient to men.\n\nEven with the reduced competition, though, the negotiation of a living wage was only possible thanks to the power that trade unions wielded at the time. In the decades after World War II, roughly one in three U.S. workers were union members, compared to only about one in ten today. Unions helped increase manufacturing wages and reduce wage gaps between front-line workers, managers, and CEOs. They also helped create and maintain other employment protections, like 40-hour workweeks , health insurance , and defined-benefit pensions that guaranteed a steady income even after workers retired.\n\nHigh taxes helped subsidize the \"good life\" for American families (especially White families) who couldn't have afforded that life on their own.\n\nAs unions fought to protect workers from falling at the bottom, policymakers also moved to prevent runaway wealth at the top . At the federal level, the highest marginal tax rate increased rapidly after World War II, peaked at 92% in 1953, and remained above 70% until the early 1980s, after which it fell dramatically to just 37% today.\n\nThose high taxes helped subsidize the \"good life\" for American families (especially white families) who couldn't have afforded that life on their own. That money fueled innovations that increased lifespans and standards of those lives (including by allowing Americans to buy cheap goods produced in countries with laxer labor protections). That money also expanded access to education , making it possible for the children of factory workers to go to college and avoid the physical pain that their fathers suffered from manufacturing work.\n\nIn the absence of unions, higher taxes, and robust regulations, we risk slipping back to an earlier era of U.S. manufacturing - one far more precarious than the one we find ourselves in today. In the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries - the height of the Gilded Age Trump has touted in promoting his tariffs - manufacturing jobs were difficult, dangerous, and often deadly. Worse still, the absence of government welfare programs left families one death or injury away from destitution, and forced them to take whatever jobs they could get, no matter how terrible or poorly paid. And, the absence of child labor laws and Social Security drove up the supply of factory workers in ways that drove down wages for workers of all races.\n\nEssentially, the nostalgia that some Americans feel for the factory is just misplaced frustration with the way they've been forced to live in a DIY society : to protect themselves and their families from the risk of precarity with fewer unions and hollowed-out government supports.\n\nThose who are betting on Trump and his promise to bring back manufacturing risk putting us all in a more precarious position-pushing us back to Gilded Age levels of inequality , and to a time when the \"good life\" was accessible only to the robber barons, while the rest of America struggled to get by.\n\nDr. Jessica Calarco is a sociologist and author of \" Holding it Together: How Women Became America's Safety Net .\"\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Those assumptions were quickly discredited as the administration rounded up, among others, plenty of people who've never been convicted - or even accused of - committing a crime.\n\nSimilarly, many assumed the Republican's deportation plan would focus on noncitizens. Those assumptions are in doubt, too. The Hill reported :\n\nPresident Trump said Sunday he would \"love\" to send American inmates to El Salvador's mega-prison but first needs to check if it's legal. Speaking with reporters on Air Force One, Trump was asked whether he plans to discuss with El Salvador President Nayib Bukele his offer to take in and house American prisoners.\n\n\"Well, I love that,\" Trump said. \"If we could take some of our 20-time wise guys that push people into subways and that hit people over the back of the head and that purposely run people over in cars - if he would take them, I would be honored to give them.\"\n\nHe went on to say, \"I don't know what the law says on that, but I can't imagine the law would say anything different.\"\n\nIn case this isn't painfully obvious, there is already a system in place to deal with Americans who push people into subways, hit people over the back of the head, and purposely run people over in cars. It's called the criminal justice system. People are charged, tried, convicted and imprisoned by way of this system all the time.\n\nWhat Trump referred to is a different kind of model in which American citizens who commit violent crimes are, for all intents and purposes, deported to foreign detention facilities.\n\nWhat's more, these comments were not the first time the president broached the subject. On the contrary, Trump published an item to his social media platform a few weeks ago, musing about sending Americans to a prison in El Salvador if they're convicted of vandalizing Tesla vehicles.\n\nIn January, roughly a week into his second term, the Republican made related comments , suggesting that United States might be willing to pay a \"small fee\" to foreign countries to imprison American criminals.\n\nHe repeated the sentiment , using nearly identical phrasing, in early February.\n\nIn the latest iteration, Trump said he \"can't imagine\" this would be illegal. Presumably, administration attorneys will eventually explain otherwise that the limits of his imagination, coupled with his ignorance about legal limits, are a problem.\n\nThe next question, of course, would be whether the president would let legal limits stop him from doing what he apparently wants to do.\n\nSteve Benen is a producer for \"The Rachel Maddow Show,\" the editor of MaddowBlog and an MSNBC political contributor.

Activate your online access\n\nYou can't make America great again by wrecking the government.\n\nWhat to make of the blur of news, revolutionary rhetoric, panicky fundraising texts, economic indicators, the plunging stock market , and, of course, President Trump's address to a joint session of Congress on March 4, 2025? Are we on the brink of a socioeconomic Armageddon? Or is there-as the great Tallulah Bankhead once said, \"less in this than meets the eye\"?\n\nLeaving aside the buckets called \"culture wars\" and \"foreign policy,\" we may distinguish eight distinct forces at work in Trump's economics. They are (a) the targeted destruction of specific regulatory agencies, (b) random disruptions of the federal civil service, (c) old-fashioned Reaganism, (d) tariffs, (e) migration, (f) energy, (g) the military, and (h) the general effect of rash and unpredictable policymaking-otherwise called uncertainty and chaos.\n\nTargeted destruction. Trump's early days have seen the declared end for the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the National Labor Relations Board , crippling blows to the Environmental Protection Agency , and a start to dismantling the Department of Education , among others . These are regulatory and supervisory agencies specifically targeted by longtime adversaries, now empowered. Their demolition ( in whole or part ) is a political gesture that will weaken labor against business, consumers against bankers, and citizens against polluters. However, taken alone these will not have large economic effects in the short run.\n\nIn the longer run, systematic deregulation will degrade economic performance. Not all regulation is effective. But quite distinct from its social and health benefits, effective regulation serves the interests of advanced businesses, including in manufacturing, by forcing old, dirty, and unsafe technologies and low-wage competitors out. Trump's government, like others before it, is-unfortunately for its own declared strategy-in the hands of the reactionary branch of the business elite.\n\nArbitrary disruptions of the civil service occur through blanket measures such as the peremptory dismissal of probationary employees, pressured early retirements, office closings, and downsizing, notably at Veterans' Affairs , the Internal Revenue Service , the Social Security Administration , and other agencies, including the Forest Service and the National Park Service . The effect is to make those agencies less efficient at what they do. If there is a political strategy behind this, it is to deepen public frustration with the federal government, creating a feedback loop that can be exploited later. Over time, degrading the federal government will also degrade economic performance, fostering a race to the bottom as key functions are taken up, in part and inadequately, by state and local governments-or allowed to decay and disappear.\n\nOld-fashioned Reaganism turns up in Trump's budget: to cut spending (mostly Medicaid, if it happens), and cut taxes, while leaving defense alone. These are the most economically significant of Trump's measures-but their effect, relative to Reagan's, is doubtful. Medicaid now covers 90 million Americans; the program is popular, bipartisan, and may be difficult to cut . The Trump tax cuts are highly regressive-but they appear, so far, to be mainly extensions of current tax law that would otherwise expire. The Pentagon budget is already very high, which was not the case in 1981. Reaganomics did spur a strong recovery from the 1982 recession, giving Reagan his reelection boom. Trump's version may not have the same effect this time around.\n\nThe tariffs are the most dramatic of Trump's economic measures, because they lie within his sole discretion, and he can impose or retract them at will. In a simple world-like the one depicted in economics textbooks-they would fall straightforwardly on consumers or producers, and either way they foster import substitution on both sides of the tariff wall. In the real world of complex supply and production chains, they are highly disruptive and could kill the profits of major American firms-a fact that seems to have dawned, a bit late, on the Trump team. So the tariffs on Canada and Mexico were on-off-on and now off again, thanks (most likely) to stiff complaints from the auto makers . With respect to those countries, our largest and closest trading partners, it's possible that the big stick may turn into a weak reed.\n\nNot so with China, where the tariff war is on, and China is biting back . US tariffs on China will force supply chains for many Chinese goods to divert to other Asian countries-a boon, for instance, for Vietnam. China's tariffs will hit American farmers , who sell a large share of their wheat, corn, rice and meat to China. Both sides will adjust. A key consequence may be in the markets for high-end chips and software, as the US moves to restrict or shut down Chinese apps like TikTok, DeepSeek and WeChat, not to mention RedNote. Is this, perchance, the agenda of formerly free-trading oligarchs in the tech sector, suddenly faced with superior competition in their niche?\n\nWe do not yet know where Trump's tariffs will settle; a general high-tariff regime is possible. What would it bring? Higher prices for American consumers, and higher profits for businesses protected by tariff walls. Will it bring back jobs and production to American shores? Probably not. Monopoly power usually brings lower output at higher prices; there is no automatic path from higher profits to competitiveness. If the government wants more (and better) production, it needs extra tools: mandatory investment directives, excess profits taxes, credit allocation and price controls, public purchase and ownership of new factories-and above all competent public supervision of private performance. That is how it was done in the New Deal and in the mobilization for World War II-creating the era of American dominance to which Trump would like to return.\n\nTrump's energy policy is \"drill, baby, drill.\" Here the US does have a big cost advantage, especially in natural gas, over most of the world. Let's also admit that subsidies for renewable energy and electric cars were oversold. And let's overlook the environmental consequences, for a moment. Will Trump deliver a new age of cheap and abundant fossil fuels? Apart from geology itself, drilling depends much less on deregulation than on price. So far, under Trump, the oil price is falling, and so is drilling , which peaked back in 2023. Cheap is possible; cheap and abundant, to fuel an industrial revival? We'll see.\n\nTrump's military program appears twofold: to boom US arms exports to Europe , while reorienting the Pentagon toward Asia and missile defense . Sales of overpriced kit to the Europeans would help the big military contractors and permit the US military to shift missions-toward a world-ending war with China that, let's hope, never happens. Saddling Europe with financial and manpower responsibility for confrontation with Russia would be a disaster for Europe -but one can see how it fits into a US calculus in economic and military terms. A major reset of the US military is long overdue-the bases, ships, and aircraft are all obsolete and would not withstand serious combat. But so far, it appears, Trump appears content to waste real resources on a military whose power is, to a large degree, illusory. This, too, is an obstacle to the economic transformation he purports to seek.\n\nMigration figures large in Trump's rhetoric but only trivially in his economics. At the present pace of deportations (about a thousand per day) a shortage of labor in the low-end services migrants presently perform is unlikely, although fear may keep many away from their present jobs. Even so, American wages will not be restored by a mere shortage of undocumented workers.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nBooks & the Arts / Brett Christophers\n\nUncertainty and chaos are the final factors in Trump's operation. The winners, broadly, will be financial speculators with fast fingers and (especially) inside knowledge. Those in position to move quickly in and out of stocks, bonds and real estate-and perhaps even in and out of the dollar from a base in crypto -could be the biggest winners. The apex financial and tech predators, already at Trump's feeding trough, could end up in control of the whole economy. Which may be their goal. Well, no surprise-it's an oligarch's world, is it not?\n\nAnd what do the oligarchs want? Like all feudal lords, they want untrammeled power and insecure, obedient serfs-and for this, the vast social services operation that is the US federal government must be cut back, along with the professional classes who form the modern core of the Democratic Party. The words of Andrew Mellon (as recalled by Herbert Hoover) come to mind: \"Liquidate labor, liquidate stocks, liquidate the farmers, liquidate real estate. Purge the rottenness out of the system.... enterprising people will pick up the wrecks from less competent people.\" The problem the oligarchs face, and possibly do not understand, is that they cannot do this, any more now than then, without bringing the economy to ruin-from which recovery will be possible only with the competent government they are now working to destroy.\n\nWill they push that far? For now the budget deficit remains high (about 6 percent of GDP), and this supports economic activity. Firing federal employees saves little money in the large scheme of the economy. Apart from severe Medicaid cuts, there is little in Trump's cost-cutting plans that could reduce deficits by much-a good thing, as that would drive GDP down.\n\nOn the other hand, the Federal Reserve is keeping interest rates up-a bad thing that could be bringing on a recession even now, but given the Fed's failure to slow the economy over three years, it's hard to be sure. The stock market is skittish, to say the least. The New York Times has caught wind of a slowdown and naturally blames Trump -in mainstream journalism, economics and witchcraft are easily confused.\n\nApart from interest rates, perhaps the largest risk is the simple fact that the expansion is getting old. Some shock-a stock crash, a financial crisis, a new war, or a new pandemic-could occur at any time. But a general slowdown in business and household spending, not specifically Trump's fault but aggravated by the chaos and uncertainty in Washington, may be the biggest single threat right now. If that happens, Trump's reaction will tell us just how much pain his team is prepared to allow.\n\nOver the longer term, it is hard for an old progressive, who fought against the forces of deindustrialization and financialization when they took control under Reagan in the early 1980s, not to sympathize with the stated vision of the old man now in charge. But it is one thing to yearn for a vanished past of superior American engineering, industrial strength and technological prowess-and quite another to create the conditions for revival. Handing the economy over to libertarians, monopolists, speculators, and rich reactionaries with big egos will not make America great again.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Current and former employees at the agency spoke with The Nation about the chaos inside the department as the administration released layoff notifications and aligned the department with President Trump's political agenda. The Department of Education did not respond to multiple requests for comment.\n\nEmployees were notified on Tuesday that the department's offices would be closed starting at 6 pm due to \"security reasons,\" per a copy of an e-mail obtained by The Nation . Confusion and rumors began to swirl about potential shake-ups, according to an employee who was laid off and granted anonymity for fear of losing their severance benefits. \"We were all trying to figure out 'What's the security concern?,'\" they said.\n\nFifteen minutes after the offices closed, the department announced the layoffs. But employees were not initially told whether they were one of the approximately 1,300 who were fired. Employees called and texted one another in an attempt to learn if they still had a job. Those fired did not receive an e-mail notifying them of their termination until 7:30 pm -over an hour after it was announced to the public.\n\nThe termination e-mail, obtained by The Nation , says the decision was a result of Trump's executive order establishing the so-called Department of Government Efficiency and a memo from the Office of Personnel Management advising workforce cuts. \"This decision is in no way a reflection of your performance or contributions,\" the e-mail reads. But one employee said that rhetoric from the administration about \"bureaucratic bloat,\" including Secretary of Education Linda McMahon's comments Tuesday on Fox News, has made federal employees ask: \"Why would anyone want to hire me after this if there's been messaging that we're not good people?\"\n\nMcMahon hinted at the move in a department-wide e-mail to staff sent last week titled \"Our Department's Final Mission.\" Criticizing DEI programs, federal bureaucracy, and alleged anti-American ideology in schools, she wrote that \"we will partner with Congress and other federal agencies to determine the best path forward to fulfill the expectations of the president and the American people.\"\n\nMcMahon has acknowledged that fully shutting down the agency, which was created by statute in 1979, would require an act of Congress. But the expansive nature of the layoffs effectively paralyzes the department, according to a former employee. \"By the time there is an act of Congress, there isn't going to be anything left anyway.\"\n\n\"The ramifications of this will be enormous,\" according to one employee, who said that the political upheaval from these firings is only just beginning. \"We're going to see a societal shift on education.\" The department vowed that the eliminations will not impact the agency's statutory functions, such as Pell Grants, funding for students with disabilities, and student loans. An employee pushed back on this, saying, \"It's impossible for statutory functions to occur without the necessary people in place to provide oversight and make sure they are implemented appropriately and in a timely manner.\"\n\n\"We were already understaffed and trying to do our best,\" they said. \"This gutting of the agency will harm millions of people and interrupt services and activities across America.\"\n\nA coalition of 20 state attorneys general, led by New York Attorney General Leticia James, filed a lawsuit Thursday against the Trump administration over the department's Tuesday firings. In a press release, James called the move \"madness,\" arguing that \"this administration may claim to be stopping waste and fraud, but it is clear that their only mission is to take away the necessary services, resources, and funding that students and their families need.\"\n\nThe administration's crusade began well before Tuesday's layoffs. In a February 5 e-mail, employees were directed to ensure compliance with some of Trump's DEI- and gender-related orders. They included a list of keywords they say were unacceptable, including \"fairness,\" \"access,\" \"empathy,\" \"homosexual,\" \"equity,\" gender,\" \"LGBTQ,\" \"social justice,\" and more.\n\nEmployees removed letters \"supporting LGBTQI+ youth and families in school,\" \"supporting intersex students,\" \"supporting transgender youth,\" and a resource guide for \"confronting anti-LGBTQ+ harassment in schools\" from the department's website, according to a partial list of removals obtained by The Nation .\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nRev. Dr. Liz Theoharis and Noam Sandweiss-Back\n\nSaree Makdisi\n\nThat same day, employees were sent an e-mail requiring them to review all new and ongoing grants to ensure \"department grants do not fund discriminatory practices-including in the form of D.E.I.\" In a team meeting to discuss the new orders, employees planned to begin a review of all Education Department grants that contain these keywords. The department began cutting millions of dollars in grants later that month they claim contained DEI.\n\nIn January, the department also stopped the development of Spanish translations for trainings that are provided to agency personnel and grant awardees, according to an employee and an internal e-mail. An e-mail sent last week, and reviewed by The Nation , said that the department was considering fully removing all Spanish trainings from its website.\n\nBefore Tuesday's layoffs, some employees in the department received buyout offers of up to $25,000, per an internal e-mail. The employees were also sent the \"Fork in the Road\" e-mail in late January, offering a deferred resignation. Other probationary employees were also terminated. Dozens of employees associated with DEI initiatives in the department were also placed on administrative leave, according to an e-mail obtained by The Nation .\n\nSheria Smith, the president of the union that represents thousands of Education Department employees, said at the time that \"our members want to continue their important work for the public and are frustrated that their work has been disrupted.\"\n\nThese shake-ups have left employees feeling scared and uneasy, as they only learn about the termination through news reports. \"Sometimes I'll e-mail someone and just get an automated response that they are on administrative leave,\" they said, \"and I had no clue they were put on leave.\"\n\nMcMahon said that nearly 600 employees voluntarily resigned or retired over the past seven weeks. Tuesday's layoffs cut about 1,300 additional workers. Similar layoffs have been seen at other agencies in recent weeks, including at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the US Agency for International Development.\n\nPlans for the agency's elimination have not been a secret. Campaigning a third time for the presidency, Trump vowed to eliminate the department and dismantle the federal government's role in education while simultaneously hoping to assume a more intensive ideological regulatory role . In his eye, doing so would combat an education system \"taken over by the radical left maniacs.\"\n\nEven with the vow to dismantle the department, Trump and his inner circle have been brandishing the Education Department's main enforcement mechanisms-federal funding and investigations-as a punishment for those they view as not conforming to their executive authority.\n\nThe Education Department, in conjunction with other federal agencies, has opened investigations and sent warning letters to schools they believe are not doing enough to protect Jewish students amid pro-Palestinian protests on campus. Last Friday, the administration canceled $400 million in federal funds to Columbia University \"due to the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\"\n\nRumors of an executive action to substantially dismantle the department have been swirling in Washington for weeks. In an interview on Fox News last Friday, McMahon said that Trump \"certainly intends\" to sign an executive order that would remake the department and ensure that \"education is back at the state level where it belongs.\"\n\nOn February 4 in the Oval Office, Trump said his administration would \"have to work with the teachers' union\" to eliminate the department \"because the teachers' union is the only one that's opposed to it.\" Becky Pringle, president of the largest US teachers' union, the National Education Association, previously denounced the potential executive action, calling it a \"wrecking ball at public schools.\"\n\n\"We won't be silent as anti-public education politicians try to steal opportunities from our students, our families, and our communities to finance tax cuts for billionaires,\" she said. \"Together with parents and allies, we will continue to organize, advocate, and mobilize so that all students have well-resourced schools.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

Activate your online access\n\nThe litigation would afford schools a high-profile venue in which to detail the Trump administration's lawlessness and aggression.\n\nThe Trump administration's assault on higher education continues to escalate. The White House has pressured universities into shutting down diversity and equity programs of all sorts, terminated hundreds of millions of dollars in research grants inconsistent with its political agenda, and moved to slash reimbursements for the grants that remain. The Department of Education has opened investigations into more than 60 colleges and universities. Most alarming, the Department of Homeland Security has started sending agents onto campuses across the country to arrest and deport noncitizen students and faculty who have engaged in pro-Palestinian advocacy.\n\nIn hindsight, all of this looks predictable. Vice President Vance gave a speech in 2021 titled \"The Universities Are the Enemy.\" The Heritage Foundation's Project Esther calls for the use of counterterrorism tactics to \"disrupt and degrade\" student activism in the name of combating antisemitism. And attacks on universities' finances and freedoms have become a defining feature of authoritarian regimes worldwide. Even so, the speed and scale of President Trump's effort to tear down higher education has been shocking to many in the field. After decades of enjoying a mutually beneficial partnership with the federal government, university leaders have struggled to find their bearings as their chief patron has turned against them.\n\nColumbia University is currently the leading case in point. Citing \"the school's continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students,\" the Trump administration announced on March 7 the \"immediate cancellation\" of $400 million in contracts and grants. Less than a week later, the administration sent Columbia a list of demands , including changes to academic policies and internal governance bodies with little connection to antisemitism, as \"a precondition for formal negotiations regarding Columbia University's continued financial relationship with the United States government.\" Both the immediate funding cutoff and the extortionate demand letter are unprecedented in the history of US higher education. Columbia acceded to a modified version of each demand. The White House pocketed those concessions and, by all appearances, promptly forced out the university's interim president.\n\nIt is unclear at this time whether Columbia will ever get the $400 million back. From a legal perspective, the remarkable thing is that the university has not already tried. For as numerous scholars (including two of us) have pointed out -and as no expert inside or outside the government has denied-the Trump administration's demand letter is unlawful six ways to Sunday. The demands do not comply with the procedural or substantive rules of the federal statute on which they are based, and they violate the due process rights of the university and its researchers, as well as First Amendment guarantees of academic freedom. The illegality of the government's effort to punish and control Columbia is not a close call .\n\nSo, why didn't Columbia simply tear up the demand letter and sue? The most fundamental reason is that the university receives close to $1.5 billion per year in federal funds, and a vindictive president could try to cut much of that money on some other pretext. In addition to being costly and time-consuming, litigation to recover the $400 million might prove a pyrrhic victory if the government were to respond by inflicting even greater economic pain. Columbia's board of trustees is a risk-averse, business-oriented group-like most contemporary university boards -and certain trustees may be not just grudgingly acquiescent but genuinely enthusiastic about certain reforms they have made in response to Trump's demands. But even the most outraged academic leaders must think twice before suing this administration.\n\nRecognizing as much, universities nationwide have given little indication that they intend to fight back in court against the defunding of their scientists or the deportation of their students. Hardly any university leaders said a word in defense of Columbia. (Nor, for that matter, did New York's Democratic governor or its Democratic senators.) Less than a week after issuing its demand letter to Columbia, the Trump administration suspended $175 million in federal grants to the University of Pennsylvania because the school allowed a transgender woman to compete on its women's swimming team several years ago. This funding cutoff is legally dubious on some of the same grounds as the Columbia cutoff, yet there are no reports that Penn is planning to sue. Other institutions are engaging in similar anticipatory obedience , shuttering diversity offices and climate initiatives, abandoning policies aimed at transgender inclusion, and clamping down on outspoken Middle Eastern studies scholars.\n\nThe result is a classic race to the bottom. University administrators are sacrificing more and more of their academic mission in the hope of avoiding additional funding cuts or, worse, escalating state violence against the most vulnerable members of their community. This is unfolding in plain sight, notwithstanding that leading scholars of fascism have made it crystal clear that only concerted collective action stands a chance against such authoritarian predations.\n\nAttempting to fight on universities' behalf, organizations like the American Association of University Professors, the American Federation of Teachers, and the Knight First Amendment Institute have filed lawsuits challenging the suspension of funds and the potential deportation of students for their constitutionally protected speech. In many ways, these and similar suits model the sort of faculty governance that has all but disappeared from American higher education in recent years-an absence that helped yield the present moment. Pockets of legal courage still exist.\n\nSuch organizations, however, lack the material resources and media-generating capacity of rich universities. They will not always be able to assert some of the strongest legal claims, which belong to the universities themselves when their institutional interests have been threatened. Even more frustratingly, these organizations cannot prevent administrators and trustees from conceding defeat before a complaint can be filed. Lawsuits brought by people in and around universities are at best a partial substitute for universities' failure to bring their own lawsuits against the government.\n\nTo protect both themselves and the entire educational system, then, university leaders should commit, collectively and immediately, to challenge unlawful demands that threaten academic freedom and university self-governance. Nothing in the antitrust laws prohibits this sort of coordination. To further reduce the risk of \" being picked off one by one ,\" schools could also promise to support one another in litigation by submitting amicus briefs, joining suits that raise common issues, and (for sufficiently widespread issues) filing class actions. A version of this approach was recently proposed by the Rutgers University Senate, in the form of a \" Mutual Defense Compact \" for Big Ten schools. Any such shared effort would likely result in a series of court victories, at least in early rounds, given the statutory and constitutional carelessness with which the government has been operating.\n\nFiling lawsuits would do more than produce judicial decisions ordering the government to return specific funds. The litigation would afford schools a high-profile venue in which to detail the Trump administration's lawlessness and aggression. By standing up to such threats, the lawsuits would also send the message that civil society institutions have a duty to defend basic democratic and rule-of-law norms, a message that must be communicated in word and deed to unsettle the culture of capitulation that has begun to take hold, not just in higher education but throughout the legal profession .\n\nPerhaps most importantly, filing lawsuits would lay the legal groundwork for challenging any future funding cuts or other punitive measures taken on pretextual or retaliatory grounds-thereby alleviating the pyrrhic-victory concern-while buying time for universities to make their case in the court of public opinion. This effort will have to involve defending the value of the academy to Congress and the American people. Working together, universities can highlight the importance of scientific research to economic growth and social progress, along with the centrality of humanistic thought to a functioning democracy.\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nSophie Lewis\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nSaree Makdisi\n\nAs crucially, universities must acknowledge the rightful concerns about exclusion, elitism, and the reproduction of privilege that have corroded support for higher education over decades. This parallel effort cannot be a mere PR campaign. By committing to material concessions such as reduced tuition and increased enrollments, academic leaders could begin to address the populist anger that Trump and his allies have thus far been able to exploit.\n\nLitigation is an imperfect and limited tool. It is nonetheless a necessary tool if universities are to survive long enough-as morally and intellectually self-respecting communities as well as financially solvent enterprises-to mount a more robust, coordinated defense. The fight over the future of higher education will not ultimately be settled in court. But the fight will definitely be lost if it doesn't go there at all.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

This expansion has been both physical (expanding detention capacity across the United States, Guantánamo Bay, and even El Salvador) and digital (gaining access to government troves of personal data and leveraging contracts with private firms to support mass roundups).\n\nThose of us long involved in the fight for the dignity and flourishing of undocumented and immigrant communities always knew that this administration's cruelty would not stop with them. Indeed, in the last few weeks, US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has begun arresting and detaining US permanent residents and residents with valid work visas. In the face of public outrage, President Trump has vowed that he's just getting started.\n\nThis time around, the nation's tech companies are proudly furnishing the administration with the tools to fulfill its ambition.\n\nWe are at a crossroads as a nation. One side believes that immigrant communities are at the essence of this country, and that civil rights are too. We have the Constitution behind us, as well as the support of the families and workers that make this country run. The other side, now led by the Trump administration, is desperate to criminalize, surveil, detain, and deport as many immigrants as possible, without regard for civil liberties or the courts that enforce them. Even as President Trump guts and defunds other government functions, his administration has poured more money and resources into deportation infrastructure, including an expansion of tech contracts . His threats against immigrants-and all of us-are not empty ones.\n\nWe're disgusted but not surprised, because these methods are not new. During the first Trump administration, our Latinx community organization Mijente built the #NoTechForICE campaign to respond to the government's escalating partnerships with data and technology companies. #NoTechForICE published reports on how much corporations like Amazon, LexisNexis, and Palantir made selling the software, services, and data that enabled ICE to terrorize our immigrant communities. We exposed the means and methods used to track people down with biometric and geolocating technologies. We showed up to demonstrate at 20 campus job fairs and organized huge, sustained protests at Palantir's former headquarters in Palo Alto.\n\nWe did all this all because we believed that pressuring these firms' economic interests-in Palantir's case, targeting its recruiting pipeline as the company sought to expand-was an available and effective means of throwing sand in the gears of institutional cruelty. We still believe that. And we had some wins. We believe our work is part of what pushed Palantir to move its headquarters out of the Bay Area, and, at least for a time, we made it difficult for Palantir to recruit college graduates, many of whom didn't want to work for a company building the infrastructure for mass deportations, suffering, and harm.\n\nNow, the alliances between these companies, their investors, and the federal government have expanded further. Shame is apparently considered obsolete in Silicon Valley. At January's inauguration, and in the news ever since, the executives running tech companies like Google, Tesla, and Amazon have stood with Trump-and in the case of Elon Musk, even stood in for him. These men have attained the full stature of oligarchs. Their companies are ready to catch windfalls from the horrific and sometimes illegal actions of Trump's new administration. We are seeing tech oligarchs move beyond the deportation of immigrants to offer their services in ushering in a politics of cruelty and venality that reaches into everyone's life.\n\nGoogle recently removed a promise in its AI Principles not to design or deploy \"technologies that cause or are likely to cause overall harm.\" A former Amazon executive known for trampling labor rights is now Trump's pick to oversee worker safety across the country. Whole Foods , owned by Amazon, is celebrating and accelerating the administration's dismantling of the National Labor Relations Board. Palantir gets half its revenue from government contracts and has recently won new contracts with federal agencies. SpaceX and Starlink are indispensable to US surveillance at home and abroad. Data Brokers give ICE a way around sanctuary protections and the Fourth Amendment, selling sensitive personal information without a warrant. LexisNexis continues to work with ICE to create national target lists for its raids against immigrants.\n\nDenouncing the Trump Administration's fascism is not enough. The corporations and oligarchs standing behind it need to be put on notice. We are thrilled to see protests that call for corporate accountability, including at Tesla factories , showrooms , and dealerships, by federal workers and ordinary people. And we're buoyed by the TeslaTakedown movement's efforts to urge Tesla owners to sell their cars and dump their stock.\n\nWe know that whatever is perpetrated against the most vulnerable will eventually come for those who seem less so. All of our privacy and freedom is on the line until we stop them.\n\nAt Mijente, we will continue to shine a light on how deadly and invasive technologies are being deployed against undocumented people and migrants. In the past, we've resisted the machinery of deportation, exposed surveillance contracts, and united people to address the harms of Big Tech's unchecked power. We won't stop now. We're organizing locally and nationally to end data broker contracts with ICE, close information sharing loopholes between ICE and local governments, and track how ICE is deploying AI to power its deportation machine. We are calling on local governments to commit to robust sanctuary protections without loopholes and to take it a step further, strengthening protections for immigrants and all residents in the face of a hostile oligarchy.\n\nThese fights weren't easy during the last Trump administration-or during the Biden administration, for that matter. The road ahead certainly won't be either. But we refuse to let the tech industry take over our country and divide our people. At Mijente and in our communities, we've never backed down, and we're not starting now.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home.

The complete closure of the department would require an act of Congress as it was established by statute in 1979-a fact McMahon has previously acknowledged.\n\nThe order will also detail stipulations that \"programs or activities receiving any remaining Department of Education funds will not advance DEI or gender ideology,\" according to the Internal document, which was labeled \"pre-decisional.\" As part of its rationale for the move, the administration cited plummeting standardized test scores as evidence that \"federal government control of education has failed students, parents, and teachers.\"\n\nThe Trump administration began weakening the department last week. On March 11, about 1,300 employees were laid off, approximately half of the department's workforce, The Nation previously reported . These employees were irate about Trump's decision and said that his justification for the order-returning education to state control-is redundant.\n\n\"Education has already been controlled at the state and local levels,\" one former employee told The Nation . They were granted anonymity for fear of jeopardizing their severance. \"It's hard to understand what the actual goal is here.\" Currently, the department has no say over the curricula that are used in schools. Instead, states are typically the ones that take the lead on developing and implementing curricula.\n\nAnother employee said the department \"only sets policy for the use of a tiny percentage of federal funds and keeps track of student performance on standardized tests,\" another employee said. \"Nothing about the shutting down of the department has to do with saving money or being efficient.\"\n\nEducation groups are livid over the decision. The American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten had just four words for Trump: \"See you in court.\"\n\nBecky Pringle, the president of the National Education Association, the largest educators union in the United States, blasted the decision Wednesday night, saying it \"will hurt all students by sending class sizes soaring, cutting job training programs, making higher education more expensive and out of reach for middle-class families, taking away special-education services for students with disabilities, and gutting student civil rights protections.\"\n\nThe administration has previously floated reassigning various functions of the department to other federal agencies. Project 2025, a Republican playbook compiled by the conservative think tank The Heritage Foundation, suggested closing the department and moving some of its financial aid operations to the Treasury Department and the Office for Civil Rights to the Department of Justice\n\nIn seeing the reports of the upcoming signing, two employees described their reaction as \"heartbroken.\"\n\n\"Closing the department harms students and families,\" one said.\n\nOn the campaign trail , Trump repeatedly bashed the state of American education, saying that it had been taken over by \"the radical left maniacs.\" He has advocated for \"pro-America education\" and the creation of a credentialing body that would \"certify teachers who embrace patriotic values.\"\n\nMcMahon gave a preview of departmental reshuffling in an all-staff e-mail hours after she was sworn in as the department's secretary in early March: \"We will partner with Congress and other federal agencies to determine the best path forward to fulfill the expectations of the President and the American people.\"\n\nWithout a filibuster-proof majority in the Senate and with a fractious coalition in the House, the prospect of passing a GOP-led bill to wholly shutter the department remains unlikely. But many hard-line Trump allies in the Republican Party have expressed support for the action.\n\nJeet Heer\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nRev. Dr. Liz Theoharis and Noam Sandweiss-Back\n\nSaree Makdisi\n\nIt is unclear whether Speaker Mike Johnson or Senate majority leader John Thune, who have the last say on which bills are brought to the floor of their respective chambers, support such congressional action. But they have been Trump's allies in the Capitol, uniting their caucuses to deliver policy wins for the new administration. Neither of their offices responded to a request for comment.\n\nBut as the administration has eyed a phaseout of the department, it has ramped up its oversight functions. Investigations have been opened into higher education institutions over allegations of antisemitism, funding cuts have been threatened for schools with race-conscious programs, and DEI is now anathema.\n\nOn March 7, the Education Department, alongside other federal agencies, canceled $400 million in federal grants to Columbia University over what it calls \"continued inaction in the face of persistent harassment of Jewish students.\" Columbia is now in negotiations with the federal government, which is attempting to extract concessions from the university, including instituting a mask ban on campus, adding additional protest restrictions, and placing the department of Middle East, South Asian, and African Studies under \"academic receivership,\" meaning it would no longer be controlled by faculty.\n\n\"Legitimate questions about our practices and progress can be asked, and we will answer them,\" Columbia interim president Katrina Armstrong said in a Wednesday statement. \"But we will never compromise our values of pedagogical independence, our commitment to academic freedom, or our obligation to follow the law.\"\n\nUniversities have also paused hiring new staff, reduced the number of PhD admits, and issued travel warnings for international students in recent weeks, citing an ever-changing federal landscape.

President Trump said he would not back off his trade war, reinforcing fears of a global economic downturn.\n\nData delayed at least 15 minutes\n\nSource: FactSet\n\nBy The New York Times\n\nMatthew Mpoke Bigg Eshe Nelson Yan Zhuang and Joe Rennison\n\nWall Street ended another turbulent day of trading with a small decline on Monday, as false reports about a potential tariff reprieve sent stocks gyrating before President Trump's threat of additional tariffs on China restored the potential for a severe economic downturn.\n\nMr. Trump on Monday issued a new ultimatum to China to rescind its retaliatory tariffs on the United States, or face additional tariffs of 50 percent beginning Wednesday . The threat came as governments around the world raced to schedule phone calls, send delegations to Washington and submit proposals to lower their import taxes to escape the tariffs. Mr. Trump and his advisers have offered conflicting signals on whether the United States is willing to negotiate.\n\nMr. Trump's trade war made investors increasingly pessimistic about the economy but he defended his global tariffs, saying those in place had already brought the United States billions of dollars in revenue.\n\nThe S&P 500, the benchmark U.S. index, swung between steep losses - as much as 4.7 percent - and gains, before ending the day down 0.2 percent.\n\nEarlier, shares in Asian and European markets extended their sell-off . The S&P 500, which is 17.6 percent below its February peak, was close to tumbling into a bear market, defined as a drop at the end of a trading day of 20 percent or more from a recent high.\n\nThe recent rout in global markets reflected deepening concern that Mr. Trump's significant new taxes on U.S. imports could disrupt global supply chains, cause inflation to accelerate and set off a severe economic downturn.\n\n\"This one is likely to last a while given the intransigence of the Trump administration on the issue of tariffs,\" said Ed Yardeni, the veteran Wall Street analyst. \"The stock market clearly believes this is a disastrous policy.\"\n\nMr. Trump showed no sign of pulling back from his tariffs, saying in a social media post on Monday morning that the Federal Reserve should cut interest rates, a move that the Fed chairman has warned could fuel inflation. Earlier, Mr. Trump had dismissed concerns that his steep new taxes on imports would lead to higher prices, calling them \"a very beautiful thing.\"\n\nHere's what else to know:\n\nReduction efforts: Several Asian countries sought a reprieve from the tariffs. Bangladesh and Vietnam asked Mr. Trump to delay imposing the tariffs, while the Philippines said it would reduce tariffs on goods coming from the United States. South Korea and Japan said they wanted to meet with the Trump administration.\n\nAsia and Europe: The main stock index in Hong Kong, where many mainland Chinese companies trade, plunged 13 percent. In Taiwan, a hub for global technology, stocks lost 10 percent of their value. European markets closed sharply lower. The benchmark Pan-European index, the Stoxx Europe 600, was down 4.5 percent, and the FTSE 100 in London was down 4.4 percent.\n\nCommodities prices: Benchmark Brent crude oil prices, which briefly dipped below $60 a barrel on Sunday, were down more than 2 percent on Monday. Copper prices are also dropping.\n\nCryptocurrency: Since Mr. Trump announced his global tariffs last week, the price of Bitcoin has plunged 10 percent , dropping below $78,000 on Sunday night. The decline shows that Bitcoin, often pitched as a stable long-term source of value, is still subject to market gyrations.\n\nYour money: The market turmoil has caused worry for many people, not least those nearing retirement who may need to access funds in the near future. But timing the market on this or any other basis is hazardous, experts say.\n\nJenny Gross\n\nThe timing was a bit awkward.\n\nWalmart's investor event - which happens every two years and aims to showcase the company's strengths and strategy for growth - also happened to fall on the same day that U.S.-imposed tariffs went into effect worldwide and a trade war heated up.\n\nAs the largest retailer in the United States, Walmart relies on suppliers from around the world. And for the Wall Street analysts who attended the event in Dallas on Wednesday, tariffs were top of mind.\n\nDoug McMillon, Walmart's chief executive, acknowledged the uncertainty. In response to one of several questions from analysts about tariffs, he said: \"There's so many variables playing out in terms of what costs are going to be, where people source from. We're going have to manage this as we always do, daily.\"\n\nOr by the minute.\n\nAs the event got underway on Wednesday, the United States had imposed worldwide tariffs, including a levy of 104 percent on Chinese goods, and China quickly retaliated with 84 percent tariffs on U.S. goods. Mr. McMillon, speaking just after Beijing's additional tariffs went into effect, said the situation was \"very fluid.\" In fact, not long after Mr. McMillon's question-and-answer session with analysts, President Trump said he was pausing his worldwide reciprocal tariffs for 90 days and raising the rate on China to 125 percent.\n\nDuring the session, Mr. McMillon emphasized that Walmart was well placed to cope with uncertainty, having navigated \"the period after 9/11, the global financial crisis, a pandemic and more recently high inflation.\" Walmart's customer base includes a large number of lower-income shoppers, who have less capacity to absorb the higher prices that the tariffs could bring.\n\nJohn David Rainey, Walmart's chief financial officer, emphasized that two-thirds of what Walmart sells in the United States is made, grown or assembled domestically; the figure includes groceries, which generally have lower margins. The other third of what Walmart sells comes from all over the world, especially from China and Mexico, he said.\n\nMr. Rainey said the tariffs had made it harder for Walmart to predict its first-quarter operating income growth. \"We're one week into this new tariff environment, and we're still working through what this means for us,\" he said. \"For the current quarter, the uncertainty and decline in consumer sentiment has led to a little more sales volatility week to week and, frankly, day to day.\"\n\nWalmart reiterated expectations for first-quarter sales growth of about 3 to 4 percent and said its annual sales growth guidance remained unchanged, with customers still expected to migrate toward e-commerce and delivery, key parts of Walmart's strategy. Walmart will report its first-quarter results on May 15.\n\n+10\n\n%\n\n+5\n\nChina\n\nGermany\n\n-5\n\nU.K.\n\nCanada\n\n-10\n\nUnited\n\nStates\n\nJapan\n\n-15\n\n-20\n\nJan.\n\nFeb.\n\nMarch\n\nApril\n\n+10%\n\n+5\n\n0\n\nChina\n\nGermany\n\n-5\n\nU.K.\n\nCanada\n\n-10\n\nJapan\n\nUnited\n\nStates\n\n-15\n\n-20\n\nJan.\n\nFeb.\n\nMarch\n\nApril\n\nNotes: Data as of 3:30 a.m. Eastern time on Friday.

Bessent said he had suggested that foreign officials \"keep your cool, do not escalate and come to us with your offers.\" He added: \"And at a point, President Trump will be ready to negotiate.\" These comments contradict an interview this morning by Peter Navarro, a White House trade adviser, who said there would be no negotiations.\n\nDanielle Kaye\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent today, capping off a tumultuous day of trading that at one point pulled the benchmark into bear market territory, or a drop of 20 percent or more from its recent high. The index is almost 18 percent below its mid-February peak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index, which also saw dramatic swings throughout the day, ended slightly higher.\n\nDanielle Kaye\n\nMajor U.S. stock indexes came into this week on the heels of a two-day rout that caused the S&P 500 to register its worst week since March 2020, the beginning of the coronavirus pandemic. Concern that Trump's sweeping tariffs - and responses from other countries - will sink global growth and fuel inflation is still driving sentiment on Wall Street.\n\nDavid E. Sanger\n\n\"Tariffs will make this country very rich,\" Trump insisted. Millions of Americans may not be feeling that way right now.\n\nAna Swanson\n\nTrump says \"virtually every country wants to negotiate\" and that \"if I didn't do what I did over the last couple of weeks\" no countries would want to negotiate. That includes Israel offering to cut their tariffs on American products today, he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAna Swanson\n\nTrump says the reason he hasn't imposed tariffs again Russia is because \"we're not doing business essentially with Russia.\" The United States did not put tariffs on Russia, North Korea, Cuba or Belarus because the U.S. already has substantial sanctions on those countries. Still, the $3 billion of imports the United States brought in from Russia last year is much larger than some of the tiny countries Trump targeted.\n\nChris Cameron\n\nAs Trump vowed to maintain his sweeping tariff policies, he gave a rosy, exaggerated picture of the current economy, saying that price inflation on \"everything is down at levels that nobody ever thought possible.\" Inflation eased more than expected in February , but prices were still up 2.8 percent from a year earlier. Even before the tariffs were announced, economists were bracing for higher prices and slower growth.\n\nTony Romm\n\nThe European Union has floated that it could reduce tariffs on American cars and industrial goods to zero if the United States does the same in return. Asked if that is a good enough offer, Trump said, \"No it's not. The E.U. has been very tough over the years.\"\n\ntranscript\n\nReporter: \"The E.U. has said that they have offered zero for zero tariffs on cars and industrial goods. Is that not enough?\" \"Well the E.U. - no it's not. The E.U. has been very tough over the years. It was, I always say it was formed to really do damage to the United States in trade. The European Union has been very - very bad to us. They don't take our cars, like Japan in that sense. They don't take our agricultural product. They don't take anything practically.\"\n\nAna Swanson\n\nAsked if his tariffs would drive other countries into the arms of China, Trump says, \"I'm not worried.\"\n\nHe adds, \"They don't want to be in the hands of the Chinese.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAna Swanson\n\nTrump says he will pursue deals with many countries. \"We're going to get fair deals and good deals with everybody. And if we don't, we're going to have nothing to do with them. They're not going to be allowed to participate in the United States,\" he said.\n\nTony Romm\n\n\"We're not looking at that,\" Trump says when asked about a potential pause on tariffs.\n\nMaggie Haberman\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Trump are now speaking after a meeting in the Oval Office. Netanyahu begins by thanking the U.S., and says Israel will \"eliminate\" the trade deficit with the U.S. \"Free trade has to be fair trade,\" Netanyahu says, adding that Israel will get rid of its tariffs \"quickly.\"\n\n\"That's very nice, thank you,\" Trump replies.\n\nKen Belson\n\nOne of the country's most influential business lobbies is warning that the sweeping tariffs unveiled by the White House last week will cause \"major harm\" to manufacturers and workers.\n\nLast week, Joshua Bolten, the chief executive of the Business Roundtable, said that while his group supported the president's goal of achieving fairer trade deals, the damage to the economy from the measures that President Trump proposed \"will increase the longer the tariffs are in place and may be exacerbated by retaliatory measures.\"\n\nMr. Bolten's statement was the fourth time this year the group commented on the threat of new tariffs against the country's major trading partners.\n\nOn March 12, the Business Roundtable's survey of 150 chief executives, polled in late February and early March when Mr. Trump threatened tariffs against Canada and Mexico, showed growing pessimism about the United States' economic outlook. The survey, called the Business Roundtable C.E.O. Economic Outlook Index, fell in the first quarter to 7 points , roughly where it was in mid-2024. Expectations for hiring, capital investment and sales all fell.\n\nChuck Robbins, the chair of the group and the chief executive of Cisco, said last month that not all tariffs were harmful, but that businesses wanted certainty about the levies so they could adapt if needed.\n\n\"Markets want clarity,\" he said in an interview with Punchbowl News . \"Companies want clarity, and the fear is that companies begin to do the classic, you know, 'I'm just going to pause investments now until we understand this a little bit better.'\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAna Swanson\n\nStephan Miran, the top White House economist, was asked today in Washington about the White House giving mixed signals about whether it would negotiate on its tariffs or not. \"There are conflicting narratives because everybody has got an opinion,\" Miran said. \"And that's fine.\" He added that President Trump would make the decision, and that the president's history \"on the creation of deals is pretty great.\"\n\nAna Swanson\n\nStephen Miran, the chair of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers, said at an event at the Hudson Institute, a Washington think tank, on Monday that President Trump would be the ultimate decider about whether to accept the concessions that foreign countries are offering to avoid tariffs. He said offers by foreign countries \"would be welcomed by the United States,\" and that the president had been \"very clear that we want increased access to foreign markets that would boost our exports.\"\n\nAna Swanson\n\nPeter Navarro, a senior White House trade adviser, on Monday defended the sweeping tariffs President Trump has imposed on foreign nations and indicated that other countries' offers to drop their own tariffs on American products would be insufficient to convince the president to retreat.\n\nMr. Navarro, who has been the architect of many of President Trump's trade plans, said on CNBC that the United States was facing a national emergency based on chronic trade deficits, and the only fix would be foreign countries removing trade barriers that had hindered the flow of American goods.\n\nThe European Union offered Monday to drop its tariffs on American cars and industrial goods to zero if the United States did the same. But Mr. Navarro criticized the bloc for its value-added taxes and restrictions on American meat exports, as well as systematically higher tariffs.\n\n\"You steal from the American people every which way is possible,\" Mr. Navarro said. \"So, don't just say we're going to lower our tariffs.\"\n\nMr. Navarro also targeted Vietnam, which has appealed to the president in recent days to have its tariffs reduced. He accused Vietnam of dumping products into U.S. markets, engaging in intellectual property theft and killing industries like shrimp, kitchen cabinets and others.\n\n\"When they come to us and say, we'll go to zero tariffs, that means nothing to us, because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters,\" Mr. Navarro said.\n\nBut Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who, with Jamieson Greer, the United States trade representative, was put in charge of negotiations with Japan, signaled in an interview later in the day that Mr. Trump is ready to negotiate.\n\n\"President Trump, as you know, is better than anyone at giving himself maximum leverage,\" he said.\n\nMr. Bessent said he had suggested that foreign officials \"keep your cool, do not escalate and come to us with your offers.\" He added: \"And at a point, President Trump will be ready to negotiate.\"\n\nIn the CNBC interview in the morning, Mr. Navarro said that tax cuts were forthcoming, as well as other benefits for Americans, like deregulation, lower energy prices, lower interest rates and the restructuring of manufacturing.\n\n\"We're going to get to a place where America makes stuff again, real wages are going to be up, profits are going to be up,\" he said, adding, \"the market's going to find a bottom.\" Stock markets closed slightly lower Monday, following two days of punishing losses last week.\n\nHe was also asked about Elon Musk's very public criticism of tariffs and of Mr. Navarro specifically over the weekend. Responding to a social-media post praising Mr. Navarro, Mr. Musk on Saturday mocked Mr. Navarro's Ivy League degree as useless, and then said Mr. Navarro had not \"built\" anything.\n\nOn Monday, Mr. Navarro said that Mr. Musk was \"not a car manufacturer\" but \"a car assembler,\" mentioning that Tesla's plant in Texas imported batteries, electronics, tires and other parts. \"He wants the cheap foreign parts, and we understand that,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaggie Haberman\n\nThe White House has canceled a press conference in the East Room between President Trump and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel this afternoon and instead will have the two take questions in the Oval Office, a White House official said. Trump's sweeping tariffs did not spare Israel. Netanyahu's office said before his visit that the two men planned to discuss the tariff issue.\n\nPeter Eavis\n\nFears that trade tensions will cause a global recession are weighing on a closely watched economic barometer: the price of copper.\n\nThe price of the metal - used in many products and industries - shows how President Trump's tariffs and tariff threats have driven the cost of certain commodities higher before causing them to collapse.\n\nCopper prices surged this year, and reached a high after Mr. Trump said his administration was investigating whether tariffs might be necessary to reduce the United States' reliance on copper imports. Copper buyers rushed to purchase the metal before any tariffs took effect.\n\nThen last week, Mr. Trump imposed \"reciprocal\" tariffs on most countries, terrifying many investors and business executives because of the tariffs' potential to sharply slow the economy and perhaps even cause a recession. As a result, copper prices plunged, and are now down nearly 20 percent from last month's high.\n\n\"With growth in the U.S. likely to slow on the back of tariffs, and China already struggling to revive its economy, demand for copper and other industrial metals is likely to weaken,\" said Ewa Manthey, a commodities strategist at ING.\n\nCopper is used widely, including in cars, appliances, electronics and many industries that produce and consume electricity. Last year, the United States imported about half the copper it used, excluding scrap, according to ING.\n\nPrices of other metals are also under pressure.\n\nMr. Trump's 25 percent tariff on steel and aluminum imports went into effect last month. But the prices of these metals have weakened in recent days as fears of a recession have intensified. The prices of \"hot rolled coil\" steel have fallen more than 10 percent since last month, and aluminum is down nearly 15 percent.\n\n\"If trade tensions intensify and we see more retaliatory measures, this will add to the bearish sentiment for industrial metals,\" Ms. Manthey said.\n\nSeparately, the Trump administration said on Monday that it would conduct a new national security review of the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Nippon Steel, a Japanese steel producer. The Biden administration had performed its own review and blocked the deal in January.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, U.S. Steel said, \"We look forward to continuing to work closely with President Trump and his administration to finalize this significant and important investment, which will preserve existing jobs, create new jobs, enhance national security and secure a bright future for American manufacturing.\"\n\nTony Romm and Ana Swanson\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nPresident Trump said on Monday that he does not plan to pause a slate of expansive tariffs set to take effect later this week, as he threatened to subject Chinese imports to a staggering 104 percent tax in a bid to ward off retaliation by Beijing and other powers.\n\nMr. Trump issued his warning on a day when the White House once again found itself on the defensive for its spiraling global trade war. But the president insisted he remained unbowed by the widening range of governments pleading for relief and the markets convulsing anew over the chaos and confusion.\n\n\"We're not looking at that,\" Mr. Trump said, when asked about a possible pause on his tariffs. \"We're going to have one shot at this and no other president is going to do what I'm doing.\"\n\nMr. Trump began the day by drawing new battle lines over his so-called reciprocal tariffs, which he plans to impose on certain countries after midnight on Wednesday. The taxes, which can reach as high as 46 percent for some nations, will snap into effect just days after the president imposed a minimum 10 percent levy on nearly every U.S. trading partner.\n\nMr. Trump specifically targeted China, which announced last week it would match the United States by imposing a retaliatory 34 percent tax on imports from America. In a post on Truth Social, the president demanded that Beijing rescind its retribution or face an additional 50 percent U.S. tariff beginning April 9. He also threatened to halt any further negotiations.\n\nThe escalation could bring the U.S. tariff on Chinese goods to 104 percent, though for some products, the rate is likely to be much higher because of levies that date back to Mr. Trump's first term. Taken together, it could prove costly for importers bringing in clothing, cellphones, chemicals and machinery from China. American consumers last year bought $440 billion of goods from China, making it the second-largest source of U.S. imports after Mexico.\n\nMr. Trump coupled his ultimatum to China with a pledge to issue punishing, additional tariffs on other U.S. trading partners if they similarly try to rebuff his policies. But his attacks did not appear to dissuade some opponents, including the European Union, where officials prepared to circulate a list of U.S. products that they could soon subject to retaliation.\n\nWith global tensions rising, Mr. Trump's strategy triggered another day of unease on Wall Street. The S&P 500 fell 0.2 percent, now almost 18 percent below its mid-February peak. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index, which also saw dramatic swings throughout the day, ended slightly higher.\n\nIn a sign of investor frustration over the tariffs, an erroneous news report earlier in the day, suggesting that the president might pause his trade war, sparked an immediate rally - only to see stocks just as quickly plummet again, after the White House made clear no such pause was in the offing.\n\nStill, administration officials appeared to leave open the door for negotiations that could ultimately defuse the trade war, citing the fact that more than 50 countries - including, most recently, Israel, Japan and Vietnam - had approached the U.S. government in recent days to strike deals. After visiting with the president at the White House, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu pledged Monday that his country would \"eliminate the trade deficit with the United States,\" while reducing other trade barriers \"fairly quickly.\"\n\nBut White House officials have sought to set a high bar for what the president is willing to accept, marking a shift in tone after Mr. Trump and his aides initially signaled they would not haggle over tariffs at all.\n\n\"If they come to us with really great deals that advantage American manufacturing and American farmers, I'm sure he'll listen,\" Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said in an interview on Fox News.\n\nMr. Hassett said some nations had proposed \"some deals that are great,\" but added of the president: \"After decades and decades of mistreating American workers, it's going to be tough to get him to decide to really come to the table and sign on the dotted line.\"\n\nPeter Navarro, a senior White House trade adviser, specifically said that other nations needed to do more than lower their own tariffs to secure relief from the United States. Appearing on CNBC, he cited a need to reduce \"cheating\" and other barriers that restrict American goods in foreign markets.\n\nAnd Stephen Miran, the head of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said offers by foreign countries \"would be welcomed by the United States.\" He added at an event in Washington that the president had been \"very clear that we want increased access to foreign markets that would boost our exports.\"\n\nWith seemingly no end to the trade war in sight, economists once again were left to grapple with the prospect that high tariffs could raise prices on consumers, slow U.S. growth and tip the country into a recession. Tariffs are taxes on imports, which businesses may struggle to afford, potentially resulting in those firms passing on the new costs to customers.\n\nJay Foreman, the chief executive of toy company Basic Fun, called the president's new threat against China \"unhinged.\"\n\nMr. Foreman said he had just initiated a complete hold on all shipments of his products from Asia. \"I cannot risk putting any product on the water that might incur, at this point, a 54 percent to 104 percent tariff,\" he said. \"It's one thing to try to absorb or pass along 10 percent to 20 percent, but 54 percent to 104 percent, it's impossible. The consumer will just shut down.\"\n\nJeanna Smialek and Danielle Kaye contributed reporting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaureen Farrell\n\nLaurence D. Fink, chief executive of the giant asset manager BlackRock, said today that most chief executives he had been speaking with \"would say we're probably in a recession right now.\" Speaking at a lunch at the Economic Club of New York, he told the audience: \"The economy is weakening as we speak.\" Most Americans don't understand the extent of how the tariffs will affect them. Barbie dolls, he said, will become more expensive because many toys are made in China.\n\nEshe Nelson\n\nEuropean markets closed sharply lower. The FTSE 100 in London was down 4.4 percent. The Stoxx Europe 600 closed with a 4.5 percent decline, with every sector in the red.\n\nEmiliano Rodríguez Mega\n\nMexico has not yet ruled out imposing 25 percent levies on American steel and aluminum products, but wants \"to avoid reciprocal tariffs as much as possible,\" President Claudia Sheinbaum said during her daily news conference. The government wants to protect the Mexican industry, she added, but placing its own tariffs on American goods, as Canada has done , would elevate prices in Mexico. \"We prefer to continue the dialogue before any other measure,\" Sheinbaum said, adding that the Mexican economy minister, Marcelo Ebrard, would travel to Washington this week again to resume negotiations.\n\nAna Swanson\n\nA White House official says the tariffs that President Trump this morning threatened to impose on China - which would counter Beijing's retaliation against Trump's tariffs - are \"additive,\" which means that he would be imposing a 104 percent tariff on Chinese goods as of April 9. This is a huge surcharge on foreign products. Importers bringing in clothing, cell phones, chemicals and machinery from China will see the cost of their imports double. American consumers last year bought $440 billion of goods from China, the second-largest source of U.S. imports after Mexico.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiz Alderman\n\nPresident Trump's tariffs have raised the risk of a recession this year in Europe and are likely to deal a severe blow to the volume of global trade, Moody's ratings agency said in a new analysis today. Ireland, Slovakia, Germany, Hungary, Italy and Austria are the most vulnerable countries in Europe because value-added exports to America represent over 1 percent of their economic output. If the trans-Atlantic relationship were to deteriorate into an all-out trade war, the ratings agency added, then European consumers and supply chains will face further pain.\n\nBenjamin Mullin and Tony Romm\n\nThe news seemed big: That the Trump administration was considering a 90-day pause to his expansive tariffs.\n\nThe problem was, it wasn't true.\n\nBut in a sign of the precarious nature of the markets right now, an unsubstantiated online report spiked shares sharply, albeit briefly, and continued to climb after CNBC and Reuters relayed the claim. The White House quickly responded saying that the report was \"FAKE NEWS,\" and CNBC and Reuters issued statements correcting the record.\n\nStocks fell back down after those corrections. Still, the fallout continued to reverberate on Monday, and became a cautionary tale of the risk of using information drawn from the fast-moving echo chamber of social media without first confirming the news independently.\n\nAsked earlier in the day about the possibility of a pause on imposing the expansive tariffs announced by President Trump last week, Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, said on Fox News: \"I think the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide.\"\n\nWalter Bloomberg, an influential X account that is unaffiliated with Bloomberg News, amplified a post on social media claiming Mr. Hassett had said Mr. Trump was considering a 90-day pause in tariffs.\n\nMinutes after the Walter Bloomberg account's post, Carl Quintanilla, a CNBC anchor, read a headline on air echoing the reports about Hassett. \"I think we can go with this headline,\" Mr. Quintanilla said, without attributing the news. A person with knowledge of the editorial process at the network said Mr. Quintanilla had read a CNBC headline that was circulated prematurely by mistake.\n\nAfter that, Reuters flashed a headline, citing CNBC.\n\nThe Walter Bloomberg account later deleted the post. In a direct message on X, the account said to The New York Times that the post had originated minutes earlier from another X account. \"Given the market movement - plus 4.5 percent - I deemed the headline reliable and posted it at 10:13,\" the Walter Bloomberg account said in the direct message. \"A few minutes later, Reuters picked up the story, citing CNBC.\"\n\nCNBC issued a correction soon after mentioning the potential pause, saying its \"aired unconfirmed information in a banner,\" adding that its reporters \"quickly made a correction on air.\" Reuters also issued a correction, saying its report relied on a headline from CNBC. \"Reuters has withdrawn the incorrect report and regrets its error,\" it said in a statement.\n\nTony Romm\n\nPresident Trump on Monday issued China a new ultimatum: Rescind its retaliatory tariffs on the United States, or be subject to additional tariffs of 50 percent beginning Wednesday. The president said on Truth Social that he would also cease negotiations with China if it does not withdraw its plan to put a 34 percent tariff on U.S. goods. In issuing his new threat to China, Trump also took aim at other countries contemplating their next moves in response to expansive U.S. tariffs set to take effect later this week. He pointed to his past threat that \"any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs.\" Still, the president said negotiations with other countries would \"begin taking place immediately.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJoe Rennison\n\nThe S&P 500 is still moving around as investors try to get to the bottom of the unsubstantiated report that the Trump administration was considering a 90-day pause to the tariffs. Currently the index is roughly flat for the day.\n\nTony Romm\n\nU.S. markets swung wildly this morning on an unsubstantiated report that President Trump was considering a 90-day pause to his expansive tariffs. The White House has not announced any change in policy. Asked earlier in the day about the possibility of a pause, Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council, said on Fox News: \"I think the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide.\" The White House later called the report \"FAKE NEWS\" on one of its official accounts on X.\n\nAlex Travelli and Saif Hasnat\n\nAlex Travelli reported from New Delhi, and Saif Hasnat from Dhaka, Bangladesh.\n\nBangladesh has written to the Trump administration asking for a three-month reprieve before any tariffs are imposed on its exports to the United States, the country's interim leader said on Monday.\n\nThe 37 percent tariffs announced by President Trump last week could severely weaken Bangladesh's garment industry by cutting off its biggest single market.\n\nMuhammad Yunus, Bangladesh's interim leader, wrote on Facebook that if granted, Bangladesh would use the three months \"to substantially increase US exports to Bangladesh.\" Mr. Yunus said that he had promised Mr. Trump in the letter that Bangladesh would \"take all necessary actions to fully support your trade agenda.\"\n\nMohiuddin Rubel, the director of a Bangladeshi trade association, said that American \"buyers have already requested that shipments be put on hold until further notice,\" and that some are trying to force their suppliers in Bangladesh to absorb the costs. The industry employs roughly four million people in the world's 10th most populous country.\n\nMore than 80 percent of Bangladesh's exports are ready-made garments. Until this week, the United States was buying almost half.\n\nKevin Hassett, the head of the White House National Economic Council, said on Sunday that the White House had received offers from about 50 countries interested in making deals to ease Mr. Trump's expansive tariffs. But Mr. Hassett sought to set a high bar for the sort of deal that the administration would be willing to accept.\n\n\"After decades and decades of mistreating American workers, it's going to be tough to get him to decide to really come to the table and sign on the dotted line,\" he said of the president.\n\nTony Romm contributed to this report.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJenny Gross\n\nReporting from London\n\nDaily close price\n\nNote: Data as of 3:50 p.m. Eastern time Tuesday\n\nSource: LSEG Data & Analytics\n\nPresident Trump's global tariffs have sent stock markets worldwide into a tailspin, and the S&P 500 on Wednesday was close to tumbling into bear market territory.\n\nMr. Trump has seemed unmoved by the decline, signaling that he has no plans to back off on tariffs, insisting that they would bring in \"billions of dollars\" in revenue and that other countries had been \"abusing\" the United States with their trade policies.\n\nHere is what to know about a bear market.\n\nA bear market is a Wall Street term for a sustained market downturn, when a stock index closes 20 percent from its last peak.\n\nThe 20 percent threshold signals investor pessimism about the future of the economy.\n\nThe S&P 500, the benchmark U.S. stock index, was poised to open lower on Wednesday. The index was already down 18.9 percent from its last high, on Feb. 19, and if it closes on Wednesday with a loss of at least 1.4 percent from Tuesday's close, that would tip it into a bear market.\n\nThe S&P 500 has tumbled more than 12 percent in the days since Mr. Trump announced his new tariffs.\n\nS&P 500\n\nDow\n\nNasdaq\n\nLoading market data...\n\nSource: FactSet\n\nAnalysts at Morgan Stanley have warned that an even steeper drop is possible. Goldman Sachs on Monday slashed its forecast for economic growth, citing a growing risk of a U.S. recession next year.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite Index, as well as the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies that are more vulnerable to the economic outlook, are already in a bear market.\n\nA market decline can offer opportunities for investors with long horizons. Investing in diversified, low-cost index funds has been a successful strategy over the years, through bull markets and bears.\n\nBut given the deepening concern that Mr. Trump's trade agenda could set off a severe economic downturn, volatility and uncertainty are high. People with shorter investment timelines, as well as those nearing retirement , often shift more assets into bonds, which have historically shown greater resilience during downturns.\n\nThe U.S. stock market has always recovered from declines, usually within a couple of years. In early 2020, the outbreak of the coronavirus set off global shutdowns, causing a short, sharp bear market. The Federal Reserve intervened, and markets regained their losses in six months. In late 2021, fears of surging inflation leading to sharply higher interest rates pulled the S&P into a bear market in early 2022, which lasted for much of the year.\n\nThe S&P has entered a bear market 15 times since 1929. Bear markets have lasted 18.9 months on average, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst for S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nBear markets are sometimes precursors to recessions, but not always.\n\nRecessions, defined by the National Bureau of Economic Research as \"a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and lasts more than a few months,\" are much more perilous for the economy. Recessions often lead to job losses as economies contract, such as in the summer of 2020, when unemployment levels rose to their worst levels since the Great Depression .\n\nThe exact origins of the phrase are unclear. But they came into mainstream vernacular in London in the 18th century. One theory traces \"bear\" to the proverb \"selling the bear skin before you've caught the bear,\" according to Merriam Webster .\n\nThe poet Alexander Pope and other writers helped popularize the use of the words bull or bear to describe the stock market when writing about the frenzied rally of the South Sea Company stock and its infamous plummet in a financial scandal referred to as the South Sea bubble.\n\nMr. Trump on Monday repeated his calls for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. But the Fed does not seem in a hurry to intervene .\n\nJerome H. Powell, the Fed chair, said last week that the central bank needed to assess the economic effects of the tariffs before taking action, and he has warned that cutting rates could fan inflation.\n\nA new wave of Trump tariffs that took effect on Wednesday were creating even more turmoil in the markets. When asked by reporters on Sunday about the market declines and fears of a recession, Mr. Trump said, \"Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"\n\nMichael J. de la Merced\n\nPresident Trump's wave of tariffs threatens to bring both short-term economic pain, including lower growth, and long-term damage to America's standing and trade relationships around the world, the chief executive of Wall Street's biggest bank warned on Monday.\n\n\"The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession,\" Jamie Dimon, JPMorgan Chase's chief executive, wrote in his annual letter to shareholders.\n\nThe warning by Mr. Dimon, one of Wall Street's most influential leaders, echoes the growing anxiety among corporate chiefs about how the tariffs will play out. Even those who had initially professed support for Mr. Trump's trade plans are becoming increasingly worried about the consequences.\n\nEven before Mr. Trump's tariff announcement last week, the U.S. economy had been showing signs of strain after years of healthy performance, Mr. Dimon wrote. Inflation was already a worry, he said, pointing to a yawning fiscal deficit and the need for more infrastructure spending. And stock valuations remain well above historical averages, even after the recent market sell-off.\n\nThe potential consequences of the trade fight could make things worse, the letter said. Those include other countries' efforts to fight back - as China has done by imposing 34 percent counterlevies - and a possible erosion of confidence among consumers and investors. Mr. Dimon also warned about the weakening of the American dollar's role as the global reserve currency.\n\n\"If America, for whatever reason, becomes a less attractive investment destination, the U.S. dollar and the economy could suffer if foreigners sold their U.S. assets,\" he wrote.\n\nJPMorgan's own economists have increasingly been saying a recession is more likely this year, though Mr. Dimon did not personally take a position on those odds in his shareholder letter.\n\nWhile he asserted that JPMorgan itself was strong enough to withstand the shocks that the levies posed - its traders have profited from previous whipsaws in the markets - the global economy may not be so fortunate. \"It is not particularly good for the capital markets,\" Mr. Dimon wrote of the tariff-linked volatility.\n\nFor now, Mr. Dimon wrote, he is hoping for a speedy resolution to the trade battles. \"The quicker this issue is resolved, the better, because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,\" he wrote.\n\nThe longer-term worry, Mr. Dimon said, is that Mr. Trump's fight could shred decades-old alliances that cemented the United States' primacy in the global order. The JPMorgan chief wrote that he was worried that America's trading partners might seek out deals with the likes of China, Iran or Russia in response to the tariffs.\n\n\"America First is fine,\" Mr. Dimon wrote, referring to Mr. Trump's description of his policies, \"as long as it doesn't end up being America alone.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement"

The president has slashed federal funding for research into emerging technologies like A.I. and quantum computing. His immigration clampdown has incited fears that he will cut off pipelines for tech talent.\n\nThe Trump administration has also signaled that it will continue an aggressive regulatory stance on reining in the power of the biggest tech companies, beginning next week with a landmark antitrust trial to break up Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nSince the inauguration, the combined market value of Amazon, Apple, Google, Meta and Microsoft has fallen 14.6 percent to $11.3 trillion. And the tech-heavy Nasdaq index is down 15.3 percent.\n\nThe efforts to court Mr. Trump are a far stretch from the industry's approach to his first administration, when many tech leaders were openly hostile toward the president.

Schmidt\n\nI'm an investigative reporter covering Washington.\n\nWhen President Trump returned to office, his rivals feared he would seek revenge by using the Justice Department and the F.B.I. to investigate and even imprison his perceived enemies.\n\nBut the retribution effort is far more expansive, efficient and creative than that - and less reliant on the justice system. Trump has found new ways to use his power against foes. And his actions, or just the prospect of them, have led some of his antagonists to fall in line.\n\nTrump has filed lawsuits, signed executive orders, drafted regulations, fired people from government jobs and withdrawn security details to battle those who he believes stood in his way. In many cases, rather than turning to the courts or federal agencies to carry out his demands, he has asserted unilateral executive power. His defenders say the Constitution should be interpreted to give a president centralized, untrammeled control of government.\n\nTrump appears to hold a maximalist view of his powers even if they are disputed or untested. Can he deport people without due process, impound money allocated by Congress or remove appointees from independent agencies like the National Labor Relations Board? He is not waiting to find out. He has imposed costs on those who fail to heed his demands at universities, news organizations and executive agencies. Most recently, major law firms have buckled rather than endure punitive executive orders or fight in court. \"They're all bending and saying, 'Sir, thank you very much,'\" Trump said recently.\n\nIn today's newsletter I'll look at some of the most prominent cases and explain his prospects for ultimate success.\n\nThe administration has struck at perceived adversaries in many realms.\n\nAttorneys general in blue states, lawyers and advocacy groups have filed many lawsuits to stop Trump's policies. In the face of those challenges, Trump issued an order directing the Justice and Homeland Security Departments to \"seek sanctions against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable and vexatious litigation against the United States.\"\n\nThe law firm Paul Weiss is home to many former Democratic officials. Its managing partner is a major Democratic fund-raiser, and another partner prepared Kamala Harris for her debates. Trump barred it from dealing with the government and suggested that its clients could lose their government contracts. Despite believing that what Trump was doing to the firm was wrong and illegal, Paul Weiss made a deal with the Trump administration to reverse the order.\n\nMany alumni of Trump's first administration later spoke out against him in the 2024 election, including John Bolton, his national security adviser, and Mark Esper, his defense secretary. Both had security protection because, the government believed, Iran might target them for their roles in helping Trump kill a top Iranian general. Trump revoked their security protection. Defense Department officials also withdrew protection for Mark Milley, a former top military officer who worried Trump was staging a \"Reichstag moment\" during the Capitol riot, and removed Milley's portrait from the Pentagon.\n\nThe Trump administration is investigating government lawyers who prosecuted Jan. 6 rioters - and will do the same for prosecutors who refused to dismiss corruption charges against Mayor Eric Adams of New York.\n\nThe White House blocked Associated Press reporters from the Oval Office and Air Force One because the wire service refuses to use \"Gulf of America,\" Trump's preferred term for the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nTrump sued an Iowa pollster who underestimated his support before the election. A Trump appointee has also announced an investigation into the San Francisco radio station KCBS for its coverage of immigration enforcement actions.\n\nFacebook suspended Trump's account after the Jan. 6 riot. During the campaign, Trump threatened to imprison the company's founder. After he took office, Meta, the parent company, agreed to pay $25 million to settle a lawsuit on the matter.\n\nRead a list of Trump's other retributive actions here .\n\nWe are having trouble retrieving the article content.\n\nPlease enable JavaScript in your browser settings.\n\nThank you for your patience while we verify access.

      "text": "The Trump Show Comes to the Kennedy Center\n\nCan the fifty-four-year-old arts hub weather the next four years?\n\nOn the evening of March 23rd, the Kennedy Center honored Conan O'Brien with the 2025 Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. The ceremony, which attracted a mix of comedy stars and arts-adjacent members of D.C.'s beau monde, was the biggest event held by the center since February, when President Trump purged eighteen members of the nonpartisan board of directors and installed himself as chairman. With the exception of a few half-hearted references to \"new management,\" the currency of the night was encomiums, not political critiques. O'Brien, when his turn came to speak, made veiled jabs in the President's general direction. (Mark Twain, he pointed out, hated bullies and defined patriotism as \"supporting your country all of the time and your government when it deserves it.\") But if the evening had a true villain, it wasn't Trump but Jay Leno, who took \"The Tonight Show\" back from O'Brien, in 2010, after pledging to retire.\n\nThe ceremony was held in the center's Concert Hall, a 2,465-seat statement piece in white walls and coppery-red carpets, which was renovated in 1997 and conveyed a warm, slightly dilapidated grandeur. Afterward, guests departed for a party at the Reach, a 2019 addition spearheaded by the Kennedy Center's former president Deborah Rutter. The seventy-two-thousand-square-foot complex of pavilions, galleries, and studios is home to much of the institution's social-impact programming, which is aimed toward supporting marginalized artists and audiences. Last year, the annex announced a two-year residency program with Play Play DC, a collective that curates \"refreshing, creative, fun, healing, and playful experiences for grown and queer adults,\" and Chefs Stopping AAPI Hate.\n\nThese offerings largely pay for themselves with donations specifically set aside for social impact, but Trump and his allies argue that such \"wokey\" events are repelling audiences and draining the center's resources. At a board meeting on March 17th, the President declared his intention to make the center \"hot again\" by staging more popular programming. Regaling trustees with memories of his first time seeing \"Cats,\" he noted that a Broadway hit \"does well\" at the center and that \"we are going to have some really good shows.\" He also spoke of wanting more control over the Kennedy Center Honors, the institution's flagship awards ceremony, which has recognized such figures as Bonnie Raitt, Steven Spielberg, and Paul McCartney. Trump complained that past picks have been \"radical-left lunatics\" and named as possible invitees Babe Ruth, Elvis Presley, and the casino impresario Steve Wynn, a major donor; he also suggested that hosting duties for the event would by necessity fall to him, the \"king of ratings.\" The center's new president, Richard Grenell, who served as Ambassador to Germany and acting director of National Intelligence during Trump's first term, has shared few details about his programming plans but has promised a \"big, huge celebration of the birth of Christ at Christmas.\"\n\nBoth Trump and Grenell were conspicuously absent from the Twain festivities. At the after-party, as donors swanned past white-clothed tables bearing wilting bouquets of truffle-dusted fries, young Kennedy Center staff members, identifiable by their badges, clustered around, looking giddy and on edge. A few days earlier, Tavish Forsyth, an associate artistic lead at the Washington National Opera's Opera Institute, had posted a YouTube video in which he stripped naked and recited a thirty-five-minute spoken-word poem about whether he should quit his job, after which he was promptly fired. The week of the ceremony, between five and ten employees had resigned. More were waiting until after the gala to quit. \"We're working extra to cover all the people we're losing but we still don't know what the outcome will be for our jobs personally or the programs we support at large,\" a staffer told me.\n\nTwo days after the event, at least five members of the Kennedy Center's social-impact team, including its vice-president and artistic director, Marc Bamuthi Joseph, were let go. Joseph, who had directed the division since 2019, told me he understands the official motivation to be financial. (A document obtained by NPR reportedly stated that the decision was based on the center's \"staffing needs.\") Speaking to the Washington Reporter , Grenell outlined his plan to cut back on \"niche\" offerings, saying, \"We had spent way too much on programming that doesn't bring in any revenue.\" Former staffers stress that the mission of the Kennedy Center, a nonprofit founded in 1971, is not to make money but to represent the best of American culture. A former employee familiar with the center's finances told me: \"It is simply not accurate to say the center's finances are in poor health. In fact, under Rutter's leadership the center's endowment grew more than fifty per cent.\" Between 2014, when Rutter became president, and 2023, the most recent year for which tax records are publicly available, the center's total assets increased from $470 million to $633 million. For six of those years, it ran a surplus, and the two lean years coincided with COVID 's decimation of the performing arts. \"The balance sheets are proof it was in good financial health,\" the former employee said.\n\nBy most measures, Trump's takeover has darkened the center's financial picture. Ticket sales fell by fifty per cent in early February, and haven't rebounded. Several large donors have paused their infusions, a former staffer told me, until they have a clearer sense of the place's new direction. Since early February, the institution has also refunded more than a hundred thousand dollars in small donations, the checks for a hundred or three hundred dollars that concertgoers regularly write as bond-cementing exercises-a worrying sign given that traditional nonprofit fund-raising often revolves around modest recurring gifts. One staffer expressed concern that DOGE 's ravaging of the federal workforce would shrink the center's audience and donor base by slashing their disposable income.\n\nSince the regime change, there has been a steady drip of resignations and cancellations by prominent performers, including the opera singer Renée Fleming and the comedian Issa Rae. On March 5th, Lin-Manuel Miranda announced that \"Hamilton\" would not be appearing at the center's semiquincentennial celebration for the Declaration of Independence, next year, because \"it's not the Kennedy Center as we knew it . . . we're not going to be a part of it.\" Several other productions, including \"Legally Blonde,\" have been postponed or called off-a potentially devastating development, as Broadway shows function as the organization's cash cows. So many artists have quietly pulled out of the 2025-26 season that the center has had to keep delaying its schedule announcements. The Kennedy Center usually unrolls its musical-theatre offerings in April, but, \"at this point, I have no idea when we'll be able to announce a theatre season,\" one staff member told me.\n\nIn an unintentional nod to its namesake's Catholicism, the Kennedy Center is a sort of trinity: performance venue, cultural center, and \"living memorial\" to Kennedy himself. Like all nonprofit arts institutions, it represents a delicate ecology of artists, audiences, donors, and administrators. In 2023, the center's revenue was about two hundred and eighty-six million dollars. Around forty-five million dollars, or sixteen per cent, of its money comes from the federal government, and is earmarked for maintenance and building operations. The rest comes from ticket sales, donations, and space rentals. When the center is functioning correctly, its crowd-pleasing events bankroll art that is not always supported by the mainstream. The Washington National Opera and the National Symphony Orchestra, for instance, are revenue drags, which the center has to subsidize to the tune of nearly thirty million dollars annually. But, over time, these offerings draw gifts from donors confident that they are underwriting a vision they believe in; they also generate prestige, lure talent, and prop up endangered national art forms.\n\nAs evidence of malfeasance, Donna Arduin, the new chief financial officer, wrote in an e-mail to staff that Rutter and her team had bequeathed the center an operating deficit of more than a hundred million dollars. But several employees called Arduin's claim misleading, as she referenced only earned revenue-box-office profits minus expenses-and not contributions, which, in a typical year, comprise about forty per cent of the center's revenue. (In an e-mail to the Washington Post , the new head of public relations, Roma Daravi, wrote: \"I understand this can be confusing to grasp. An 'operating deficit' is the net margin from operations. Net margin is revenues minus expenses. The extreme mismanagement of funds is certainly shocking and was designed to leave the Center in the red.\") An employee also disputed Grenell's complaint, two days after he took over, that \"there is ZERO cash on hand,\" pointing out that, because theatre tours are seasonal, \"cash on hand\" fluctuates throughout the year and is a flawed benchmark. Certainly, the person said, there are ill-advised shows that lose money. Trump's two-hour appearance at the Kennedy Center on March 17th-during which he peacocked on a balcony and bragged about his musical aptitude-cost the organization more than fifty thousand dollars.\n\nSprucing up the Kennedy Center building has emerged as a priority for Trump, the real-estate grandee; during his visit, he groused that his predecessors had left it in \"tremendous disrepair\" and mused about covering the exposed columns with his signature marble. Grenell, who has accused the previous leadership of \"criminal\" financial mismanagement, submitted that the federal funds designated for physical upkeep had been spent on D.E.I. initiatives, a claim that is contradicted by publicly available records. (Since 2020, one of the members of the Kennedy Center's audit committee-which is responsible for monitoring its outlays-has been the Trump appointee Pam Bondi.)\n\nMary Helen Bowers, who joined the Kennedy Center board near the end of Trump's first term, told me that she was excited for a \"return to commonsense programming.\" She'd been dismayed by \"drag shows at a family theatre.\" (One of the more than two thousand events hosted at the center last year was \"Dragtastic Dress Up,\" a gathering with snacks and lip-synching by the artist Tara Hoot, who bills her act as \"Mr. Rogers in a dress.\") \"That's telling a large part of the American population, 'Your family values aren't important to us,' \" Bowers said.\n\nBowers, who trained as a professional ballerina, is married to Paul Dans, one of the architects of Project 2025. When I asked whether she personally felt accepted by the old leadership, she paused. \"Superficially, yes,\" she said. \"But I voiced complaints and concerns . . . that anything that would be more sexually oriented shouldn't be geared toward families, for lots of different reasons, if nothing else it's simply bad business. When I shared those thoughts, I don't know that anything was really done other than 'Hey, Mary Helen, thanks for letting us know.' \"\n\nGoing forward, Bowers said that the board would focus on \"getting the center into better financial health, really honing in on what people want to see and which shows produce higher attendance and revenues.\" She was confident that Trump could right the ship. \"We have one of the best businessmen in the world stepping in and putting a lot of energy into turning the Kennedy Center around,\" she told me, referring to the President, \"and I think the finances will reflect that.\"\n\nAccording to one former administrator, Trump's leadership team has brought in its own fund-raisers, whose strategy seems rooted in political, rather than arts-based, fund-raising. \"There's more of an expectation of access to the chairman\" in exchange for sponsorship, the person said. Grenell, who spent the Biden years developing luxury tourist sites in Serbia and Albania, suggested at a recent meeting that Trump's plans to beautify the center were advancing; a proposal was under way to refurbish the lounges in front of the main theatres. Foreign governments-he expressed interest in seeking donations from the Gulf states and Japan-would fund the renovations. An employee described Nick Meade, Grenell's chief of staff, prowling around campus \"trying to see where else we can put a lounge or a bar or any space to put a donor name on.\"\n\nGrenell's character-Trump has described him as \"a fighter\"-does not at a glance mark him out for arts administration. Nor is he an obvious diplomat; in a room of carrots and sticks, Grenell favors the sledgehammer. On a 2024 podcast, he argued that America needs a \"tough\" Secretary of State who \"goes in to these tables and says, 'Guys, if we don't solve this here, if we don't represent peace and figure out a tough way, I've got to take this file, go back to the United States, and transfer it to the Secretary of Defense, who doesn't negotiate. He's going to bomb you.' \"\n\nIn Grenell, Trump has found a deputy who shares his aggressive posting style. After Miranda pulled the \"Hamilton\" performance, Grenell retaliated on social media: \"This is a publicity stunt that will backfire. The Arts are for everyone-not just for the people who Lin likes and agrees with.\" On March 13th, Vice-President J. D. Vance was booed at the National Symphony Orchestra. \"This was not a young crowd,\" an employee who attended the performance told me, \"so it was pretty remarkable.\" Grenell, the administration's highest-profile openly gay member, sent a staff-wide e-mail stating that \"as President, I take diversity and inclusion very seriously\" and that \"intolerance towards people who are politically different is just as unacceptable as intolerance in other areas.\"\n\nMost shows that have been called off so far have involved artists pulling out, but, in February, the Kennedy Center abandoned several productions involving L.G.B.T.Q. and progressive themes, ostensibly for financial reasons. A two-week run of the play \"Eureka Day,\" which explores vaccine skepticism at a private school, was scrapped, along with a Pride celebration featuring the N.S.O. and the Gay Men's Chorus of Washington, D.C. Thea Kano, the chorus's artistic director, told me that the Kennedy Center has traditionally maintained close ties to the L.G.T.B.Q. community. \"We've done many concerts there; we tend to do our big anniversary concerts there every five years,\" she said. When the chorus was founded, in 1981, she continued, \"a lot of venues in this town wouldn't respond to our phone calls.\" With the cancellation of the Pride performance this summer, Kano said, \"it feels like we've gone back in time.\"\n\nOne of the first programs to be junked was a children's musical called \"Finn,\" about a shark who comes to accept his sparklier, gentler side. A Kennedy Center spokesperson told Deadline that the show, which was co-created by Chris Nee, Michael Kooman, and Christopher Dimond, was discarded for \"purely financial\" reasons. \"Finn\" had been developed in partnership with the Kennedy Center in 2024, and had sold out shows in its initial run. It was scheduled to tour not only in 2026 but also in 2027, \"which is rare for the Kennedy Center and is a testament to how much they believed in the piece,\" Nee said. The idea that \"Finn\" was an encumbrance on the institution's budget, she continued, \"doesn't make a lot of sense.\" Dimond added, \"It's shocking and terrifying, just how politicized this has all become.\"\n\nOn March 6th, as cancellations were rolling in, I attended a comedy show at the Reach that featured an all-female lineup. \"Traumedy by Rola Z: A Comedy Showcase for Catharsis\" began with free coffee, quiche, and falafel, and ended with a Q. & A. with two therapists. Rola Z., a local comedian who organized the show, took the stage with a disclaimer that nothing she was about to say represented the official views of the Kennedy Center. The comic Elizabeth Booker Houston jokingly expressed solidarity with the MAGA movement. She, too, pined for the \"good old days,\" she said, when \"white men used to die.\" Now, \"they keep living and running for office,\" she added, to screams of laughter from the crowd.\n\nHouston told me that she had weighed her decision to perform at the Reach carefully. In the end, she concluded, it would be more meaningful to show up. \"I'm not a billionaire,\" she added. Maysoon Zayid, who was billed as the show's headliner, was the last to perform. She spoke about the terror of constantly wondering whether her friends and family in Palestine had been killed. Over text, Zayid echoed Houston in her Kennedy Center calculus. \"I actually can't afford to cancel this gig,\" she wrote. \"I am a disabled woman living in America.\"\n\nOther artists are performing a different calculus. The novelist Thomas Mallon, a frequent New Yorker contributor, told me that he and his collaborators pulled \"Fellow Travelers,\" an opera based on his book, from the 2025-26 classical lineup ahead of its announcement on March 27th. \" Fellow Travelers (the opera as well as the novel on which it's based) is a love story set against the ruthless purging of gay people from the State Department in the 1950s. It ultimately stands for the expansion of freedom and liberty for all people,\" Mallon wrote in an e-mail. \"I look forward to its eventual presentation in Washington, when decency has been restored to the White House and independence has been regained by the Kennedy Center.\"\n\nOn March 17th, the producers Seth Rudetsky and James Wesley Jackson partnered with \"Finn\" 's creators to present a special performance in protest of the show's cancellation at the Town Hall in New York City. They invited Broadway and screen stars, including Andrew Rannells, Michael Urie, and Nikki M. James, to play the main parts. The G.M.C.W. also appeared, with the New York City Gay Men's Chorus singing alongside them in solidarity. Rudetsky said, of the show, \"I heard that it was about a trans shark. I thought, Sounds fun . And then I saw the script and was, like, Wait, what?\" Nee and Dimond's story was sweet and innocent, its L.G.B.T.Q. allegory quiescent beneath an uncontroversial message of acceptance. \"I thought it was going to be, like, the shark gets down,\" Rudetsky said. \"But this can be translated into anything. Don't hide what's inside of you. Be yourself.\"\n\nRudetsky and Jackson discussed the vital role that the Kennedy Center has historically played in the theatre ecosystem. The venue is an important \"tryout theatre,\" a place where productions can be tested and tweaked before appearing on Broadway or on the West End. \"Annie\" and \"Les Misérables\" both tried out at the Kennedy Center, Rudetsky told me. The center has produced multiple Broadway shows, and it regularly hosts out-of-town auditions. It is-or was-a site of tremendous good will from the thespian community. \"For our actor friends, doing a show at the Kennedy Center is like, oh, my gosh , if you're going to do anything outside of New York, it's, like, Yes , Kennedy Center is it! \" Jackson said. Urie told me that he'd performed at the Kennedy Center twice, for \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying\" and \"Spamalot,\" and that he'd loved it. But \"I can't imagine that I would say yes\" if a gig materialized now, he continued. He was skeptical that they would even ask.\n\nAfter talking to the singers and actors, I took my seat in the packed house to watch \"Finn\" and the gay men's choruses. At the end of the evening, which featured a magnificently game Rannells belting \"Can I still make the Shark Guard if I declare that I have an inner fish?,\" the choruses came out to perform a mash-up of two songs by Stephen Sondheim, \"No One Is Alone\" and \"Not While I'm Around.\" As the arrangement concluded, the singers locked into unison on \"round,\" and a ripple of harmonics spun off the note and tumbled toward the ceiling.\n\nIn search of the psychic wound that got us here, commentators often cite Trump's tense history with the Kennedy Center Honors. In 2017, after several prominent artists threatened to boycott the event if Trump showed up, the President broke with thirty-nine years of tradition by not only skipping the star-studded gala but also refusing to host the recipients at the White House beforehand. For the rest of his first term, Trump struck an outwardly chilly pose toward the Kennedy Center. But, behind the scenes, a former staffer told me, the Administration maintained a \"productive\" and \"positive\" relationship with the cultural hub. Trump filled the Kennedy Center's Presidential Box-a V.I.P. area overlooking the stage of the 2,364-seat Opera House-with guests and loyalists almost every night.\n\nThis time is different. Trump's interventionist tack speaks to his desire to extend his reach deep into the cultural life of the country. Although the President's mockery by the creative and cultural élite has long rankled him, it's the melding of his hurt feelings with his instinct for stagecraft and its uses that has crystallized the Kennedy Center as one of his prime targets. Trumpologists stress that the President once dreamed of being a Broadway producer. In the eight weeks since his Kennedy Center takeover, he has shown that he also wants to be the flattered consumer, the glittering patron, the inescapable star. The Kennedy Center, a system marked by the interplay of many moving pieces, is on a collision course with a man who yearns to absorb everything into himself. If he has his way, he'll be the only show in town. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Has Trump's Legal Strategy Backfired?\n\nRemember when Donald Trump told people that they'd get tired of winning once he was in office? If you are a Trump Administration lawyer, it surely doesn't feel that way. Based on the useful litigation tracker compiled by the group Just Security, the Trump Administration, in its second incarnation, has lost in thirty-six of fifty-six cases decided so far in the federal district courts and not yet subject to appellate rulings. It has lost in ten of fifteen cases that have been decided at the next level of review, the federal circuit courts of appeals. These numbers are especially striking because the cases are at a preliminary stage, when the hurdles are high for those seeking to block an Administration action.\n\nWith six emergency petitions challenging four different Administration policies now before the Supreme Court, the coming days should provide a better sense of how Trump will fare there. The early indications are not good for the Administration: the Court effectively rebuffed a request for emergency intervention involving the U.S. Agency for International Development, albeit by a vote of 5-4. In another case, a challenge to Trump's order restricting birthright citizenship, the Court set a briefing schedule so languid-those opposing the Administration's position were given two full weeks to respond-as to send the unmistakable message that the Justices did not share Trump's view on the urgency of the situation.\n\nThese statistics don't merely indicate that the Administration is on the wrong side of the law. They also reflect bad lawyering. The Administration's hyper-aggressive litigation strategy combines maximalist assertions of the scope of Presidential power with the insistence that any potential intrusion on executive authority necessitates emergency relief. It is belligerent in tone , treating federal judges like junior associates at law firms, when not asserting that they are biased partisans. It dispatches attorneys like so much legal cannon fodder, to defend the Administration's actions with little or incorrect information about the underlying facts. It is grudging, if that, on compliance with court orders, all but inviting judges to find the Administration in contempt of court. Add to this Trump's out-of-court behavior, which has included assailing a respected district-court judge as a \"radical left lunatic,\" calling for his impeachment, and going after Big Law with blatantly unconstitutional executive orders. An Administration that is going to want the vote of Chief Justice John Roberts might do well to recall that Roberts spent years in private law practice.\n\nOne lawyer leading the anti-Trump advocacy surmised that the Justice Department is \"trying to play to Trump, and Stephen Miller,\" the deputy White House chief of staff. \"It's a very bad strategy,\" the attorney added. \"We're by the day gaining more credibility with the Supreme Court by just not being crazy about court orders and judges.\" Jack Goldsmith, a professor at Harvard Law School and a senior official in the Justice Department under George W. Bush, has reached the same conclusion. The Trump Administration's \"open disrespect toward and aggressive political attacks on lower court judges will surely have a negative impact on the way that some and maybe most Supreme Court Justices approach the legal issues coming to the Court,\" Goldsmith wrote last month on his Substack, Executive Functions . The Justice Department did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nOne possible explanation for this self-defeating behavior is that the Trump Administration doesn't actually care about winning-at least, not about winning in court. It cares about inflicting damage, as swiftly and brutally as possible-putting agencies \"into the wood chipper,\" for example, as Elon Musk boasted about U.S.A.I.D. Perhaps the Administration will eventually lose in court, but the harm already done will be irreparable. Meanwhile, this argument goes, the Administration reaps political benefit by picking fights on base-friendly issues such as immigration and transgender rights, and by waging rhetorical war against judges. Calls for impeachment now, impeachment forever will result in zero actual impeachments, but they serve as invigorating rallying cries.\n\nMaybe this is the Administration's approach; in that case, it's important to acknowledge that there can be a divergence between the tactics that sober-minded lawyers would prefer and the demands of their hot-headed clients. When your hot-headed client is the President of the United States, you can do only so much. That reality was evident in February, early in the litigation wars, when the acting Solicitor General, Sarah Harris, felt compelled to drop a soothing footnote in an emergency request that the Supreme Court block a lower-court order reinstating Hampton Dellinger as the head of the Office of Special Counsel. \"The Executive Branch takes seriously its constitutional duty to comply with the orders of Article III courts,\" Harris, a former law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas, assured the Justices. (Dellinger has since withdrawn the appeal, which he appeared destined to lose.)\n\nThis observation was no random aside-it followed the President's alarming statement, on social media, that \"He who saves his Country does not violate any Law. \" In an earlier post, Vice-President J. D. Vance , a graduate of Yale Law School, asserted that \"judges aren't allowed to control the executive's legitimate power.\" Proclamations like these are not helpful when you are trying to convince judges that the executive is making a legitimate assertion of power. In the end, as Chief Justice John Marshall declared in Marbury v. Madison, \"It is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is.\"\n\nPutting aside the prospect that Trump will resort to open defiance of the Court, the fact is that the courts will be the final arbiter of whether Trump can revoke the constitutional guarantee of birthright citizenship, unilaterally shutter departments created by Congress, fire commissioners at independent agencies without cause, ban trans people from serving in the military, punish law firms because of whom they hire or what clients they represent, or-well, the list goes on. On some of these initiatives, such as the power to control independent agencies, the Administration is likely to encounter a receptive audience, especially before the high court. On others, such as birthright citizenship, the Administration has a tougher path to victory. Making preposterous arguments, employing disrespectful language, and treating judges like obstreperous obstacles rather than life-tenured members of a coequal branch does nothing to help its cause.\n\nIn one case-which challenges the removal of Venezuelan migrants accused of being gang members, under the supposed authority of the Alien Enemies Act, a 1798 law that has only been used in wartime-U.S. District Judge James Boasberg unloaded on a lawyer for the government for using \"intemperate and disrespectful language I'm not used to hearing from the United States.\" In a hearing Thursday, Boasberg, saying the government had \"acted in bad faith,\" appeared inclined to find it in contempt of an order he had issued not to remove the migrants.\n\nIn another case, involving Musk and the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE , U.S. District Judge Tanya Chutkan ruled for the Administration, but she admonished lawyers for being disingenuous about the extent of DOGE 's authority over personnel actions. \"Defense counsel is reminded of their duty to make truthful representations to the court,\" Chutkan wrote in a footnote. Another judge in the District of Columbia, Ana Reyes, was even sharper in response to the government's argument that its executive order barring transgender individuals from serving in the military applied only to people with gender dysphoria-notwithstanding a tweet from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth and the Defense Department's official account asserting flatly, \"Transgender troops are disqualified from service without an exemption.\"\n\n\"I am not going to abide by government officials saying one thing to the public . . . saying what they really mean to the public and coming in here to the court and telling me something different, like I'm an idiot,\" Reyes said. \"I am not an idiot.\" The Justice Department lawyer, Jean Lin, persisted with this ludicrous distinction. \"Your Honor, we respectfully submit that the inference that this is a broad transgender ban is incorrect,\" she said.\n\nThis kind of lawyering takes a toll. Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, where many of the cases challenging Trump Administration actions are headed, refused to block Boasberg's order preventing the Administration from removing alleged members of the Tren de Aragua gang from the United States. Notably, the Administration came before a panel of two Republican-nominated judges-one, Karen LeCraft Henderson, named by George H. W. Bush; the other, Justin Walker, by Trump-and one Democratic appointee, Patricia Millett, named by Barack Obama. In other words, this panel looked to be stacked in the Administration's favor. And Henderson's prior cases underscored her willingness to defer to the government on matters of national security and her scant sympathy for the plight of migrants.\n\nBut the Trump Administration managed to lose Henderson's vote in Trump v. J.G.G., as she joined Millett in refusing to lift Boasberg's temporary restraining order. To read Henderson's opinion is to get a glimpse of her impatience with the audacity of the Administration's arguments, which included the claim that federal courts had no business reviewing Trump's actions because of his authority over national security and foreign relations. \"Sensitive subject matter alone does not shroud a law from the judicial eye,\" she observed. As to the Administration's assertion that the Alien Enemies Act could be stretched to cover the actions of a gang, not a government, at a time when there is no declared war or military invasion, Henderson was tart. \"The text and its original meaning say otherwise,\" she wrote.\n\nMillett was even more unsparing. She went out of her way to defend Boasberg, noting that the \"district court has been handling this matter with great expedition and circumspection, and its orders do nothing more than freeze the status quo.\" And she called out the government for arguing to Boasberg that it didn't have to comply with his verbal order to turn around planes carrying the Venezuelans because only the written one mattered, and then asking her court to review the same verbal order on appeal. \"Heads the government wins, tails the district court loses is no way to obtain the exceptional relief of a [temporary restraining order] stay,\" Millett wrote.\n\nThat day, the U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell displayed similar impatience in rejecting the Administration's request that she step aside from overseeing a case brought by the law firm Perkins Coie, which argues that Trump's executive order targeting the firm violates its constitutional rights. Her action was no surprise-judges don't tend to be well disposed toward efforts to bump them off cases, which is why prudent litigants are wary of making such requests. But Howell's opinion denying the motion is worth paying attention to, because she used the opportunity to send a message to the government about what she termed its \"rhetorical strategy of ad hominem attack.\"\n\nThe opening sentence of the Administration's filing asking her to step aside, she noted, emphasized \"the need to curtail ongoing improper encroachments of President Trump's Executive Power playing out around the country.\" Howell pushed back. \"This line, which sounds like a talking point from a member of Congress rather than a legal brief from the United States Department of Justice, has no citation to any legal authority for the simple reason that the notion expressed reflects a grave misapprehension of our constitutional order,\" she wrote. \"Adjudicating whether an Executive Branch exercise of power is legal, or not, is actually the job of the federal courts.\"\n\nThe Trump Administration's frustration with the quantity of litigation against it, she continued, \"is a testament to the fact that this country has an independent judiciary that adheres to an impartial adjudication process, without being swayed merely because the federal government appears on one side of a case and the President wishes a particular result.\"\n\nMy point here isn't that judges bristle at the Administration's actions and reflexively decide to rule against it. The judicial process is more subtle than that. But judges are people, too. They talk among themselves in courthouse corridors and lunchrooms. They witness the disrespectful treatment of colleagues they know deserve respect. They encounter extreme arguments and become understandably wary of the credibility of the Administration making them. Appellate judges surely noted, for example, that the Administration took the extraordinary step of asserting the \"state secrets\" privilege to shield information about the Venezuelan migrants case and then dismissed as no big deal the far more sensitive information discussed by senior officials on a Signal chat , to which they had accidentally added The Atlantic's Jeffrey Goldberg.\n\nPaul Freund, the legendary Harvard Law School professor, famously said that \"the Court should never be influenced by the weather of the day, but inevitably they will be influenced by the climate of the era.\" A climate of hostility to the judiciary is one of the Trump Administration's own creation, but it cannot be conducive to the President's desired outcome. For that, at least, we should be grateful. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Even Donald Trump's Historical Role Model Had Second Thoughts About Tariffs\n\nThe other morning, as Donald Trump was writing on social media that the \"Entire World is RIPPING US OFF!!!\" and threatening to impose tariffs of two hundred per cent on wine and champagne from the European Union, and as investors were fretting about the possibility of his actions plunging the economy into a recession, I happened to be reading a biography of another tariff-raising Republican whom Trump has adopted as a role model: the Ohioan William McKinley, who served as President from March, 1897, until his assassination, in September, 1901, at the hands of an anarchist. Last year, Trump said that McKinley \"made this country rich.\" On Trump's first day back in office, in January, he reinstated Mt. McKinley as the name of an Alaskan mountain that is the highest peak in North America.\n\nIn \" President McKinley: Architect of the American Century ,\" which was published in 2017, the journalist and author Robert W. Merry recounts how McKinley started out as a \"steadfast protectionist\" who believed that high tariff walls were a prerequisite for the rapid growth of the U.S. economy in the decades following the Civil War. In 1890, when McKinley was serving as the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, he sponsored a tariff bill that raised the duties on many imported goods to nearly fifty per cent on average. Sounding like a modern-day Trumpian economic nationalist, he declared on the House floor, \"This bill is an American bill. It is made for the American people and American interests.\" Seven years later, when McKinley was in the Oval Office, he signed into law a piece of legislation, the Dingley Act, that raised some tariffs even further.\n\nMcKinley also presided over the Spanish-American War of 1898, and the subsequent acquisitions of Hawaii, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Guam as U.S. territories. It's hardly surprising that Trump, a self-proclaimed \"tariff man\" and a would-be American imperialist, seized on McKinley as a role model. But a closer inspection of McKinley's trade policy reveals some surprises and warnings for Trump-supporting members of Congress who are up for reëlection in less than twenty months. In purloining a simplistic version of McKinley's attitudes toward tariffs, Trump is ignoring the valuable lessons they have to offer.\n\nSince the days of Alexander Hamilton, the United States had imposed customs on imported goods to encourage local production and raise revenues. Throughout the nineteenth century, the dividing line on trade policy was largely geographic. In the South, planters and other agricultural interests who exported crops to world markets were generally supportive of open trade and low tariff rates. In the North, where new manufacturing industries faced stiff competition from European (and particularly British) imports, many business interests supported higher tariffs.\n\nBy the time McKinley entered Congress, in 1877, industrialization was accelerating rapidly, and his home state, long dependent on agriculture, was emerging as a major center for the mining of coal and the production of iron and steel. McKinley was the son of an iron-foundry owner, and his electoral district encompassed some of Ohio's biggest industrial centers. In the long run, industrialization and migration would transform American politics, but for now the Republican Party remained the primary representative of Northern industrialists, and the Democratic Party largely depended on the South.\n\nAfter arriving on Capitol Hill, McKinley advocated for higher tariffs. Back then, Congress determined trade policy: it wouldn't be until the nineteen-thirties that it delegated the responsibility for making trade deals and adjusting tariff rates to the President. The postwar government was still fiercely divided, and McKinley didn't get the opportunity to pass any trade legislation until after the election of 1888, when Republicans won control of the White House and both chambers of Congress.\n\nThus empowered, McKinley drew up a bill that raised or maintained import duties on a broad range of manufactured goods, including woollens, cottons, earthenware, iron, steel, and metal products. Democrats claimed that the McKinley Tariff Act, as it came to be known, would gouge ordinary Americans and provoke foreign countries to retaliate. They portrayed McKinley as a captive of his wealthy industrialist allies, who included Mark Hanna, the Cleveland iron-and-steel magnate. The Republicans largely dismissed these objections, and, on October 1, 1890, President Benjamin Harrison signed the tariff bill into law. The midterms were just a month away.\n\n\"The Democrats had supporters of the tariff on the defensive,\" the historian Richard J. Jensen wrote in his book \" The Winning of the Midwest: Social and Political Conflict, 1888-96 .\" \"Young party workers peddled wagonloads of tinware from house to house, asking fifty cents for twenty-five-cent items, and explained to dismayed housewives that McKinley's tariffs had doubled the price of tin.\" Rallying to McKinley's side, other Republican leaders insisted that the tariffs bearing his name would protect workers' jobs. Harrison and his Secretary of State, James G. Blaine, visited McKinley's district and gave campaign speeches, but their efforts were to no avail. On Election Night, the Republicans suffered heavy losses across the country. McKinley was one of the victims.\n\nTo be sure, other factors played into this outcome. In the case of McKinley, redistricting changes had boosted the number of Democrats in his district. At the time, however, it was generally believed that public anger at the new tariffs was a major reason for the G.O.P. wipeout. In his sweeping 2017 history of U.S. trade policy, \" Clashing Over Commerce ,\" the Dartmouth economist Douglas A. Irwin points out that Theodore Roosevelt, who was then an ambitious young Republican politician, subscribed to this view. When, in 1901, Roosevelt succeeded McKinley as President, he would follow his predecessor's lead on U.S. imperialism, but he would also steer away from tariffs.\n\nIrwin's book also highlights another fact about the McKinley Tariff Act that should worry latter-day protectionists in the Trump Administration. In the years after the law was enacted, the U.S. economy entered a deep slump, which didn't fully relent until 1897. Non-trade factors played the primary role in bringing about this calamity, particularly a big financial panic in 1893, which led to the collapse of a number of banks and railroads. Still, as Irwin noted when I called him up last week: \"When President Trump says that the McKinley tariff ushered in this glorious period of industrial expansion, it was actually a recession, really a depression, for a number of years.\"\n\nA third important fact about McKinley's record that Trump ignores is that his views on trade were far from static. When he ran successfully for President, in 1896, he was still a supporter of high tariffs-his Democratic opponent, William Jennings Bryan, had called for less restrictive policies-but his views were changing, an evolution that the economic slump seems to have accelerated. McKinley \"could see that America's burgeoning industrialism was outstripping American consumer demand, and prosperity in the postdepression era that would define his presidency would require an active American pursuit of foreign markets,\" Merry writes in his biography.\n\nIn his March, 1897, Inaugural Address, McKinley highlighted the \"reciprocity principle,\" which he said involved \"the opening up of new markets for the products of our country, by granting concessions to the products of other lands,\" by which he meant reducing or removing the barriers to imports. Four months later, he signed legislation that appeared to contradict this principle: the Dingley Act raised the average rate on dutiable goods to as high as fifty-two per cent for a time. But the most egregious elements of this legislation came about because of uber-protectionists in the Senate. Merry writes that, in fact, McKinley \"harbored some disappointment at many of the law's high duties,\" and took consolation from the fact that the bill also bestowed upon him some limited power to reach reciprocal trade agreements with foreign countries. The following year, the White House announced a deal with France in which the French duties on American exports of a range of goods, including fruits, pork, and building materials, would be set at a minimum rate in return for a reduction of U.S. tariffs on French goods, including wines, spirits, and paintings.\n\nThis agreement, and others like it, didn't do very much to mitigate the high tariffs imposed by the McKinley and Dingley Acts. But McKinley, as he entered his second term, in 1901, seemed sincere in his belief that new circumstances demanded new, less restrictive trade policies. Speaking in Buffalo on September 5th, the day before he was fatally shot, he acknowledged some of the benefits that the U.S. economy derived from trade, saying, \"A system which provides a mutual exchange of commodities, a mutual exchange, is manifestly essential to the continued and healthful growth of our export trade. We must not repose in fancied security that we can forever sell everything and buy little or nothing. . . . We should take from our customers such of their products as we can use.\" Further distancing himself from the harsh protectionist language he had employed earlier in his political career, he went on, \"Commercial wars are unprofitable. A policy of good will and friendly trade relations will prevent reprisals. Reciprocity treaties are in harmony with the spirit of the times, measures of retaliation are not.\"\n\nTrump claims to be in favor of reciprocity. The White House is already describing an extensive proposal of new levies, which he is expected to impose in early April, as \"reciprocal tariffs.\" But Trump's definition of reciprocity is a peculiar one. \"Under the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement, we already have reciprocity with Canada and Mexico,\" Irwin pointed out to me. \"Trump cut that deal in his first term, and he seems to be walking away from it. Japan doesn't have a tariff on imported automobiles. Should we match that? He seems to want to raise tariffs rather than lower them.\"\n\nSome people in the Trump Administration deny that Trump's goal is permanently higher tariffs. Scott Bessent, the Treasury Secretary, famously remarked that Trump's strategy is \"escalate to de-escalate.\" But Irwin, for one, is skeptical of this rationalization. \"It's all threats about raising tariffs,\" he said, of Trump's messaging. \"Ultimately, since he hasn't done much about reciprocity, and he keeps talking about the benefits of tariffs, it seems like tariffs are the endgame.\" Meanwhile, some widely watched economic indicators are showing weakness. Last week, the University of Michigan's Survey of Consumers reported that consumer confidence has fallen for the third month in a row, and expectations of inflation have reached their highest level since 2022. Whatever impact Trump's tariffs and tariff threats are having on U.S. trading partners, they seem to be alarming many ordinary Americans.\n\nMcKinley had gone to Buffalo, near the Canadian border, to speak at the Pan-American Exposition, an elaborate fair that was intended to celebrate the growth of countries in the Americas and foster commerce between them. Finishing up his fateful last address, he said, \"Our earnest prayer is that God will graciously vouchsafe prosperity, happiness and peace to all our neighbors, and like blessings to all the people and powers of earth.\" Obviously, these words don't erase McKinley's record of protectionism and imperialism. But can anybody imagine Trump saying them? ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "How Donald Trump Throttled Big Law\n\nBrad Karp's cellphone rang on the evening of Tuesday, March 18th. It was the President of the United States. Karp, the chairman of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton & Garrison, the powerful New York law firm, had been trying to reach Donald Trump on the President's personal cellphone for days, only to get his voice mail. Karp was desperate to find a way out from under an executive order targeting Paul, Weiss, which Trump had signed the previous Friday.\n\nThe Lede Reporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nTrump's order put Paul, Weiss on an Administration blacklist. Firm lawyers were barred from meeting with government employees or entering government buildings; firm clients were at risk of having their government contracts revoked. If the edict stood, Karp believed it would destroy the hundred-and-fifty-year-old firm, an enterprise that Karp had helped build into a behemoth with $2.6 billion in annual revenue, more than a thousand lawyers, and hefty profits per partner of $7.5 million. In an attempt to find an entrée to the White House, he had enlisted Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots and a close friend of Trump's, to secure a Presidential audience. After Kraft assured the President that Paul, Weiss was willing to pledge millions in pro-bono legal work and to make other concessions, Trump was prepared to grant the meeting. He invited Karp to the White House.\n\nAnd so ensued a remarkable session in the Oval Office. For more than ninety minutes, beginning around 8:30 A.M. on Wednesday, Karp met with the President of the United States; Susie Wiles, the White House chief of staff; Steven Witkoff, the President's Middle East envoy; and Boris Epshteyn, Trump's outside legal counsel. Patched into the meeting by phone from New York was Robert Giuffra, the co-chair of Sullivan & Cromwell, one of Paul, Weiss's major competitors. Giuffra had been recently hired by Trump to represent him in the appeal of his conviction on thirty-four counts of falsifying business records. Now Giuffra was drafted to help negotiate the terms of an agreement.\n\nTrump was friendly toward Karp, effusive even, saying that he had heard \"nice things\" about the lawyer. There were fifteen minutes of golf talk, with the President reminiscing about playing with Tiger Woods and Gary Player, and musing about how his Turnberry course, in Scotland, should host the British Open. Trump then launched into a lengthy soliloquy about how the law had been weaponized against him and the role of law firms in that unfair treatment. He complained, in particular, about Mark Pomerantz, a former Paul, Weiss partner who at one point led the Manhattan District Attorney's criminal investigation of Trump-and who was cited by name in the executive order. \"Work this out,\" Trump instructed the group as the session concluded. \"Let's get a deal done.\"\n\nBy the end of the day on Thursday, the parties, negotiating back and forth by e-mail, had reached what was, for Paul, Weiss, the equivalent of a plea bargain; Trump posted what he said were its terms on his Truth Social website. But this was a deal without an underlying offense: the firm had done nothing wrong, except in Trump's mind. Even worse, it was a deal to undo a flagrantly unconstitutional order, one that punished the firm for taking legal positions hostile to Trump and for representing clients he did not like. Swallowing it should go down like acid. A spokesperson for Paul, Weiss declined to comment. The White House, when asked for comment, defended the order. The press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, wrote, \"President Trump is delivering on his promise to end the weaponization of government and protect the nation from partisan and bad faith actors who exploit their influence.\"\n\nThe stakes here are bigger than the survival of a single firm, even one as iconic as Paul, Weiss. Trump and his allies are engaged in a methodical war against the legal profession, from law schools to the private bar, from the Justice Department to the federal judiciary . Their goal is not only to exact retribution against perceived enemies-although, for Trump, vengeance is never far from top of mind-but to intimidate others who might dare to resist. The Paul, Weiss deal-and the studied silence of other law firms who have refused to speak out against other recent orders-offers an alarming illustration of how impressively the campaign is succeeding. \"If law firms can be cowed this easily, then they don't deserve to be law firms,\" John Keker, a veteran San Francisco lawyer whose firm has been one of the few willing to publicly denounce the executive orders, told me. \"I can understand why people would be scared of losing clients,\" Keker added. \"What I don't understand is why they think putting their heads in the sand is going to be better in the long run.\"\n\nFrom the point of view of Paul, Weiss, having to strike this arrangement wasn't pleasant, but the price was tolerable. The firm didn't commit to much that was tangible. It agreed to provide forty million dollars over four years in additional pro-bono work, but that means little to a firm that already allocates some hundred and thirty million dollars a year to free legal services. On the other side of the ledger, fighting the order in court had good prospects of success-but Karp thought that any win would arrive too late. \"Clients had told us that they were not going to be able to stay with us, even though they wanted to,\" he wrote in a firm-wide e-mail, on Sunday. Meanwhile, he noted, \"certain other firms were seeking to exploit our vulnerabilities by aggressively soliciting our clients and recruiting our attorneys.\" The bottom line, according to Karp: \"It was very likely that our firm would not be able to survive a protracted dispute with the Administration.\"\n\nSome of Karp's counterparts at other firms are sympathetic to this position. Many more, based on conversations I've had with dozens of lawyers in the past several days, are livid at what they see as a craven sellout-one that is particularly galling given the firm's comfortable position near the top of the heap of Big Law profitability. Clients might leave and lucrative practice groups defect to rival firms, this argument goes, but surely Paul, Weiss could survive a few lean years-its profits per partner, say, plummeting to a mere two million dollars-in the service of standing up to Trump. \"There's no way that Paul, Weiss would have gone under,\" one former partner told me.\n\nFor many attorneys, the episode encapsulates a lamentable shift in their roles, in which a profession that once embraced the lofty obligation to do good for society has degraded into another grubby enterprise focussed on profits. A letter signed by ninety former Paul, Weiss associates and other employees deplored the \"permanent stain on the face of a great firm that sought to gain a profit by forfeiting its soul.\" (I was a summer associate there in 1983.)\n\nWhether the Paul, Weiss agreement was a wise compromise or shameful capitulation, the lesson is unavoidable: if a powerhouse like Paul, Weiss cannot, or will not, stand up to Trump, then no firm can. And, if there was any hope that subduing Paul, Weiss might have slaked Trump's desire to punish firms, it was quickly extinguished with a new order directing the Attorney General, Pam Bondi, to pursue sanctions \"against attorneys and law firms who engage in frivolous, unreasonable, and vexatious litigation against the United States.\" (This is rich coming from the man who has perfected the art of vexatious litigation; in 2023, a federal judge called Trump \"the mastermind of strategic abuse of the judicial process.\") Trump followed up, on Tuesday, with an order against another firm that drew his ire, the Chicago-based firm Jenner & Block. Two days later, another major firm, WilmerHale, was hit by an executive order. Jenner & Block and WilmerHale filed lawsuits to challenge the edicts against them. Skadden, Arps, a New York powerhouse, took the Paul, Weiss route on Friday; Trump announced that they would devote another hundred million dollars to pro-bono work, in what he described as a \"settlement.\"\n\nNo firm weighing whether to represent a client that has crossed Trump or whether to file a lawsuit against the Administration can afford to ignore these developments. Even before the spate of executive orders, firms were skittish about finding themselves at odds with the new Administration. Now they are terrified, and lining up their own outside counsel. Trump could be coming for them next. On Monday, when the President was asked about his orders against law firms, he made his position clear: firms were to submit to his will. \"I just think the law firms have to behave themselves,\" he said.\n\nIt took the Trump Administration only three weeks to accomplish this subjugation. First, they came for Covington & Burling, the storied Washington firm that had the temerity to represent, pro bono, the former special counsel Jack Smith -\"deranged Jack Smith,\" in the words of Trump, who has called for Smith to be jailed. An executive order issued on February 25th yanked the security clearance for Smith's lawyer, the Covington partner Peter Koski, threatening, as Trump well understood, Smith's constitutional right to counsel; Trump's own lawyers needed clearances in order to represent him in the Mar-a-Lago classified-documents case.\n\nThe next firm targeted was Perkins Coie, based in Seattle and with a long history of representing Democratic Party entities and candidates. In 2016, as part of its work for the Democratic National Committee and Hillary Clinton's Presidential campaign, the firm commissioned what came to be known as the Steele dossier, an opposition-research report into the then candidate Trump's ties to Russia. Trump sued Perkins Coie over the Steele dossier, in 2022, and lost, but he is not one to drop a grudge. The Perkins executive order, issued on March 6th, claimed that \"the dishonest and dangerous activity of the law firm . . . has affected this country for decades,\" and went on to invoke the dossier.\n\nThe Perkins Coie executive order was far more egregious than the one directed against Covington. It not only suspended security clearances for the firm's lawyers but also barred Perkins Coie employees from entering government buildings or meeting with government officials \"when such access would threaten the national security of or otherwise be inconsistent with the interests of the United States.\" Even more draconian, it instructed agencies to terminate contracts held by Perkins Coie clients.\n\n\"The Order is not just an attempt to constrain or weaken Perkins Coie; its objective is to destroy the Firm,\" its lawyers argued in a request for an emergency order suspending most of the edict. \"Unless restrained, the Order realistically might succeed in that objective within days.\" Perkins Coie's fifteen highest-billing clients or their affiliates all regularly bid for government contracts. In an affidavit, the partner David Burman said that a major government contractor had already withdrawn its work from Perkins Coie, and that a federal official had informed a client that its Perkins Coie lawyers should not attend a meeting. \"The client,\" Burman wrote, \"after expressing great reluctance and regret, said it was forced to hire other law firms to represent it before the federal government.\"\n\nU.S. District Judge Beryl Howell quickly blocked the order from taking effect, concluding that it appeared to violate a suite of constitutional protections, including free speech, due process, and the right to counsel. The Administration's arguments that the President can take action against any entity he deems to be acting against the national interest \"sends little chills down my spine,\" Howell told Chad Mizelle, the chief of staff to Attorney General Bondi, who had been dispatched to argue the case, a remarkable use of a senior official's time. Trump, she said, appeared to be \"using taxpayer dollars and government resources . . . to pursue what is a wholly personal vendetta.\" (The Trump Justice Department has demanded that Howell step aside from the case, saying she \"repeatedly demonstrated partiality against and animus towards the president.\" Howell refused.)\n\nAs the lawsuit proceeds, it is hard to imagine appellate judges-even the Supreme Court's current conservative super-majority-concluding that the order passes constitutional muster. But it is also difficult to see how Perkins Coie does not emerge grievously damaged. Some clients, new and existing, may be steering business its way in appalled solidarity. Still, clients with issues before the government have to think twice before hiring Perkins Coie. Any corporate general counsel would have a difficult time explaining why retaining Perkins Coie would be in the best interest of shareholders. (A spokesperson for the firm declined to comment.)\n\nThe judge's order and her harsh words, of course, did nothing to deter Trump. Two days after the Perkins Coie order was blocked, he went after Paul, Weiss. This executive order made manifest the implicit message of the first two: that Trump intends to deter large law firms from pursuing the pro-bono cases against Administration policies that plagued him during his first term and that threaten to do so in his second.\n\n\"Global law firms have for years played an outsized role in undermining the judicial process and in the destruction of bedrock American principles,\" the order stated. \"Many have engaged in activities that make our communities less safe, increase burdens on local businesses, limit constitutional freedoms, and degrade the quality of American elections. Additionally, they have sometimes done so on behalf of clients, pro bono, or ostensibly 'for the public good'-potentially depriving those who cannot otherwise afford the benefit of top legal talent the access to justice deserved by all.\"\n\nThis argument turns the concept of pro-bono work on its head. A law firm taking on pro-bono representation of a criminal defendant, or a migrant on the verge of being deported, reflects attorneys fulfilling their professional responsibility to represent those unable to pay; in Trump's reductionist universe, it is making communities less safe. When a firm helps challenge a law that curtails voting rights, it is adhering to the American Bar Association's advice that firms should represent those \"seeking to secure or protect civil rights\"; for Trump, it is helping to rig elections.\n\nAs always with Trump, there were specific, grudge-based grievances. The Paul, Weiss order noted, although it did not cite her by name, that the partner Jeannie Rhee-perhaps not coincidentally, a top prosecutor in the office of the special counsel Robert Mueller-had provided pro-bono help to the D.C. attorney general in a civil lawsuit against the Proud Boys, Oath Keepers, and others involved in the January 6th insurrection . (The lawsuit was dropped a few days after Trump issued the Paul, Weiss order.)\n\nThe order also singled out Pomerantz, the former Paul, Weiss partner who joined the Manhattan District Attorney's office, in late 2020, to help oversee the criminal investigation into Trump's business dealings and personal finances. He quit a little over a year later in frustration, asserting that it was a \"grave failure of justice\" not to charge Trump, and wrote a book laying out the case against him. (Trump ultimately was indicted and convicted, although on a different theory than the one that Pomerantz had endorsed.) In short, Trump went after Paul, Weiss for a prosecution that a lawyer who was no longer with the firm had never brought.\n\nPaul, Weiss presented a juicy target for Trump. Of the major New York firms, its profile was the most decidedly Democratic. A history on the firm's website notes that it was \"the first major New York City firm to break down the barrier of Jews practicing with Gentiles, the first to hire a Black associate, the first to hire a Black female associate, the first to make a woman a partner.\" The Democratic Presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson was a firm lawyer, as was John F. Kennedy's adviser Theodore Sorensen. Current partners include two leading members of the Obama Administration: the former Attorney General Loretta Lynch and the former Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson.\n\nThe firm has a rich tradition of pro-bono work-from helping overturn the convictions of several of the Scottsboro Boys to representing McCarthy-era targets such as J. Robert Oppenheimer to bringing a landmark case that helped establish the right to same-sex marriage. During Trump's first term, Paul, Weiss proudly joined litigation to combat the Administration's family-separation policies. Karp co-wrote an opinion piece in the Times decrying the cruel policy and trumpeting the role of lawyers in fighting it. \"We're reuniting families destroyed by the administration,\" Karp told the Times for a separate article , which reported that around seventy-five lawyers at the firm were working on that project.\n\nIn 2024, Paul Weiss didn't soft-pedal its liberal leanings. Karen Dunn, the co-chair of the litigation department, oversaw debate preparation for the Democratic nominee Kamala Harris . Karp became a leader of Harris's fund-raising efforts, waving off concerns about a backlash if Trump were to win. \"Each of us needs to do what we believe is right, whatever the consequences,\" Karp said. \"That has always been my mantra in leading Paul, Weiss.\"\n\nThen came Trump's Inauguration, and a torrent of executive orders . Public-interest groups challenging these orders found that private firms that were eager to sign on to pro-bono litigation during the first term were reluctant this time around. Paying clients knew how vindictive Trump could be and didn't want to antagonize him, even if no one imagined that a tactic quite as effective as the executive orders would soon be deployed.\n\nIt quickly became clear that the firms would not be willing to protect one another, either, against an Administration determined to terrorize Big Law. Ultimately, Williams & Connolly-a Washington firm whose practice is heavy on litigation rather than corporate transactions-agreed to take Perkins Coie's case. In a sign of the wary times, Howell, the U.S. district judge, went out of her way at the hearing in which she froze the order to praise Williams & Connolly as \"a very brave law firm, to take this on.\"\n\nMeanwhile, an effort to recruit firms to join a friend-of-the-court brief on behalf of Perkins Coie confronted a collective-action problem. Leading law firms, including Paul, Weiss, expressed tentative willingness to sign on to the brief-but only if enough of their peers agreed to put themselves out there, as well, and few were willing to make a definitive commitment. These delicate negotiations were already faltering when Paul, Weiss reached its separate agreement with the Administration.\n\nKarp had concluded even before the Friday night when his firm's order came down that litigation was not the way to solve the problem. After the Covington order, and again after the one directed at Perkins Coie, he shared that view at the firm's well-attended, weekly Thursday partners' lunch. A modern law firm was an inherently fragile enterprise, Karp warned. The point in responding to Trump was not to be a martyr-it was to survive.\n\nOnce, firms had been small and clubby, a place where partners practiced together for life. Now they were behemoths, with partners flitting from firm to firm, and taking clients along with them. If anyone understood the economic realities of a twenty-first-century law firm, it was Karp. Since becoming chairman of Paul, Weiss, in 2008, he had presided over its transformation, shifting the firm's focus from litigation to the constant stream of revenue produced by corporate dealmaking. \"In order for us to make sure that we will endure . . . we had to increase our transactional footprint,\" Karp told colleagues at his first \"state of the union\" address as chair. That was not going to happen \"organically,\" with homegrown talent, Karp said on a legal podcast last year. He needed to go shopping, poaching lawyers from rivals such as Kirkland & Ellis and Cravath, Swaine & Moore.\n\nThe hiring spree paid off, with a surge in the firm's revenue and in profits per partner-even as the new cadre of rainmakers took home salaries in the range of twenty million dollars. But with that came a discernible shift in the firm's culture, and in the balance of power between the corporate and litigation departments. In 2024, the firm shifted to a \"black box\" compensation system, in which partners no longer know what their colleagues are making, on the theory that less transparency will reduce tension. Likewise, the firm, following the lead of many others, created a new, lesser tier of partner-so-called non-equity partners. This metamorphosis may have been good for the bottom line, but in the view of many Paul, Weiss veterans it took a toll on culture. This was less a partnership than a business, and the corporate lawyers held the reins.\n\nKarp called an emergency Zoom meeting of the partners for Saturday morning. Clients were already starting to worry-and flee. Steven Schwartz, a New Jersey technology-company executive accused of paying bribes in India, had fired the firm, which had represented him for years, because, as Paul, Weiss lawyers told the judge in the case, Schwartz was \"concerned that Paul, Weiss's ongoing involvement in the matter could in and of itself prejudice the review of his case.\" (Schwartz has pleaded not guilty to the bribery charges.)\n\nThe partner Kannon Shanmugam, an appellate specialist in the Washington office, started drafting a lawsuit. But litigation was only the fallback, in case the firm failed to find a way to get Trump's attention. Karp also brought in Quinn Emanuel-a firm that, like Williams & Connolly, is famed for its hard-charging litigation. Quinn Emanuel also had something Williams & Connolly didn't: ties to Trumpworld. Its co-managing partner, William Burck, who agreed to represent Paul, Weiss, was brought in by Eric Trump at the start of Trump's second term to be the ethics adviser to the President's company, and he has represented others close to Trump, including Steve Bannon. Burck and his partner Alex Spiro have represented New York City's mayor, Eric Adams . While Kraft, the Patriots owner, reached out to the President, Burck touched base with people in the offices of the chief of staff and the White House counsel.\n\nAfter the Oval Office session, the lawyers got to work, trading draft terms by e-mail, text, and telephone. They dickered over the size of the pro-bono commitment, an effort to insert what one source familiar with the negotiations described as \"Trumpy language,\" and whether the order would be suspended, as the White House team wanted, or rescinded, as Paul, Weiss preferred. (It was rescinded.) The eventual agreement consisted, in part, of innocuous boilerplate. \"Paul, Weiss agrees that the bedrock principle of American Justice is that it must be fair and nonpartisan for all,\" one such section read.\n\nOther aspects were more disconcerting, implying that the Administration would have a role in overseeing firm affairs. \"Paul, Weiss affirms its commitment to merit-based hiring, promotion, and retention, and will not adopt, use, or pursue any DEI policies,\" the White House version of the agreement read. \"As part of its commitment, it will engage experts, to be mutually agreed upon within 14 days, to conduct a comprehensive audit of all of its employment practices.\" (The Paul, Weiss summary of the agreement omitted any outright renunciation of D.E.I.) The firm's promise to finance pro-bono activities specified that it would \"support the Administration's initiatives, including: assisting our Nation's veterans, fairness in the Justice System, the President's Task Force to Combat Antisemitism, and other mutually agreed projects.\" To read this was to wonder: When did the President become the boss of Paul, Weiss?\n\nBut the most appalling aspect of the episode involved the treatment of Pomerantz, the well-liked former partner who'd had the brass to investigate Trump. In his Truth Social post-and, more significant, in his official order revoking the decree-the President asserted that Karp \"acknowledged the wrongdoing\" of Pomerantz. Whether Karp made such an acknowledgment is the subject of intense dispute. The Paul, Weiss summary of the agreement did not contain any such admission of \"wrongdoing,\" and Karp insisted to a person who was not present at the meeting that he did nothing to denigrate Pomerantz or to indicate acceptance of Trump's criticism. Still, a person familiar with the meeting said that Karp pointed out to the President that Pomerantz had not been formally associated with the firm for years. (He didn't note that Paul, Weiss was representing Pomerantz in matters relating to his work for the Manhattan District Attorney and his book on Trump.) A second person familiar with the meeting insisted, \"Everything in the President's statement is completely and totally factual.\" Certainly, Karp, in the context of pleading for his law firm's life, was not about to defend Pomerantz and antagonize the President.\n\nWhen the Truth Social post came out, Paul, Weiss registered its objections to the White House, only to be told there was nothing to be done. The firm made no public comment-and Pomerantz's peers were furious. \"Are we in effect now muzzled, and we're not going to be saying anything for fear that we'll be targeted once again?\" one former partner asked. \"I'm assuming they just want to keep their heads down. I think it's quite troubling. I wonder if the Paul, Weiss of ten years ago would have done this, and I want to believe the answer is no.\"\n\nPomerantz, for his part, took the high road. \"I do not believe that Brad Karp or Paul, Weiss 'acknowledged' any 'wrongdoing' on my part,\" he said in a statement provided to The New Yorker. \"They know, and I know, that my efforts to prosecute Donald Trump were entirely lawful. What matters is not what the President is saying about me, but what he is doing to crush opposition from anyone who disagrees with him about anything.\"\n\nAnother potential problem for the firm surfaced on Tuesday, when Isaac Stanley-Becker, of The Atlantic , reported that Paul, Weiss \"severed ties with the nation's oldest and largest Latino civil-rights organization, the League of United Latin American Citizens.\" LULAC 's C.E.O., Juan Proaño, told me that he received a call this past Thursday morning from a Paul, Weiss lawyer, informing him that the firm, which had previously done pro-bono work for LULAC , could no longer represent the organization, which has challenged Trump's attempt to revoke birthright citizenship . \"Clearly, looking at it, they were basically under some pressure to disengage from certain types of representation,\" Proaño said, of Paul, Weiss. After the Atlantic article appeared, Paul, Weiss backpedalled. \"We are proud to represent them in this matter, look forward to future representations, and have enormous respect for their work,\" Karp said in a statement on LULAC . But the encounter suggested a disturbing willingness to back away from clients who might be disfavored by the White House.\n\nIn the short term, Karp may have done the right thing for his firm, if at enormous personal cost. Yet, whatever the deal means for Paul, Weiss, its acquiescence to Trump marks a sad day for the legal profession-or what once was a profession, and is now just another business. It marks an even sadder day for the rule of law, which can only be vindicated when there are lawyers fearless enough to stand up for it, no matter the price. ♦\n\nThis article has been updated to include news developments.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "How Donald Trump Is Teaching Christians to Abandon Empathy\n\nAlbert Mohler, the longtime president of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, is one of the best-known evangelicals in the United States, famous for his writings on faith, and now for his podcast, \"The Briefing,\" which airs every weekday. Mohler was a harsh critic of Donald Trump in 2016, calling him a \"sexual predator,\" and lamenting his popularity among Christians. (Mohler says that he did not vote that year.) When Mohler and I spoke in June of 2020, he called Trump \"a huge embarrassment,\" but nevertheless offered various reasons why it was necessary to support him in that year's election. He admitted that his reasoning had a certain \"pragmatic, utilitarian dimension to it,\" explaining that Democrats and Republicans had diverged so much on social issues.\n\nFive years later, Mohler interviewed a fellow-theologian about \"the sin of empathy.\" The conversation occurred in February, around the same time that Elon Musk told Joe Rogan that \"civilizational suicidal empathy\" was destroying the West. I wanted to hear more about Mohler's perspective on empathy, and whether his views on American politics and the Trump Administration had evolved since we last spoke. Our conversation, which has been edited for length and clarity, is below.\n\nDo you still think President Trump is an embarrassment?\n\nNow when you say those words, you are going back to 2016?\n\n2020. You said that to me.\n\nO.K., I need context here. I supported President Trump's election in 2020.\n\nI know you did, but when we talked you said, \"President Trump is a huge embarrassment, and it's an embarrassment to evangelical Christianity that there appear to be so many people who will celebrate precisely the aspects that I see Biblically as most lamentable and embarrassing.\"\n\nYeah, I mean, I said that in a context. I mean, frankly, many of the particulars of the story of Donald Trump are embarrassing to evangelicals. But, at the same time, I unapologetically supported him in 2020, and I supported him in 2024. And, by the way, I supported him as President once he was elected to his first term. I don't think it's fair to have that statement as an isolated statement. Donald Trump's not the only politician that has embarrassed me that I have supported.\n\nSo it's a larger group?\n\nWell, and it's a complicated context, and I want to be very clear about that. It's very complicated. It's not so easy. I just finished teaching a two-hour class on leadership, and one of the things I pointed out is that, you know, in ancient Rome and then Victorian England, you had a separation between public virtue and private vice. Now you have public vice. That's a game changer. We know stuff about John F. Kennedy that people didn't know when he was alive.\n\nIn 2020, I thought you were making a real utilitarian case for Trump.\n\nAbsolutely. There's a utilitarian aspect of politics, period. So, you know, on my podcast tomorrow, I talk about incrementalism in politics, and I just say politics is incrementalism. The perfect can be the enemy of the good in politics. There are no perfect candidates.\n\nYou just proudly used the word \"utilitarian.\" You once said, \"A utilitarian worldview is widely celebrated by secular élites. . . . When an objective morality of right and wrong is abandoned, inevitably something like pragmatism and utilitarianism is all that will come into play.\" Do you have any concerns about that now?\n\nYeah. I'm not disagreeing with myself. In that quote you read to me, I'm talking about what's formally identified as the philosophies of pragmatism and utilitarianism. So when I say somebody's pragmatic, I'm not necessarily tying it to John Dewey, you know, who didn't believe that morality was real. I am a moral realist. I'm not a pragmatist. But in decision-making, sometimes we have two options and we have to weigh those and make a choice. I would use the word \"pragmatic,\" and I'm not trying to be slippery here.\n\nYou recently wrote, \"President Trump has won the White House, and he has achieved a complete takeover of the Republican Party. The Republicans who disdained him and tried to terminate his leadership have made his point by leaving the party and becoming Democrats (or at least voting for Democrats). President Trump will just argue that they are now where they have always belonged. It's hard to argue otherwise.\"\n\nAmen.\n\nCan you say more-\n\nSo I think there's been a great sifting. I'll be honest, in terms of principle, I see myself in a straight line, and I'm open to anyone correcting me about that. I can tell you why I think I'm a straight line on these issues. I'm trying to achieve, legislatively and culturally, the greatest realization of the moral ends that I believe are right. That's the strategy, and the tactics change election by election, because you're presented with a different set of choices. I think, if you want to understand why so many evangelicals are basically so glad to have so many former Republicans gone, it is because in terms of the great issues of the day, they weren't really all that different from Democrats. They were just liberals on a slower timetable.\n\nWhat do you think about the kind of lifelong Republicans who just were so disgusted by Trump's behavior, by the accounts of women who said that he assaulted them, by, you know, making fun of disabled people, all these things? What about people who just felt like they had had enough and morally couldn't swallow it anymore?\n\nI have two different responses. No. 1, let's assume that that was said honestly and with an attempt at moral consistency.\n\nWell, you said things like that once, so I will assume you said them with honesty.\n\nRight, but let me finish my thought. I'm about to get lost here. Some are making that argument, I think, with a form of their own integrity and responsibility. But what I want to ask them is, well, then where do you draw the line? In other words, who is then acceptable? Just be honest and tell me where you draw the line. I think what has become evident is that there were a lot of Republicans who really were not philosophically, ideologically, or certainly on moral issues absolutely aligned with the Party. And as you know, the Republican Party's always had at least three major streams: big business and corporate interests, social conservatives, and then libertarians. The libertarians and the corporatists-they've never been big on social issues, which are certainly the primary reason why a lot of moral conservatives are in the Republican Party in the first place. And I think it's become clear that an awful lot of people really weren't committed to those issues. It didn't get smoked out in 2016, but it did in 2020 and 2024.\n\nSmoked out? You mean like they revealed themselves or something?\n\nLook, how many people were against same-sex marriage and are now for it?\n\nIn 2024, there was an open primary. Many people on the stage were pro-life, against gay marriage, and had more sincere conservative social values than Donald Trump. Why did evangelicals broadly not embrace someone else in the 2024 primary?\n\nI supported Ron DeSantis. I think Donald Trump represents something a lot of people just don't see. And I didn't see it for a long time, but I think I see it now. I think there is an intuitive connection that Donald Trump has made with a lot of people in the United States who believe that a massive disruption of the norm is necessary in order to save the Republic and preserve the culture. I think they see that in Donald Trump. I have to say that I don't think a mainstream Republican would, in his Inaugural Address, have said 'In my Administration, there will be two and only two genders: male and female.' I think Donald Trump did that because Donald Trump is a disruptor. There's a great hunger on the part of many American conservatives, including conservative Christians, for disruption.\n\nAnd on your part, too?\n\nYes, yes. Not without limits, but yes, yes.\n\nWhat sort of limits?\n\nWell, I believe in the continuation of the American Republic. I believe in the importance of constitutional order. I believe that disruption needs to take place.\n\nYou were not a January 6th fan?\n\nI was not. Yeah.\n\nWhat is your broader concern with empathy right now?\n\nI think the broader concern is that it's an artificial virtue, and I want to lean into authentic virtues. And I think it is used politically in ways that are very destructive and manipulative.\n\nSo what's an example?\n\nWell, on the immigration issue, the open embrace of empathy in that platform is on the part of people who basically are using empathy as an argument against having any meaningful citizenship, nationality, national borders, etc. Here's the thing-I've never said it this clearly before, but feel like I need to say it now. Empathy means never having to say no. Because the whole impulse of empathy is feeling with people as they feel. It's a therapeutic category rather than a moral category. I'm a Christian. I believe in moral categories. I believe in the importance of sympathy and even more in the responsibility of compassion. But that takes action and it's based in truth. It's not based on validating anyone's self-perceived situation, nor identifying with their own read of the situation as valid.\n\nOne of my concerns about this Administration is the joy they seem to take in cruelty toward immigrants. Do you feel that at all? Does that concern you?\n\nIt would concern me. That is not what I'm seeing. And I have been in parts of the country where this is of daily concern. I have not seen a lack of concern. What I do see is that there are very clear concerns reflected in public support for the President, sending gang members back to their home country and things like that. In the view of millions of Americans, it's a lack of compassion for fellow-citizens that has led to relatively insane and irresponsible open borders. The people I hang around with, they would never inflict any deliberate cruelty on anyone.\n\nYou're talking about the Venezuelan immigrants who were deported to El Salvador. The White House claims that they were all gang members, but we actually don't know that. It seems like some of them were not. Time magazine wrote about these men: \"Inside the intake room, a sea of trustees descended on the men with electric shavers, stripping heads of hair with haste. The guy who claimed to be a barber began to whimper, folding his hands in prayer as his hair fell. He was slapped. The man asked for his mother, then buried his face in his chained hands and cried as he was slapped again.\" The President and his Administration were revelling in this.\n\nI think you ought to have a concern about the mistreatment of anyone. Look, I take a very Augustinian view of state power. You know Augustine, the Church Father?\n\nI've heard of him.\n\nThis is the main Western theological tradition in Christianity. Am I making sense?\n\nYup.\n\nAn Augustinian view of government says that government coercion is never pretty. It is necessary, but it's never pretty. And, when government acts in a coercive manner, it always leads to some form of pain. That's what government coercion is. And so I am not justifying it. I'm simply saying that if you are going to return people against their will to their country, where they are seen there as gang members and they're going to be treated as criminals-\n\nThey were Venezuelan, and they were sent to El Salvador, but go on.\n\nO.K. No, that's true, but at least in theory, they are to be sent back to their home country. And I think that's a part of the spat between the Trump Administration and Venezuela at the moment. But, I also think the vast majority of Americans would say, Look, our understanding of refugees who are legitimate refugees does not include gang members who clearly are coming to the United States with an effort to expand their colonization of criminal activity.\n\nWe just don't know for sure that they were gang members. There's been some reporting that suggests some of them are not.\n\nI understand that, but want to be honest with you, and I think you'll be honest with me. Look, you can't say that everyone with that tattoo is a gang member, but there's no reason anyone other than a gang member should have that tattoo. [ The government has apparently been taking specific tattoos as a sign of gang membership, despite the fact that the F.B.I. and the Department of Homeland Security have previously raised concerns about doing so. ]\n\nI really enjoyed our first conversation in 2020, and my feeling is, if we'd gone back to 2020, or even 2016, and I read you the passage that I just did about these Venezuelan men, many of whom I assume are Christian, your response would have been different.\n\nI don't think that's true. I want to be ruthlessly honest with you and with myself. My view of some of the questions of public and private virtue-I've had to rethink some of those things. I think my approach to immigration policy and the potential gang involvement, I don't think that's changed at all.\n\nWhen I read about the Trump Administration's cuts to foreign aid, and the reports of children suffering around the world because of it, it's hard to feel that the people in power in the Trump Administration care at all.\n\nI know a lot of people in the government who would care a great deal and who actually think that the greater threat to human flourishing is letting a lot of the spending go on, all the programs go on, that aren't really helping anyone but populating bureaucracies. I personally know some of the people in the Administration making some of these decisions, and I'll simply say I believe they are not driven by animus, but, rather, driven by the attempt to try to get Leviathan back under some control.\n\nWhen I interviewed you in 2020, I sensed that there'd been somewhat of a change from how you were thinking about things in 2016. And this conversation, at least to me, feels different than our 2020 conversation.\n\nI'm trying to be as honest with you as I can be. And that means self-reflective as well. I'm a Christian theologian; I'm a Christian minister. I am obligated to introspection and self-criticism. And I want to be honest. I'll tell you what I think's changed. I think what has changed is the sense that something more significantly disruptive is going to have to take place for any progress to be made toward correction anywhere. And I will tell you, time will tell. I do not know if Donald Trump and his disruption is going to bring about lasting, meaningful, fruitful change. I'm hoping it does. And I see the necessity of disruption. If it isn't Donald Trump now, I don't know who it is going to be when. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Don't Believe Trump's Promises About Protecting the Social Safety Net\n\nTwo months into Donald Trump's second term, his Republican attack dogs, including Elon Musk and his minions at DOGE , are still busy chewing into many parts of the federal government. But the Trump Administration continues to promise that it will protect three major entitlement programs that together account for nearly half of all federal spending. \"The Trump administration will not cut Social Security, Medicare, or Medicaid,\" the White House wrote in a statement a couple of weeks ago. \"President Trump himself has said it (over and over and over again).\"\n\nOf course, Trump says many things that bear little relation to reality. During last year's Presidential campaign, he insisted that he had nothing to do with Project 2025-the Heritage Foundation's nine-hundred-page blueprint to reshape the federal government, which describes Medicare and Medicaid as the \"principal drivers of our $31 trillion national debt.\" Lo and behold, one of the authors of that report, Russell Vought, is now the director of the Office of Management and Budget, where, according to his White House bio, he is \"responsible for overseeing the implementation of the President's policy, management and regulatory agendas across the Executive Branch.\"\n\nThe alliance of radical conservative activists like Vought, who have long had entitlements in their sight, with Ayn Randian tech bros like Elon Musk, who enthuse about \"efficiencies,\" is perhaps the distinguishing feature of Trump 2.0. Project 2025 contains a number of proposals to reform Medicare and Medicaid, but it largely stays away from Social Security, which for years has been considered the third rail of American politics. Musk has shown fewer reservations. In an interview with the podcaster Joe Rogan, he described Social Security as \"the biggest Ponzi scheme of all time.\" In online posts and an appearance on Fox Business, he also claimed that there were more than twenty million people aged a hundred or older in the Social Security database, and he suggested that this could be evidence of pervasive fraud. (Trump repeated these allegations in a speech to Congress.)\n\nIt seems clear that Musk, Trump, and other Republicans have decided that the \"waste, fraud, and abuse\" narrative provides them with a more effective means of mobilizing support for cuts to entitlements than the traditional arguments about rising deficits and debt. After Musk and Trump made their claims about dead Social Security recipients, the acting head of the Social Security Administration, Leland Dudek, had to issue a press release explaining that the data they cited came from people with Social Security numbers who \"do not have a date of death associated with their record\" but who \"may not be receiving benefits.\" In other words, Musk and Trump were spreading disinformation.\n\nDudek was promoted when his predecessor resigned, in mid-February, following clashes with DOGE staffers who were attempting to access information about Social Security recipients. Although Dudek has corrected some of Musk's misstatements, he has also embraced the DOGE cost-cutting agenda. Since he took over, the Social Security Administration has announced plans to reduce its workforce by about twelve per cent. It is shuttering dozens of local field offices, even as it is changing its rules so that Social Security claimants who aren't able to confirm their identities online are obliged to appear in person. (Until now, people could confirm their identities over the phone.)\n\nWith new developments practically every day, it's hard to keep up with everything relating to entitlement programs. The key thing to remember is that there are two distinct but related stories unfolding. One is the ongoing campaign by Musk and DOGE to chip away at the Social Security Administration and other government departments. The other story, which has received much less media coverage, is playing out on Capitol Hill, where Republicans are looking for spending cuts to finance an extension of the feed-the-rich tax cuts they passed during the first Trump Administration. All the indications are that they are preparing to target entitlement programs that serve the poor, particularly Medicaid and food assistance.\n\nThe two stories intersect because any permanent savings that Musk and his colleagues would make could be applied to future budgets. Also, if DOGE did uncover genuine fraud and waste on a large scale, Republicans on Capitol Hill could conceivably exploit this to build public support for their own cuts. So far, however, the DOGE investigators have come up largely empty-handed, while the sight of the world's richest man leading an assault on programs that serve some of the poorest and most vulnerable Americans has alarmed even some elected Republicans. \"It doesn't help the President,\" Senator Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, said last week, referring to Musk's role. She also registered concerns about the closure of Social Security field offices and the elimination of employees who answer call lines, warning, \"I can tell you it's not going to go over well.\"\n\nMeanwhile, economists and other number crunchers are analyzing the budget resolution that House Republicans passed late last month, which Trump endorsed, saying it \"implements my FULL America First Agenda.\" To make space for four and a half trillion dollars in tax cuts over ten years, the resolution instructs various House committees to find nearly two trillion dollars in cuts to programs that come under their purview. This figure includes eight hundred and eighty billion dollars from the Energy and Commerce Committee, which oversees Medicare and Medicaid, and two hundred and thirty billion dollars from the Agriculture Committee, which manages the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program ( SNAP ), formerly known as the Food Stamp Program. Another five hundred billion dollars in cuts were left unspecified.\n\nSome Republicans have denied that they are singling out Medicaid and SNAP for big cuts, but simple arithmetic undermines this claim. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, Medicare and Medicaid make up more than ninety-seven per cent of the spending that the Energy and Commerce Committee oversees. Cutting Medicare, which is partly funded by payroll contributions from working Americans, is politically contentious. But, \"if you don't touch Medicare, the math doesn't work without deep cuts to Medicaid,\" the Democrats on the House Budget Committee noted . In theory, the Agriculture Committee has a bit more leeway to cut other programs aside from SNAP , but, in practice, the food-assistance program appears to be its main mark.\n\nMedicaid, which was created in 1965 alongside Medicare, is administered by the states, but the federal government bears about seventy per cent of its cost. Once a relatively small program for the aged and impoverished, it is now a pivotal component of the nation's over-all safety net. Under the Affordable Care Act of 2010, it was expanded to make it accessible to Americans of all ages with income of up to a hundred and thirty-eight per cent of the poverty line. By October of last year, enrollment in Medicaid had risen to about 72.1 million, which means that about one in five Americans depend on the program.\n\nAt the local level, nineteen states with Republican governors have chosen to participate in the Medicaid expansion. It's a great deal for the states: in this case, the federal government picks up ninety per cent of the cost. At the national level, however, the G.O.P. has remained committed to chopping back the program. In Project 2025 and other venues, Republican policy analysts and legislators have suggested multiple ways to do this, including imposing strict work requirements on enrollees, capping spending on a per-capita basis, and pushing more of the costs onto the states. Republicans have claimed that reforms of this kind wouldn't prevent eligible enrollees from receiving the health care they require. But this argument doesn't stand up to inspection.\n\n\"Some policies Republicans are considering will directly and immediately reduce the number of people who receive Medicaid, which is how the policies save money,\" Allison Orris and Elizabeth Zhang, of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, pointed out in an analysis published last week. \"Other policies will upend Medicaid financing and payment arrangements and may leave states with little choice but to cut eligibility, benefits, provider payments, or all three.\" The biggest losers would likely include deep-red states and their low-income populations. A recent report from the Urban Institute shows that if Congress removed the extra federal money provided to states in the Obamacare expansion, North Dakota, Indiana, and Louisiana would be among the hardest-hit places.\n\nAt the national level, a new analysis from the Budget Lab at Yale, a research organization that dissects federal policy proposals, gives a broad picture of who the winners and losers would be, on average, if Congress met the goals set out in the House budget resolution. For illustrative purposes, the researchers determined the impact of four policies \"consistent with the text\" of that resolution: an across-the-board, fifteen-per-cent cut in spending on Medicaid; a similar thirty-per-cent cut in spending on SNAP ; and the extension of various individual and business tax cuts that are scheduled to expire at the end of this year. In 2026, the researchers found, Americans in the bottom fifth of the income distribution would see their income (after taxes and government transfers) reduced by $1,125, or five per cent, whereas Americans in the top fifth of the income distribution would see their incomes rise by $6,220, or two and a half per cent. The poor would lose; the rich would gain. No great surprise there, perhaps, but it's yet another example of how hollow Trump's claims are that he's a protector of the social safety net.\n\nIn an era when the American population is aging (life expectancy is about nine years higher than it was fifty years ago) and medical costs are rising, seemingly inexorably, there is-and has been for decades-room for legitimate debate about how to reform and preserve entitlement programs. But that is not the exercise that Republicans and the White House are engaged in. If it were, they would be contemplating options like raising the income limit for contributions to Social Security and expanding the Biden Administration's efforts to control prescription-drug costs. Instead, they are ruling out revenue raising, rolling back some of Joe Biden's initiatives, and targeting for cuts programs aimed at assisting the poorest-all to make room for the preservation of their previous handout to corporate America and the wealthy. It is, through and through, an unedifying spectacle. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "How Much Power Does President Trump Have?\n\nTo many Americans, it is foundational that the power to make law lies exclusively with Congress and the power to interpret law ultimately rests with the Supreme Court. The most striking over-all message of Donald Trump 's executive orders, issued on the first day of his second term, is not merely in the register of controversial policies on immigration or the environment . It is, rather, a bold assertion that the President can go toe to toe with the other two branches of government to make and interpret law. The batch of executive orders does not read as bluster and hand-waving; it shows a level of competence, sophistication, and planning that was far less evident in Trump's first Administration.\n\nThe most eye-popping example concerns the Constitution and birthright citizenship. An executive order, titled \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\" declares that a baby born in the United States to a mother who is in the country unlawfully (or lawfully but temporarily) is not a citizen, unless the baby's father is a citizen or permanent resident at the time. The Fourteenth Amendment states, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\" Several years after the amendment's ratification, Congress, in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, categorically denied Chinese immigrants eligibility for citizenship. The case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark presented the Supreme Court with the question of whether a child born in the U.S. to Chinese parents who were barred from citizenship was nevertheless a citizen under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court said yes. We have long taken for granted that the Constitution provides for birthright citizenship without regard to the parents' citizenship status.\n\nTrump's executive order engages in his own constitutional interpretation that is arguably in conflict with the Court's. His order does not mention Wong Kim Ark, but it does accurately describe Dred Scott v. Sandford -the \"shameful decision\" in which the Court interpreted the Constitution to mean that a Black man could not be a citizen-as having been \"repudiated\" by the Fourteenth Amendment. That portrays the Court as an institution that has made historic mistakes on citizenship and need not be trusted as the sole authority on the meaning of the Constitution. Trump reasons that a person may be born in the U.S. but not be \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" and therefore not be a citizen. He asserts that children born to unlawful immigrants are such people and orders the executive branch not to issue or accept documents recognizing their citizenship. (The order applies only to children born at least thirty days after it was issued.)\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, Lawyers for Civil Rights, and nearly two dozen states immediately filed lawsuits asking several different federal courts to declare the executive order in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, citing Wong Kim Ark. In response, the President could claim that he is not directly contravening the Court, because the case acknowledged that there are some persons who are both born in the U.S. and not citizens-for example, a child born to foreign diplomats. Trump's executive order sets up the argument that a child born to unlawful immigrants or temporary visitors is in that category. Nevertheless, the executive order is pushing ahead of the Court with a bold constitutional interpretation. The Court could react by smacking down the President's audacity. Or it could accept its own diminished status and let the President's constitutional interpretation carry the day. There is some chance that the Court, which knows that its popularity and public trust are at historic lows, will fear that this President might contemplate disobeying a court's order to issue citizenship documents, and choose not to test him.\n\nTrump's executive order on TikTok takes on Congress. The platform is owned by ByteDance, which operates in China and must coöperate with Chinese intelligence and give the Chinese government access to private data. Congress deemed it a threat to national security, and passed a statute that prohibits U.S. companies, such as Apple, Google, and Oracle, from distributing, maintaining, or updating TikTok-effectively requiring that the social-media platform be shut down. In a constitutional challenge brought by TikTok and its users on free-speech grounds, the Supreme Court ruled last week that the statute does not violate the First Amendment, and the law went into effect the day before Trump's Inauguration . In his executive order, Trump instructed his Attorney General (likely the soon to be confirmed Pam Bondi) not to enforce Congress's statute for seventy-five days, creating time for TikTok's parent company to be sold to a U.S. company-or for Trump to pressure Congress to repeal or revise its statute.\n\n\"I have the unique constitutional responsibility for the national security of the United States, the conduct of foreign policy, and other vital executive functions,\" Trump wrote . Indeed, he complained that the statute going into effect the day before he took office \"interferes with my ability to negotiate a resolution to avoid an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform while addressing national security concerns.\" There is no doubt that the President has a unique role in national security, but the assertion that he has \" the unique constitutional responsibility\" for it is highly tendentious, especially in a context in which he is refusing to enforce a national-security law that was validly enacted by Congress and is in effect. His order goes so far as to say the Attorney General will \"issue a letter to each provider stating that there has been no violation of the statute and that there is no liability for any conduct\" during the relevant period. The realist point here is that, so long as a law will not be enforced and no liability will be imposed for violating it, it is functionally the same as if \"there has been no violation\" of the law-or even as if there is no law. If in seventy-five days Trump hasn't been able to bring about a successful resolution, he could extend the period for another few months or even indefinitely.\n\nThis raises the question of whether the President could practically suspend any congressional statutes that are not to his liking by announcing that he won't enforce them and assuring potential violators that they can go ahead because there will be no liability. The President has vast enforcement discretion, such that the effect of laws passed by Congress can depend entirely on executive-branch decisions. One constitutional responsibility that is unique to the President is his duty to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) was actually a policy to refrain from enforcing federal immigration statutes on deportation against undocumented immigrants who arrived as children. That provoked allegations that Obama violated the \"take care\" clause of the Constitution, because DACA meant that immigration law was not being \"faithfully executed.\" Similar charges could be levelled at Trump for baldly declaring that a congressional law won't be in force until he says it will. But again, it is unlikely that a court would find that his non-enforcement decision lies outside the President's authority, even if a person or entity had standing to sue to enforce the law.\n\nOne of Trump's executive orders refuses to enforce a binding federal regulation, in order to fulfill his promise to dismantle the administrative state . Last year, the Biden Administration concluded a formal rule-making process that resulted in a final rule designed to protect civil-service employees in the executive branch from at-will firing. Trump's executive order tells the director of the Office of Personnel Management to \"rescind all changes made\" by that rule to the extent that it impedes his Administration's goal of making employees fireable at will. The President does have the prerogative to rescind a final rule, but that is a legal process, laid out by Congress, that usually takes months, at a minimum. Trump wrote that in the meantime, several offending parts of the final rule \"shall be held inoperative and without effect.\" A rule that has not yet gone through the rescinding process is not actually \"inoperative and without effect,\" but, again, if the executive branch treats a rule that way under the President's orders, it demonstrates that the binding nature of a legal regulation depends on the President's decision to enforce or ignore it. This executive order goes even further and directs the executive branch to potentially violate a regulation by which it is currently bound. The National Treasury Employees Union immediately filed suit-claiming, among other things, that Trump's executive order exceeds the President's authority under the congressional statute that governs the hiring and firing of federal employees.\n\nTrump strongly asserts his authority as a legal interpreter in his executive order \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.\" The order announces that it is U.S. policy \"to recognize two sexes, male and female,\" and that they \"are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.\" So Trump instructs that, wherever the term \"sex\" appears in federal law, it means \"an individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female\" and \"is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of 'gender identity.' \" This means that the executive branch will not interpret laws and regulations that protect people from discrimination on the basis of sex as protecting them on the basis of transgender status.\n\nIn 2020, the Supreme Court in Bostock v. Clayton County held that transgender people are covered by Congress's employment statute, Title VII, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. That has led to litigation over the meaning of sex discrimination in other statutes and contexts in which transgender people seek legal protection. (The Court will decide this term whether a state ban on gender-affirming medical care for minors violates the Fourteenth Amendment.) Trump's executive order does not say that it is challenging Bostock. But it blasts the Biden Administration for arguing that Bostock \"requires gender identity-based access to single-sex spaces\" under Title IX, in which Congress conditioned schools' receipt of federal funding on their not engaging in sex discrimination. Trump's executive order says, \"Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology. Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.\" It declares that \" 'gender ideology' replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa.\" That means, for example, that, in administering Title IX, the Education Department could threaten a university with loss of federal funding if the university \"promotes\" the view that \"it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body.\" Universities will need to fret about what counts as \"promoting\" that view. Though Trump during his campaign vowed to eliminate the Education Department, his Administration is much more likely to deploy it.\n\nLike many words in statutes, the term \"sex\" is often left undefined, perhaps because at the time of passage legislators deemed what it meant self-evident. Until last summer, when the Supreme Court overruled its 1984 decision in Chevron v. N.R.D.C., that case required courts to defer to the executive branch's reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute. In that regime, it would have been highly likely for Trump's interpretations of statutes to prevail in court. Boosters of the administrative state lamented the end of Chevron, fearing that it signalled the systematic disempowerment of federal agencies. The silver lining of Chevron's demise is that Trump's interpretations of statutes during his second term will not get judicial deference-including when his interpretations are part of his attempt to dismantle the administrative state.\n\nCompetition among the three branches of government is perennial: it is part of the design of our system of separated powers. But the fact that all three branches are currently dominated by one party and may agree on important policy preferences may make that competition all the more visible. It puts into relief the structural fight over which one gets to make the decisions. With Trump's first array of executive orders, he gets in the ring with the other branches and throws the first punch. With a Republican-controlled Congress and a conservative Court, in which a third of the Justices were appointed by Trump, it is reasonable to wonder whether the President will lack for real rivals. But it is altogether possible that the other branches will take umbrage at assertions of his dominance and punch back. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Donald Trump's Ghostwriter Tells All\n\nLast June, as dusk fell outside Tony Schwartz's sprawling house, on a leafy back road in Riverdale, New York, he pulled out his laptop and caught up with the day's big news: Donald J. Trump had declared his candidacy for President. As Schwartz watched a video of the speech, he began to feel personally implicated.\n\nTrump, facing a crowd that had gathered in the lobby of Trump Tower, on Fifth Avenue, laid out his qualifications, saying, \"We need a leader that wrote 'The Art of the Deal.' \" If that was so, Schwartz thought, then he, not Trump, should be running. Schwartz dashed off a tweet: \"Many thanks Donald Trump for suggesting I run for President, based on the fact that I wrote 'The Art of the Deal.' \"\n\nSchwartz had ghostwritten Trump's 1987 breakthrough memoir, earning a joint byline on the cover, half of the book's five-hundred-thousand-dollar advance, and half of the royalties. The book was a phenomenal success, spending forty-eight weeks on the Times best-seller list, thirteen of them at No. 1. More than a million copies have been bought, generating several million dollars in royalties. The book expanded Trump's renown far beyond New York City, making him an emblem of the successful tycoon. Edward Kosner, the former editor and publisher of New York , where Schwartz worked as a writer at the time, says, \"Tony created Trump. He's Dr. Frankenstein.\"\n\nStarting in late 1985, Schwartz spent eighteen months with Trump-camping out in his office, joining him on his helicopter, tagging along at meetings, and spending weekends with him at his Manhattan apartment and his Florida estate. During that period, Schwartz felt, he had got to know him better than almost anyone else outside the Trump family. Until Schwartz posted the tweet, though, he had not spoken publicly about Trump for decades. It had never been his ambition to be a ghostwriter, and he had been glad to move on. But, as he watched a replay of the new candidate holding forth for forty-five minutes, he noticed something strange: over the decades, Trump appeared to have convinced himself that he had written the book. Schwartz recalls thinking, \"If he could lie about that on Day One-when it was so easily refuted-he is likely to lie about anything.\"\n\nIt seemed improbable that Trump's campaign would succeed, so Schwartz told himself that he needn't worry much. But, as Trump denounced Mexican immigrants as \"rapists,\" near the end of the speech, Schwartz felt anxious. He had spent hundreds of hours observing Trump firsthand, and felt that he had an unusually deep understanding of what he regarded as Trump's beguiling strengths and disqualifying weaknesses. Many Americans, however, saw Trump as a charmingly brash entrepreneur with an unfailing knack for business-a mythical image that Schwartz had helped create. \"It pays to trust your instincts,\" Trump says in the book, adding that he was set to make hundreds of millions of dollars after buying a hotel that he hadn't even walked through.\n\nIn the subsequent months, as Trump defied predictions by establishing himself as the front-runner for the Republican nomination, Schwartz's desire to set the record straight grew. He had long since left journalism to launch the Energy Project, a consulting firm that promises to improve employees' productivity by helping them boost their \"physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual\" morale. It was a successful company, with clients such as Facebook, and Schwartz's colleagues urged him to avoid the political fray. But the prospect of President Trump terrified him. It wasn't because of Trump's ideology-Schwartz doubted that he had one. The problem was Trump's personality, which he considered pathologically impulsive and self-centered.\n\nSchwartz thought about publishing an article describing his reservations about Trump, but he hesitated, knowing that, since he'd cashed in on the flattering \"Art of the Deal,\" his credibility and his motives would be seen as suspect. Yet watching the campaign was excruciating. Schwartz decided that if he kept mum and Trump was elected he'd never forgive himself. In June, he agreed to break his silence and give his first candid interview about the Trump he got to know while acting as his Boswell.\n\n\"I put lipstick on a pig,\" he said. \"I feel a deep sense of remorse that I contributed to presenting Trump in a way that brought him wider attention and made him more appealing than he is.\" He went on, \"I genuinely believe that if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes there is an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization.\"\n\nIf he were writing \"The Art of the Deal\" today, Schwartz said, it would be a very different book with a very different title. Asked what he would call it, he answered, \"The Sociopath.\"\n\nThe idea of Trump writing an autobiography didn't originate with either Trump or Schwartz. It began with Si Newhouse, the media magnate whose company, Advance Publications, owned Random House at the time, and continues to own Condé Nast, the parent company of this magazine. \"It was very definitely, and almost uniquely, Si Newhouse's idea,\" Peter Osnos, who edited the book, recalls. GQ , which Condé Nast also owns, had published a cover story on Trump, and Newhouse noticed that newsstand sales had been unusually strong.\n\nNewhouse called Trump about the project, then visited him to discuss it. Random House continued the pursuit with a series of meetings. At one point, Howard Kaminsky, who ran Random House then, wrapped a thick Russian novel in a dummy cover that featured a photograph of Trump looking like a conquering hero; at the top was Trump's name, in large gold block lettering. Kaminsky recalls that Trump was pleased by the mockup, but had one suggestion: \"Please make my name much bigger.\" After securing the half-million-dollar advance, Trump signed a contract.\n\nAround this time, Schwartz, who was one of the leading young magazine writers of the day, stopped by Trump's office, in Trump Tower. Schwartz had written about Trump before. In 1985, he'd published a piece in New York called \"A Different Kind of Donald Trump Story,\" which portrayed him not as a brilliant mogul but as a ham-fisted thug who had unsuccessfully tried to evict rent-controlled and rent-stabilized tenants from a building that he had bought on Central Park South. Trump's efforts-which included a plan to house homeless people in the building in order to harass the tenants-became what Schwartz described as a \"fugue of failure, a farce of fumbling and bumbling.\" An accompanying cover portrait depicted Trump as unshaven, unpleasant-looking, and shiny with sweat. Yet, to Schwartz's amazement, Trump loved the article. He hung the cover on a wall of his office, and sent a fan note to Schwartz, on his gold-embossed personal stationery. \"Everybody seems to have read it,\" Trump enthused in the note, which Schwartz has kept.\n\n\"I was shocked,\" Schwartz told me. \"Trump didn't fit any model of human being I'd ever met. He was obsessed with publicity, and he didn't care what you wrote.\" He went on, \"Trump only takes two positions. Either you're a scummy loser, liar, whatever, or you're the greatest. I became the greatest. He wanted to be seen as a tough guy, and he loved being on the cover.\" Schwartz wrote him back, saying, \"Of all the people I've written about over the years, you are certainly the best sport.\"\n\nAnd so Schwartz had returned for more, this time to conduct an interview for Playboy . But to his frustration Trump kept making cryptic, monosyllabic statements. \"He mysteriously wouldn't answer my questions,\" Schwartz said. After twenty minutes, he said, Trump explained that he didn't want to reveal anything new about himself-he had just signed a lucrative book deal and needed to save his best material.\n\n\"What kind of book?\" Schwartz said.\n\n\"My autobiography,\" Trump replied.\n\n\"You're only thirty-eight-you don't have one yet!\" Schwartz joked.\n\n\"Yeah, I know,\" Trump said.\n\n\"If I were you,\" Schwartz recalls telling him, \"I'd write a book called 'The Art of the Deal.' That's something people would be interested in.\"\n\n\"You're right,\" Trump agreed. \"Do you want to write it?\"\n\nSchwartz thought it over for several weeks. He knew that he would be making a Faustian bargain. A lifelong liberal, he was hardly an admirer of Trump's ruthless and single-minded pursuit of profit. \"It was one of a number of times in my life when I was divided between the Devil and the higher side,\" he told me. He had grown up in a bourgeois, intellectual family in Manhattan, and had attended élite private schools, but he was not as wealthy as some of his classmates-and, unlike many of them, he had no trust fund. \"I grew up privileged,\" he said. \"But my parents made it clear: 'You're on your own.' \" Around the time Trump made his offer, Schwartz's wife, Deborah Pines, became pregnant with their second daughter, and he worried that the family wouldn't fit into their Manhattan apartment, whose mortgage was already too high. \"I was overly worried about money,\" Schwartz said. \"I thought money would keep me safe and secure-or that was my rationalization.\" At the same time, he knew that if he took Trump's money and adopted Trump's voice his journalism career would be badly damaged. His heroes were such literary nonfiction writers as Tom Wolfe, John McPhee, and David Halberstam. Being a ghostwriter was hackwork. In the end, though, Schwartz had his price. He told Trump that if he would give him half the advance and half the book's royalties he'd take the job.\n\nSuch terms are unusually generous for a ghostwriter. Trump, despite having a reputation as a tough negotiator, agreed on the spot. \"It was a huge windfall,\" Schwartz recalls. \"But I knew I was selling out. Literally, the term was invented to describe what I did.\" Soon Spy was calling him \"former journalist Tony Schwartz.\"\n\nSchwartz thought that \"The Art of the Deal\" would be an easy project. The book's structure would be simple: he'd chronicle half a dozen or so of Trump's biggest real-estate deals, dispense some bromides about how to succeed in business, and fill in Trump's life story. For research, he planned to interview Trump on a series of Saturday mornings. The first session didn't go as planned, however. After Trump gave him a tour of his marble-and-gilt apartment atop Trump Tower-which, to Schwartz, looked unlived-in, like the lobby of a hotel-they began to talk. But the discussion was soon hobbled by what Schwartz regards as one of Trump's most essential characteristics: \"He has no attention span.\"\n\nIn those days, Schwartz recalls, Trump was generally affable with reporters, offering short, amusingly immodest quotes on demand. Trump had been forthcoming with him during the New York interview, but it hadn't required much time or deep reflection. For the book, though, Trump needed to provide him with sustained, thoughtful recollections. He asked Trump to describe his childhood in detail. After sitting for only a few minutes in his suit and tie, Trump became impatient and irritable. He looked fidgety, Schwartz recalls, \"like a kindergartner who can't sit still in a classroom.\" Even when Schwartz pressed him, Trump seemed to remember almost nothing of his youth, and made it clear that he was bored. Far more quickly than Schwartz had expected, Trump ended the meeting.\n\nWeek after week, the pattern repeated itself. Schwartz tried to limit the sessions to smaller increments of time, but Trump's contributions remained oddly truncated and superficial.\n\n\"Trump has been written about a thousand ways from Sunday, but this fundamental aspect of who he is doesn't seem to be fully understood,\" Schwartz told me. \"It's implicit in a lot of what people write, but it's never explicit-or, at least, I haven't seen it. And that is that it's impossible to keep him focussed on any topic, other than his own self-aggrandizement, for more than a few minutes, and even then . . . \" Schwartz trailed off, shaking his head in amazement. He regards Trump's inability to concentrate as alarming in a Presidential candidate. \"If he had to be briefed on a crisis in the Situation Room, it's impossible to imagine him paying attention over a long period of time,\" he said.\n\nIn a recent phone interview, Trump told me that, to the contrary, he has the skill that matters most in a crisis: the ability to forge compromises. The reason he touted \"The Art of the Deal\" in his announcement, he explained, was that he believes that recent Presidents have lacked his toughness and finesse: \"Look at the trade deficit with China. Look at the Iran deal. I've made a fortune by making deals. I do that. I do that well. That's what I do.\"\n\nBut Schwartz believes that Trump's short attention span has left him with \"a stunning level of superficial knowledge and plain ignorance.\" He said, \"That's why he so prefers TV as his first news source-information comes in easily digestible sound bites.\" He added, \"I seriously doubt that Trump has ever read a book straight through in his adult life.\" During the eighteen months that he observed Trump, Schwartz said, he never saw a book on Trump's desk, or elsewhere in his office, or in his apartment.\n\nOther journalists have noticed Trump's apparent lack of interest in reading. In May, Megyn Kelly, of Fox News, asked him to name his favorite book, other than the Bible or \"The Art of the Deal.\" Trump picked the 1929 novel \"All Quiet on the Western Front.\" Evidently suspecting that many years had elapsed since he'd read it, Kelly asked Trump to talk about the most recent book he'd read. \"I read passages, I read areas, I'll read chapters-I don't have the time,\" Trump said. As The New Republic noted recently, this attitude is not shared by most U.S. Presidents, including Barack Obama, a habitual consumer of current books, and George W. Bush, who reportedly engaged in a fiercely competitive book-reading contest with his political adviser Karl Rove.\n\nTrump's first wife, Ivana, famously claimed that Trump kept a copy of Adolf Hitler's collected speeches, \"My New Order,\" in a cabinet beside his bed. In 1990, Trump's friend Marty Davis, who was then an executive at Paramount, added credence to this story, telling Marie Brenner, of Vanity Fair , that he had given Trump the book. \"I thought he would find it interesting,\" Davis told her. When Brenner asked Trump about it, however, he mistakenly identified the volume as a different work by Hitler: \"Mein Kampf.\" Apparently, he had not so much as read the title. \" If I had these speeches, and I am not saying that I do, I would never read them,\" Trump told Brenner.\n\nGrowing desperate, Schwartz devised a strategy for trapping Trump into giving more material. He made plans to spend the weekend with Trump at Mar-a-Lago, his mansion in Palm Beach, where there would be fewer distractions. As they chatted in the garden, Ivana icily walked by, clearly annoyed that Schwartz was competing for her husband's limited free time. Trump again grew impatient. Long before lunch on Saturday, Schwartz recalls, Trump \"essentially threw a fit.\" He stood up and announced that he couldn't stand any more questions.\n\nSchwartz went to his room, called his literary agent, Kathy Robbins, and told her that he couldn't do the book. (Robbins confirms this.) As Schwartz headed back to New York, though, he came up with another plan. He would propose eavesdropping on Trump's life by following him around on the job and, more important, by listening in on his office phone calls. That way, extracting extended reflections from Trump would not be required. When Schwartz presented the idea to Trump, he loved it. Almost every day from then on, Schwartz sat about eight feet away from him in the Trump Tower office, listening on an extension of Trump's phone line. Schwartz says that none of the bankers, lawyers, brokers, and reporters who called Trump realized that they were being monitored. The calls usually didn't last long, and Trump's assistant facilitated the conversation-hopping. While he was talking with someone, she often came in with a Post-it note informing him of the next caller on hold.\n\n\"He was playing people,\" Schwartz recalls. On the phone with business associates, Trump would flatter, bully, and occasionally get mad, but always in a calculated way. Before the discussion ended, Trump would \"share the news of his latest success,\" Schwartz says. Instead of saying goodbye at the end of a call, Trump customarily signed off with \"You're the greatest!\" There was not a single call that Trump deemed too private for Schwartz to hear. \"He loved the attention,\" Schwartz recalls. \"If he could have had three hundred thousand people listening in, he would have been even happier.\"\n\nThis year, Schwartz has heard some argue that there must be a more thoughtful and nuanced version of Donald Trump that he is keeping in reserve for after the campaign. \"There isn't,\" Schwartz insists. \"There is no private Trump.\" This is not a matter of hindsight. While working on \"The Art of the Deal,\" Schwartz kept a journal in which he expressed his amazement at Trump's personality, writing that Trump seemed driven entirely by a need for public attention. \"All he is is 'stomp, stomp, stomp'-recognition from outside, bigger, more, a whole series of things that go nowhere in particular,\" he observed, on October 21, 1986. But, as he noted in the journal a few days later, \"the book will be far more successful if Trump is a sympathetic character-even weirdly sympathetic-than if he is just hateful or, worse yet, a one-dimensional blowhard.\"\n\nEavesdropping solved the interview problem, but it presented a new one. After hearing Trump's discussions about business on the phone, Schwartz asked him brief follow-up questions. He then tried to amplify the material he got from Trump by calling others involved in the deals. But their accounts often directly conflicted with Trump's. \"Lying is second nature to him,\" Schwartz said. \"More than anyone else I have ever met, Trump has the ability to convince himself that whatever he is saying at any given moment is true, or sort of true, or at least ought to be true.\" Often, Schwartz said, the lies that Trump told him were about money-\"how much he had paid for something, or what a building he owned was worth, or how much one of his casinos was earning when it was actually on its way to bankruptcy.\" Trump bragged that he paid only eight million dollars for Mar-a-Lago, but omitted that he bought a nearby strip of beach for a record sum. After gossip columns reported, erroneously, that Prince Charles was considering buying several apartments in Trump Tower, Trump implied that he had no idea where the rumor had started. (\"It certainly didn't hurt us,\" he says, in \"The Art of the Deal.\") Wayne Barrett, a reporter for the Village Voice , later revealed that Trump himself had planted the story with journalists. Schwartz also suspected that Trump engaged in such media tricks, and asked him about a story making the rounds-that Trump often called up news outlets using a pseudonym. Trump didn't deny it. As Schwartz recalls, he smirked and said, \"You like that, do you?\"\n\nSchwartz says of Trump, \"He lied strategically. He had a complete lack of conscience about it.\" Since most people are \"constrained by the truth,\" Trump's indifference to it \"gave him a strange advantage.\"\n\nWhen challenged about the facts, Schwartz says, Trump would often double down, repeat himself, and grow belligerent. This quality was recently on display after Trump posted on Twitter a derogatory image of Hillary Clinton that contained a six-pointed star lifted from a white-supremacist Web site. Campaign staffers took the image down, but two days later Trump angrily defended it, insisting that there was no anti-Semitic implication. Whenever \"the thin veneer of Trump's vanity is challenged,\" Schwartz says, he overreacts-not an ideal quality in a head of state.\n\nLink copied\n\nWhen Schwartz began writing \"The Art of the Deal,\" he realized that he needed to put an acceptable face on Trump's loose relationship with the truth. So he concocted an artful euphemism. Writing in Trump's voice, he explained to the reader, \"I play to people's fantasies. . . . People want to believe that something is the biggest and the greatest and the most spectacular. I call it truthful hyperbole. It's an innocent form of exaggeration-and it's a very effective form of promotion.\" Schwartz now disavows the passage. \"Deceit,\" he told me, is never \"innocent.\" He added, \" 'Truthful hyperbole' is a contradiction in terms. It's a way of saying, 'It's a lie, but who cares?' \" Trump, he said, loved the phrase.\n\nIn his journal, Schwartz describes the process of trying to make Trump's voice palatable in the book. It was kind of \"a trick,\" he writes, to mimic Trump's blunt, staccato, no-apologies delivery while making him seem almost boyishly appealing. One strategy was to make it appear that Trump was just having fun at the office. \"I try not to take any of what's happened too seriously,\" Trump says in the book. \"The real excitement is playing the game.\"\n\nIn his journal, Schwartz wrote, \"Trump stands for many of the things I abhor: his willingness to run over people, the gaudy, tacky, gigantic obsessions, the absolute lack of interest in anything beyond power and money.\" Looking back at the text now, Schwartz says, \"I created a character far more winning than Trump actually is.\" The first line of the book is an example. \"I don't do it for the money,\" Trump declares. \"I've got enough, much more than I'll ever need. I do it to do it. Deals are my art form. Other people paint beautifully on canvas or write wonderful poetry. I like making deals, preferably big deals. That's how I get my kicks.\" Schwartz now laughs at this depiction of Trump as a devoted artisan. \" Of course he's in it for the money,\" he said. \"One of the most deep and basic needs he has is to prove that 'I'm richer than you.' \" As for the idea that making deals is a form of poetry, Schwartz says, \"He was incapable of saying something like that-it wouldn't even be in his vocabulary.\" He saw Trump as driven not by a pure love of dealmaking but by an insatiable hunger for \"money, praise, and celebrity.\" Often, after spending the day with Trump, and watching him pile one hugely expensive project atop the next, like a circus performer spinning plates, Schwartz would go home and tell his wife, \"He's a living black hole!\"\n\nSchwartz reminded himself that he was being paid to tell Trump's story, not his own, but the more he worked on the project the more disturbing he found it. In his journal, he describes the hours he spent with Trump as \"draining\" and \"deadening.\" Schwartz told me that Trump's need for attention is \"completely compulsive,\" and that his bid for the Presidency is part of a continuum. \"He's managed to keep increasing the dose for forty years,\" Schwartz said. After he'd spent decades as a tabloid titan, \"the only thing left was running for President. If he could run for emperor of the world, he would.\"\n\nRhetorically, Schwartz's aim in \"The Art of the Deal\" was to present Trump as the hero of every chapter, but, after looking into some of his supposedly brilliant deals, Schwartz concluded that there were cases in which there was no way to make Trump look good. So he sidestepped unflattering incidents and details. \"I didn't consider it my job to investigate,\" he says.\n\nSchwartz also tried to avoid the strong whiff of cronyism that hovered over some deals. In his 1986 journal, he describes what a challenge it was to \"put his best foot forward\" in writing about one of Trump's first triumphs: his development, starting in 1975, of the Grand Hyatt Hotel, on the site of the former Commodore Hotel, next to Grand Central Terminal. In order to afford the hotel, Trump required an extremely large tax abatement. Richard Ravitch, who was then in charge of the agency that had the authority to grant such tax breaks to developers, recalls that he declined to grant the abatement, and Trump got \"so unpleasant I had to tell him to get out.\" Trump got it anyway, largely because key city officials had received years of donations from his father, Fred Trump, who was a major real-estate developer in Queens. Wayne Barrett, whose reporting for the Voice informed his definitive 1991 book, \"Trump: The Deals and the Downfall,\" says, \"It was all Fred's political connections that created the abatement.\" In addition, Trump snookered rivals into believing that he had an exclusive option from the city on the project, when he didn't. Trump also deceived his partner in the deal, Jay Pritzker, the head of the Hyatt Hotel chain. Pritzker had rejected an unfavorable term proposed by Trump, but at the closing Trump forced it through, knowing that Pritzker was on a mountain in Nepal and could not be reached. Schwartz wrote in his journal that \"almost everything\" about the hotel deal had \"an immoral cast.\" But as the ghostwriter he was \"trying hard to find my way around\" behavior that he considered \"if not reprehensible, at least morally questionable.\"\n\nMany tall tales that Trump told Schwartz contained a kernel of truth but made him out to be cleverer than he was. One of Trump's favorite stories was about how he had tricked the company that owned Holiday Inn into becoming his partner in an Atlantic City casino. Trump claimed that he had quieted executives' fears of construction delays by ordering his construction supervisor to make a vacant lot that he owned look like \"the most active construction site in the history of the world.\" As Trump tells it in \"The Art of the Deal,\" there were so many dump trucks and bulldozers pushing around dirt and filling holes that had just been dug that when Holiday Inn executives visited the site it \"looked as if we were in the midst of building the Grand Coulee Dam.\" The stunt, Trump claimed, pushed the deal through. After the book came out, though, a consultant for Trump's casinos, Al Glasgow, who is now deceased, told Schwartz, \"It never happened.\" There may have been one or two trucks, but not the fleet that made it a great story.\n\nSchwartz tamped down some of Trump's swagger, but plenty of it remained. The manuscript that Random House published was, depending on your perspective, either entertainingly insightful or shamelessly self-aggrandizing. To borrow a title from Norman Mailer, who frequently attended prizefights at Trump's Atlantic City hotels, the book could have been called \"Advertisements for Myself.\"\n\nIn 2005, Timothy L. O'Brien, an award-winning journalist who is currently the executive editor of Bloomberg View, published \"Trump Nation,\" a meticulous investigative biography. (Trump unsuccessfully sued him for libel.) O'Brien has taken a close look at \"The Art of the Deal,\" and he told me that it might be best characterized as a \"nonfiction work of fiction.\" Trump's life story, as told by Schwartz, honestly chronicled a few setbacks, such as Trump's disastrous 1983 purchase of the New Jersey Generals, a football team in the flailing United States Football League. But O'Brien believes that Trump used the book to turn almost every step of his life, both personal and professional, into a \"glittering fable.\"\n\nSome of the falsehoods in \"The Art of the Deal\" are minor. Spy upended Trump's claims that Ivana had been a \"top model\" and an alternate on the Czech Olympic ski team. Barrett notes that in \"The Art of the Deal\" Trump describes his father as having been born in New Jersey to Swedish parents; in fact, he was born in the Bronx to German parents. (Decades later, Trump spread falsehoods about Obama's origins, claiming it was possible that the President was born in Africa.)\n\nIn \"The Art of the Deal,\" Trump portrays himself as a warm family man with endless admirers. He praises Ivana's taste and business skill-\"I said you can't bet against Ivana, and she proved me right.\" But Schwartz noticed little warmth or communication between Trump and Ivana, and he later learned that while \"The Art of the Deal\" was being written Trump began an affair with Marla Maples, who became his second wife. (He divorced Ivana in 1992.) As far as Schwartz could tell, Trump spent very little time with his family and had no close friends. In \"The Art of the Deal,\" Trump describes Roy Cohn, his personal lawyer, in the warmest terms, calling him \"the sort of guy who'd be there at your hospital bed . . . literally standing by you to the death.\" Cohn, who in the fifties assisted Senator Joseph McCarthy in his vicious crusade against Communism, was closeted. He felt abandoned by Trump when he became fatally ill from AIDS , and said, \"Donald pisses ice water.\" Schwartz says of Trump, \"He'd like people when they were helpful, and turn on them when they weren't. It wasn't personal. He's a transactional man-it was all about what you could do for him.\"\n\nAccording to Barrett, among the most misleading aspects of \"The Art of the Deal\" was the idea that Trump made it largely on his own, with only minimal help from his father, Fred. Barrett, in his book, notes that Trump once declared, \"The working man likes me because he knows I didn't inherit what I've built,\" and that in \"The Art of the Deal\" he derides wealthy heirs as members of \"the Lucky Sperm Club.\"\n\nTrump's self-portrayal as a Horatio Alger figure has buttressed his populist appeal in 2016. But his origins were hardly humble. Fred's fortune, based on his ownership of middle-income properties, wasn't glamorous, but it was sizable: in 2003, a few years after Fred died, Trump and his siblings reportedly sold some of their father's real-estate holdings for half a billion dollars. In \"The Art of the Deal,\" Trump cites his father as \"the most important influence on me,\" but in his telling his father's main legacy was teaching him the importance of \"toughness.\" Beyond that, Schwartz says, Trump \"barely talked about his father-he didn't want his success to be seen as having anything to do with him.\" But when Barrett investigated he found that Trump's father was instrumental in his son's rise, financially and politically. In the book, Trump says that \"my energy and my enthusiasm\" explain how, as a twenty-nine-year-old with few accomplishments, he acquired the Grand Hyatt Hotel. Barrett reports, however, that Trump's father had to co-sign the many contracts that the deal required. He also lent Trump seven and a half million dollars to get started as a casino owner in Atlantic City; at one point, when Trump couldn't meet payments on other loans, his father tried to tide him over by sending a lawyer to buy some three million dollars' worth of gambling chips. Barrett told me, \"Donald did make some smart moves himself, particularly in assembling the site for the Trump Tower. That was a stroke of genius.\" Nonetheless, he said, \"The notion that he's a self-made man is a joke. But I guess they couldn't call the book 'The Art of My Father's Deals.' \"\n\nThe other key myth perpetuated by \"The Art of the Deal\" was that Trump's intuitions about business were almost flawless. \"The book helped fuel the notion that he couldn't fail,\" Barrett said. But, unbeknown to Schwartz and the public, by late 1987, when the book came out, Trump was heading toward what Barrett calls \"simultaneous personal and professional self-destruction.\" O'Brien agrees that during the next several years Trump's life unravelled. The divorce from Ivana reportedly cost him twenty-five million dollars. Meanwhile, he was in the midst of what O'Brien calls \"a crazy shopping spree that resulted in unmanageable debt.\" He was buying the Plaza Hotel and also planning to erect \"the tallest building in the world,\" on the former rail yards that he had bought on the West Side. In 1987, the city denied him permission to construct such a tall skyscraper, but in \"The Art of the Deal\" he brushed off this failure with a one-liner: \"I can afford to wait.\" O'Brien says, \"The reality is that he couldn't afford to wait. He was telling the media that the carrying costs were three million dollars, when in fact they were more like twenty million.\" Trump was also building a third casino in Atlantic City, the Taj, which he promised would be \"the biggest casino in history.\" He bought the Eastern Air Lines shuttle that operated out of New York, Boston, and Washington, rechristening it the Trump Shuttle, and acquired a giant yacht, the Trump Princess. \"He was on a total run of complete and utter self-absorption,\" Barrett says, adding, \"It's kind of like now.\"\n\nSchwartz said that when he was writing the book \"the greatest percentage of Trump's assets was in casinos, and he made it sound like each casino was more successful than the last. But every one of them was failing.\" He went on, \"I think he was just spinning. I don't think he could have believed it at the time. He was losing millions of dollars a day. He had to have been terrified.\"\n\nIn 1992, the journalist David Cay Johnston published a book about casinos, \"Temples of Chance,\" and cited a net-worth statement from 1990 that assessed Trump's personal wealth. It showed that Trump owed nearly three hundred million dollars more to his creditors than his assets were worth. The next year, his company was forced into bankruptcy-the first of six such instances. The Trump meteor had crashed.\n\nBut in \"The Art of the Deal,\" O'Brien told me, \"Trump shrewdly and unabashedly promoted an image of himself as a dealmaker nonpareil who could always get the best out of every situation-and who can now deliver America from its malaise.\" This idealized version was presented to an exponentially larger audience, O'Brien noted, when Mark Burnett, the reality-television producer, read \"The Art of the Deal\" and decided to base a new show on it, \"The Apprentice,\" with Trump as the star. The first season of the show, which premièred in 2004, opens with Trump in the back of a limousine, boasting, \"I've mastered the art of the deal, and I've turned the name Trump into the highest-quality brand.\" An image of the book's cover flashes onscreen as Trump explains that, as the \"master,\" he is now seeking an apprentice. O'Brien said, \" 'The Apprentice' is mythmaking on steroids. There's a straight line from the book to the show to the 2016 campaign.\"\n\nIt took Schwartz a little more than a year to write \"The Art of the Deal.\" In the spring of 1987, he sent the manuscript to Trump, who returned it to him shortly afterward. There were a few red marks made with a fat-tipped Magic Marker, most of which deleted criticisms that Trump had made of powerful individuals he no longer wanted to offend, such as Lee Iacocca. Otherwise, Schwartz says, Trump changed almost nothing.\n\nIn my phone interview with Trump, he initially said of Schwartz, \"Tony was very good. He was the co-author.\" But he dismissed Schwartz's account of the writing process. \"He didn't write the book,\" Trump told me. \" I wrote the book. I wrote the book. It was my book. And it was a No. 1 best-seller, and one of the best-selling business books of all time. Some say it was the best-selling business book ever.\" (It is not.) Howard Kaminsky, the former Random House head, laughed and said, \"Trump didn't write a postcard for us!\"\n\nTrump was far more involved in the book's promotion. He wooed booksellers and made one television appearance after another. He publicly promised to donate his cut of the book's royalties to charity. He even made a surprise trip to New Hampshire, where he stirred additional publicity by floating the possibility that he might run for President.\n\nIn December of 1987, a month after the book was published, Trump hosted an extravagant book party in the pink marble atrium of Trump Tower. Klieg lights lit a red carpet outside the building. Inside, nearly a thousand guests, in black tie, were served champagne and fed slices of a giant cake replica of Trump Tower, which was wheeled in by a parade of women waving red sparklers. The boxing promoter Don King greeted the crowd in a floor-length mink coat, and the comedian Jackie Mason introduced Donald and Ivana with the words \"Here comes the king and queen!\" Trump toasted Schwartz, saying teasingly that he had at least tried to teach him how to make money.\n\nSchwartz got more of an education the next day, when he and Trump spoke on the phone. After chatting briefly about the party, Trump informed Schwartz that, as his ghostwriter, he owed him for half the event's cost, which was in the six figures. Schwartz was dumbfounded. \"He wanted me to split the cost of entertaining his list of nine hundred second-rate celebrities?\" Schwartz had, in fact, learned a few things from watching Trump. He drastically negotiated down the amount that he agreed to pay, to a few thousand dollars, and then wrote Trump a letter promising to write a check not to Trump but to a charity of Schwartz's choosing. It was a page out of Trump's playbook. In the past seven years, Trump has promised to give millions of dollars to charity, but reporters for the Washington Post found that they could document only ten thousand dollars in donations-and they uncovered no direct evidence that Trump made charitable contributions from money earned by \"The Art of the Deal.\"\n\nNot long after the discussion of the party bills, Trump approached Schwartz about writing a sequel, for which Trump had been offered a seven-figure advance. This time, however, he offered Schwartz only a third of the profits. He pointed out that, because the advance was much bigger, the payout would be, too. But Schwartz said no. Feeling deeply alienated, he instead wrote a book called \"What Really Matters,\" about the search for meaning in life. After working with Trump, Schwartz writes, he felt a \"gnawing emptiness\" and became a \"seeker,\" longing to \"be connected to something timeless and essential, more real.\"\n\nSchwartz told me that he has decided to pledge all royalties from sales of \"The Art of the Deal\" in 2016 to pointedly chosen charities: the National Immigration Law Center, Human Rights Watch, the Center for the Victims of Torture, the National Immigration Forum, and the Tahirih Justice Center. He doesn't feel that the gesture absolves him. \"I'll carry this until the end of my life,\" he said. \"There's no righting it. But I like the idea that, the more copies that 'The Art of the Deal' sells, the more money I can donate to the people whose rights Trump seeks to abridge.\"\n\nSchwartz expected Trump to attack him for speaking out, and he was correct. Informed that Schwartz had made critical remarks about him, and wouldn't be voting for him, Trump said, \"He's probably just doing it for the publicity.\" He also said, \"Wow. That's great disloyalty, because I made Tony rich. He owes a lot to me. I helped him when he didn't have two cents in his pocket. It's great disloyalty. I guess he thinks it's good for him-but he'll find out it's not good for him.\"\n\nMinutes after Trump got off the phone with me, Schwartz's cell phone rang. \"I hear you're not voting for me,\" Trump said. \"I just talked to The New Yorker -which, by the way, is a failing magazine that no one reads-and I heard you were critical of me.\"\n\n\"You're running for President,\" Schwartz said. \"I disagree with a lot of what you're saying.\"\n\n\"That's your right, but then you should have just remained silent. I just want to tell you that I think you're very disloyal. Without me, you wouldn't be where you are now. I had a lot of choice of who to have write the book, and I chose you, and I was very generous with you. I know that you gave a lot of speeches and lectures using 'The Art of the Deal.' I could have sued you, but I didn't.\"\n\n\"My business has nothing to do with 'The Art of the Deal.' \"\n\n\"That's not what I've been told.\"\n\n\"You're running for President of the United States. The stakes here are high.\"\n\n\"Yeah, they are,\" he said. \"Have a nice life.\" Trump hung up.\n\nSchwartz can understand why Trump feels stung, but he felt that he had to speak up before it was too late. As for Trump's anger toward him, he said, \"I don't take it personally, because the truth is he didn't mean it personally. People are dispensable and disposable in Trump's world.\" If Trump is elected President, he warned, \"the millions of people who voted for him and believe that he represents their interests will learn what anyone who deals closely with him already knows-that he couldn't care less about them.\" ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "Trump's Vivisection of the Department of Education\n\nThe President cannot legally shut down a government agency, but his Administration could make it essentially impossible for the D.O.E. to function.\n\nEarlier this month, the Trump Administration announced that it was laying off thirteen hundred employees of the U.S. Department of Education, in addition to the hundreds of workers who had already either lost their jobs or accepted buyout offers. Three areas of the D.O.E. in particular were disproportionately affected by the cuts: student aid, civil-rights complaints, and education research. Then, on Thursday, this slow-motion vivisection of a federal agency culminated in a symbolic death blow, when President Trump signed an executive order declaring the imminent closure of the D.O.E. Trump cannot legally shut down a government agency without an act of Congress, but, as seen in the recent decimation of the U.S. Agency for International Development, which had eighty-three per cent of its contracts and programs cancelled in February, his Administration could make it essentially impossible for the D.O.E. to function, at least for a time.\n\nIn a speech ahead of the signing, Trump lamented the D.O.E.'s \"breathtaking failures\"-above all, the nation's dismal reading and math scores. He nodded to the latest results, published in January, of the National Assessment of Educational Progress ( NAEP ), known as the \"nation's report card.\" It found that forty per cent of fourth graders and one-third of eighth graders lack basic reading skills for their age level; in math, a quarter of fourth graders and thirty-nine per cent of eighth graders haven't acquired basic skills. Given this bleak picture, Republican governors are eager, Trump said, \"to take their children back and really teach their children individually.\"\n\nThe Lede Reporting and commentary on what you need to know today.\n\nA hallmark of right-wing antipathy to the D.O.E., and to public education in general, is the notion that children and schools need to be \"taken back\" from their federal overlords. In fact, the D.O.E. does not decide what or how students are taught; it does not weigh in on whether a school should adhere to Common Core standards or how many books by Ibram X. Kendi should be found on its library shelves. One thing that does fall under the D.O.E.'s remit, however, is administering the tests and collecting the data for the annual NAEP report, under the aegis of the National Center for Education Statistics. As of the most recent cuts to the D.O.E., the statistics office has been reduced \"from roughly 100 employees to a skeletal staff of just three,\" according to reporting by Jill Barshay, of the Hechinger Report . If disembowelling a federal agency does somehow lead to higher reading and math scores, the federal workers who would have tracked this progress won't be around to tell us about it.\n\nTrump claimed in his speech that Title I funds to underserved schools, Pell Grants for low-income college students, and special-education funding will be \"preserved in full,\" and that allocating these funds would become the responsibility of other federal agencies. Speaking from the Oval Office on Friday, he explained that all student loans will be moved over to the Small Business Administration, and that Robert F. Kennedy, Jr., the Secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services, \"will be handling special needs\" (presumably referring to special education).   It's unclear how any of these education offices-which were never handsomely funded or staffed in the first place-can meet their statutory obligations with a tiny fraction of their previous workforce, regardless of where they are situated in the federal bureaucracy.\n\nNot knowing much about what he wants to destroy is something that Trump has in common with his Secretary of Education, Linda McMahon . Appearing on Fox News earlier this month, McMahon showed unfamiliarity with the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, or I.D.E.A., which requires that public schools provide appropriate services to children with disabilities, oversees how federal special-education funds are spent, and allows parents to be involved in developing their children's education plans. \"I'm not sure I can tell you exactly what it stands for,\" McMahon said, of I.D.E.A., \"except that it's the programs for disabled and needs.\" She added that it was only her fifth day on the job.\n\nMore seasoned education experts are worried that both Title I and I.D.E.A. funding will be rolled into block grants, which states can administer with little federal oversight. An earlier executive order, which the President issued in January, directed Cabinet agencies to review how states can use federal funds to \"support families who choose educational alternatives to governmental entities, including private and faith-based options.\" This is a barely veiled endorsement of K-12 voucher programs , which are already draining the budgets of seventeen states, and which reroute public money to private schools-where, for the most part, the rights guaranteed under I.D.E.A. don't apply.\n\nTo set the stage for Trump's speech on Thursday, in the East Room of the White House, a group of children sat at school desks that had been arranged in a half-moon facing the audience, with an empty Presidential podium at the center. In the minutes before the President arrived, the students sat patiently, some of them looking out at the assembled crowd with nervous smiles. When Trump showed up, he scarcely interacted with the kids, and, in his address, he offered no indication of who they were or why they'd been chosen to share the stage with him. Perhaps they were recruited from Trump's central casting of the mind.

      "text": "How Much Power Does President Trump Have?\n\nTo many Americans, it is foundational that the power to make law lies exclusively with Congress and the power to interpret law ultimately rests with the Supreme Court. The most striking over-all message of Donald Trump 's executive orders, issued on the first day of his second term, is not merely in the register of controversial policies on immigration or the environment . It is, rather, a bold assertion that the President can go toe to toe with the other two branches of government to make and interpret law. The batch of executive orders does not read as bluster and hand-waving; it shows a level of competence, sophistication, and planning that was far less evident in Trump's first Administration.\n\nThe most eye-popping example concerns the Constitution and birthright citizenship. An executive order, titled \"Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,\" declares that a baby born in the United States to a mother who is in the country unlawfully (or lawfully but temporarily) is not a citizen, unless the baby's father is a citizen or permanent resident at the time. The Fourteenth Amendment states, \"All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States.\" Several years after the amendment's ratification, Congress, in the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, categorically denied Chinese immigrants eligibility for citizenship. The case of United States v. Wong Kim Ark presented the Supreme Court with the question of whether a child born in the U.S. to Chinese parents who were barred from citizenship was nevertheless a citizen under the Fourteenth Amendment. The Court said yes. We have long taken for granted that the Constitution provides for birthright citizenship without regard to the parents' citizenship status.\n\nTrump's executive order engages in his own constitutional interpretation that is arguably in conflict with the Court's. His order does not mention Wong Kim Ark, but it does accurately describe Dred Scott v. Sandford -the \"shameful decision\" in which the Court interpreted the Constitution to mean that a Black man could not be a citizen-as having been \"repudiated\" by the Fourteenth Amendment. That portrays the Court as an institution that has made historic mistakes on citizenship and need not be trusted as the sole authority on the meaning of the Constitution. Trump reasons that a person may be born in the U.S. but not be \"subject to the jurisdiction thereof\" and therefore not be a citizen. He asserts that children born to unlawful immigrants are such people and orders the executive branch not to issue or accept documents recognizing their citizenship. (The order applies only to children born at least thirty days after it was issued.)\n\nThe American Civil Liberties Union, Lawyers for Civil Rights, and nearly two dozen states immediately filed lawsuits asking several different federal courts to declare the executive order in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, citing Wong Kim Ark. In response, the President could claim that he is not directly contravening the Court, because the case acknowledged that there are some persons who are both born in the U.S. and not citizens-for example, a child born to foreign diplomats. Trump's executive order sets up the argument that a child born to unlawful immigrants or temporary visitors is in that category. Nevertheless, the executive order is pushing ahead of the Court with a bold constitutional interpretation. The Court could react by smacking down the President's audacity. Or it could accept its own diminished status and let the President's constitutional interpretation carry the day. There is some chance that the Court, which knows that its popularity and public trust are at historic lows, will fear that this President might contemplate disobeying a court's order to issue citizenship documents, and choose not to test him.\n\nTrump's executive order on TikTok takes on Congress. The platform is owned by ByteDance, which operates in China and must coöperate with Chinese intelligence and give the Chinese government access to private data. Congress deemed it a threat to national security, and passed a statute that prohibits U.S. companies, such as Apple, Google, and Oracle, from distributing, maintaining, or updating TikTok-effectively requiring that the social-media platform be shut down. In a constitutional challenge brought by TikTok and its users on free-speech grounds, the Supreme Court ruled last week that the statute does not violate the First Amendment, and the law went into effect the day before Trump's Inauguration . In his executive order, Trump instructed his Attorney General (likely the soon to be confirmed Pam Bondi) not to enforce Congress's statute for seventy-five days, creating time for TikTok's parent company to be sold to a U.S. company-or for Trump to pressure Congress to repeal or revise its statute.\n\n\"I have the unique constitutional responsibility for the national security of the United States, the conduct of foreign policy, and other vital executive functions,\" Trump wrote . Indeed, he complained that the statute going into effect the day before he took office \"interferes with my ability to negotiate a resolution to avoid an abrupt shutdown of the TikTok platform while addressing national security concerns.\" There is no doubt that the President has a unique role in national security, but the assertion that he has \" the unique constitutional responsibility\" for it is highly tendentious, especially in a context in which he is refusing to enforce a national-security law that was validly enacted by Congress and is in effect. His order goes so far as to say the Attorney General will \"issue a letter to each provider stating that there has been no violation of the statute and that there is no liability for any conduct\" during the relevant period. The realist point here is that, so long as a law will not be enforced and no liability will be imposed for violating it, it is functionally the same as if \"there has been no violation\" of the law-or even as if there is no law. If in seventy-five days Trump hasn't been able to bring about a successful resolution, he could extend the period for another few months or even indefinitely.\n\nThis raises the question of whether the President could practically suspend any congressional statutes that are not to his liking by announcing that he won't enforce them and assuring potential violators that they can go ahead because there will be no liability. The President has vast enforcement discretion, such that the effect of laws passed by Congress can depend entirely on executive-branch decisions. One constitutional responsibility that is unique to the President is his duty to \"take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\" President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals ( DACA ) was actually a policy to refrain from enforcing federal immigration statutes on deportation against undocumented immigrants who arrived as children. That provoked allegations that Obama violated the \"take care\" clause of the Constitution, because DACA meant that immigration law was not being \"faithfully executed.\" Similar charges could be levelled at Trump for baldly declaring that a congressional law won't be in force until he says it will. But again, it is unlikely that a court would find that his non-enforcement decision lies outside the President's authority, even if a person or entity had standing to sue to enforce the law.\n\nOne of Trump's executive orders refuses to enforce a binding federal regulation, in order to fulfill his promise to dismantle the administrative state . Last year, the Biden Administration concluded a formal rule-making process that resulted in a final rule designed to protect civil-service employees in the executive branch from at-will firing. Trump's executive order tells the director of the Office of Personnel Management to \"rescind all changes made\" by that rule to the extent that it impedes his Administration's goal of making employees fireable at will. The President does have the prerogative to rescind a final rule, but that is a legal process, laid out by Congress, that usually takes months, at a minimum. Trump wrote that in the meantime, several offending parts of the final rule \"shall be held inoperative and without effect.\" A rule that has not yet gone through the rescinding process is not actually \"inoperative and without effect,\" but, again, if the executive branch treats a rule that way under the President's orders, it demonstrates that the binding nature of a legal regulation depends on the President's decision to enforce or ignore it. This executive order goes even further and directs the executive branch to potentially violate a regulation by which it is currently bound. The National Treasury Employees Union immediately filed suit-claiming, among other things, that Trump's executive order exceeds the President's authority under the congressional statute that governs the hiring and firing of federal employees.\n\nTrump strongly asserts his authority as a legal interpreter in his executive order \"Defending Women from Gender Ideology Extremism and Restoring Biological Truth to the Federal Government.\" The order announces that it is U.S. policy \"to recognize two sexes, male and female,\" and that they \"are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality.\" So Trump instructs that, wherever the term \"sex\" appears in federal law, it means \"an individual's immutable biological classification as either male or female\" and \"is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of 'gender identity.' \" This means that the executive branch will not interpret laws and regulations that protect people from discrimination on the basis of sex as protecting them on the basis of transgender status.\n\nIn 2020, the Supreme Court in Bostock v. Clayton County held that transgender people are covered by Congress's employment statute, Title VII, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex. That has led to litigation over the meaning of sex discrimination in other statutes and contexts in which transgender people seek legal protection. (The Court will decide this term whether a state ban on gender-affirming medical care for minors violates the Fourteenth Amendment.) Trump's executive order does not say that it is challenging Bostock. But it blasts the Biden Administration for arguing that Bostock \"requires gender identity-based access to single-sex spaces\" under Title IX, in which Congress conditioned schools' receipt of federal funding on their not engaging in sex discrimination. Trump's executive order says, \"Federal funds shall not be used to promote gender ideology. Each agency shall assess grant conditions and grantee preferences and ensure grant funds do not promote gender ideology.\" It declares that \" 'gender ideology' replaces the biological category of sex with an ever-shifting concept of self-assessed gender identity, permitting the false claim that males can identify as and thus become women and vice versa.\" That means, for example, that, in administering Title IX, the Education Department could threaten a university with loss of federal funding if the university \"promotes\" the view that \"it is possible for a person to be born in the wrong sexed body.\" Universities will need to fret about what counts as \"promoting\" that view. Though Trump during his campaign vowed to eliminate the Education Department, his Administration is much more likely to deploy it.\n\nLike many words in statutes, the term \"sex\" is often left undefined, perhaps because at the time of passage legislators deemed what it meant self-evident. Until last summer, when the Supreme Court overruled its 1984 decision in Chevron v. N.R.D.C., that case required courts to defer to the executive branch's reasonable interpretation of an ambiguous statute. In that regime, it would have been highly likely for Trump's interpretations of statutes to prevail in court. Boosters of the administrative state lamented the end of Chevron, fearing that it signalled the systematic disempowerment of federal agencies. The silver lining of Chevron's demise is that Trump's interpretations of statutes during his second term will not get judicial deference-including when his interpretations are part of his attempt to dismantle the administrative state.\n\nCompetition among the three branches of government is perennial: it is part of the design of our system of separated powers. But the fact that all three branches are currently dominated by one party and may agree on important policy preferences may make that competition all the more visible. It puts into relief the structural fight over which one gets to make the decisions. With Trump's first array of executive orders, he gets in the ring with the other branches and throws the first punch. With a Republican-controlled Congress and a conservative Court, in which a third of the Justices were appointed by Trump, it is reasonable to wonder whether the President will lack for real rivals. But it is altogether possible that the other branches will take umbrage at assertions of his dominance and punch back. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Will Trump's Intent to Destroy the Economy Wake Up Congress?\n\nSign up for the Surge , the newsletter that covers most important political nonsense of the week, delivered to your inbox every Saturday.\n\nWelcome to this week's edition of the Surge, a newsletter that thought it was closely guarding its proprietary news-ranking formula only to discover that the U.S. trade representative just used the same exact one to destroy the global economy.\n\nYou don't need us to tell you: We are in deep, folks. There is an internet dingbat leading purges on the National Security Council. There is a man talking on the Senate floor for 25 hours straight. There is a chamber of Congress shutting down because of a dispute about internal parental-leave policy. There are trillions in tax cuts, shrouded by a cloak of darkness, where the Senate parliamentarian can't see them.\n\nThere is a president who's gone and done it (pressed all the buttons to see what would happen).\n\nThis week, President Trump blew it all up. In a Wednesday ceremony, he revealed his baseline universal tariffs and his \"reciprocal\" tariffs, which aren't really reciprocal at all and rely on a crude formula potentially devised by an A.I. chatbot . This supreme and unholy amateurism produced such outputs as a 47 percent import tax on the poor island nation that produces most of the world's vanilla; a 50 percent import tax that will \"kill\" Lesotho's economy for its crime of exporting clothes and not having enough money to buy anything in return; and, yes, a 10 percent tax on a bunch of penguins. It's all too hard to process \"Liberation Day\" in full. That's going to be a job for historians. But let's set aside, for the moment, the sharp increase in the likelihood of recession, inflation, and generally a global economic meltdown that this augurs. Let's even set aside how this is probably lights-out for American global leadership and how, between this gut punch to the economic world order and Trump's months of spurning military allies and abandoning soft power, China's going to have a lot of new potential friends knocking on its door. What might be the most frightening is what it revealed about how decisions get made in this White House. The policy is slop, developed in secret and implemented unilaterally, unraveling 80 years of work at the snap of a finger. There are no longer any impediments between the weird ideas Trump developed in 1986 and their actualization. There's no one to talk him out of anything. He is one-sixteenth of the way through his term.\n\nWe had elections this week! Whoop-de-doo! In Florida's special elections, Republicans held their two deep-red congressional seats, while underperforming their November margins by 15 to 20 points. The showstopper of the night, though, was the Wisconsin Supreme Court election, which would determine the balance of power in the all-important swing state. The liberal candidate, Susan Crawford, defeated the conservative candidate , Brad Schimel, by 10 percentage points. The race would have drawn its share of national attention on its own terms. But the stakes were heightened when Elon Musk got involved, putting tens of millions of dollars behind Schimel and showing up in person to deliver jumbo-sized million-dollar checks at a rally. Intentionally or not, he made the race a referendum on himself, while arguing that its outcome might \"decide the future of America and Western civilization.\" The outcome seems mostly to have decided how long Musk will remain welcome in D.C.: Politico reported , the day after the special election, that Trump has been telling people that Musk will begin receding into the background soon. We'll see about that, but the Wisconsin race made clear what a liability Musk has become.\n\nLast week , we wrote about how the Florida Republican was working to force a vote on her resolution to allow members who are new parents to vote by proxy for 12 weeks-and the aggressive resistance she was meeting from GOP leadership and fellow conservatives. In an attempt to thwart her urged by the Freedom Caucus, Speaker Mike Johnson tried to pass a rule that would kill Luna's bill. To up the ante, the same rule would've teed up votes on bills requiring proof of citizenship to register to vote and to prevent district court judges from issuing nationwide injunctions. In other words, GOP leaders were daring Luna and her allies to impede Trump's agenda to get their parental-leave policy. But Luna and eight other Republicans didn't flinch , joining Democrats to tank the rule vote. Johnson, piqued, dismissed the House for the remainder of the week on a Tuesday afternoon in an attempt to shame Luna. Unfortunately for Johnson, Trump didn't join him in that effort, instead going on the record to say that he liked Luna's resolution and didn't \"know why it's so controversial.\" That directive from on high appears to have gotten Johnson to start negotiating, something he could have done months ago instead of emptying the arsenal to stop new parents from temporarily proxy voting. Isn't it nice to have a quaint congressional-procedure subplot while everything else in the world goes off the rails? Let's do another one next, from the Senate side.\n\nThe Surge wrote last month about a budgeting sleight of hand that Senate Republicans were hoping to use to disguise the cost of their planned tax cuts: using a current-policy baseline to argue that extending the 2017 Trump tax cuts would cost nothing on paper (even though they'll cost $4 trillion over a decade). But first, they needed to ensure that Senate rules and precedent allowed them to do this. After weeks of consultations with the parliamentarian-Elizabeth MacDonough, aka \"the Hammer,\" as insider publications call her-Senate Republicans decided this week that they didn't actually need her to greenlight this after all. Instead, they've decided, Budget Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham can himself determine which baseline to use. Republicans described this move as bypassing the parliamentarian, rather than \"overruling\" her. But that may be a distinction without a difference, because bypassing the parliamentarian (because you're scared of what she'll say) will also erode enforcement of the guardrails on the filibuster-proof reconciliation process. If Democrats retake power and say that \"Medicare for All\" has zero deficit impact because they've determined it to be \"current policy,\" and that the parliamentarian wasn't consulted because she'd been mysteriously stuffed in a locker, no complaining is allowed.\n\nA rule is a rule! If the New Jersey senator's speech had been an hour shorter, he would not have been in the Surge this week. Real estate is valuable here, and we don't give out prizes for speeches under 25 hours. But this week, Booker broke the 68-year record held by South Carolina Sen. Strom Thurmond for his filibuster of the 1957 Civil Rights Act. (Thurmond would go on to serve for one million additional years after that.) Booker's speech was a generalized rant against everything the Trump administration has been doing, interspersed with colloquies with his Democratic colleagues. We'll put our cards on the table: Booker is a fine senator, but he's a ham. He practices a politics of inspiration, and the Surge recoils at politicians who try to inspire us. Democrats, though, need this. They need to try stuff. Their strongest tool to rein in Trump isn't the few, far-between, and illusory moments of legislative leverage. It's not the courts. They have to get the word out about what Trump is doing-or at least get the headline out that a senator thinks it's bad enough to not eat, drink, or pee for much longer than is medically advisable-and why it's toxic. Sure, the coverage of Booker's speech was overtaken by Trump's decision the following day to make America a rogue state. That can be some other senator's 25-hour assignment the next week.\n\nThe power to impose tariffs is one the Constitution gives to Congress-not the president. Only now is Congress recognizing that its various efforts over the past 100 years to give the executive some tariff authority here, some tariff authority there, ends up with the president getting all the authority he needs to create a situation where a nearly 80-year-old with vast untreated issues might abuse the power as a form of self-medication. And in response to Liberation Day, we saw the very beginnings of some pushback this week. Trump invoked much of his tariff authority from a 1977 emergency law that's never before been used for this purpose. The upside to this, though, is that such emergencies can be terminated by simple majority votes in Congress. Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine led a charge this week to terminate the emergency declaration underpinning Trump's on-again, off-again Canada tariffs, and his resolution passed the Senate , with four Republicans (Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul, Mitch McConnell, and Susan Collins) joining all Democrats. Trump is invoking the same emergency law-the International Emergency Economic Powers Act-for the universal and \"reciprocal\" tariffs he announced Wednesday, so there's a similar opportunity to reject those too. But the worse the effects of Trump's tariffs get, the more opportunity there is to think bigger. On Thursday, Sens. Chuck Grassley and Maria Cantwell introduced a bill that would require any new tariffs to be approved by Congress within 60 days or they'd expire. A proposal like this, over the past few days, has gone from something that Congress should do to something it's obligated to do.\n\nRemember Signalgate? That was so silly when it happened, 150 years ago. And while everyone involved in \"Houthi PC small group\" still has a job, the ramifications within the executive branch are still being felt. Our stated belief has been that if someone-namely national security adviser Michael Waltz-lost their job, it would be more the result of internal battles between the MAGA and traditional GOP wings of the foreign-policy teams than accountability for insecure communications practices. That's begun to happen, though in a stupider way than we'd predicted. Laura Loomer, a lunatic online-brained conspiracy theorist whom then-campaign manager Susie Wiles worked diligently to keep away from Trump's ear, apparently has Trump's ear yet again. In an Oval Office meeting with Trump this week-yikes!-Loomer presented him with a \"list of people she believed were disloyal to the president\" primarily on the National Security Council. Six NSC officials were fired shortly thereafter, even though Waltz and his deputy survived. Trump still doesn't want to fire Waltz and give the media credit for a \"scalp.\" So he just moved one rung lower, at the behest of a dingbat from the internet. Well!

      "text": "Trump's Trade Wars Are Having a Very Unexpected Effect on Housing. But Not Where You Think.\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has set in motion an ambitious housing plan that promises to double the rate of homebuilding, finance affordable housing, and develop new construction technology.\n\nIn Canada , that is.\n\n\"In the face of President Trump's tariffs, we need to build for Canadians,\" Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said this week, pitching tens of billions in housing investment as a kind of industrial policy response to Trump. Indeed, that Carney-who replaced Justin Trudeau last month and will lead Canada's Liberal Party into an election on April 28-is in this position at all is thanks to Trump's seismic effect on politics in Canada, where his tariffs and annexation threats have revived the fortunes of the country's Liberal Party.\n\nFor Americans, it's a look at what a functional federal government might try to do to address the nation's housing affordability crisis. Carney's Build Canada Homes plan calls for the Canadian government to become an actual builder of affordable housing-a strategy that the U.S. mostly abandoned in the 1970s-as well as provide low-cost financing to private affordable housing developers. It proposes tax incentives for rental housing construction, carrots and sticks to reduce local zoning and permitting barriers, and a $25 billion stimulus for prefab and modular construction companies.\n\nAbout 12 percent of Canadian households live in unaffordable, substandard, overcrowded housing , and providing affordable housing has traditionally been delegated to local and regional governments. (It's hard to make an apples-to-apples comparison, but almost a third of U.S. households live in \"unaffordable\" housing , meaning that the rent or mortgage consumes more than 30 percent of their income.)\n\nFor buyers north of the border, the price of homes has followed the same hockey-stick trajectory as in the United States. And yet supply is lagging: \"The current environment is not friendly to homebuilders, with rising costs (labor, materials, financing), and now with the tariffs,\" Yushu Zhu, a professor of urban studies at Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, told me.\n\nIn part, Carney mentioned Trump because he is campaigning in an election that has become a referendum on the American president. But Carolyn Whitzman, an urban planner and the author of Home Truths: Fixing Canada's Housing Crisis , told me that the proposal is also a response to Canada's sudden detachment from the U.S. economy. \"Our construction industries are highly interconnected, with lots of products moving north and south-the U.S. getting steel and wood; we're buying finished products, bathroom fixtures,\" she said. \"Tariffs are going to be super disastrous, so we have to build up a homegrown industry.\" (It's a little like what's happening in Germany, where the American betrayal of Ukraine has kickstarted a military spending boom. U.S. policy is having some unexpected results.)\n\nU.S. housing advocates have long hoped that modular technology-in which pieces of buildings are assembled in a factory-might be on the cusp of revolutionizing construction. In Canada, the promise is even greater, because the colder climate makes year-round outdoor work unpleasant or even dangerous.\n\nSome U.S. progressives have also argued for the federal government to reprise its role as a low-income housing provider. That's a novel and exciting prospect in Canada as well. \"Getting back into the government building housing is not something we've seen in this country since the end of the Second World War,\" Chris Bell, the director of strategy at Norfolk Housing Association, a nonprofit housing operator in Calgary, told me. \"That would be quite game-changing.\"\n\nIn the United States, that idea is weighed down by the dismal record of midcentury public housing projects, which have been mostly demolished and replaced by privately built housing. But Canadians' own postwar public housing , sometimes known as \"strawberry boxes\" or \"victory homes,\" consisted largely of bite-sized single-family homes built for returning veterans, and has not suffered from the same reputational (and literal) damage.\n\nTo succeed, Carney's plan will need to overcome local barriers to growth-including zoning restrictions and permitting fees. That is less of a problem in Canada than in the United States, Bell observed. Canada has larger jurisdictions, which reduces the power of exclusionary neighborhoods. The country doesn't have the same culture of passing laws at the ballot box-a source of NIMBY power. \"We have the same vocal opposition to density, but Canada doesn't have the institutions available for that opposition to be very effective,\" Bell said.\n\nMoreover, Canada already has an example of how to overcome that local opposition to housing. The country's Housing Accelerator Fund has been offering grants to cities and towns that pledge to speed up the housing construction process. In 2023, for example, the fund gave 228 million Canadian dollars (about $160 million) to Calgary to support seven initiatives, including accelerated permit approvals and missing-middle zoning, to increase the housing supply.\n\nWashington has tried something similar . But the program's entire budget is just $80 million, half of what Canada spent on one San Diego-sized city. All in all, Canada's plan aims to double the country's pace of home construction.\n\nIt's not as if the nonauthoritarian U.S. political party does not have similar ideas; Kamala Harris had a big housing plan too . But her goals were smaller (a 50 percent increase in housing production) and the path to get there less clear. If a big housing plan works in Canada, it could provide a model for Democrats next time around. There's no tariff on ideas.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Maybe Trump Wants to Help Ukraine After All\n\nMaybe President Trump isn't clamoring to push Ukraine under the bus after all.\n\nTuesday's meeting in Jeddah, between his top officials and their Ukrainian counterparts, ended with the Americans handing Kyiv a clear advantage-militarily and diplomatically-and putting Moscow in a tight, awkward spot.\n\nAccording to a joint statement released after several hours of talks, the two countries agreed to a 30-day ceasefire in the Russia-Ukraine war, hopefully to be extended for a longer span, segueing into negotiations toward a permanent peace. The ceasefire deal-which also contains details about a long-term settlement that have not been publicly disclosed-will soon be presented to the Russian government for its acceptance or rejection. Meanwhile, whatever the Russians decide, Ukraine will enjoy an immediate resumption of U.S. military and intelligence assistance, which Trump had suspended after his disastrous Oval Office meeting with President Volodymyr Zelensky on Feb. 28.\n\nTrump's suspension of weapons deliveries-and especially his halting of intelligence on Russia's movements-had started to damage Ukrainian troops' strength and morale at a time when both sides are facing shortfalls and exhaustion. Even before the Oval Office meeting, when U.S. and Russian officials met to discuss an end to the war without inviting any Ukrainians to the talk , it seemed as if Donald Trump and Vladimir Putin were about to impose a peace on Kyiv-and that Trump had capitulated to Russia's position.\n\nZelensky had pushed for the meeting in Jeddah to repair the damage done by the Oval Office disaster and, more broadly, to restore good relations with Washington, which are necessary not only for Ukraine's war effort but also for his country's stability-and possibly survival-after the fighting is over.\n\nWhatever happens next, from Zelensky's standpoint, the Jeddah meeting was an unqualified success.\n\nRussian President Vladimir Putin must be displeased-and more than a bit surprised. He has opposed a ceasefire unless it is preceded by a settlement of the war's \" root causes .\" By his definition of those causes, he has insisted on the removal of Zelensky's regime (which he sees as illegitimate), the \"demilitarization\" and \"neutralization\" of Ukraine (meaning its disarmament and a pledge never to join NATO), and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from much of Eastern Europe (which is to say, the reversal of the West's Cold War victory).\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has expressed sympathy for Putin's views, saying that Ukraine started the war and remains the main obstacle to peace.\n\nAt the very least, the results of the Jeddah meeting put that proposition to a test. \"The ball is in Russia's court,\" Secretary of State Marco Rubio said coming out of the meeting. If Putin rejects the ceasefire offer, he added, \"then we'll unfortunately know what the impediment is to peace.\"\n\nIf Putin says nyet , even Trump might get the picture. He might even turn against Putin-whom he has openly admired for many years-for dissing his high-profile plan to end the war. He told reporters on Wednesday that Russia would face \" devastating \" penalties, mainly financial in nature, if it rejected the deal. He didn't elaborate, nor is it clear what these penalties might be, given that the U.S. has already piled sanctions on Russia and that trade between the two nations is too scanty for tariffs to matter. Nonetheless, Putin's foreign policy rests largely on staying cozy with Trump and thereby splitting the U.S.-European alliance; he may take the vehemence of Trump's remarks as a warning that this partnership might be in danger.\n\nOf course, Putin could accept the ceasefire, then refuse to abide by it. We have all seen, most recently in the Middle East, how difficult it is to sustain even a 30-day ceasefire, especially when one or both sides would rather keep fighting. It is unclear, at least from the U.S.-Ukrainian joint statement, how the ceasefire-whether for 30 days or an extended span-would be monitored and enforced. Some European countries, notably Britain and France, have offered to deploy peacekeeper troops on Ukrainian soil. Putin has rejected that idea out of hand . If actual peace talks get underway, he may have to change his position-or risk being seen, by the rest of the world and even by Trump, as the bad guy.\n\nEven if a ceasefire happens, that wouldn't necessarily mean the outbreak of peace. Nobody believes that a final deal would give back all the territory that Ukraine has lost to Russia since the annexation of Crimea in 2014 or even since the wider invasion of 2022. Zelensky doesn't concede the point, but has said that he can't stop fighting without some form of security guarantees, if not formally from NATO, then in some manner from select Western countries, including the U.S.-in order to deter or prevent Russia from reinvading months or years down the road.\n\nTrump has said that the minerals treaty -which he and Zelensky were about to sign until the Oval Office blowup and which they now seem set to try signing again in a do-over -would be a more-than-ample substitute for a security guarantee. The Russian army, he argues, wouldn't dare threaten Ukrainian soil once American miners and engineers are present, exploring and excavating its minerals (whose revenues the U.S. would then share). There may be something to this, but it's doubtful that Western companies would send their workers to Ukraine without U.S. security guarantees-especially since half of Ukraine's mineral wealth is buried on land that Russian troops currently occupy .\n\nBut those are issues for the future. In the meantime, National Security Advisor Michael Waltz-who represented the U.S. in Jeddah, along with Rubio and Trump's special envoy, Steve Witkoff-will be carrying the ceasefire proposal , including details not yet publicized, to Moscow.\n\nTrump also said he will personally talk with Putin soon . During that phone call, Putin will probably repeat his rambling lecture that distorts and falsifies the history and geopolitics of Russia and Ukraine-a lecture that Trump has accepted in the past. Trump very much wants to believe the tall tale, just as he wants to restore good ties between Washington and Moscow-but whether he continues to do so may depend, this time, on Putin's actions as well as his words. If true, that in itself marks a major change in the relationship.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Why It's So Outrageous That Trump Is Invoking This Obscure 200-Year-Old Wartime Law\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nThis week, Donald Trump invoked a law that played a role in one of the darkest moments in American history. Originally passed in 1798, the Alien Enemies Act has rarely been used over the past 200 years. It was most recently deployed during World War II to justify the detention of Japanese noncitizens, shortly before the incarceration of tens of thousands of Japanese Americans.\n\nThe president invoked the law through executive action , directing immigration authorities to target members of Tren de Aragua, a Venezuelan gang, who are \"not actually naturalized or lawful permanent residents of the United States.\" The order proclaims that these migrants \"are liable to be apprehended, restrained, secured, and removed as Alien Enemies,\" and it does not require the government to have evidence or grant a court hearing.\n\nWithin days, multiple flights transported Venezuelan migrants from the U.S. to El Salvador, despite a judge's ordering the deportations to stop. Some of the families of those deported have said their loved ones had no connection with Tren de Aragua and were falsely targeted; in some cases, the families believe, simply because they had visible tattoos. Lawyers representing a group of Venezuelan immigrants suing the Trump administration over its use of the Alien Enemies Act wrote in a recent court document , \"If the president can designate any group as enemy aliens under the act, and that designation is unreviewable, then there is no limit on who can be sent to a Salvadoran prison, or any limit on how long they will remain there.\"\n\nThe Alien Enemies Act was never intended to be used this way. The wartime law was created during an era when the U.S. did not have federal immigration policy. To better understand why the law was established and how it's historically been used, I spoke with Katherine Yon Ebright, counsel at the Brennan Center's Liberty and National Security Program.\n\nOur conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nShirin Ali: When was the Alien Enemies Act created, and what was the context behind it?\n\nKatherine Yon Ebright: The act was enacted in 1798, during the Quasi-War with France. That was a wholly naval conflict, and it was an undeclared war, or \"imperfect war,\" with France. There was no ground incursion, there was no congressional declaration of war, but there was substantial fear at that time that the war would escalate. So the Congress enacted a series of four laws, commonly known as the Alien and Sedition Acts. Three of those laws applied even before the declaration of war or before some sort of escalation by France.\n\nBut the Alien Enemies Act was for a true all-out war. This meant that if Congress declared war, or France sent a ground invasion, that the native citizens, denizens, and subjects of France-people who were from France, who were born in France, who notionally owed allegiance to France in wartime-could be regulated, be put into internment camps, or be expelled or deported. One of the reasons that Congress felt this was appropriate is that there was basically no criminal or immigration law that existed at the federal level. There was very little national security law that existed at the federal level.\n\nObviously, that is very, very different today, where we have a proliferation of criminal and immigration and national security authorities. The other thing that's worth noting about the context of 1798 is that the law of war, under the law of nations, allowed these noncitizens from the foreign belligerent to be treated as though they were prisoners of war. That is a legal artifact that is no longer true after the adoption of the Geneva Conventions. Today, under the law of war, civilians are supposed to have protections, including against citizenship- or identity-based detentions or internment, as well as against forced repatriation.\n\nHow many times has the Alien Enemies Act been invoked since its passage?\n\nIt's been used in only three major conflicts. Now, of course, we have our fourth invocation of the wartime authority for peacetime immigration enforcement coming down this past Saturday by President Trump.\n\nIn the War of 1812, which was fought with the British, the Alien Enemies Act was used to regulate British subjects who were not allowed to live within 40 miles of the coast. A U.S. marshal told them that they had to relocate to an inland residence. Then, in World War I, this law was used to heavily regulate noncitizens from the foreign belligerent, which was Germany and the Austro-Hungarian Empire. People from those backgrounds were subject to very intense regulation, ranging from limiting travel to preventing them from living in certain places. For example, if you were a German noncitizen, you could not live in Washington-so if you had lived in D.C. for decades but were simply not a U.S. citizen and were born in Germany, you had to get out, subject to internment.\n\nThere were several thousand German and Austro-Hungarian internees from World War I. However, by the time World War II started, there was a general consensus that the wartime hysteria and internment policy of World War I was really inappropriate, and that it inflated people's sense of the dangerousness of Germans and Austro-Hungarians based on their ancestry.\n\nNevertheless, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, we see another invocation of the Alien Enemies Act. Barring the present day, this invocation of the law has been the only use of the authority based on a supposed invasion. But even then, it was in fact a real invasion, because the attack on Pearl Harbor involved hundreds of military aircraft and dozens of armed submarines. We all know the attack on Pearl Harbor and the other Pacific holdings that launched the United States into World War II. That same day, President Roosevelt invoked the Alien Enemies Act and imposed draconian regulations on noncitizens of Japanese descent and, the following day, noncitizens of German and Italian descent. Those regulations controlled whether noncitizens could own flashlights, maps, certain books, and firearms. On top of that, they allowed the president or the attorney general to intern anyone who was deemed \"dangerous.\"\n\nThe act does not have due process protections built into it when the president moves against a noncitizen to put them into a camp or to try to expel them. We ended up with 31,000 noncitizens of Japanese, German, and Italian descent who were put into camps based principally on their ancestry or the conflation of their ethnicity with disloyalty and dangerousness. People are more familiar with the incarceration of Japanese Americans, including U.S. citizens, but we still do remember the Alien Enemies Act internments as a shameful part of our history. In fact, some of the internees from the act, those of Japanese descent, received monetary reparations , and Congress even passed an apology bill.\n\nWe are not currently in a war, yet the president has invoked the Alien Enemies Act. What now?\n\nI anticipated that the Trump administration would invoke this act. He'd been promising to do it on the campaign trail, giving stump speeches about how he was going to invoke the law. Then, on Jan. 20, the day of the inauguration, there was reporting that he was going to issue a proclamation claiming that Tren de Aragua was perpetrating an invasion and that that gang was a part of the Venezuelan government. If anything, I am surprised that it took around two months for that proclamation to be released. I think there were probably aspects of the political moment and also some legal concerns within the administration about how they were going to roll out the policy that may have delayed it until now.\n\nThe president is saying that migration and narcotics trafficking constitute an invasion or predatory incursion, but those terms are not defined by the text of the Alien Enemies Act. However, there are other parts of the text of this law that refer to actual hostility and a hostile nation. In 1800 you have James Madison unambiguously writing, in the context of the Alien and Sedition Acts, that \"invasion is an operation of war.\" Then you move to the one time that this law has ever been used based on an invasion or predatory incursion, and it's Pearl Harbor, right? That looks so different from migration and narcotics trafficking that it makes the way that this law has been invoked by Trump, the language undergirding the invocation, frankly a farce.\n\nI think, more or less, what we're going to see today is Venezuelan noncitizens who are going to be designated or deemed to be members of Tren de Aragua without any verifiable evidence or due process. It's going to sweep up innocent people who are not gang members. And there are parts of immigration law that actually allow this government to pursue individuals who are members of Tren de Aragua, if they can prove it before an immigration judge or in a court of law. The only reason to use the wartime authority is to bypass due process and try to target Venezuelans more broadly when you know you can't prove that they're actually gang members. I think that that is a major threat to civil liberties and to our Constitution.\n\nIf the Alien Enemies Act led to such horrific abuses, shouldn't it have been repealed a long time ago?\n\nYes-I think it should have been repealed in that period when we were taking stock of the World War II internments. But as the politics had it, the primary focus of the reparations movement to account for the incarcerations and internments of World War II was Executive Order 9066 . That was the authority under which 110,000 Japanese Americans, including U.S. citizens, were put into camps. As a result, the Alien Enemies Act slid under the radar, but it still is bound up with that shameful history of targeting noncitizens based on their ancestry, not based on their conduct.\n\nMoreover, unlike in 1798, today we have a flurry of different immigration, criminal, and national security authorities that are perfectly adequate. In fact, they are more than adequate for keeping us safe in wartime and in peacetime. Leaving this authority on the books manifestly opens the door to an abuse of a very powerful authority that we have seen in the past violate First Amendment rights, Fourth Amendment rights, arguably Second Amendment rights and Fifth Amendment rights. It's a complete abdication of due process rights and the right to be free from discrimination. I think that even in wartime, this law is neither necessary nor appropriate and therefore can and should be repealed. The fact that it is subject to abuse, as we're now seeing in peacetime, makes repeal particularly urgent.\n\nThere is an ongoing legal battle over the president's use of the Alien Enemies Act, and let's say it eventually goes up to the Supreme Court. How do you think the current slate of justices would interpret this?\n\nI think you could find five votes, maybe more, on the court to turn down an abuse of the act. It is, again, manifestly a wartime authority. The Trump administration is trying to say that migration is an invasion, that narcotics trafficking is a predatory incursion, but the history is remarkably clear that those terms refer to acts of war that trigger the law of war.\n\nThe administration is simply not acting in a manner that is consistent with the belief that we are operating under the law of war. Our commander in chief has not identified any armed attack that would trigger the law of war. He has not asked Congress for a declaration of war. In fact, at the start of this month on Truth Social, he posted that \"the invasion of our country is over,\" based on the low number of border encounters that we saw in February.\n\nI think that you would find five votes on the Supreme Court, maybe more, to say that this action was not taken in good faith, that this action is an obvious mistake or a manifestly unauthorized use of power. And even though the courts typically afford the president substantial deference with respect to sensitive national security matters, here it is just so crystal clear that this is not what that law is for. Also, there's so many civil liberties issues with using the law, whether in wartime or in peacetime, that this simply can't go forward.\n\nAre there other centuries-old laws that the Trump administration could tap into, just as it has with the Alien Enemies Act?\n\nOne big concern that we at the Brennan Center have is around the president's potential use of the Insurrection Act, which allows the president to use the military for domestic civilian law enforcement. There has been some speculation that he might try to invoke that act to assist with immigration enforcement. As a general matter, the military is prohibited from participating in civilian law enforcement, so rounding people up, enforcing criminal law, immigration law. There is a separate statute called the Posse Comitatus Act , which prohibits the military from boots-on-the-ground civilian law enforcement, but the Insurrection Act is a very broad exception to that Posse Comitatus principle.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Trump's Most Shockingly Ambitious Executive Order\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nAt a time when many commentators think that the death penalty is waning in the United States, President Donald Trump issued an ambitious executive order on his first day in office laying out his vision for the use of capital punishment in this country. It describes capital punishment as \"an essential tool for deterring and punishing those who would commit the most heinous crimes and acts of lethal violence against American citizens.\"\n\nThe president's embrace of the death penalty is no surprise given his longtime support for that punishment and his use of it during his first term in office. What is surprising is how sweeping his executive order was and how much of it was designed to revive capital punishment and facilitate executions, not just at the federal level but in death penalty states where they are flagging.\n\nReviving the death penalty across the country, though, will be a heavy lift even for a politician as skilled as the president. Recently, the death penalty fundamentals have changed in serious and significant ways . The playing field is now tilted in favor of its opponents.\n\nMoreover, first-day executive orders often turn out to be more important as symbolic gestures than as surefire policy guides. That will likely be the case with the president's death penalty order.\n\nSome of what he wants to accomplish seems to be of dubious legality. Some of it will raise the specter of gratuitous cruelty.\n\nOne thing is certain: The president's order is a shockingly broad attack on abolition that will generate a lot of litigation. Whatever its ultimate effect, it is a reminder that Americans live in two different worlds regarding the government's use of the ultimate punishment.\n\nIn most of the country, the death penalty has been abolished or is seldom used. Still, as I explained in 2021, it remains a force in \"a dwindling number of outlier jurisdictions to continue to pursue death sentences and executions.\"\n\nLast year, new death sentences were handed out in just 10 states . Many of them, including Alabama, Florida, Mississippi, and Texas, are longtime death penalty hot spots. Executions, the Death Penalty Information Center reported , also are \"geographically concentrated in the South, with 19 of this year's executions (76%) carried out in southern states.\"\n\nThe center noted that \"Alabama carried out the most executions in 2024, with six, followed by Texas with five, and Oklahoma and Missouri with four each.\" President Trump carried each of those states by large margins in the November election.\n\nThe death belt is Trump country. There, his executive order on capital punishment will play well with his most fervent supporters.\n\nIn addition, it is an area in which the president can potentially undo the legacy of the Biden administration , which imposed a moratorium on federal executions and commuted the sentences of 37 of the 40 people who were on federal death row.\n\nIn his executive order, Trump described the inmates to whom Biden showed mercy as \"vile and sadistic rapists, child molesters, and murderers on Federal death row: remorseless criminals who brutalized young children, strangled and drowned their victims, and hunted strangers for sport.\" He previously criticized the commutations, calling them a \"mockery of justice\" that \"insult the victims of these horrible crimes.\"\n\nThat is why it is unsurprising that two parts of Monday's executive order target Biden's clemency.\n\nFirst, the president's order \"directs the attorney general to evaluate whether the 37 people whose federal death sentences were commuted under Biden can be charged with state capital crimes.\" This is possible, professor Josh Blackman writes , because \"there is no statute of limitation for murder, and states remain free to punish defendants who had their federal sentences commuted.\"\n\nBut, Blackman observes, \"Even in the states that still allow death sentences, it would be difficult to re-prosecute decades-old cases.\" However, he points to the case of John Hanson , who is serving a life sentence in federal prison in Louisiana, as one in which Trump could take advantage of a state's death penalty system.\n\nHanson \"was also sentenced to death in Oklahoma for two murders ... but [under Biden] the Federal Bureau of Prisons refused to transfer him to the custody of the state.\" The Trump Justice Department could now turn him over to Oklahoma authorities so his \"execution can be carried out.\"\n\nThe president's second response to Biden's death penalty clemencies was to direct the attorney general to \"evaluate the places of imprisonment and conditions of confinement for each of the 37 murderers whose Federal death sentences were commuted by President Biden.\" He wants \"to ensure that these offenders are imprisoned in conditions consistent with the monstrosity of their crimes and the threats they pose.\"\n\nInmates removed from death row generally remain incarcerated in very restrictive conditions. But if the president cannot get them executed under state law, he may be signaling that he wants the people whose death sentences Biden commuted to spend the rest of their lives in the federal government's supermax prison in Florence, Colorado.\n\nPrisoners in these facilities, Human Rights Watch notes , \"typically spend their waking and sleeping hours locked in small, sometimes windowless, cells sealed with solid steel doors. ... Prisoners have almost no access to educational or recreational activities or other sources of mental stimulation.\"\n\nThe president's order also seeks to ramp up federal death penalty prosecutions quickly. It directs the Justice Department to \"pursue the death penalty for all crimes of a severity demanding its use.\" It singles out for special attention \"the murder of a law-enforcement officer\" or capital crimes committed by undocumented immigrants.\n\nMoreover, the president wants to turn the federal government into a cheerleader for capital punishment everywhere. As he put it, \"The Attorney General shall encourage State attorneys general and district attorneys to bring State capital charges for all capital crimes.\"\n\nRecognizing that drug shortages have prevented many death penalty states from carrying out executions , Monday's executive order seeks to enlist the federal government in helping \"to ensure that each state that allows capital punishment has a sufficient supply of drugs needed to carry out lethal injection.\"\n\nIt is, of course, not clear that the federal government will have any greater success than the states in securing such drugs, But the president can again direct the Food and Drug Administration to stop regulating death penalty drugs as he did during his first term.\n\nFinally, the president's order seeks ways of expanding the reach and applicability of capital punishment. That is why it directs the attorney general to \"challenge Supreme Court precedents that hinder capital punishment and limit the authority of State and Federal governments to impose capital punishment.\"\n\nOne likely target would be the court's 2008 Kennedy v. Louisiana decision , holding that the death penalty for child sexual assault is unconstitutional. Such a case is already teed up by the laws recently enacted in Florida and Tennessee that authorize the death penalty in such cases .\n\nFor opponents of capital punishment, the president's executive order is a reminder that the road to abolition will not be smooth. For death penalty supporters, Trump's executive order is about as good as it gets. It is comprehensive, bold, and imaginative.\n\nBut, at the end of the day, it is unlikely to make much of a dent in the progress that abolitionists have made in changing the national conversation about capital punishment and in putting this country on the path to ending capital punishment.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Trump Pardons That Will Haunt America\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nOn his first day back in office, President Donald Trump signed dozens of executive orders that sought to reach into nearly every corner of America life. Yet that was overshadowed by Trump's unprecedented, sweeping pardons and commutations for nearly all of the roughly 1,500 people charged in connection with the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the U.S. Capitol. Among those pardoned were high-profile figures convicted of seditious conspiracy and violent assaults that left dozens of police officers injured. Though Trump had promised the move, its broad scope reportedly surprised even members of his inner circle. Just days before being sworn in as vice president, J.D. Vance told reporters that the most violent perpetrators \"obviously\" shouldn't be pardoned.\n\nTo help understand the true scope of Trump's action, on Tuesday I spoke with Jacob Ware, a research fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and co-author of God, Guns, and Sedition: Far-Right Terrorism in America . Ware's work examines the deep roots of far-right extremism and the importance of the sedition charges that followed Jan. 6 in sending a message of accountability in America . Now, with Trump's pardons reversing much of that, I asked Ware how he sees this moment. He had a simple response: \"We're in unprecedented territory.\" Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nAymann Ismail: What was your gut reaction to the news of the pardons?\n\nJacob Ware: This is pretty devastating moment for counterterrorism in the U.S., particularly counterterrorism against domestic paramilitary groups. It sets a terrible precedent for rule of law, for violence against institutions, violence against law enforcement. And it sends a message of permission-that political violence will be tolerated as long as it's on behalf of a certain movement and a certain man. And that's tremendously dangerous. We're in unprecedented territory where people who sought to overthrow the government have now been allowed back on our streets as returning warriors.\n\nWhat worries you most about Trump's action?\n\nJan. 6 was the largest investigation in Department of Justice history. Those prosecutions were really about two things: punishments of crimes committed and deterring follow-on acts of violence. The consensus among the counterterrorism community is that the deterrence has been completely and fully eroded now.\n\nIt's not just because of the pardons. In the immediate aftermath of Jan. 6, even the most conservative Republicans were horrified. Elise Stefanik called for people to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. Over the course of the past four years, that narrative has been steadily eroded as Jan. 6 defendants have been recast and redefined from insurrectionists to martyrs, political prisoners, victims, hostages. At one point, President Trump even used the word \"warriors,\" a word that actually celebrates organized state violence. And so the concern is there is now no deterrence against political violence from this particular movement.\n\nWhat was the anticipation in the online extremism world heading into the Trump inauguration? What is the reaction to these broad pardons?\n\nWe know that countless individuals who are enmeshed in these criminal cases were trying to delay or postpone trials, waiting for Trump's inauguration, truly believing that he was going to protect them from the criminal justice system. This has been an ongoing dance that we've seen over the course of the past eight years, where President Trump would issue these public proclamations of support condoning these movements. We saw that at Charlottesville, and with the Proud Boys \"stand back and stand by\" comment. And we know from statements that these groups make from the chatter within their online spaces that they do take his words and his actions to be supportive of them. It was barely months between \"stand back and stand by\" and the Jan. 6 insurrection. So they were waiting for this moment, and they will be celebrating their freedom.\n\nI should also point out that Jan. 6 was an incident that had a huge variety of activity. You did have people who were involved in nonviolent crimes, trespassing crimes, and they served very short prison sentences, if they served prison sentences at all. And then you had people prosecuted for very violent crimes, including seditious conspiracy, which is arguably the most serious crime in our country. I think even the most conservative Republicans did not expect President Trump to pardon or commute the sentences of those prosecuted for seditious conspiracy. So that is also a big shock. The people the Justice Department proved had intended to overthrow the government have now been protected and condoned by President Trump. That is a big deal.\n\nAs the people convicted of Jan. 6 crimes start getting out of prison, what will you be watching? Do you think most of them will try to fade into ordinary life, or is there a chance they will jump back into organizing or activism?\n\nYou have two kinds of Jan. 6 defendants. You have those who recognize that they were duped and are genuinely remorseful. Those are the kind of people who I hope will be given the space to rebuild their lives. You also have those who acted out on Jan. 6 because they had a grievance against the government. And that victimhood has now been propelled further. They feel they now have more evidence that they are struggling against a tyrannical government. Certainly, I would expect those people to double down in their activism and go back to their paramilitary and militia groups as battle-hardened leaders who now can speak with authority about the violence against the government that they've been promising all these years. I do think this will be a shot in the arm for the movement and for several groups who had been relatively dormant since Jan. 6.\n\nSince President Trump first emerged on the political stage, he has redefined what we once called anti-government extremism. These kinds of movements-the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters, and the Proud Boys-used to be fundamentally opposed to all governments or federal authority in the United States. That has changed now. They've been recast as anti-Democratic and pro-Republican, because they feel that President Trump is an ally in the White House. Because President Trump has shifted the Overton window, whether we see those people enter the political process or continue in their violent activism remains to be seen.\n\nI would also not be surprised to see some people use that to propel political careers as well. The narrative has been rewritten. Jan. 6 perpetrators are no longer violent insurrectionists. They are now peaceful patriots who were victimized by the government. And that is going to be something very powerful for people who decide to run for office, much as it was an honorable thing to have been a prisoner of war.\n\nWhat about the Proud Boys specifically? What do you think Enrique Tarrio's release could mean for the group's future?\n\nEnrique Tarrio has a long, checkered history of cooperation , which of course is not looked upon very positively by the movement. He's going back with this sense of legitimacy and authority because he is somebody who has personal experience of \"government tyranny\" in quotation marks; he stared down an overreaching tyrannical government and won. I think that's going to be an incredibly powerful narrative that he's going to be able to spin, which can make him a very powerful figure in whatever the next generation of the violent far right is. This pardon will be taken as a stamp of approval by the movement, and he's going to become a poster child for it.\n\nThe violent far right has always been exceptional at weaving this narrative of martyrdom and hailing those people who have been felled at the hands of the government as martyrs. And these people will now carry that authority with them forever. Whether Tarrio determines that he's going to go deeper into the movement and rebuild it for this golden age in the second Trump administration, or whether he decides to do something more productive with his life, it remains to be seen.\n\nHas anything of this scale happened before?\n\nI'm thinking a lot about historical parallels. In 1988, the U.S. government tried 14 white supremacists for seditious conspiracy at Fort Smith, Arkansas. And those 14 white supremacists were acquitted. It was a huge deal for the movement because they felt they had approval. But one of them, a former KKK leader called Louis Beam, realized that the entire movement had almost been decapitated. So, he went underground, formed this journal called the Seditionists, in reference to the charges, and he revived an old treatise of insurgency and guerrilla warfare known as leaderless resistance, basically lone-actor terrorism. And most of the violence that we've seen from the far right over the past decade-in places like Charleston, Pittsburgh, El Paso, Buffalo-have actually followed this model.\n\nI don't know whether the movement is going to say Jan. 6 was proof of concept for leaderless resistance, because when they organized publicly, the government was able to decapitate the movement temporarily, or whether they see that as a success now that they have infiltrated the mainstream. I can see it going either way. I think certainly we will see both groups and individuals acting with more of a sense of invincibility because they attacked the United States government.\n\nHow does this moment stack up against other pivotal points in your work studying domestic extremism?\n\nWe're in unprecedented territory. The success of the seditious conspiracy charges a couple of years ago was a really important moment because the government had made up for the mistakes that they made in 1988. For the first time, arguably since the Civil War, the United States government had proven without question that groups that organize against the government on behalf of white supremacist and anti-government ideologies were attempting to overthrow the government. And that was a significant deal, not just legally, but also in terms of deterrence and building a democratic norm against violence. All of that has now been destroyed.\n\nIt is fundamentally a rewriting of the norm against violence in democracies. That will affect our own battle here against domestic terrorism, but I think it also has implications abroad. Right now, in Washington, D.C., our national security bureaucracy is obsessed with great power competition, obsessed with strategic competition against China and Russia, and our allies and adversaries are watching crucial democratic norms be undermined in the alleged city on a hill, the United States. And that has impacts abroad. In fact, we saw that in Brazil in January 2023 when an election riot struck that capital city. It's not just an unprecedented impact for our own battle against domestic terrorism, but it also deeply affects American soft power and American foreign policy at a critical moment. I really think this is a transformational day for American national security and American counterterrorism, if not for American democracy writ large.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "I Was a Member of the the NLRB. What Trump's Doing to It Now Is Very Illegal.\n\nSign up for the Slatest to get the most insightful analysis, criticism, and advice out there, delivered to your inbox daily.\n\nThis week, the fight back against President Donald Trump's power grabs over independent agencies is beginning in earnest. On Wednesday, former National Labor Relations Board member Gwynne Wilcox sued Trump over his \" unprecedented and illegal \" removal of her from her position at the start of his new administration.\n\nThe move came one week after Trump fired Wilcox and NLRB general counsel Jennifer Abruzzo. Removal of Abruzzo-while unfortunate for America's workers-was expected and consistent with recent historical and judicial precedent. As she lays out in her lawsuit, however, board member Wilcox's removal was unprecedented and unlawful, in contravention of decades of Supreme Court precedent.\n\nThe National Labor Relations Act makes crystal clear that board members, who serve as specialized judges for labor law, can only be removed from office for \"neglect of duty or malfeasance in office, but for no other cause,\" and only \"upon notice and hearing.\" The president made no pretense of accusing Wilcox of misconduct-she is a dedicated public servant with a sterling reputation-or providing her any opportunity for a hearing. Instead, the president summarily fired her because he disagreed with her decisions as a board member.\n\nThis extraordinary act, which was not only contrary to statute but clearly unlawful under a 90-year-old Supreme Court precedent, has serious implications for the board. The immediate result is to cripple the agency-the board now lacks a quorum and cannot issue decisions, delaying justice for workers, employers, and unions with cases before it. Even after new members are appointed to secure a quorum, more chaos is likely to ensue. If Wilcox's legal challenge succeeds, as it should, board decisions made in her absence could be later deemed invalid, potentially creating years of uncertainty for federal labor law. But the implications for the functioning of the federal government are even greater.\n\nI served on the board for almost 10 years and learned well the unique and important role that adjudicators at independent agencies like the NLRB play within the government. Member Wilcox and I were appointed, with Senate approval, not to carry out the president's orders, but to use our independent judgment and ensure that the mission of the law is served. While I was appointed to the NLRB by President Barack Obama, reappointed by President Trump during his first term, and named chair by President Joe Biden, I was not a part of any of their presidential administrations. I had almost no communication with any White House about any matter during the time I served-and certainly not about cases before the board. Instead, I was free to make decisions based on my expert knowledge of the law. When considering the arguments that parties presented to the board, I never had reason to fear that rejecting the position of a presidential ally-or even the presidentially appointed general counsel-would cost me my job. Member Wilcox and I did not serve at the pleasure of the president, and that was vital to our ability to serve the public.\n\nIndependent agencies play an invaluable role within the executive branch. They reflect Congress' judgment that certain areas of critical government decisionmaking should be insulated from the day-to-day influence of the president. This is particularly important for agencies like the NLRB that decide legal cases. Parties that bring their disputes to the judges at these agencies deserve a fair hearing, and they deserve to have their disputes resolved by experts in the manner that the law-not the whims of presidential favoritism-dictates. Compromising the independence of these adjudicators is an attack on the authority of Congress to create such fair tribunals.\n\nJust as importantly, it is a deep disservice to members of the public who deserve fair and reasoned decisionmaking from those charged with protecting their rights. At my own former agency, a worker who has been unlawfully fired deserves to have their case heard by an impartial tribunal, not a panel of judges who face termination for enforcing the law against companies owned by presidential allies or donors. Giving any president-but especially this president-that power would eviscerate the rule of law.\n\nMere days into the new administration, the pattern that has emerged is clear: From the mass firing of inspectors general to blatant retaliation against career civil servants, it is President Trump's plan to eradicate all vestiges of independent thinking from the executive branch. Unfortunately, if history is any indication, if that long-standing insulation from politics is eliminated, the integrity of independent agencies may be virtually impossible to restore. For the sake of the country, it's vital that the courts considering challenges to these unprecedented abuses of power are willing to do independent thinking of their own and restore respect for both Congress and the Constitution.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Trump Figured Out a New Way to Avoid Facing His Many Alleged Crimes\n\nRead our ongoing coverage of Donald Trump's first criminal trial here .\n\nOn Monday, the jury and reporters heard opening arguments in People of New York v. Donald J. Trump , offering us our best glimpse yet at the cases each side will make-and also at how Donald Trump will respond when forced to silently listen to damning evidence of his alleged crimes described straight to his face.\n\nThe answer to the latter: Trump appears to be intent on only hearing from the cocoon of sycophants and admirers he has built around himself. He seemed to completely ignore the prosecution's opening arguments as they described their \"election fraud\" case against the former president for his role in covering up hush money payments to Stormy Daniels and others in the lead-up to the 2016 election.\n\nFrom my vantage point in the courtroom on Monday-sitting directly behind the defendant, about seven rows behind him-Trump's head was pointed down toward the TV monitor in front of him the entire time Matthew Colangelo, the senior counsel to District Attorney Alvin Bragg, gave the people's opening argument. Trump didn't once appear to look at Colangelo-or even the jury, from what I saw-during this time. Indeed, a reporter next to me, who had been using binoculars to look at the screens at the front of the room that showed Trump's face, said that his eyes appeared to be literally closed for much of the presentation.\n\nBy contrast, as soon as his attorney, Todd Blanche, began the defense's presentation, Trump perked up and stared intently at his lawyer. Indeed, when he left the courtroom, he had his longest stop-and-chat with the press yet, seeming to regurgitate much of Blanche's case to reporters, with comments trashing Biden and complaining about being forced off the campaign trail thrown in for good measure.\n\nWhat was that case Blanche will be making on his client's behalf? Blanche repeatedly reminded the jury that Trump is a former president and that he will refer to him as \"President Trump\" (and perhaps not the more customary \"my client\") \"out of respect for the office.\"\n\nTrump, though, isn't just a former president. \"He's also a man; he's a husband, he's a father, he's a person just like you and just like me,\" Blanche added. The stuff of Clarence Darrow, this was not. Blanche continued with what would amount to the defense's case: The prosecution's documents charges are convoluted and not even truly criminal; the primary witnesses, Michael Cohen and Stormy Daniels, can't be trusted; and this prosecution is for alleged crimes that are really old (most of the evidence, he informed jurors, was \"from years and years ago, pre-COVID,\" as if the pandemic offered a clean sheet, wiping out everyone's crimes).\n\nBlanche laid out exactly how Trump paid Cohen (for what the defense claims were legal services and prosecutors claim was a hush money reimbursement to Daniels), before indignantly declaring: \"None of this was a crime.\"\n\n\"What on earth is a crime? What is a crime about what I just described?\" Blanche asked the jury, in reference to the various accounting procedures of the Trump Organization. \"The 34 counts, ladies and gentleman, are literally just 34 pieces of paper.\"\n\nThose 34 pieces of paper, of course, lay out the trail of money that went from Trump to Cohen to pay back the money that went to Daniels to allegedly keep her quiet on the eve of the 2016 election, as is expected to be corroborated by Daniels' and Cohen's testimony. This is perhaps why the key point of Blanche's opening-and, we expect, of the defense's case-was focused on trashing Daniels and Cohen.\n\nBlanche depicted Cohen as a convicted tax cheat, fraudster, and perjurer who was \"obsessed with President Trump,\" attempting for years to enter his orbit and then, once the two parted ways bitterly, making it his entire public persona to attack Trump in books, podcasts, and TV appearances (including in comments on the eve of the trial).\n\nBlanche also attempted to describe Daniels as a \"sinister\" liar who took part in a plot \"to embarrass Trump and his family\" with a \"false claim of a sexual encounter with President Trump back in 2008.\" (The alleged encounter took place in 2006, and this was likely a mistake by Blanche.)\n\nThe problem for Blanche is that he tried repeatedly to stretch these attacks on Daniels and Cohen beyond the bounds that the judge had previously allowed. When Blanche attempted to describe Daniels as having tried to \"extort President Trump,\" that was quickly objected to; the objection was sustained, and the remarks were stricken from the record. Blanche also repeatedly tried to enter into the proceedings a claim that Cohen perjured himself in Trump's recent civil fraud trial when he refused to take responsibility for tax crimes. (Cohen pleaded guilty to perjury once before, for statements made during congressional testimony in 2018.) Again, the judge repeatedly upheld the prosecution's objections to these comments and for a second time interrupted Blanche's opening argument to bring the lawyers to the bench, presumably to warn the defense not to again delve into an area that was off-limits.\n\nDuring the prosecution's opening, meanwhile, Colangelo faced not one such objection, even as he was unable to maintain the president's attention. What did Trump miss by seeming to ignore Colangelo? The prosecution made the case that the stakes in this case are much higher than a hush money payment to a \"porn star.\"\n\nColangelo described in detail the scheme that Trump allegedly orchestrated with the owner of the National Enquirer, American Media Inc., in the weeks after he announced his presidential run, to \"catch and kill\" damaging stories, publish positive stories, and also publish negative ones trashing GOP rivals like Ben Carson and Sen. Ted Cruz. Colangelo laid out how this was a \"long-running conspiracy to influence the 2016 election to help Donald Trump get elected through illegal expenditures.\" These events are so important to the prosecution's case that their opening witness on Monday was David Pecker, the former CEO of AMI. (For his part, Trump appeared to look up to the witness stand when his old friend was testifying.)\n\n\"It was election fraud, pure and simple,\" Colangelo declared. \"We'll never know-and it doesn't matter-if this conspiracy was the difference-maker in a close election.\"\n\nColangelo asserted that after AMI paid off Playboy Playmate Karen McDougal to cover up a story alleging that Trump had an affair with her, Trump was too cheap to pay AMI back-leaving Trump and Cohen on their own when it came to paying to Daniels to cover up that story on the eve of the election. Finally, Colangelo described the entire process for reimbursing Cohen that resulted in the false documents charges.\n\nBlanche's response to this, it's worth noting, was basically to blow it all off. \"I have a spoiler alert,\" he declared. \"There's nothing wrong with trying to influence an election. It's called democracy. They put something sinister on this idea as if it's a crime. It's not.\"\n\nThe judges who have previously looked at this issue have decided that, yes, it is a crime to violate campaign finance law to unlawfully influence an election-which is why Trump will be sitting in front of a jury and prosecutors in Manhattan for the next six weeks or so, apparently ignoring them. (For their parts, the jurors seemed to stare straight ahead and not look Trump in the face each time they exited and entered the courtroom, despite walking directly in front of him and Trump facing them as they went in and out.)\n\nThroughout the day, the jurors appeared to be in rapt attention for every aspect of the start of the trial; the judge's elaborate, lengthy (and to many in the press corps, boring) jury instructions as well as both the defense and prosecution's opening cases. More than half of the group of 12 jurors and six alternates, in fact, requested pens and pads to take notes in the middle of the first witnesses' opening testimony. They seem to care way more than Trump does.\n\nPerhaps that attention won't be maintained as the days and weeks wear on. Monday was a big day, more for the symbolic purposes of the official start of this trial than the actual substance-big-name reporters like Rachel Maddow who hadn't been there for jury selection were among the press corps on Monday, while the district attorney himself was back in court for the first time since the first day of jury selection last week. The more explosive witnesses will come later in the trial, even as David Pecker, the former CEO of AMI at the center of the catch-and-kill scheme, began his testimony by introducing himself and his journalistic products to the jury. Monday was also the shortest day of the trial yet-proceedings ended early due to the start of the Passover holiday and one juror having a medical appointment.\n\nTuesday is anticipated to be an even shorter day, with Pecker resuming testimony and jurors working for just a few hours. It will start, however, with the bang of a contempt hearing over nearly half a dozen statements Trump has made targeting witnesses in likely violation of a gag order. We'll see if Trump can focus a bit more when he's likely given his first sanction in this proceeding and warned not to do it again .\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "We Have a Full Trump Jury! Here's What We Know About Them So Far\n\nRead our ongoing coverage of Donald Trump's first criminal trial here .\n\nAfter a lot of back-and-forth and multiple jurors backing out, the full 12-person jury in Donald Trump's first criminal trial was rounded out on Thursday, along with one alternate.\n\nHere's what we learned about the latest jurors to be added, and their views of the former president, after their responses to the 42-part questionnaire and about an hour of voir dire. (We wrote about the first half of the jury here .) We will be filling out the rest of the alternates as what is expected to be the final day of jury selection continues on Friday.\n\nThe original Juror No. 2, selected on Tuesday, left the jury at the start of the day after family members told her that her employer, which was discussed in open court and was public knowledge, had been published by multiple media outlets (initially including Slate). A man who lives in Hell's Kitchen and works in investment banking replaced her as Juror No. 2. He said he follows Michael Cohen, MuellerSheWrote, and Kellyanne Conway on X. He said that he followed these accounts because he needed to pay attention to any social media accounts that might \"move markets.\" When asked, he said he would be able to stop following Cohen, who will obviously be a witness in this case, during the trial. The juror added that he was particularly interested in Israel and Ukraine news. On his opinion of Trump, he said that \"I might not like some of his policies,\" but \"it goes both ways.\" He hasn't read any Trump books, but says he has seen quotes from The Art of the Deal . It seems unusual that a juror with so much potential knowledge of the case ended up on this jury, but here we are.\n\nJuror No. 4 is also a replacement, after the original Juror No. 4 was removed from the case on Thursday morning for apparently failing to disclose an arrest in the 1990s over tearing down political posters and an interaction his wife had with the Manhattan District Attorney's office. The new (and hopefully final?) Juror No. 4 is a man originally from California who lives in the West Village. He is married with children and enjoys metalworking and woodworking. In the middle of voir dire, Trump attorney Susan Necheles remarked to Juror No. 4, \"You look like you're cold.\" He responded, \"I am freezing.\" Previously, Trump attorney Todd Blanche had complained to the judge about the temperature in the room. \"Is it possible to warm it up just a degree or two in here?\" he asked the judge. \"If I did that it would probably go up about 30 degrees,\" Judge Merchan responded. \"It is cold, there's no question it's cold. I agree with you, it's chilly in here, no question.\" Nothing was done about the temperature. At the end of the day, Trump started complaining that it was \"freezing\" in the courtroom, including in open court and then in remarks to the press after court let out.\n\nJuror No. 8 is a man originally from Lebanon who has lived on the Upper East Side for decades. He is a retired wealth manager who is married with children. During voir dire, he responded that he doesn't really pay attention to politics. \"I live in New York so I know about President Trump, but I'm more interested in my hobbies,\" he told the court. Those hobbies include fly fishing, skiing, yoga, and meditation. He follows the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the BBC, and CNBC.\n\nJuror No. 9 is a woman who previously lived in New Jersey, who said about her news consumption: \"I don't watch any news or follow it too closely.\" Of the limited things she does read, she listed CNN's \"5 Things\" and the New York Times' \"morning whatever,\" seemingly referring to a newsletter. \"I do have opinions, but I do think I can be fair and impartial,\" she said. \"I don't really know about business so I don't know about President Trump in that state,\" she said. She said she feels the media saturation around Trump has subsided to the point that she does not have a strong opinion now about his politics. \"When he was president, everyone was kind of talking about politics,\" she said. \"But it's not something that happens now that he's not president.\"\n\nJuror No. 10 is a man who was born and raised in Ohio, but lives now in Murray Hill. \"I live with another adult, he's an accountant,\" Juror No. 10 said during the questionnaire. He said he doesn't really follow the news, \"but if anything, it's the New York Times.\" He says he listens to behavioral psychology podcasts and doesn't have a strong opinion about Trump. Of Trump's political policies, Juror No. 10 said \"some I'm in favor [of], some I'm not in favor [of].\"\n\nJuror No. 11 is a woman who lives in Upper Manhattan and is originally from California. She enjoys traveling, eating, and visiting New York. She said, \"I don't really watch the news,\" and noted that she had a close friend convicted of financial fraud, which might make her more sympathetic to Trump in this case. During voir dire, Necheles asked her feelings about Donald Trump and she was very forthright. \"I don't have strong opinions, but I don't like his persona,\" she said. \"How he presents himself in public.\" When asked to expand on how she might be able to be impartial, she said, \"I don't like some of my co-workers, but I don't try to sabotage their work.\" Merchan couldn't hear and asked her to repeat herself. \"I don't like some of my co-workers,\" Juror No. 11 was made to repeat in open court. When asked to expand on her views of Trump himself, she said: \"He seems very selfish and self-serving. I don't really appreciate that from any public servant.\" She described Trump's persona and how he \"portrays himself in public\" as \"not my cup of tea.\" Necheles asked her if she didn't like Trump, and she responded \"yes.\" The defense tried to have Juror No. 11 removed for cause because of these answers, but Merchan said, \"the issue is whether they can be fair and impartial. I think she was adamant that she can be fair and impartial,\" before saying tersely: \"I'm denying your challenge for cause.\" The defense was running out of peremptory challenges at that point and didn't strike this juror.\n\nJuror No. 12 is a woman who has lived in has lived in various places in the U.S. but has now been on the Upper East Side for the past few years. She is a physical therapist with a doctorate in physical therapy. Her husband is a coach for a sports team. She listens to sports and faith-based podcasts, and reads the New York Times, CNN, and USA Today. She described her politics as \"quite centrist\" and said she has \"surrounded myself by people on both sides of the aisle.\" She agreed with Juror No. 11 about Trump's persona. \"Some of the ways he may carry himself in public leaves something to be desired,\" she said, drawing laughter in the press overflow room. \"At the same time, I see him speak to a lot of people in America, and I think there's something to be said for that,\" she added. \"I've learned to appreciate that diversity and appreciate democracy.\" She also said that her \"family background comes from totalitarian regimes\" that involves seeing people \"being sent to prison without a fair trial,\" and because of that she particularly understands the importance of the principle of a defendant being viewed as innocent until proven guilty.\n\nAlternate Juror No. 1 is a woman who grew up in England and now lives in Midtown East. She has a college degree, works as an asset manager, and lives with a boyfriend who is self-employed. She likes to run, hang out with friends, and eat food. Of Trump, she said that she has \"opinions about him the same way I have opinions about most things,\" but \"none that would interfere\" with her ability to judge the \"evidence that was presented.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

He has revealed plans to purge the FBI of his perceived enemies and provided sweeping pardons to his insurrectionist supporters. And he's vowed to launch the \"largest deportation program in American history.\"\n\nTrump appears intent on remaking the executive branch as he sees fit - empowering ally Elon Musk to push aside civil servants, wind down entire agencies, and generally strike terror into the federal workforce.\n\nThe news is changing rapidly. Follow here for the latest updates, analysis, and explainers about Trump's first 100 days in office.\n\nChristian Paz\n\nIt's perhaps the most urgent reason Democrats lost in November: The party has solidly lost the support of working-class voters across the country and doesn't have a solid sense of how to win them back.\n\nNow, a group of Democratic researchers, strategists, and operatives are launching a renewed effort to figure out - and to communicate to the rest of their party - what it is that these voters want, where they think the party went wrong, and how to best respond to their concerns before the 2026 election cycle.\n\nEric Levitz\n\nLast year, a coterie of tech billionaires rallied behind Donald Trump's candidacy. Many had not been lifelong Republicans. In 2016, the venture capitalist Marc Andreessen declared Hillary Clinton the \" obvious choice \" for president, saying Trump's immigration agenda \"makes me sick to my stomach.\" Elon Musk, meanwhile, had once been an Obama-supporting climate hawk . Yet they, and many others in their circles , found their way to supporting an openly authoritarian insurrectionist in 2024.\n\nThey offered many explanations for this decision, some of which were unabashedly self-interested - Trump had promised to limit regulatory scrutiny of their companies and taxation of their capital. But right-wing tech moguls generally insisted that their fundamental concern was for the country, not their profits: Trump's pro-business policies would accelerate economic growth and technological progress - thereby ensuring America's prosperity and global supremacy.\n\nAbdallah Fayyad\n\nMohsen Mahdawi , a Palestinian student at Columbia University, went into a US Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Vermont on Monday for his scheduled naturalization interview. But instead of being granted citizenship, he was arrested and detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), which started the process to deport him . In a memo reviewed by the New York Times, Secretary of State Marco Rubio claimed that Mahdawi's activities - like the protests he helped lead at Columbia - undermined US foreign policy and threatened the Middle East peace process.\n\nWhat happened to Mahdawi is alarming on many levels. Mahdawi has legal status as a permanent resident and has lived in the United States for the past decade. He wasn't charged with a crime, but, like Mahmoud Khalil , another Palestinian Columbia student and green card holder, was detained and ordered to be deported simply for having and expressing views that the secretary of state does not like.\n\nPatrick Reis\n\nThis story appeared in the Logoff , a daily newsletter that helps you stay informed about the Trump administration without letting political news take over your life.

They were monarchs - the iconic, Halloween-colored butterflies - and they were coming here from the US to rest for the cold winter months.\n\nNearly all of the monarchs east of the Rocky Mountains spend winter in this one forest in Mexico. They often fly more than 2,000 miles to get here, pollinating plants as they go. And by December, there are tens of millions of them in the branches of native fir trees, which droop under their weight. Scientists believe the trees provide just the right temperature and humidity for the butterflies to survive winter before they return north.\n\nKevin Carey\n\nEditor's note , April 14, 4 pm ET : On April 14, after this article was published, Harvard University announced that it would not comply with the Trump administration's demands. This article has been lightly updated to reflect this information.\n\nFor the past month, President Donald Trump has been stalking the richest universities in the world like a horror movie serial killer picking off a group of frightened teenagers one by one.

Abrego Garcia are shocking, even by the standards of the Trump administration's treatment of immigrants. The Supreme Court just ruled that the immigrant at the heart of the case get some relief - but that relief is only partial.\n\nIn mid-March, President Donald Trump's government deported Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia to El Salvador, where he is currently detained in a notorious prison supposedly reserved for terrorists. He was deported even though, in 2019, an immigration judge had issued an order explicitly forbidding the government from sending Abrego Garcia to El Salvador because he faced a \"clear probability of future persecution\" if returned to that nation. This court order is still in effect today.\n\nAndrew Prokop\n\nAfter a week of intensifying market turmoil, President Donald Trump stepped back from the brink of financial crisis Wednesday, announcing a 90-day \"pause\" on the exorbitant tariff levels he'd imposed on dozens of countries.\n\nIt was not a total climbdown: Trump intensified a trade war with China by hiking its tariff level up to 125 percent. And he is also keeping in place a 10 percent tariff for other countries.

False reports about a potential pause in tariffs gave Wall Street a brief moment of false hope on Monday, but the White House has only doubled down, threatening to add more tariffs on China. Economists have also raised the alarm, projecting that Trump's tariffs have increased the odds of a recession .\n\nThis is just the latest update to tariff policies that have already caused a good deal of whiplash since Trump took office in January. He threatened to impose tariffs on Colombia and canceled his plan to do so all in a single day. He rolled out a tariff plan for Canada and Mexico, only to postpone implementing it shortly after some tariffs went into effect. And he's been threatening both allies and adversaries with broad and aggressive tariffs for reasons ranging from cracking down on fentanyl to closing a TikTok deal .\n\nDylan Matthews\n\nPresident Donald Trump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" last week unleashed a set of sweeping tariffs - what he calls \"reciprocal\" tariffs, although they're anything but - on imports from nearly every country in the world. The result has been a tanking stock market, immediate layoffs of US autoworkers , and widespread recession fears .\n\nThe pre-history of this disastrous set of policies, which will only make America poorer and alienate it from its closest allies , is as long and weird as you'd expect from Trump. Part of the story seems to involve him losing an auction in 1988 for a piano used in Casablanca to a Japanese collector, thus confirming that Japan was an economic threat. Sure, fine, that seems par for the course with this guy.\n\nPatrick Reis\n\nThis story appeared in The Logoff , a daily newsletter that helps you stay informed about the Trump administration without letting political news take over your life.

But today I want to focus on a story I worry is going under the radar: the president outsourcing national security staffing decisions to a far-right conspiracy theorist.\n\nZack Beauchamp\n\nDonald Trump's tariffs were at once predictable and shocking.\n\nPredictable, in the sense that Trump had been crystal-clear about wanting across-the-board tariffs during the campaign. Shocking, because they have been implemented in a manner that appears extreme and incompetent even by previous Trump standards . As a result, the world is historically unsettled: One metric of global economic uncertainty shows higher levels of concern than at any point in the 21st century , worse than the 2008 financial crisis and even the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nIan Millhiser\n\nOn Thursday, one day after President Donald Trump announced sweeping new tariffs, what appears to be the first lawsuit challenging those tariffs was filed in a federal court in Florida. That alone isn't particularly surprising. The tariffs are expected to drive up the costs of goods in the United States , and have already sent the stock market into a nose dive. That means that a lot of aggrieved potential plaintiffs have standing to challenge the tariffs in court.\n\nWhat is surprising is that the plaintiff in this particular case, known as Emily Ley Paper v. Trump , is represented by the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA), a right-wing legal shop that previously backed Trump's efforts to expand executive power .\n\nNoel King and Gabrielle Berbey\n\nPresident Donald Trump's new tariff chart , which he unveiled Wednesday at the Rose Garden, had a mixture of surprising and predictable countries on the list. A high tariff on China ? Not so surprising. But among the top 10 countries on his chart, eight are in Asia.\n\nMany close US allies like South Korea and Japan were stunned by the steep rate increases applied to their exports.\n\nNicole Narea\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tariffs are already wreaking economic chaos in the US and abroad.\n\nOn Wednesday, he announced a minimum 10 percent tariff on almost all imports, with dozens of countries facing even higher rates.\n\nDylan Scott\n\nWhen Robert F. Kennedy Jr. sought to be confirmed as Donald Trump's secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS), he had to overcome a long record of fringe anti-science beliefs. He had indulged in conspiracies about chem trails, questioned whether HIV was the actual cause of AIDS, and, most notably, spread the repeatedly debunked theory that childhood vaccinations could lead to autism.\n\nIn private meetings with senators and public confirmation hearings, he downplayed that record and claimed he wasn't anti-vaccine: \"I am pro-safety,\" Kennedy said in his opening statement at one hearing. \"I believe vaccines have a critical role in health care.\" He gave assurances to Sen. Bill Cassidy of Louisiana, an MD and one of the last Republican holdouts on his nomination, that he would not change federal vaccine guidance\n\nZack Beauchamp\n\nThe Trump administration's tariffs are, by every reasonable account, an economic catastrophe in the making . So why are they happening?\n\nOne explanation is that this is simply democracy at work. President Donald Trump campaigned on doing more or less exactly what he's just done , and the voting public elected him. So here we are.\n\nKenny Torrella\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. visited West Virginia on March 28 to promote his \"Make America Healthy Again\" (MAHA) agenda at an event where he cruelly criticized state Gov. Patrick Morrisey's weight. Kennedy suggested that he would host a public weigh-in and celebration once Morrisey had shed 30 pounds, and Kennedy had an idea about how the governor could do it: \"We're going to put him on a carnivore diet,\" Kennedy said.\n\nWeeks before, science journalist and meat enthusiast Nina Teicholz argued in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece titled \" Meat Will Make America Healthy Again \" that when the US government updates its dietary guidelines this year, it needs to keep meat and other animal proteins firmly at the center of the plate.\n\nChristian Paz\n\nDemocratic voters just won a 10-point landslide in a state that President Donald Trump won last year. How?\n\nThe answer is a defining trend of modern elections: There are two different kinds of electorates who come out to vote in the Trump era.\n\nEric Levitz\n\nDonald Trump has said that \"tariff\" is the \" most beautiful word in the dictionary .\" And throughout his first months in office, he has given Americans plenty of cause for googling that word's definition.\n\nThe president announced Wednesday - a day he dubbed \" Liberation Day \" - that he will impose tariffs of at least 10 percent on all foreign-made goods. For products made in China, the tariff rate will be 34 percent; for those made in Vietnam, it will be 46 percent; for the European Union, it will be 20 percent. Trump framed these tariffs as \"reciprocal,\" meaning that that they match the level of trade restrictions that each foreign nation imposes on US products. But this is not true - Trump's tariffs greatly exceed those of America's targeted trade partners.\n\nZack Beauchamp\n\nIn God and Man at Yale , the 1951 book that made William F. Buckley famous, American conservatism's founding father argues that academic freedom is premised on a fiction.\n\nWhile professors claim that they are merely attempting to equip their students with the tools necessary to comprehend the world and succeed in it, they are in fact engaged in conveying a particular set of truths and values to their students - meaning, at the time, liberal and socialist values. In response, Buckley argues, university trustees and administrators should \"banish\" favorable discussion of such ideas from the classroom, replacing them with a curriculum that emphasizes the eternal truths of Christianity and capitalism.\n\nPatrick Reis and Nicole Narea\n\nThis story appeared in The Logoff , a daily newsletter that helps you stay informed about the Trump administration without letting political news take over your life.

For products made in China, the tariff rate will be 34 percent; for those made in Vietnam, it will be 46 percent; for the European Union, it will be 20 percent. Trump framed these tariffs as \"reciprocal,\" meaning that that they match the level of trade restrictions that each foreign nation imposes on US products. But this is not true - Trump's tariffs greatly exceed those of America's targeted trade partners.\n\nTrump has already imposed tariffs on steel and aluminum made outside the US, all products made in Canada or Mexico , all Chinese goods , and all foreign-made cars , among other things, claiming these moves will strengthen the economy long-term while downplaying concern they'll lead to a recession.\n\nThe threat of tariffs have led to massive economic uncertainty, with Trump's on-again, off-again declarations tanking stock markets and souring consumer sentiment , though some longtime critics of globalization appear optimistic . Meanwhile, many Americans are worried and confused - tariffs haven't been as significant to the US economy in nearly a century - and they're understandably unsure about what tariffs are, how they'll affect their wallets, why governments would implement them, and whether the president's policy will work on its own terms.\n\nWe'll help you make sense of this moment. Follow here for the latest news, analysis, and explainers.\n\nEric Levitz\n\nIn recent days, Donald Trump has signaled eagerness to reach a trade agreement with China. The president said Tuesday that his 145 percent tariffs on Chinese imports will \"come down substantially\" in the near future.\n\nOn Thursday, Trump said that his administration is already negotiating with China over trade, saying, \"They had a meeting this morning.\" Asked who precisely had a meeting, Trump told reporters, \"it doesn't matter who 'they' is.\"\n\nNicole Narea\n\nIf anything is safe from the economic chaos caused by President Donald Trump's tariffs, it's probably gold - or at least that's what investors seem to think.\n\nThe price of gold has increased rapidly in the months since Trump took office, surging particularly since his March 2 announcement of a baseline 10 percent tariff on all US imports. This week, it briefly climbed to a record high of more than $3,500 per ounce during day trading, before closing slightly lower than that.\n\nNicole Narea\n\nIt's not just the stock market.\n\nIn the few weeks since President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs, a series of indicators from across the economy suggest anxiety - or even outright panic - is in the economic driver's seat.\n\nAdam Clark Estes\n\nLess than six months ago, after an inappropriate amount of research, I bought a new toaster for $30. My old toaster had died, as old toasters do , and I wanted to buy one cheap enough that I wouldn't be mad when I had to replace it. If President Donald Trump's current 145 percent tariff on Chinese imports remains in effect, the same toaster could cost me about $75 when that time comes.\n\nYou've probably seen a lot of these Trump tariff calculations for consumer products lately - especially those for goods made in China, from iPhones to baby products . In many instances, it's hard to even guess how much things will cost because the tariff structure has become so complicated and is constantly changing.\n\nDylan Matthews\n\n\"Jobs and factories will come roaring back into our country,\" President Donald Trump promised on \"Liberation Day,\" as he announced tariffs that have shocked global markets and set the country on course for a recession . \"We will supercharge our domestic industrial base. We will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers, and ultimately, more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers.\"\n\nThis has long been the key argument behind protectionist policies like Trump's: They will bring manufacturing jobs back to America. It's a claim popular not just on the right, but with pro-tariff Democrats and labor unions, too. Chris Deluzio, a House Democrat from western Pennsylvania (a traditional hotbed of protectionism), has urged his party to \"embrace tariffs as one component of a broader industrial strategy to revitalize American manufacturing and make whole communities that have been hollowed out by decades of bad trade policy.\"\n\nSean Collins and Miles Bryan\n\nThe United States and China are locked in an economic war. They've levied tit-for-tat tariffs on each other, and there's little sign of detente.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in a statement Tuesday that \" The ball is in China's court . China needs to make a deal with us. We don't have to make a deal with them.\"\n\nAndrew Prokop\n\nDonald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff policy, in which he declared trade war on the entire world simultaneously, was a bizarre and nonsensical undertaking, seemingly shaped only by the president's own whims .\n\nBut since that initial announcement, the policy has been modified to bear at least a little bit more of a resemblance to what Trump's more sophisticated advisers wanted.\n\nJoshua Keating\n\nWhen President Donald Trump unveiled tariffs on more than 180 countries and territories early this month, there was one place that was conspicuously left off the list: Russia.\n\nInitially, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told Axios that Russia had been excluded because US sanctions already \"preclude any meaningful trade.\" But this doesn't make a lot of sense.\n\nConstance Grady\n\n\"Tariffs or this?\" mused an X user on April 5 , the day after President Donald Trump's newly announced tariffs sent the Dow Jones spinning into its biggest drop since the height of the pandemic .\n\nThe \"this\" in question was a TikTok video from last summer in which the all-women executive team of an Australian skin care company playfully sang and danced around their office. Faced with the option of a woman joking about being a \"Gen Z boss\" and probable economic ruin: \"Tariffs,\" the X user concluded.\n\nChristian Paz\n\nIn between jokes about identity politics and the taste of urine, massively popular podcaster Theo Von and his most recent show guest debated President Donald Trump's tariff and trade policy. Would rising prices in the short term justify the supposed return of manufacturing jobs to America? Or would automation and artificial intelligence end up vaporizing those jobs as well?\n\n\"Here's the thing with tariffs. Is the goal of tariffs...if it costs more for people to bring their products in, then they'll build them here?\" Von asked comedian Mark Normand on the April 7 episode of This Past Weekend With Theo Von .\n\nAbdallah Fayyad\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tariff plan has rattled Wall Street, alarmed the United States' trading partners, and made Americans afraid of checking their retirement accounts.\n\nIt's also been extremely confusing: After announcing that he would implement steep tariffs across the board (for reasons that didn't make much sense ), Trump walked back some of the tariffs before they were set to go into effect. However, he is still waging a trade war with China , and the tariff rates on many other countries remain much higher than they were before this whole saga began.\n\nAndrew Prokop\n\nFor many years, Donald Trump has viewed unpredictability as one of his greatest negotiating assets.\n\nHe believes deliberately acting \"crazy,\" as he reportedly told aides in 2017, is a highly effective way to win concessions in advance of a deal. As I've written , this is akin to what President Richard Nixon dubbed the \" madman theory \" - that if he convinced foreign leaders he was willing to do unthinkable things, they'd back down out of fear.\n\nAnna North\n\nThis story originally appeared in Kids Today , Vox's newsletter about kids, for everyone. Sign up here for future editions .\n\nHaving a baby is expensive.\n\nNicole Narea\n\nMuch has apparently changed in the last 24 hours in the US economy.\n\nThe S&P 500 opened Wednesday more than 10 percent down since President Donald Trump announced his sweeping tariffs on American imports. Goldman Sachs had raised its recession odds to 45 percent . Investors believed they no longer had the ear of the president . US Treasury yields were spiking , a signal that investors' confidence in the strength of the American economy was wavering.\n\nEric Levitz\n\nPresident Donald Trump has launched a global trade war , raising prices and tanking stocks in the process. His approval rating is in free fall . And yet, somehow, the Democrats are in disarray.\n\nOr at least, they are bitterly bickering over what their party's stance on trade should be.\n\nPatrick Reis\n\nThis story appeared in The Logoff , a daily newsletter that helps you stay informed about the Trump administration without letting political news take over your life. Subscribe here .\n\nWelcome to The Logoff: Today I'm breaking down President Donald Trump's wild afternoon of trade moves.\n\nEric Levitz\n\nPresident Donald Trump beat a partial - and possibly temporary - retreat from the most radical version of his trade agenda Wednesday.\n\nOne week ago, he vowed to impose massive new tariffs on virtually all imports from nearly all countries. Although rates varied by nation, many countries faced tariffs of more than 30 percent. Trump branded these duties \"reciprocal tariffs,\" claiming ( falsely ) that they mirrored foreign nations' trade barriers to American goods. The policy triggered a stock market collapse and upended countless businesses dependent on foreign suppliers for goods or parts.\n\nAndrew Prokop\n\nAfter a week of intensifying market turmoil, President Donald Trump stepped back from the brink of financial crisis Wednesday, announcing a 90-day \"pause\" on the exorbitant tariff levels he'd imposed on dozens of countries.\n\nIt was not a total climbdown: Trump intensified a trade war with China by hiking its tariff level up to 125 percent. And he is also keeping in place a 10 percent tariff for other countries. (Details on exactly which countries remained murky as of mid-Wednesday afternoon.)\n\nAndrew Prokop\n\nPresident Donald Trump has been angry about trade for nearly half a century - and throughout all that time, he's kept on making the same complaint.\n\nThe problem, he says, is that the US has trade deficits with other countries. He believes that, if we buy more from a country than they buy from us, the other country is \" beating \" us. And he wants to \"beat\" them instead.\n\nNicole Narea\n\nThe US stock market has lost trillions of dollars in value in the days since President Donald Trump announced major tariffs on American imports. On Tuesday afternoon, the S&P 500 was down more than 11 percent since Trump's announcement of the tariffs. Global stock indices, such as the Japanese Nikkei and the German DAX , have also plunged as the tariffs disrupt world trade.\n\nStocks recovered somewhat after Trump indicated that he's in negotiations - including with countries such as Japan and South Korea - to broker what his press secretary Karoline Leavitt called \"tailor-made\" trade deals . But the question is how quickly those deals can get done without wreaking further havoc on financial markets.\n\nJoshua Keating\n\nIt's not often the case, but this is a week when the hard-working spokespeople for China's foreign ministry have a pretty easy job.\n\nThe trade war between the United States and China is escalating rapidly. In February, President Trump imposed 20 percent tariffs on China as punishment for fentanyl trafficking . Last Thursday, he added 34 percent tariffs. When China retaliated with an import tax of its own, Trump imposed an additional 50 percent tariff , which would bring the total rate to a staggering 104 percent.\n\nZack Beauchamp\n\nPresident Donald Trump's tariffs haven't only demolished trillions in wealth and raised the chance of a global recession. They've also led some prominent Trump supporters to wonder whether they made a huge mistake.\n\nTrump supporters ranging from mega-investor Bill Ackman to anti-vax influencer Alex Berenson have expressed remorse about their decision to support Trump in November. Some have been harsh: Razib Khan, a geneticist and influential science writer on the right, called himself \" r*****ed and wrong \" for discounting the risk that Trump would actually do the tariffs.\n\nNoel King and Miles Bryan\n\nMost mainstream economists agree that the massive tariffs Donald Trump is imposing on most of the United States's trading partners are a bad idea - that they will make the economy weaker and inflation worse .\n\nNot Oren Cass.\n\nAllie Volpe\n\nThe Trump administration's announcement of widespread tariffs has thrown the stock market into a tailspin, increasing the odds of a recession.\n\nThis economic turmoil could have far-ranging implications, and some Americans' first question - and the outcome they believe they have most control over - is how to handle their retirement savings and other investments. While recent losses to your 401(k) account may inspire panic, experts caution most people (basically anyone not nearing retirement or recently retired , in which case the advice may vary) from making drastic changes to their investment strategy.\n\nNicole Narea\n\nIn less than a week, President Donald Trump's tariffs have already created economic chaos in the US and abroad.\n\nOn Wednesday, he announced a minimum 10 percent tariff on almost all imports, with dozens of countries facing far higher rates.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\n© 2025 Vox Media , LLC.

It'll go on Saturday. We have a very big meeting, and we'll see what can happen,\" he said.\n\n\"And I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious. And the obvious is not something that I want to be involved with, or, frankly, that Israel wants to be involved with if they can avoid it,\" he said.\n\n\"So, we're going to see if we can avoid it. But it's getting to be very dangerous territory. And hopefully those talks will be successful. And I think it would be in Iran's best interests if they are successful,\" he said.\n\nWhen asked, Trump would not reveal the location or identify the U.S. negotiators. However, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi later confirmed the meeting in a post on X, in which he said that the \"indirect high-level talks\" on April 12 would take place in Oman.\n\n\"It is as much an opportunity as it is a test,\" Araghchi said in the post.\n\n\"If the talks aren't successful with Iran, I think Iran is going to be in great danger,\" Trump said. \"And I hate to say it, great danger, because they can't have a nuclear weapon. You know, it's not a complicated formula. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. That's all there is.\"\n\nLast month, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkiansaid rejected an offer for direct talks in a letter sent by Trump, according to state media.\n\nIran's diplomatic mission in New York had no immediate comment Monday.\n\nIf the talks happen, they would mark the first significant, publicly known direct talks between the U.S. and Iran since President Trump exited the 2015 Obama-era nuclear deal (the JCPOA) with Tehran in 2018.\n\nIn recent weeks, Trump has threatened potential military action against Iran to keep it from developing nuclear weapons.\n\n\"We have a very big meeting on Saturday, and we're dealing with them directly,\" he said Monday. \"You know, a lot of people say, 'Oh, maybe you're going through surrogates or you're not dealing directly. You're dealing through other countries.' No, we're dealing with them directly. And, maybe a deal is going to be made.\"\n\n\"That'll be great,\" he continued. \"That be it'd be really great for Iran, I can tell you that. But hopefully we're not going to have to get into that. We we're meeting, very importantly on Saturday at almost the highest level. And we'll see how it works out.\"\n\nIran's nuclear \"breakout time\" has dwindled dramatically, with most experts agreeing that Tehran could now produce enough fissile material for a nuclear bomb in just one or two weeks. It would likely take several months to a year beyond that for Iran to develop a deliverable warhead.\n\nABC News' Michelle Stoddart and Molly Nagle contributed to this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

The ball is in America's court,\" he wrote on social media.\n\nIranian news agency Tasnim later said Araghchi would lead Tehran's delegation and negotiate through a mediator with U.S. Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff.\n\nMr. Trump's meeting with Netanyahu took place as new tariffs the president is levying on Israel and the rest of the world are about to go into effect on Wednesday. The U.S. is set to impose 17% tariffs on imports from Israel, effective Wednesday. Other nations, too, are scrambling to try to reverse Mr. Trump's tariffs.\n\nNetanyahu said he told Mr. Trump that Israel would soon address his country's trade deficit with the U.S.\n\n\"I can tell you that I said to the president, a very simple thing - we will eliminate the trade deficit with the United States,\" Netanyahu said. \"We intend to do it very quickly. We think it's the right thing to do. And we're also going to eliminate trade barriers.\"\n\nStill, Mr. Trump didn't indicate he's quite ready to eliminate tariffs on imports from Israel.\n\n\"Well, we're talking about a whole new trade - maybe not, maybe not,\" Mr. Trump said in response to a reporter's question. \"Don't forget, we help Israel a lot.\"\n\nThe Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones were whipsawing Monday after two consecutive days of losses last week, the biggest two-day drop of the stock market since the pandemic in March 2020.\n\nThe president was asked by a reporter if he's considering a pause on the tariffs to ease the turmoil in the markets.\n\n\"Well, we're not looking at that,\" the president replied. \"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals.\"\n\nThe president said of the the tariffs he is imposing, \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"\n\nBut he left open the possibility that some countries could reduce their tariffs. \"There also can be negotiations,\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nThe White House canceled a scheduled joint news conference with Mr. Trump and Netanyahu abruptly and without explanation just ahead of the Israeli leader's arrival.\n\nAhead of the Netanyahu meeting, Mr. Trump held a joint phone call with French President Emmanuel Macron, Egyptian President Fattah al-Sisi and King Abdullah of Jordan, according to a Jordanian official.\n\nIt's Netanyahu's second visit to the White House since Mr. Trump took office in January. Netanyahu also visited Mr. Trump in early February. Since Mr. Trump and Netanyahu last met, the fragile ceasefire between Hamas and Israel has broken. Israel has since renewed its military offensive in the Gaza Strip.\n\nThe president's decision to levy tariffs on friends and foes alike is not only roiling the markets, but setting the United States' relationships with traditional allies on unsure footing. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said the old U.S.-Canada relationship is \"over\" and Canada will need to \"dramatically reduce\" its reliance on the U.S.\n\nKathryn Watson is a politics reporter for CBS News Digital, based in Washington, D.C.\n\n© 2025 CBS Interactive Inc.

      "text": "What Trump has said about tariffs as stock market reacts\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  April 9, 2025 / 4:01 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nPresident Trump has shaken up stock markets around the world as he announced sweeping tariffs on what he dubbed \"Liberation Day\" last week, then partially reversed course shortly after. The Trump administration's imposition and walkback of tariffs has led to stock volatility and sparked worries of a global trade war and recession.\n\nIn the United States, many are concerned about levies driving up the price of everyday goods, and Goldman Sachs economists on Monday cited them in a report raising the odds of a recession to 45%. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon cautioned the tariffs could slow the economy and \"will likely increase inflation.\"\n\nMr. Trump's April 2 announcement set out a baseline 10% tax on all U.S. imports, plus additional \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from 90 countries. He pitched the tariffs as a strategy to reduce the trade deficit between the U.S. and other global powers, including China and the European Union.\n\nExactly a week later, the president paused many of the newly announced reciprocal duties, with the exception of those placed on China.\n\nThe reversal came a little over a month after Mr. Trump imposed 25% tariffs on nearly all goods imported from Mexico and Canada, and then announced a pause just two days later .\n\nCBS News 24/7 is answering your questions about tariffs in a special airing on Wednesday at 6 p.m. ET. Download the CBS News app on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.\n\nAs markets fluctuate, and with many of his most recent reciprocal import duties paused, here's what Mr. Trump has said about the tariffs.\n\nTwo days after Mr. Trump said during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that he's not looking at any pauses in tariffs, he announced a 90-day pause on most of his planned tariffs and a lowering of the \"reciprocal tariff\" rate to 10% - with the exception of China.\n\nThe U.S. stock market surged immediately after the president's announcement.\n\nWhen reporters asked about mixed messages from his administration on whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, the president said on April 7, \"they both can be true.\"\n\n\"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals,\" Mr. Trump said. \"No other president's going to do this, what I'm doing.\"\n\nOn April 9, citing China's unwillingness to negotiate, Mr. Trump announced on Truth Social that he's raising taxes on China to 125%. China announced earlier in the day that it would raise its tariffs on U.S. products to 84% .\n\nThe president previously said there are \"other things besides tariffs\" that could be open to negotiation, like other countries' \"standards and tests\" that Mr. Trump said make trading more difficult, but he didn't provide further details.\n\nIn a Truth Social post on April 5 as his 10% universal tariffs took effect, Mr. Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" and acknowledged things \"won't be easy.\"\n\n\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close. They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly,\" he wrote.\n\n\"We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before. Already, more than FIVE TRILLION DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT, and rising fast! THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN. HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"\n\nMr. Trump doubled down on his trade position while speaking to reporters on April 6 on Air Force One, making clear he did not intend to budge on the reciprocal tariffs set to take effect later this week, nor the universal levies already implemented.\n\nAddressing the U.S. market plunge that followed his April 2 announcement - Wall Street's worst in five years - and seemingly preparing Americans for more potential market pain to come, the president said, \"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"\n\n\"What's going to happen with the market I can't tell you, but I can tell you our country has gotten a lot stronger,\" Mr. Trump added.\n\nHe also said various world leaders had expressed interest in negotiating to roll back tariffs as global markets, reacting to the levies, began to nosedive, too.\n\n\"I spoke to a lot of leaders, European, Asian, from all over the world,\" Mr. Trump said. \"They're dying to make a deal. And I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country. We're not going to do that, because to me a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses or at worst, going to be breaking even.\"\n\nEchoing Mr. Trump's sentiment, Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick suggested the administration would not waver on the new round of tariffs, in an interview on \"Face the Nation with Margaret Brennan.\" Arguing the policies will help protect U.S. factories and \"reset the power of the United States of America,\" Lutnick acknowledged that \"it is going to be a big change.\"\n\n\"This is the moment that the United States of America takes hold of itself, and Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Lutnick said. \"This is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute.\"\n\nIn the hour before trading opened on Wall Street on Monday, April 7, the president took to Truth Social to support his flurry of tariffs and appeared to coin a new Trump-ism referencing panic.\n\n\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" Mr. Trump said in the post . \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"\n\nHe posted as international markets were experienced significant losses, with indices in Australia, Germany, Hong Kong, Shanghai, South Korea, Taiwan and Tokyo all dropping. U.S. markets went on to have a roller-coaster day , with the S&P 500 ending down a modest 12 points, or 0.2%, at 5,062, the Dow Jones Industrial Average losing 349 points, or 0.9%, while the Nasdaq Composite eked out a small gain, rising 15 points to close up 0.1%.\n\nMr. Trump vowed on Monday, April 7, to raise duties imposed on China to 50% after Beijing issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on the U.S. over the weekend.\n\nOn Truth Social, the president said Beijing had acted despite his previous \"warning\" that the U.S. would only respond to retaliatory tariffs with even higher taxes for the issuing country, and urged its leaders to withdraw the 34% increase or face higher costs.\n\n\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" Mr. Trump said. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"\n\nChina did not withdraw its tariffs and the ratcheting up continued, with Mr. Trump increasing U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to 104% and then and then 125% as China upped its tariffs on U.S. goods to 84% .\n\nEmily Mae Czachor is a news editor at CBSNews.com.

Download the CBS News app on your phone or connected TV to watch it live.\n\nChina's commerce ministry vowed Tuesday that Beijing would \"fight to the end\" and take countermeasures against the U.S. if the president doesn't back away from his latest threat.\n\nOn April 2, Mr. Trump announced so-called reciprocal tariffs on imports from about 90 nations, adding to a 10% global tax applied to all products shipped to the U.S. Describing the announcement as \" Liberation Day ,\" the president said the new taxes are needed to erase trade imbalances between the U.S. and other countries, ranging from China to members of the European Union.\n\nIn response to Mr. Trump's imposition of a 34% tariff on Chinese imports, which is set to go into effect on April 9, Beijing last week announced it would add a 34% tariff on imports of all U.S. products beginning April 10.\n\nIf Mr. Trump implements his plans, U.S. tariffs on imports from China would reach a combined 104%. The new taxes would be on top of 20% tariffs aimed at spurring China to crack down on fentanyl trafficking and his separate 34% tariffs announced last week.\n\nLast year, the U.S. imported about $439 billion worth of goods from China, ranging from Apple iPhones to clothing, according to data from the U.S. Trade Representative.\n\nExcluding the threat of an added 50% levy on Chinese imports, American consumers could face higher costs of about $3,789 per year due to the previously announced tariffs, according to an analysis from the Yale Budget Lab.\n\nConsumers generally bear the brunt of tariffs because importers like Walmart, which must pay the import duties when they accept shipments from other nations, typically seek to spread all or most of the cost through higher price tags on imported goods. Because of those dynamics, many economists say inflation is likely to reignite this year.\n\nWall Street has been spooked by Mr. Trump's growing trade war, with economists warning that the conflict could slam economic growth and even potentially trigger a recession.\n\nIn his social media post threatening to add new tariffs to China, Mr. Trump added that he plans to start negotiations with other nations \"immediately.\"\n\nIn a separate Truth Social post on Monday, Mr. Trump also said he spoke with Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba to start trade negotiations. He complained, \"they have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade\" and \"they don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs.\"\n\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro suggested countries would need to do much more than simply lower their own tariff rates to reach deals, saying they would have to make structural changes to their tax and regulatory codes.\n\n\"Let's take Vietnam,\" he said on CNBC. \"When they come to us and say, 'We'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters.\"\n\nThe Associated  Press contributed to this report.\n\nAimee Picchi is the associate managing editor for CBS MoneyWatch, where she covers business and personal finance.

The interagency committee failed to reach a consensus last year and left the decision up to former President Biden, who ultimately blocked the merger , saying he wanted to protect the nation's security and infrastructure, as well as supply chain resiliency.\n\nCFIUS reviews transactions involving foreign investment in the United States to see how they would impact the nation's security. According to the memorandum, Mr. Trump wants a recommendation from CFIUS in 45 days.\n\n\"CFIUS shall submit a recommendation to me describing whether any measures proposed by the parties are sufficient to mitigate any national security risks identified by CFIUS,\" the memo reads.\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, both Mr. Trump and Biden vowed to block the deal. But the president said in February that Nippon Steel would drop its bid to acquire U.S. Steel and instead \"invest heavily\" in the company without taking a majority stake.\n\nThe proposed merger has been met with opposition from the United Steelworkers union from the start, despite support from the rank-and-file steelworkers. Community leaders have said the future of steelmaking in the Mon Valley is at stake , knowing U.S Steel has warned that if the deal doesn't go through , it could begin transferring operations down south and move its headquarters out of Downtown Pittsburgh.\n\nMadeline Bartos is a digital web producer for CBS Pittsburgh who has worked with KDKA since 2019.\n\n© 2025 CBS Broadcasting Inc.

      "text": "April 7, 2025 - Donald Trump presidency news\n\n• Markets and trade war: President Donald Trump threatened to add new 50% tariffs on China if Beijing doesn't remove its retaliatory duties by tomorrow and said \"he's not looking\" at a pause in enforcing the sweeping tariffs he announced last week . Global markets tumbled earlier today , while US stocks mostly fell after an extremely volatile day Monday.\n\n• SCOTUS rules in Trump's favor: The Supreme Court allowed Donald Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Act for now, handing the White House a significant victory that will let immigration officials rely on a sweeping wartime authority to rapidly deport alleged gang members.\n\n• Trump meets with Netanyahu: Trump's tariff comments came during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu at the White House after the US hit Israel with 17% tariffs. Netanyahu said his country will eliminate the trade deficit and trade barriers with the US \"very quickly.\" Meanwhile, the EU said it is \"ready to negotiate\" with the US and offer zero tariffs on industrial goods.\n\nOur live coverage of Donald Trump's presidency has ended for the day. Follow the latest updates or read through the posts below.\n\nPresident Donald Trump fired a senior US military official at NATO today, Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island said in a news release.\n\nThe top Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee called the dismissal of Vice Adm. Shoshana Chatfield, the US military representative to the NATO Military Committee, \"disgraceful\" and \"unjustified.\"\n\n\"Admiral Chatfield's record of selfless service is unblemished by President Trump's behavior,\" Reed said. \"I urge my Republican colleagues to join me in demanding an explanation from President Trump and (Secretary of Defense Pete) Hegseth.\"\n\nIt was not immediately clear why Chatfield was fired. The move comes amid a purge of senior leadership in the military aimed at those who have been the target of right-wing criticism.\n\n\"The silence from my Republican colleagues is deeply troubling,\" Reed said. \"In less than three months, President Trump has fired 10 generals and admirals without explanation, including our most experienced combat leaders. I cannot fathom how anyone could stand silently by while the President causes great harm to our military and our nation.\"\n\nChatfield was unanimously confirmed by the Senate to the post in December 2023. She previously was the first female president of the US Naval War College, a role she took on in 2019 .\n\nReuters was first to report that Chatfield was removed from her position. The Defense Department and the White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment from CNN.\n\nHong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index opened about 2% higher on Tuesday, recovering some losses following its worst day of trading in almost three decades.\n\nThe index closed 13.2% lower on Monday. It was the biggest one-day drop since October 1997, during the tough days of the Asian financial crisis.\n\nThe index is composed of stocks from some of Hong Kong's and mainland China's largest listed companies, including Alibaba, HSBC, Tencent, Meituan and Xiaomi. Some of those shares bounced back Tuesday. Alibaba opened 4.8% higher, while HSBC rose 2.7% and Tencent increased 1.7%.\n\nAfter Hong Kong and mainland Chinese markets plummeted, Central Huijin Investment, an arm of China's sovereign wealth fund, promised to increase its share holdings to \"resolutely maintain\" the smooth operation of the stock market.\n\nAnd in a statement released just before stock markets opened on Tuesday, the People's Bank of China said it \"firmly supported\" Central Huijin Investment in increasing its holdings of stock market index funds. It vowed to provide \"ample re-lending support\" to Central Hujin when necessary to resolutely maintain the stable operation of the capital market.\n\nOther Chinese state-backed funds - including China Chengtong Holdings Group, China Reform Holdings and China Electronics Technology Group Corporation - also announced plans to increase holdings.\n\nPaul Chan, Hong Kong's financial secretary, stressed the resilience of the city's stock market on Monday in response to the rout, saying that the stock market has been functioning orderly.\n\n\"We do not think the current volatility in the market warrants the taking of any drastic measures,\" he said at a news conference .\n\nChina's Commerce Ministry says it \"firmly opposes\" the additional 50% tariffs on Chinese imports threatened by US President Donald Trump on Monday, calling it \"a mistake on top of a mistake.\"\n\n\"If the United States implements the escalating tariff measures, China will resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests,\" the ministry said in a statement on Tuesday (local time).\n\nIt denounced Trump's \"reciprocal tariffs\" as \"completely unfounded\" and \"typical unilateral bullying.\"\n\n\"The US threat to escalate tariffs is a mistake on top of a mistake, which once again exposes the blackmailing nature of the US.\n\nChina will never accept this. If the US insists on its own way, China will fight to the end,\" the ministry said.\n\nReiterating that there are no winners in a trade war, the ministry emphasized that \"pressure and threats are not the right way to engage with China.\"\n\n\"We urge the US to immediately correct its erroneous practices, cancel all unilateral tariff measures against China, stop suppressing China in the economic and trade sphere, and resolve differences properly through equal dialogue based on mutual respect,\" the statement added.\n\nVietnam has promised to buy more American goods, including defense and security products, Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh said in a statement issued on Monday, according to a Reuters report .\n\nChinh was quoted as saying the country will also seek faster deliveries of commercial planes that Vietnamese airlines had ordered from the US.\n\nThe Southeast Asian country is a major clothing and footwear manufacturing hub for brands like Adidas and Nike and is seeking to delay the 46% tariffs imposed by Trump.\n\nMany countries in Southeast Asia and South Asia - including Laos, Vietnam, Myanmar and Sri Lanka - were hit by tariffs of over 40% , which could cripple their export-reliant and extremely vulnerable economies.\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sent an email to DHS component agencies tonight announcing that employees would once again have the choice to accept deferred resignation or early retirement options, according to a copy of the email obtained by CNN.\n\nEmployees have just one week to accept.\n\nNoem also made clear that law enforcement officials within DHS \"will be exempt from participation in these programs due to their essential mission-critical responsibilities.\"\n\nThe Trump administration originally offered the deferred resignation program to about 2 million employees across the federal government, with limited time to accept. Roughly 75,000 participants signed up. Workers were notified about the initial offer in a mass email from the Office of Personnel Management with the subject line of \"Fork in the Road,\" the same subject line billionaire Elon Musk used when culling employees at Twitter after he purchased it.\n\nNoem's Monday email comes amid tension at DHS agencies, particularly the US Secret Service where agents have been bracing for cuts.\n\nThe email, titled: \"Reshaping of the DHS workforce,\" lists several options for voluntary separation including a $25,000 lump sum \"buyout,\" voluntary early retirement, and deferred resignation which allows employees a brief period of administrative leave to submit retirement paperwork and wrap up tasks.\n\n\"By offering these options, we intend to provide flexibility for employees who may be considering a change, retirement, or new career opportunities,\" Noem wrote.\n\nNotably absent from the email are specific cuts that have been anticipated at component agencies.\n\nIt's looking like a more positive day for Asian stocks, after a historic rout today.\n\nJapan's benchmark Nikkei 225, which tracks more than 200 of the country's biggest listed companies, opened in the black and was last trading more than 5% higher after Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke with US President Donald Trump just hours before.\n\nShortly after the two leaders spoke on a call today, US Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent announced he and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer would lead trade talks with Japan, a US treaty ally.\n\nBessent wrote in a post on X , that Trump has tasked them to \"open negotiations to implement the President's vision for the new Golden Age of Global Trade.\"\n\nEarlier today, Ishiba had told Trump that Japan was the largest foreign investor in the US. The prime minister \"expressed strong concerns\" that the tariffs could weaken the capacity of Japanese companies to continue investing, according to a statement from his office.\n\nIshiba added that instead of imposing tariffs, both countries should pursue efforts that provide mutual benefits.\n\nIn South Korea, the Kospi was last trading 1.5% higher. Australia's benchmark ASX 200 was about 1% higher.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said today is \"a great day for justice in America\" after the Supreme Court decision that allows him to enforce the Alien Enemies Act, for now.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has upheld the Rule of Law in our Nation by allowing a President, whoever that may be, to be able to secure our Borders, and protect our families and our Country, itself. A GREAT DAY FOR JUSTICE IN AMERICA,\" the president wrote on Truth Social.\n\nThe unsigned decision in the case, the most closely watched emergency appeal pending at the Supreme Court, lets Trump invoke the 1798 law to speed removals while litigation over the act's use plays out in lower courts. The court stressed that people deported going forward should receive notice that they are subject to the act and an opportunity to have their removal reviewed.\n\nThe court's three liberal justices dissented from the decision, and Justice Amy Coney Barrett, a member of the court's conservative wing, partially dissented.\n\nTrump framed his emergency appeal as a fight over judicial power and, specifically, US District Judge James Boasberg's order that temporarily blocked the president from enforcing the Alien Enemies Act against five Venezuelans who sued and a broader class of people who might be affected - in other words, anyone else. By granting the president's request, the Supreme Court has tossed out Boasberg's orders.\n\nPeter Navarro, President Donald Trump's trade adviser, said Monday that the markets are \"finding the bottom now\" and he guaranteed there will be \"no recession.\"\n\n\"It's finding the bottom now. It's finding the bottom now. Look, here's the thing. It's going to shift over and it's going to be companies in the S&P 500 who are the first to produce here. Those are the ones going to lead to recovery. And it's going to happen. Dow 50,000. I guarantee that and I guarantee no recession,\" Navarro said on Fox News.\n\nNavarro's comments come as JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon has warned that Trump's tariffs could raise prices, tip the global economy into recession and weaken America's standing in the world by tearing up its alliances.\n\nGlobal markets tumbled earlier today, while US stocks mostly fell after an extremely volatile day Monday.\n\nHouse Republicans stood behind President Donald Trump's trade policies as markets react to the uncertainty caused by sweeping global tariffs, asserting that their constituents will benefit in the long run, while brushing off short-term consequences.\n\nHere's what some GOP lawmakers are saying:\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, with significant work ahead of him to garner enough support for the Senate's budget blueprint, is meeting with holdouts and stressing the need for urgency at this step in the process.\n\n\" We'll have some very thoughtful discussions tonight. I'll be visiting the Freedom Caucus meeting and other subgroups of members,\" Johnson told reporters.\n\n\"Time is not our friend here. We have to get this done. We have to deliver for the American people. This is all of our priorities wrapped into one big, beautiful bill, and we can't get to the bill unless we get the resolution done. And that's the kickoff of the game as I've been using the football metaphor for the last year,\" the Louisiana Republican said.\n\nWhen asked for his pitch to skeptical far-right members, Johnson said: \"We got to continue moving the ball up the field, and that's my message to these colleagues.\"\n\n\"We do not have time to wait around for (the Senate) to go through all the laborious effort that we've gone through. And so, the House has to do its work, and we're going to do it in close collaboration with the Senate and the White House, and all of that will begin as soon as we can get past start,\" he said.\n\n\"I think we need to get this done this week,\" he said.\n\nJohnson is threatening weekend work if the House can't get the budget passed by Thursday.\n\nThe US and Iran will hold \"high-level\" talks in Oman on Saturday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said on X.\n\n\"It is as much an opportunity as it is a test. The ball is in America's court,\" the Iranian foreign minister said.\n\nHis comments come after US President Donald Trump said today that a \"very big meeting\" would take place Saturday to discuss Tehran's nuclear program.\n\nThough Araghchi is describing the talks as \"indirect,\" a person familiar with the plans confirmed to CNN earlier today that US officials are expected to sit down with Iranian officials to directly discuss a nuclear deal on Saturday in a meeting hosted by Oman.\n\nThe source could not say who would participate and at what level. Steve Witkoff, Trump's Middle East envoy, is believed to be handling the Iran file.\n\nDirect talks between the US and Iran could represent a blow to Israel, which has long advocated for striking Iran's nuclear facilities. Trump has indicated a preference for negotiating over Iran's nuclear program.\n\nThis post has been updated with comments from Iran's foreign minister.\n\nAs President Donald Trump's new tariffs shook global markets and sent foreign leaders scrambling this weekend, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent flew to Mar-a-Lago with a message.\n\nIt was imperative to get the administration's tariff communications aligned, Bessent told Trump, and more focused on the endgame for Americans: better trade deals with foreign nations, according to people familiar with the conversation.\n\nThe risk in not doing so would be further market turmoil, Bessent conveyed.\n\nFive days after Trump announced the new tariffs in a splashy Rose Garden event, foreign leaders and US investors alike are all looking for clues of how willing the president is to negotiate down the duties, the highest of which take effect on Wednesday.\n\nAs those outside observers pore over interviews and remarks from Trump's constellation of economic advisers, it has not been explicitly clear what it will take to end the global trade war.\n\nThe meeting was first reported by Politico .\n\nPresident Donald Trump said in a post on Truth Social today that he supports the Senate's budget plan.\n\n\"The Budget Plan just passed by the United States Senate has my Complete and Total Endorsement and Support. All of the elements we need to secure the Border, enact Historic Spending Cuts, and make Tax Cuts PERMANENT, and much more, are strongly covered and represented in the Bill. Thank you to Senate Majority Leader John Thune, and House Speaker Mike Johnson for their hard work and attention to detail. There is no better time than now to get this Deal DONE,\" the president wrote in his post .\n\nThe House must adopt the Senate-passed budget plan to unlock the filibuster-proof process known as budget reconciliation, which Republicans will use to extend Trump's tax cuts and deliver new national security funding - as well as potentially cut federal spending.\n\nThe Supreme Court today allowed President Donald Trump to enforce the Alien Enemies Act for now, handing the White House a significant victory that will let immigration officials rely on a sweeping wartime authority to rapidly deport alleged gang members.\n\nThe court stressed that people deported going forward should receive notice they are subject to the act and an opportunity to have their removal reviewed.\n\nHere's how some members of Trump's Cabinet reacted:\n\nCNN's Clay Voytek and Priscilla Alvarez contributed reporting to this post, which was updated with reactions from Bondi and Noem.\n\nSeveral Republican senators said that they \"hope\" the new tariffs will be short term and will force world leaders to the negotiating table, despite the administration's insistence that they will dig in. One senator went so far as to say it was \"a fairly encouraging day.\"\n\n\"Hopefully, they won't be long-term,\" GOP Sen. Kevin Cramer said. He argued the tariffs are having the \"intended effect\" and pressuring other countries to roll back their own tariffs on the US.\n\n\"I thought today was actually a fairly encouraging day - granted the markets continued down, not as bad as previously, but hopefully it's found the bottom. But more importantly, that there seems to be some actual ... some actual outreach, so we'll see how much of it's real and how much of it, you know, produces fruit at the end,\" Cramer said\n\nRepublican Sen. John Cornyn agreed: \"It seems to me like he's getting a positive reaction from our trading partners, who seem to be eager to go to zero on tariffs.\"\n\nCornyn told CNN: \"My hope is it'll be done sooner rather than later, because the volatility obviously is concerning, but the sooner they're over, the better for everybody, including the United States.\"\n\nHowever, Cramer acknowledged that even a short downturn in the market can have a lasting impact. \"I'm still optimistic about it, I'm not panicking, but, you know, even something this dramatic in the market can have long-term effect, even if it's a short-term problem. I mean, I'm not looking at my 401K for a while, I know that,\" he said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump will have his annual physical at Walter Reed on Friday, he said in a social media post today.\n\n\"I am pleased to report that my long scheduled Annual Physical Examination will be done at Walter Reed Army Medical Center on Friday of this week. I have never felt better, but nevertheless, these things must be done,\" Trump posted on Truth Social.\n\nWhile running for his second term as president, Trump released relatively little detailed information about his medical history.\n\nIn November 2023, Trump posted on social media a letter from his doctor , Dr. Bruce Aronwald, in which the doctor said Trump's \"overall health is excellent.\"\n\nIran's Nour News has cast doubt on US President Donald Trump's announcement that direct talks will take place on Saturday between the United States and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program.\n\nThe outlet, which is affiliated with Iran's top security body, described the claim as a \"psychological operation designed to influence domestic and foreign public opinion.\"\n\n\"(It) is not an indication of diplomatic reality but rather a clever attempt to engineer public opinion and advance the war of narratives,\" the outlet said.\n\nThe Iranian mission to the United Nations declined to comment when asked about direct talks or the meeting that Trump announced.\n\nEarlier today, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi told Iranian state media : \"The idea of direct talks has been repeatedly rejected by us, but we are prepared for indirect discussions mediated by Oman.\"\n\nAlso speaking before Trump's announcement, Iranian foreign ministry spokesperson Esmaeil Baqaei sad the US had not responded to Iran's \"generous\" offer of indirect negotiations.\n\nShirin Faqiri contributed reporting to this post.\n\nThe Chinese Embassy in the United States said in a statement today that \"pressuring or threatening\" China is \"not a right way to engage,\" after US President Donald Trump threatened to add new 50% tariffs on the country.\n\n\"China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests,\" the embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu said in a statement to CNN following the US threats, which reiterated the country's previous position on the matter.\n\nThe spokesperson said the Trump administration's tariff plan \"serves its selfish interests at the expense of other countries' legitimate interests and puts 'America first' over international rules.\"\n\n\"This is a typical move of unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nEarlier today, Trump said he's ready to slap new 50% tariffs on China following Beijing's retaliatory duties announced last week, further escalating the global trade war that has rattled markets.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's four-day trip to Florida over the weekend, which followed the announcement of sweeping global tariffs that have rattled markets, marked at least his 23rd day golfing since the start of his second term.\n\nSo far this year, he made the most trips in February, at nine visits, followed by eight in March, according to CNN's tracker. His first visit to Trump International Golf Club in Miami was on January 26, the first weekend after the Inauguration.\n\nTrump traveled to Florida on Thursday to deliver remarks at a dinner for LIV Golf, the Saudi-backed tour, at his Doral property. He then spent several hours golfing in West Palm Beach on Friday and said he won the second-round matchup of the senior club championship in Jupiter on Saturday. The win on Saturday advanced the president to the championship round on Sunday, where he concluded his trip to all three of his Florida golf courses.\n\nThroughout his second term, Trump has visited his Florida golf clubs in Doral, Miami, West Palm Beach and Jupiter, Florida, as well as his club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nTrump's golf courses serve as a common meeting place for him and political and nonpolitical figures. In the last four months, Trump has met at his golf clubs in Florida with GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, Fox host Trey Gowdy, golfer Tiger Woods, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis and wife Casey DeSantis, Finnish President Alexander Stubb and retired golfer Gary Player.\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday reiterated his desire for US control of Gaza, calling the Palestinian enclave \"an incredible piece of important real estate.\"\n\n\"Having a peace force like the United States there, controlling and owning the Gaza Strip would be a good thing,\" Trump said in remarks at the White House alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nTrump once again suggested the displacement of Gaza's population and claimed that \"plenty of countries\" would take the 2.1 million expelled Palestinians. Regional allies have rejected such forced displacement, which could amount to a war crime .\n\nAccording to the United Nations, Israel's war on Hamas has displaced 90% of Gaza residents, many of whom have been forced to move repeatedly.\n\n\"If you take the people, the Palestinians, and move them around to different countries - and you have plenty of countries that will do that - and you really have a freedom zone. You call it the freedom zone, a free zone, a zone where people aren't going to be killed every day,\" Trump said Monday.\n\n\"That's a hell of a place,\" Trump continued. \"You know what I call it - a great location that nobody wants to live in.\"\n\nThe US president also questioned \"why Israel ever gave (Gaza) up.\"\n\n\"They took oceanfront property and they gave it to people for peace. How did that work out?\" said Trump, who has proposed transforming the enclave into a \"Riviera\" that would be owned by the United States.\n\nIsrael captured Gaza in the Six-Day War of 1967 and occupied it for nearly 40 years.\n\nHouse GOP leaders are powering ahead with plans to adopt the Senate GOP's budget blueprint on Wednesday which will mark a key step toward advancing President Donald Trump's agenda, according to two GOP sources.\n\nBut for now, Speaker Mike Johnson does not have the votes for that budget measure, in yet another political gamble for the Republican leader.\n\nThe House must adopt the Senate-passed budget plan to unlock the filibuster-proof process known as budget reconciliation, which Republicans will use to extend Trump's tax cuts and deliver new national security funding - as well as potentially cut federal spending.\n\nJohnson and his team plan to fiercely whip the budget measure over the next two days. Trump is also expected to get involved. He is expected to appear at the GOP campaign arm's \"President's Dinner\" fundraiser tomorrow night, which many lawmakers plan to attend, according to a person familiar with the plans.\n\nFurther, House GOP leaders are privately telling some members that they will keep them in session through the weekend if they do not pass the Senate's budget blueprint, according to two people familiar with the conversations.\n\nThe House Rules Committee - which is the first stop for any legislation before it heads to the House floor - opted not to take up the budget plan today. Instead, it will take it up later this week, likely tomorrow, according to a Republican source familiar with the matter.\n\nThis post has been updated with more details about timing.\n\nSenate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer warned of a possible recession if President Donald Trump and his administration continue with increased tariffs on most imported goods and called on Senate Majority Leader John Thune to allow a vote on a bipartisan bill that would require congressional approval for new tariffs.\n\nTrump has already sworn that he would veto the bill - introduced by Sen. Maria Cantwell and Senate President Pro Tempore Chuck Grassley - if it passed the Senate and House. Speaker Mike Johnson has indicated that he does not currently plan to bring it to the floor.\n\n\"The Republican Leader should make passing tariff legislation the top priority of the Senate. This week, at his press conference a few minutes ago, Donald Trump just said he is not looking at a pause,\" Schumer said.\n\n\"Now, the only hope the American people have to avoid calamity rests on Senator Thune's shoulders. So, Sen. Thune has a decision to make: Side with Donald Trump or his destructive policies, or side with the American people,\" Schumer said.\n\nWhen asked if he would put the bill on the floor for a vote, Thune said he didn't \"think that it has a future\" and indicated that he has not spoken about it to his rank-and-file members.\n\n\"The president has indicated he would veto it. I don't see how they get it on the floor in the House,\" Thune told CNN. \"At this point we're kind of just waiting to see what's going to happen next.\"\n\nThis post has been updated with comments from Thune.\n\nUS stocks mostly fell after an extremely volatile day today - tumbling, surging and then bouncing around in every direction, as traders searched for any sign that President Donald Trump's tariffs could be negotiated or halted.\n\nAfter a roller coaster day, the Dow closed lower by 349 points, or 0.91%. The broader S&P 500 fell 0.23%. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.1% higher after fluctuating between gains and losses.\n\nWall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, closed at the highest level since the Covid-19 pandemic as investors fretted over the market's next move. The VIX surpassed an intraday level of 50 points midday Monday, a rare level associated with extreme volatility.\n\nThe wild swings in markets underscore just how badly investors want Trump to put a pause on his trade war. US stocks surged off their lows on rumors of a pause on tariffs. However, that rebound proved fleeting as traders realized nothing official had been announced .\n\nAnd the volatility in markets went beyond just stocks. The yield on the 10-year Treasury note, which had slid below 4% at the end of last week, rose to 4.155% as investors sold off bonds. Yields and bond prices trade in opposite directions.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he is working with the US on another deal to secure the release of additional hostages.\n\n\"The hostages are in agony. We want to get them all out. Steve Witkoff is President Trump's very able representative. (He) helped us get a deal that got 25 out,\" Netanyahu said at the White House on today. \"We're working now on another deal, that we hope will succeed.\"\n\nNetanyahu also said he speaks to the families of the hostages \"every day.\" The Israeli leader had repeatedly faced criticism for failing to regularly engage with the families of the hostages and particularly the hostages who have been released during previous ceasefire agreements. Many of the former hostages and their families have instead turned to President Donald Trump, asking him to make a ceasefire deal happen. Last month, eight former hostages visited Trump in the Oval Office, asking him to bring the remaining hostages back to Israel.\n\nNetanyahu said Israel is committed to \"enabling the people of Gaza to freely make a choice to go wherever they want.\" He pointed to a \"bold vision\" Trump put forward which he said was discussed on Monday that involved Palestinians choosing to go to countries willing to accept them.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said he is \"not happy\" about Russia's ongoing strikes in Ukraine as the US tries to broker an end in fighting between the two countries.\n\n\"I'm not happy about what's going on with the bombing because they're bombing like crazy right now. They're bombing - I don't know what's happening there. That's not a good situation,\" Trump said during an Oval Office meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nTrump's remarks came after a question about why his new tariff plan did not include any levies on Russia. The president said this is \"because we're not doing business, essentially, with Russia, because they're at war.\"\n\nTrump said US officials are meeting with Russia and Ukraine \"and we're getting sort of close,\" though he didn't say if that meant close to a ceasefire.\n\nSome context: The comments come after a Russian missile attack on Kryvyi Rih killed at least 19 people , including nine children, on Friday. It was one of the deadliest strikes this year in the concflict.\n\nTrump also said he was recently \"pissed off \" on a recent call with the Russian leader, who rejected Trump's proposal for a full and immediate ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\nPresident Donald Trump suggested Monday that the United States will \"maybe not\" reduce Israel's tariffs, as he sat next to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office.\n\n\"Well, we're talking about a whole new trade - maybe not, maybe not. Now, don't forget we help Israel a lot. You know, we give Israel $4 billion a year. That's a lot. Congratulations, by the way. That's pretty good. But we give Israel billions of dollars a year. Billions. It's one of the highest of any ... we give a lot of countries money,\" the president said.\n\nTrump announced a 17% tariff on Israel last week as part of his massive shake-up in global trade.\n\nThe president's comments came after Netanyahu said earlier in the Oval Office that his country will eliminate the trade deficit and trade barriers with the US \"very quickly.\"\n\nResidents in the central Mexican city of Toluca expressed fear and uncertainty over automaker Stellantis' decision to pause production at its local assembly plant due to the impact of US tariffs on imported cars.\n\nWith more than 2,400 hourly workers, the plant is considered one of the largest sources of employment for residents of Toluca, but the company says the plant, which has been in operation for more than 50 years, will be closed for the rest of April starting Monday.\n\nMany in the community are worried the pause will last longer than a month. \"Losing our jobs would be impactful, but let's hope it doesn't happen,\" Pamela Valentin, a contractor who helped maintain the natural gas line at the plant, told CNN about the impact tariffs could have on workers. Valentin said that some of her colleagues have been left in the dark about the production plans and are a little afraid given the uncertainty.\n\nAsked whether she has ever considered switching careers to a different industry, Valentin said she hopes it doesn't come to that, but it would be her last option. Alejandro Sanchez's uncle worked at the plant for at least seven years before being laid off \"out of nowhere\" when tariffs were announced. Sanchez called the situation \"a bit ugly.\"\n\nThe Stellantis' production pause has alarmed people working across the automotive development industry, Norman Hernandez, a worker at another plant in the city, told CNN.\n\n\"It's worrying, the fact that we don't know what's going to happen ... We've also had some issues with that aspect, such as: how will work decline? What's going to happen?\" he said.\n\n\"And the layoffs that have occurred - massive layoffs - are a bit worrying and alarming,\" he added.\n\nPresident Donald Trump told reporters Monday that he is \"not looking\" at implementing a pause in enforcing the tariffs that he announced last week.\n\n\"Well, we're not looking at that. We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us. And they're going to be fair deals. And certain cases, they're going to be paying substantial tariffs. They'll be fair deals. As you know, I spoke this morning with the prime minister of Japan, and we had a very good conversation,\" the president said.\n\nAsked about the mixed messaging from his administration on tariff negotiation, the president claimed that \"they can both be true.\"\n\n\"It could be they can both be true. There can be permanent tariffs, and there can also be negotiations because there are things that we need beyond tariffs,\" the president said.\n\nThe president's remarks came as he sat alongside Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office. US stocks have been extremely volatile today as traders searched for any sign Trump's tariffs could be negotiated or halted. US stocks tumbled for the third straight day Monday, and the S&P 500 entered bear market territory.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Monday temporarily paused a court-imposed midnight deadline to a return a Maryland man mistakenly deported to El Salvador, agreeing to a request from President Donald Trump to give both sides more time to make their arguments.\n\nChief Justice John Roberts granted the \"administrative stay\" on his own, a move that will extend the deadline until the court hands down a more fulsome decision - probably within a few days. Roberts handles emergency cases rising from the federal appeals court in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nThe decision to temporarily pause the case, which is relatively common when the court is facing a quick deadline, means that Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national deported on March 15, will remain at a notorious prison in El Salvador for now.\n\nCNN's Priscilla Alvarez contributed reporting to this post.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday that direct talks are underway between the United States and Iran over Tehran's nuclear program.\n\nSpeaking alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu at the White House, Trump said a \"very big meeting\" would take place Saturday.\n\n\"I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious,\" Trump said.\n\nIran had previously rejected Trump's offer of direct negotiations over its nuclear program, offering instead to engage in indirect talks. Trump's offer, which he sent Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei in March, proposed negotiations on a new nuclear deal, with a two-month ultimatum to reach an agreement, a source familiar with the letter's contents previously told CNN.\n\nTrump on Monday voiced optimism that talks would be successful in convincing Iran to abandon its nuclear program, which Tehran insists is for peaceful purposes.\n\n\"Hopefully those talks will be successful. And I think it would be in Iran's best interests if they are successful. ... We hope that's going to happen,\" he said.\n\nLater, Trump added that if the talks aren't successful, then, \"I actually think it will be a very bad day for Iran.\"\n\nCNN's Maureen Chowdhury contributed to this report.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country will eliminate the trade deficit and trade barriers with the US \"very quickly.\"\n\nSpeaking alongside US President Donald Trump at the White House Monday, Netanyahu said Israel would get rid of trade barriers \"put up unnecessarily.\"\n\n\"We're going to eliminate the tariffs and rapidly,\" Netanyahu said.\n\nTrump unveiled reciprocal tariffs on most countries of the world last week, hitting Israel with a level of 17% despite Israel having removed tariffs on US products a day prior. Israel adds tariffs to very few products from the US, and the vast majority face no tariffs at all. Trump did not mention dropping tariffs on Israel to zero in his on-camera remarks alongside Netanyahu on Monday.\n\nThe prime minister said he hopes Israel can be a model for other countries to do the same.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional information.\n\nPresident Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu are meeting in the Oval Office, where the leaders are expected to discuss a wide-range of issues, including Israel's war in Gaza and Trump's tariffs.\n\nThe White House canceled a news conference that was set to happen this afternoon.\n\nEarlier today, Kevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said the meeting between the leaders would be t he first in-person meeting with a foreign country trying to negotiate with the president on the tariffs he announced last week.\n\nThe US imposed a 17% tariff on Israel, according to Trump's announcement last week .\n\nCNN's Alejandra Jaramillo contributed reporting to this post.\n\nThe US Agency for International Development (USAID) has canceled all remaining contracts for humanitarian aid in Afghanistan, a USAID official told CNN.\n\nThe terminations were among of dozens sent by USAID this weekend as the Trump administration moves to abolish the agency by July. USAID also canceled its remaining humanitarian aid work contracts for Yemen, the official said.\n\nThe canceled contracts were used for food assistance, safe drinking water, hygiene items, medical services - including treatment of women and children - and shelter support, according to the USAID official.\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio had signed off extensions for some of the foreign aid awards last week, only for them to be cancelled this weekend, the official said. CNN reported this weekend that the administration canceled other contracts for work that had previously been cleared to continue, including in Syria, Gaza, and Lebanon.\n\nTerminations for the canceled programs said they were deemed to be \"inconsistent with the administration's priorities.\"\n\nCNN has reached out to the State Department about the cancelations of the Afghanistan funding. A State Department spokesperson told CNN this weekend that \"just because contracts are terminated, doesn't mean that they can't be reinstated as needed.\"\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent and US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will lead United States negotiation with Japan on trade, Bessent announced on social media on Monday.\n\n\"Following a very constructive phone discussion with the Government of Japan, @POTUS @realDonaldTrump has tasked me and @USTradeRep to open negotiations to implement the President's vision for the new Golden Age of Global Trade with @JPN_PMO Shigeru Ishiba and his Cabinet,\" Bessent posted on X.\n\nTrump last week announced 24% tariffs on Japan, which are set to take effect Wednesday.\n\nIshiba urged Trump in a call earlier Monday to reconsider the tariffs, according to a press statement from the Japanese prime minister's office. Noting that Japan is the largest foreign investor in the US, Ishiba \"expressed strong concerns\" that the tariffs could weaken the capacity of Japanese companies to continue investing, according to the readout.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson argued today that Congress must give President Donald Trump the \"space\" to execute on his trade policy, as markets react to the sweeping global tariffs announced last week.\n\nAsked by CNN why Congress shouldn't have a check on Trump's tariff power, as a bipartisan group of lawmakers is demanding, Johnson said, \"Congress will weigh in on it but with the president, with the administration in tandem.\"\n\n\"I think you've got to give the president the latitude, the runway to do what it is he was elected to do and that is get this economy going again and get our trade properly balanced with other countries,\" he said.\n\nSens. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat, and Chuck Grassley, an Iowa Republican, introduced a bill in the Senate last week requiring congressional approval for new tariffs, which has co-sponsors from both parties. GOP Rep. Don Bacon said he'll introduce a companion bill Monday in the House, where he has acknowledged it will face a steeper challenge.\n\nJohnson said he thinks the public sees that Trump is \"engaging and trying to fix\" the US trade deficit, and Congress is \"going to give him the space necessary to do it.\"\n\nGlobal markets have been rocked following President Donald Trump's announcement last week of sweeping tariffs on trading partners and China's forceful response to unexpectedly high duties.\n\nSome countries are looking to negotiate with the US to reduce the imposed tariffs.\n\nHere's how some countries are responding as Trump digs in on his tariff plan:\n\nThis post has been updated with reactions from more foreign leaders.\n\nThe decades-long softwood lumber dispute between the US and Canada is escalating even before planned tariffs take effect. The US plans to more than double existing anti-dumping and countervailing duties on the critical building material.\n\nThe US Department of Commerce, as part of an annual review process, plans to hike the duties from 14.4% to 34.45%, according to published and unpublished filings in the Federal Register.\n\nThe duties, which are separate from tariffs that have been proposed on softwood lumber, stem from a decades-long strife between the North American neighbors. Put simply, the US claims that the Canadian lumber industry is government-subsidized.\n\nBritish Columbia Premier David Eby said the duties are \"unjustified\" in a statement released Saturday, adding that the duties will end up \"driving up housing costs for Americans who voted for a president who promised to lower costs.\"\n\nWhat this could mean: About 30% of the softwood lumber consumed in the US is imported, with Canada accounting for north of 80% of those imports. Builders estimate that tariffs on lumber and other critical homebuilding materials could raise the average cost of a home by $9,200, according to the March National Association of Home Builders/Wells Fargo Housing Market Index.\n\nHowever, members of the US lumber industry say higher duties as well as new tariffs would help level the playing the field. They also say the existing US industry has a significant amount of existing capacity that's not currently being utilized.\n\n\"These unfair trade practices are designed by Canada to maintain an artificially inflated US market share for Canadian products and force US companies to curtail production, thereby killing US jobs,\" Andrew Miller, chair of the US Lumber Coalition, said in a statement.\n\nThe White House has canceled a news conference scheduled for 2:30 p.m. ET Monday afternoon between President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nOfficials cited the Oval Office meeting with Netanyahu, where Trump could take questions, and today's previous East Room event honoring the Los Angeles Dodgers as rationale for canceling the event.\n\nThis post has been updated with more information from officials.\n\nA federal appeals court reinstated the access that affiliates of the Department of Government Efficiency can have to some agencies' sensitive data.\n\nThe ruling pauses a federal judge's order that had limited DOGE access to the personal information of some Americans held by the Department of Education, Office of Personnel Management and Treasury Department.\n\nThe 4th US Circuit Court of Appeals voted 2-1 to grant the Trump administration's emergency request for intervention. The GOP-appointed judges in the majority said that the lower court had misapplied the relevant precedents.\n\nThe administration will continue to be subject to an order in another case that put restrictions on access that Treasury gives DOGE to the department's closely guarded data systems.\n\nMore on the ruling: The dissenting judge on the 4th Circuit panel, Judge Robert King, appointed by President Bill Clinton, wrote that, after the panel voted to restore the data access, he took the \"extraordinary\" step of having the full 4th Circuit Court take a look at the case. It voted 8-7 not to get involved at this phase, leaving the panel ruling to stand.\n\nThe case was brought by several federal unions. The trial judge had blocked OPM, Education and Treasury from sharing with DOGE the personal data of the unions' two million members.\n\nThe Trump administration is in the early stages of planning for a parade to be held in Washington, DC, the city's Mayor Muriel Bowser said today.\n\nHer comments came a day after Washington City Paper reported the Trump administration hopes for the city to host a \"military parade\" on June 14, which is both the 250th anniversary of the establishment of the US Army and Trump's 79th birthday. Preliminary plans call for the parade to stretch from the Pentagon in Arlington to the White House, the outlet reported.\n\nAsked about that reporting during a press availability, Bowser said: \"I don't know if it's been characterized as a military parade, but maybe it has.\"\n\n\"I haven't been directly involved in it yet. I understand that - I think it was Homeland Security, maybe the White House - reached out to our special events task force, which is what most people wanting to do a parade do in the district,\" she said, adding that planning is \"at its early stages.\"\n\nTrump hoped to host a military-style parade during his first term but called it off after the city said it would cost tens of millions of dollars, CNN previously reported .\n\nA spokesperson for the mayor did not immediately respond to a question asking for more details about the administration's coordination with the city to plan a parade. CNN has reached out to the White House, DHS, Army and Department of Defense for comment.\n\nArlington County Chair Takis Karantonis said in a statement that the county was contacted by the Secret Service on Friday \"regarding the possibility of a military parade to celebrate the 250th Anniversary of the U.S. Army, but no further details were offered.\"\n\nThe county, which is home to the Pentagon and many active and retired military personnel, has not received a formal request from the federal government for any assistance for the parade, he added.\n\nCNN's Natasha Bertrand contributed reporting to this post.\n\nPresident Donald Trump would veto a bipartisan bill that would limit his authority to levy new tariffs, the White House said today.\n\n\"If passed, this bill would dangerously hamper the President's authority and duty to determine our foreign policy and protect our national security,\" the president's budget office wrote in an official veto threat notice.\n\nThe bill, introduced by Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington and GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, would require presidents to justify new tariffs to Congress. Lawmakers would have to approve them within 60 days or they would expire.\n\nThe White House said the bill would \"seriously constrain\" Trump's authorities that Congress has \"long recognized.\"\n\nTrump has yet to veto a bill in his second term. Congress can override a veto with a two-thirds vote in the House and Senate.\n\nWhen Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was last at the White House in February, trade matters between the US and Israel were far from mind.\n\nNot so Monday, as the Israeli leader returns for a last-minute visit looking for ways to alleviate the 17% tariff on Israel Trump announced last week as part of his massive shakeup in global trade. Netanyahu's relative success will be closely watched by fellow world leaders looking for ways to ease their own tariff burdens.\n\nThe question is what, exactly, Netanyahu can offer Trump in return for an easing-off of the new duties. He already tried to preempt the new tariffs by lifting custom duties on US imports, to little effect.\n\nThat leaves other, non-economic areas as potential ground for negotiation. Since Netanyahu's last visit - remembered mainly for Trump's shock plan to 'take over' Gaza , remove its residents and redevelop it into a seafront \"Riviera\" with glass condominiums - Israel has fully resumed its war in Gaza, and the ceasefire with Hamas that Trump took credit for brokering has fallen apart.\n\nThe White House has fully backed Israel's military campaign, putting the onus on Hamas to return hostages and come back to the negotiating table.\n\nAt the same time, one of Trump's biggest foreign policy objectives may ride on bringing the Gaza conflict to an end. As he prepares to head to Saudi Arabia next month, he hopes to advance a normalization agreement between Riyadh and Israel - creating a regional counterweight to Iran.\n\nThat plan won't go anywhere if the Gaza war continues. But the Iran threat is only ramping up, as US officials warn Tehran is advancing its nuclear program - a topic likely to arise in Monday's talks.\n\nSpeaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on Friday, Trump called Gaza a \"big problem\" he hopes to resolve. \"That's another thing we'd like to get solved,\" he said.\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday he's ready to slap new 50% tariffs on China following Beijing's retaliatory duties announced last week, further escalating the global trade war that has rattled markets.\n\nHe said the additional tariffs would take effect midweek if China doesn't remove its 34% retaliatory tariff by Tuesday.\n\nHe also said meetings China had requested would be canceled, though he said other countries would begin negotiating on trade immediately.\n\n\"Yesterday, China issued Retaliatory Tariffs of 34%, on top of their already record setting Tariffs, Non-Monetary Tariffs, Illegal Subsidization of companies, and massive long term Currency Manipulation, despite my warning that any country that Retaliates against the U.S. by issuing additional Tariffs, above and beyond their already existing long term Tariff abuse of our Nation, will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social.\n\n\"Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,\" he went on.\n\n\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"\n\nSome context: Since returning to power in January, Trump had already levied two tranches of 10% additional duties on all Chinese imports, which the White House said was necessary to stem the flow of illicit fentanyl from the country to the US. Last week, Trump announced an additional 34% on all Chinese goods , which is set to take effect Wednesday. If his latest threat of an additional 50% went into effect, Chinese goods arriving in the US would effectively be subject to tariffs of 104%.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional details.\n\nA federal appeals court declined on Monday to put on hold a judge's order requiring the Trump administration to bring back a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador.\n\nThe decision from the 4th Circuit Court of Appeals comes just hours before the administration faces an 11:59 p.m. deadline to return Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, to the US.\n\nThe ruling came minutes after the administration asked the Supreme Court to step in on an emergency basis to lift the preliminary injunction issued late last week by US District Judge Paula Xinis.\n\nAbrego Garcia's wife, Jennifer, said Monday's decision to uphold a lower court ruling gives her \"hope\" and \"encouragement to keep fighting.\"\n\n\"My children, family, and I will continue praying and seeking justice. Now that the court has spoken, I ask again that both President Trump and President Bukele stop attempting any further delays. They need to follow the court's order NOW. My children are waiting to be reunited with their father tonight,\" Jennifer said.\n\nThe case is currently in front of the Supreme Court.\n\nThis report has been updated with comments from Abrego Garcia's wife.\n\nIt's not every day that financial markets go from deep in the red to well into positive territory and then back down to the red again - all in the span of minutes.\n\nBut that's exactly what happened on Monday.\n\nWith banners flashing on CNBC and posts piling up on social media that the Trump administration was considering a 90-day pause on all tariffs with the exception of China, investors breathed a huge sigh of relief. But then it turned out that they got a little too excited.\n\nA White House official told CNN any such reports are \"fake news.\"\n\nMuch of the reporting traced back to an interview President Donald Trump's top economic advisor, Kevin Hassett, had on Fox News this morning. Hassett was asked if Trump can call a \"90-day timeout\" on tariffs.\n\nHassett responded: \"I think the President will decide what the President is going to decide.\" Several news networks took that to mean Trump was considering a 90-day pause on tariffs. However, there was no official reporting on that.\n\nWhite House director of communications Steven Cheung also denied reports of a 90-day pause being under consideration. He reposted a NewsMax post on X post of Hassett with his own comments: \"Not true. Nobody can point to a transcript ...  because it was never said.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump's administration urged the Supreme Court today to block a lower court order requiring officials to bring a man who was mistakenly deported to El Salvador back to Maryland.\n\nThe emergency appeal over Kilmar Armando Abrego Garcia, a Salvadoran national, landed at the high court on a short fuse: A lower court judge has ordered the Trump administration to return him to the US by 11:59 p.m. Monday.\n\nTrump attorneys have conceded in court filings that the administration mistakenly deported the father of three \"because of an administrative error,\" but said it could not bring him back because he is in Salvadoran custody. His case has added to the already considerable legal scrutiny over White House efforts to deport immigrants without a hearing or review.\n\nCNN's Priscilla Alvarez contributed reporting to this post.\n\nThe wild swings in financial markets on Monday morning underscore how badly investors want President Donald Trump to pause the trade war.\n\nUS stocks surged off their lows and even briefly turned positive on rumors of a 90-day pause. However, that rebound proved fleeting as traders realized nothing official had been announced.\n\n\"That was a good example of what would happen if we actually got some rational thought mixed in with the ignorant tariff policy,\" Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B. Riley Wealth Management, told CNN in a phone interview Monday. \"The stock market vigilantes have spoken loudly that we need rational thought mixed in with this trade policy. And there is none so far.\"\n\nOversold markets desperate for good news are subject to wild swings that can quickly reverse, Hogan added.\n\nThe European Union is \"ready to negotiate\" with the United States and has offered to scrap tariffs on industrial goods, Ursula Von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said Monday.\n\n\"These tariffs come first and foremost at immense costs for US consumers and businesses but, at the same time, they have a massive impact on the global economy,\" the head of the EU's executive arm said at a news conference in Brussels.\n\nFollowing US President Donald Trump's announcement of hefty tariffs on dozens of countries last week, EU exports to the US face a 20% \"reciprocal\" tariff, while its steel and auto industry face a 25% tariff. Von der Leyen said the tariffs, which have caused a global market rout, represent a \"major turning point\" for the US.\n\n\"Nonetheless, we stand ready to negotiate with the United States. Indeed, we have offered zero-for-zero tariffs for industrial goods, as we have successfully done with many other trading partners, because Europe is always ready for a good deal,\" she said.\n\nAsked when the EU tabled the zero-tariff offer, von der Leyen said the offer was made \"long before\" Trump's latest tariff announcement and \"repeatedly, for example, in the automotive sector.\" She stressed that the EU has long gone \"zero for zero with other countries that also have a strong automotive sector.\"\n\nAt the same time, the EU is willing to play hardball: Although the EU would prefer to strike a \"negotiated settlement,\" the bloc is also \"preparing a potential list (of US imports) for retaliation,\" she said.\n\nMeanwhile, the head of the EU's executive arm said the bloc would explore new opportunities, citing deals it has already made with Mexico and Switzerland, as well as new trade agreements it is exploring with India, Indonesia and other countries in the Indo-Pacific.\n\n\"We will focus like a laser beam on the 83% of global trade that is beyond the United States - vast opportunities - and this is why we're deepening our relations with our trading partners,\" she said at a news conference in Brussels.\n\nThis post has been updated with additional information.\n\nUS stocks were extremely volatile Monday as traders searched for any sign that President Donald Trump's tariffs could be negotiated or halted.\n\nMarkets around the world had tumbled over concerns about how Trump's sweeping tariffs might upend the global economy and stymie US economic growth. US stocks opened the day in bear market territory but surged an hour later on rumors that the Trump administration may pause tariffs - perhaps for several months.\n\nThat rumor turned out to be just that, it seems. And the Dow, which had risen nearly 900 points, was back down once again.\n\nThe Dow was lower 500 points, or 1.3%. The broader S&P 500 edged lower. The Nasdaq Composite was 0.1% lower.\n\nAt the open, the S&P 500 tumbled into bear market territory - a decline of 20% from a recent peak - before pulling back. The decline in US stocks came after a historic rout in Asia and massive losses in Europe.\n\nThe S&P 500 hit a record high less than seven weeks ago, on February 19. If the index closes in bear market territory, that would be the second-fastest peak-to-bear market shift in history (the fastest occurred during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic).\n\nKevin Hassett, the director of the White House National Economic Council, said Monday's meeting between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Donald Trump will be the first in-person meeting with a foreign country to negotiate on the tariffs announced last week.\n\n\"Israel is the first meeting today,\" Hassett said, alluding to all the countries trying to negotiate. \"President Trump has talked to world leaders all weekend.\"\n\n\"I'm sure they will talk about trade policy and Middle East policy as well,\" Hassett told Fox News on Monday from the White House.\n\nHassett emphasized that the US is prepared for a \"good deal.\"\n\nThe US imposed a 17% tariff on Israel, according to Trump's announcement last week .\n\nPresident Donald Trump said Monday that \"countries from all over the World\" are talking to the United States after he announced reciprocal tariffs last week and that \"tough but fair parameters are being set,\" specifically mentioning the Japanese prime minister sending negotiators.\n\n\"Spoke to the Japanese Prime Minister this morning. He is sending a top team to negotiate! They have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs. Likewise Agriculture, and many other 'things.'\"\n\nTrump also highlighted China as a particular focus, suggesting that trade relations with China need significant changes.\n\n\"It all has to change, but especially with CHINA!!!\"\n\nAsian markets dip: Global markets plunged on Monday, deepening a global stocks rout triggered by Trump's trade war and China's forceful response to unexpectedly high tariffs. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 7.9% lower, while the broader Topix finished down 7.7%. Tech giant Sony plummeted more than 10%.\n\nCNN's Juliana Liu and John Liu contributed to this report.\n\nLast week Vietnam offered to lower its tariffs on American exports to 0% in exchange for the same treatment, according to a report published by the Vietnamese government on Friday. That came after President Donald Trump spoke with Vietnam's General Secretary Tô Lâm on Friday in a call Trump labeled \"productive.\"\n\nBut White House trade adviser Peter Navarro said on Monday that Vietnam's offer is not being taken seriously.\n\n\"Let's take Vietnam. When they come to us and say 'we'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters,\" Navarro said in a CNBC interview on Monday.\n\nMore context: Vietnam is among the nations set to see the highest \"reciprocal\" tariff rates of 46% come April 9, according to the new tariff regime the Trump administration unveiled last week. Vietnam was the United States' sixth-largest source of imports last year, according to US Commerce Department data.\n\nThe tariffs Trump is set to impose could raise the price for a slew of goods which the US relies heavily on from Vietnam, including electronics, apparel and footwear\n\nUS stocks opened lower Monday as markets around the world tumbled over concerns about how President Donald Trump's sweeping tariffs might upend the global economy and stymie US economic growth.\n\nMarkets opened in bear market territory - a decline of 20% from a recent peak - after a historic rout in Asia and massive losses in Europe.\n\nThe Dow fell 1,200 points, or 3.2%. The broader S&P 500 was 3.4% lower and opened in bear territory. The Nasdaq Composite slid 3.96%. The S&P 500 hit a record high less than seven weeks ago, on February 19. If the index closes in bear market territory, that would be the second-fastest peak-to-bear market shift in history (the fastest occurred during the 2020 pandemic).\n\nWall Street's fear gauge, the Cboe Volatility Index, or VIX, has surged to levels not seen since the Covid-19 pandemic as investors fret over the market's next move. CNN's Fear and Greed Index has slumped to its lowest levels this year.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's decision to impose sweeping tariffs on trading partners could derail the global move toward green energy, aimed at preventing the worst impacts of climate change.\n\nThe tariffs will likely make key green technologies more expensive and could also force governments to divert resources from addressing the climate crisis into propping up their economies.\n\nChina is the world's largest producer of many of the materials that are crucial for clean energy technologies. Among others, it exports vast amounts of lithium and lithium batteries as well as the materials used to build wind turbines and solar panels.\n\nThe E3G independent climate change think tank said in a research paper that the tariffs will increase the cost of manufacturing of low-carbon technologies and could eventually result in higher prices for consumers - at a time when prices were going down, encouraging faster transition.\n\nClimate policies are already being changed because of the tariffs.\n\nMore context: The UK government on Monday scrapped some electric vehicle sales targets, specifically quoting the \"new era of global insecurity\" as one of the reasons. While the government kept the 2030 deadline to stop sales of new petrol and diesel cars, it gave companies more flexibility up until then, and it also slashed the fines for those who don't meet the targets.\n\nAfter the Canadian government scrapped the consumer carbon tax last month, some Canadian provinces followed suit and stopped other carbon levies, quoting the US tariffs among the reasons.\n\nTo avoid the worst of the climate crisis, the world needs to quickly transition to clean energy. With governments and businesses facing economic pressures, resources could be diverted away from green projects. That will likely backfire as failing to invest in emission cutting now will make more costly to deal with the consequences in the future.\n\nPresident Donald Trump urged patience and warned against becoming \"panican\" in a post Monday ahead of markets opening in the United States.\n\n\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO. Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!),\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\" he went on.\n\nTrump was writing as markets traded sharply lower in Asia and Europe, and a US futures tumbled. Earlier this morning, Trump defended the US economy and claims tariffs will boost revenue\n\nWhite House national economic council director Kevin Hassett defended President Donald Trump's tariffs on Monday, responding to billionaire Trump supporter Bill Ackman who criticized and said the \"economic nuclear war\" is triggered by tariffs.\n\n\"I would urge everyone, especially Bill, to ease the ease off the rhetoric a little bit,\" Hassett told Fox News on Monday from the White House.\n\n\"I think a lot of us at the White House think that these are these economic responses are exaggerated by critics, even if you think that there will be some negative effect from the trade side, that's still a small share of GDP as the idea that it's going to be a nuclear winter or something like that is completely irresponsible rhetoric,\" Hasset said responding to Ackman.\n\nAckman, who endorsed Trump's 2024 bid for president, said Sunday that America was heading toward a self-inflicted \"economic nuclear winter\" because of Trump's tariff policy rollout.\n\nHassett also responded to JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon , who has issued a bunt warning about Trump's tariff policy. Dimon said America's \"extraordinary standing\" in the world was built on the strength of its economy, military and morals. But tariffs and Trump's \"America First\" foreign policy could undermine that standing.\n\n\"Trump came into office with the biggest debt to GDP that we've seen in the US ever since World War 2,\" Hassett said. \"And what we're doing right now is we're fixing that,\" he added in response to Dimon.\n\nTrump's announcement last week, targeting nearly all the US trading partners last week, including a 10% tariff on all imports and higher tariffs on certain countries, triggered a sharp and ongoing decline in global markets, with several nations imposing retaliatory tariffs on goods.\n\nThe global market rout sparked by US President Donald Trump's tariffs deepened in Asia and Europe on Monday, with the US bracing for a further slump when its markets open shortly.\n\nAlthough the president has doubled down on his trade policy, members of his administration failed to offer a coherent message about his strategy over the weekend. Some of Trump's billionaire backers are now calling for a return to freer trade.\n\nHere's what you need to know:\n\n• Asian markets plummet: With trading now over for the day, Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index closed 13.2% down - its worst day since 1997 . The city's financial markets had been closed Friday for an annual festival.\n\n• Europe also slumps: Stocks indexes in Europe are down around 5% halfway through the day's trading. Meanwhile, European Union trade ministers are meeting in Brussels to discuss a response to Trump's tariffs.\n\n• US markets set to open: If the US stock market closes in bear territory - a drop of 20% from a recent peak - it would be the earliest in a new administration that a bull market has turned into a bear market in the history of the S&P 500, which dates back to 1957.\n\n• Dimon sounds alarm: JPMorgan Chase chief Jamie Dimon has warned that Trump's tariffs could raise prices, tip the global economy into recession and weaken America's standing in the world by tearing up its alliances.\n\n• Trump doubles down: After his trade policy wiped trillions of dollars off global markets last week, Trump told reporters late Sunday that he doesn't want \"anything to go down,\" but that \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\" On Monday morning, Trump defended his policy in a Truth Social post, saying tariffs would bring in billions of dollars in revenue.\n\n• Musk breaks rank: Elon Musk has said he would be in favor of a \"zero-tariff situation\" between the US and EU, after the man he helped elect as president imposed a 20% tariff on the bloc. Bill Ackman , another of Trump's billionaire backers, has also criticized the president's trade policy.\n\n• MAGA's mixed signals: Top Trump administration officials offered mixed messaging over whether countries can negotiate their way out of tariffs, or if the levies are here to stay. Larry Summers , former Treasury Secretary under Barack Obama, said the administration \"doesn't have a coherent message on why it's implementing the largest tax increase\" seen in the US in 50 years.\n\nFrom Nikkei to Hang Seng, Asia's markets have tumbled after Trump's new tariffs were announced, which has countries like Japan and South Korea concerned about the short to long-term effects. #CNN #News #Japan #China #SouthKorea\n\nPresident Donald Trump's trade plan could cause a repeat of the Smoot-Hawley tariffs from 1930 that worsened the Great Depression, former Federal Reserve official James Bullard warned on Monday.\n\n\"This has dramatically raised the risk of a Smoot-Hawley type outcome,\" Bullard, the former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, told CNBC. \"Global trade collapsed and the Great Depression was on. That's what really has people worried about this.\"\n\nEconomists widely blame the 1930 Smoot-Hawley Act with making the Great Depression worse than it had to be. The act surged tariffs on US imports to protect workers. A half-century later, the infamous legislation was featured in an iconic scene in \"Ferris Bueller's Day Off.\"\n\nBullard, who now serves as dean of Purdue University's Mitch Daniels School of Business, told CNBC that Trump's tariffs are setting up a situation where \"you could get a dramatic downturn in the economy.\"\n\nBullard added, however, that this does not have to be a repeat and noted that it's not clear the tariffs will even stay in place.\n\n\"What's the chance this will stick through the courts? Because I think this is probably executive overreach,\" Bullard said, arguing that the executive branch likely needs the support of Congress to make these kinds of sweeping decisions on trade. \"Who wants to invest when you don't know what the rules are going to be?\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump took to social media Monday to argue that the US is in a strong economic position, despite the fact that the US and global markets have tanked.\n\n\"Oil prices are down, interest rates are down (the slow-moving Fed should cut rates!), food prices are down, there is NO INFLATION, and the long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social .\n\nThe president claimed that the country will earn billions of dollars from the tariffs he placed on other countries, even as the stock market faces its worst start to a presidential term in modern history.\n\n\"This is despite the fact that the biggest abuser of them all, China, whose markets are crashing, just raised its Tariffs by 34%, on top of its long term ridiculously high Tariffs (Plus!), not acknowledging my warning for abusing countries not to retaliate. They've made enough, for decades, taking advantage of the Good OL' USA! Our past \"leaders\" are to blame for allowing this, and so much else, to happen to our Country. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\" Trump's post continued.\n\nTrump on Sunday aboard Air Force One said he does not want \"anything to go down,\" but stressed \"sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,\" with the administration sending mixed signals on whether his trade policies are open for negotiation.\n\nThe sweeping tariffs announced by US President Donald Trump last week are set to add to the pain inflicted on US farmers by the tariffs imposed during his first term, a union boss has warned.\n\n\"It's not fun, we still haven't recovered from the last tariffs that the president put on,\" Bob Kuylen, Vice President of the North Dakota Farmers Union, told CNN Monday.\n\nHe added that farmers \"haven't gotten (those) markets back yet and now he's picking on Canada and Mexico and China.\" Farmers are being \"held down to almost surf levels, just barely getting by,\" he said.\n\n\"We raise thousands and thousands of acres of corn and soybeans and wheat and other products and we export just about half of what we raise in the United States,\" he said.\n\nFarmers often receive government funding to protect them when prices fall due to weather or market fluctuations - but in 2018 they needed bailing out to protect them from the Trump administration's trade policies. During Trump's first term, the government spent billions of dollars bailing out farmers feeling the pinch from the president's trade war.\n\nOver the weekend, Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins was unable to clearly state whether Trump's new tariffs are here to stay, or whether there was room for deals.\n\nRollins indicated there could be support for farmers affected by the most recent tariffs, pointing to the previous relief during Trump's first term.\n\nJPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon has issued a blunt warning about President Donald Trump's tariff policy: It threatens to raise prices, drive the global economy into a downturn and weaken America's standing in the world.\n\n\"The recent tariffs will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession,\" Dimon warned in his annual letter to shareholders . \"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth.\"\n\nDimon said America's \"extraordinary standing\" in the world was built on the strength of its economy, military and morals. But tariffs and Trump's \"America First\" foreign policy could undermine that standing.\n\n\"If the Western world's military and economic alliances were to fragment, America itself would inevitably weaken over time,\" he said.\n\nDespite a recent plunge in markets, stocks could tumble much farther still, Dimon argued. The US stock market is set to open in bear market territory after hitting a record high less than seven weeks ago, on February 19 - the second-fastest peak-to-bear market shift in history (the fastest occurred during the 2020 pandemic).\n\n\"Even with the recent decline in market values, prices remain relatively high,\" Dimon said. \"These significant and somewhat unprecedented forces cause us to remain very cautious.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump and his tariffs have taken a bull stock market and are on the precipice of turning it into a bear faster than any president has overseen in modern history.\n\nIf the stock market closes in bear territory - a drop of 20% from a recent peak - it would be the earliest in a new administration a bull market has turned into a bear in the history of the S&P 500, which dates back to 1957.\n\nThese same tariffs may also take a booming economy and turn it into a recession .\n\nRead more about the state of the stock market today here.\n\nWe know there's a lot of chatter about the impact of the tariffs, and one word being thrown around is recession.\n\nSo, what is a recession? And why are economists concerned the world may be impacted by it?\n\nThe traditional (and official) definition of a US recession is \"a significant decline in economic activity that is spread across the economy and that lasts more than a few months.\"\n\nThat's according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, a private nonprofit organization has a very important role, when it comes to these downturns: Its Business Cycle Dating Committee is the official designator of peaks, troughs, expansions, contractions - and yes, recessions - in the business cycle.\n\nThe committee, in making its recession determination, uses three criteria: depth, diffusion and duration.\n\nThis is where it gets a little squishy.\n\nWhile each of those need to be met individually to some degree, extreme conditions in one of those areas can offset weaker conditions in the others.\n\nAlso, it's often the case that the US already is in a recession by the time the Business Cycle Dating Committee officially deems it so.\n\nPrognosticators have turned to other gauges as potential recessionary indicators; however, they don't always prove true.\n\nThe biggest rule of thumb or nonofficial recession indicator is the technical notion of back-to-back quarterly contractions in real gross domestic product - the broadest measure of economic activity.\n\nAs the European Union seeks to respond to the punishing 20% tariff the White House has placed on its exports, the bloc could negotiate with the United States on issues of energy security and military trade, a Latvian official said Monday.\n\nArtjom Uršulskis, parliamentary secretary of Latvia's foreign ministry, hinted at where the EU is looking to negotiate with the US, in comments to reporters ahead of a meeting of EU trade ministers.\n\n\"It could be energy security, it could be military trade, it could be new technologies - but we should really focus on that to find a common ground, because the trade wars are never favorable for everyone,\" Uršulskis said.\n\nOne area the EU could target is US services, rather than just goods - which would punish US tech giants. But Uršulskis said this would be the wrong focus.\n\n\"I don't think that we should target services,\" he said. \"Once again, it's much more needed to find some positive agenda and to show our partners that we can find common ground and not start new wars and new battlefields.\"\n\nGoldman Sachs is the latest Wall Street bank to warn that US President Donald Trump's trade war could crash the US economy into a damaging recession.\n\nAs financial markets plunged, Goldman Sachs economists delivered a report to clients titled \"Countdown to Recession\" that slashed their 2025 GDP forecast to 0.5% and raised their 12-month recession probability from 35% to 45%.\n\nThe investment bank cited the \"sharp tightening in financial conditions, foreign consumer boycotts, and a continued spike in policy uncertainty that is likely to depress capital spending by more than we had previously assumed.\"\n\nThe new recession warning from Goldman Sachs is lower than the 60% recession forecast from JPMorgan Chase last week. But that's because Goldman's forecast hinges on an assumption that Trump won't allow all his threatened tariffs to kick in.\n\n\"If most of the April 9 tariffs do take effect, then the effective tariff rate will rise by an estimated 20 percentage points once those increases and likely sectoral tariffs take effect, even allowing for some country-specific agreements at a later date,\" Goldman Sachs economists wrote. \"If so, we expect to change our forecast to a recession.\"\n\nIn other words, if Trump doesn't blink, Goldman Sachs believes a recession is likely on the cards.\n\nThe bank now expects the Fed to cut rates starting in June (versus July previously) followed by twice more later in the year. If a recession becomes more likely, Goldman said the Fed would likely slash interest rates by two full percentage points over the next year.\n\nAfter Elon Musk said he was in favor of \"zero tariffs\" between the United States and European Union - in opposition to policies of the US president he helped elect - Germany's economy minister said Musk was showing signs of \"weakness\" and \"fear.\"\n\n\"Yes, I read what Elon Musk said,\" Robert Habeck said Monday, referring to Musk's comments this weekend that he hopes for a \"zero-tariff situation\" between the US and EU.\n\n\"I think it's a sign of weakness and maybe of fear, because the acting politics are completely different,\" Habeck said as he arrived at a meeting of EU trade ministers.\n\n\"If he has something to say, he should go to his president and say, 'Before we're talking about zero tariffs, let's stop the nonsense, the mess you have just made in the last week,'\" Habeck said.\n\n\"This is ridiculous, and the only interpretation I have is that he now sees that his own companies, but even the economies are going to crumble because of the mess they have made, so he's afraid,\" he added, referring to Tesla's tanking stock price.\n\nHabeck called for a return to the policies of globalization that had \"served all economies\" around the world, and especially the US.\n\nMarkets are notoriously unpredictable - it's not easy to pinpoint the mood on the Street.\n\nThat's why a little over a decade ago, journalists at what was then called CNNMoney created the Fear & Greed Index - a kind of Wall Street vibe check that's been garnering extra attention in recent days as global markets have tumbled in response to President Donald Trump's tariff agenda.\n\nThe index is an easy-to-read barometer of investors' risk appetite on a 100-point scale, from extreme fear (0) to extreme greed (100).\n\nIt was designed to give a sense of how much markets are being driven by fear (selling stocks, buying safer assets like Treasury bonds) or greed (buying stocks, loading up on risk).\n\nOn Friday afternoon, in the middle of a massive global selloff , the index was at a 4, firmly in \"extreme fear.\"\n\nThe story of the index begins in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis and subsequent European debt crisis.\n\n\"So, March 2009, the market bottoms, and there's some sense of recovery, but we were all trying to figure out how to measure where we were, beyond just the daily ups and downs\" Lex Haris, former executive editor of CNNMoney, said in an interview. \"And I was just very drawn to this concept of these two emotions driving the market.\"\n\nWhen the index launched in the spring of 2012, CNNMoney's executive editor at the time, Chris Peacock, said it \"captures in an eye-blink the underlying forces driving investors' money moves.\"\n\nUS President Donald Trump's decision to impose a colossal set of tariffs on America's trading partners is tantamount to \"economic nuclear war,\" according to billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who endorsed Trump's 2024 bid for president.\n\nIn a post on X Sunday, Ackman said \"business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets\" if many of the new levies come into force on April 9. \"We will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate,\" he added in the post viewed 8.9 million times.\n\nTrump's baseline 10% tariff went into effect Saturday, while many countries are bracing for higher levies still, due to kick in Wednesday.\n\nThe CEO of Pershing Square Capital Management called for a 90-day \"time out\" in which Trump could negotiate with trading partners and \"resolve unfair asymmetric tariffs deals\" and warned that \"the president is losing the confidence of business leaders around the globe.\"\n\n\"This is not what we voted for,\" he wrote.\n\nHong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index closed 13.2% lower on Monday, making it the worst single one-day drop since 1997, according to the index's website listing its biggest daily losses.\n\nThe city's financial markets were closed on Friday for the annual Tomb Sweeping Festival.\n\nThe Hang Seng index includes stocks from some of Hong Kong's and mainland China's largest listed companies, such as Alibaba, HSBC, Tencent, Meituan and Xiaomi.\n\nChinese tech champions Alibaba and Tencent closed nearly 18% and more than 12.5% lower, respectively. Banking corporation HSBC plunged 14.8%, Chinese delivery giant Meituan plummeted 15% and consumer electronics firm Xiaomi finished down 20.6%.\n\nFriedrich Merz , Germany's chancellor-in-waiting, has called for swift action in response to US President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs that has caused global markets to plummet.\n\n\"The situation on the international equity and bond markets is dramatic and threatens to deteriorate further. It is therefore more urgent than ever for Germany to restore its international competitiveness as quickly as possible,\" Merz told Reuters Monday.\n\n\"The issue must now be at the center of the coalition negotiations,\" Merz said, referring to ongoing talks in Germany over the formation of its next government following February's election, which was won by his center-right Christian Democratic Union (CDU) party.\n\nAs a member of the European Union, Germany has been hit by a 20% \"reciprocal\" tariff on all exports to the US, while its steel and auto industry faces a separate 25% tariff.\n\nSince February's election, Germany's parliament voted to cancel its historic \"debt brake\" - a constitutional mechanism designed to limit government borrowing. The move will enable the usually fiscally conservative country to spend hundreds of billions of euros on its infrastructure and defense.\n\nAlthough analysts had hailed the attempt to revive Europe's largest economy, Trump's tariffs are set to inflict further economic pain on Germany, halting its hoped-for recovery.\n\nOil prices plunged Monday, with investors worried about the economic fallout from Donald Trump's decision to impose massive tariffs on America's trading partners.\n\nBrent crude, the global oil benchmark, plunged 3.5% to trade at $63.30 a barrel and West Texas Intermediate, the US benchmark, also fell 3.5% to $59.84 by 4.16 a.m. ET. Both are trading at their lowest levels since early 2021 when the world was still grappling with the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe falls in prices come after OPEC+, the coalition of the world's top oil producers, surprised investors last week by deciding on a much bigger boost in oil supply than planned earlier: Saudi Arabia, Russia and six other members of the group agreed on larger production increases starting in May than previously announced.\n\nAs Trump's tariffs rock global markets, countries are scrambling to negotiate concessions - but China is taking a different approach.\n\nTheir message is clear: China is well prepared to weather a trade war, and come out stronger on the other side.\n\n\"US tariffs will have an impact (on China), but 'the sky won't fall,'\" a commentary in the ruling Chinese Communist Party's mouthpiece People's Daily said Sunday.\n\n\"Since the US initiated the (first) trade war in 2017 - no matter how the US fights or presses - we have continued to develop and progress, demonstrating resilience - 'the more pressure we get, the stronger we become,'\" read the commentary, which was also on the front page of the paper's Monday edition.\n\nJust 48 hours after Trump's shocking announcement, the world's second-largest economy swiftly retaliated with its own punitive measures on US goods and firms, signaling that it's prepared for the long haul.\n\nRead the full analysis here .\n\nUS stock futures plunged before market open Monday after US President Donald Trump intensified his global trade war last week, prompting retaliation from China.\n\nDow futures were 5.5% lower and S&P 500 futures 6% down at 4.01 a.m. ET. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, meanwhile, was set to open 5.8% lower.\n\nThe massive declines in futures follow the worst two-day stretch for stocks in five years - since the pandemic.\n\nAnd market analysts said investors aren't done selling yet.\n\n\"Last week's brutal selling pressure is set to continue on Monday, as the market is telling us that investors still lack clarity on the implications of tariffs, tariff retaliation and are worried that economic growth is likely to slow to a complete stall or recession,\" said James Demmert , chief investment officer at Main Street Research.\n\nWhen US President Donald Trump unveiled his \"reciprocal\" tariffs chart, trade economists were flummoxed.\n\nNear the top of the list was Vietnam, which had imposed a 90% average tariff on US goods, according to the chart - far higher than the actual rate.\n\nBut the crude methodology used by the White House to calculate the \"reciprocal\" global tariffs quickly became clear, as was first pointed out by financial journalist James Surowiecki.\n\nThe Trump administration used a simple formula: It took each country's trade deficit with the United States, divided it by the value of that country's exports to the US, then divided this figure by half, in a gesture of \"kindness.\"\n\nLet's take this step by step, using official US data .\n\nIn 2024, Vietnam sold $136.6 billion worth of goods to the US.\n\nBecause Americans want to buy things like Nike shoes a lot more than Vietnamese want to buy things like Ford cars, the US sold just $13.1 billion of goods to Vietnam that year.\n\nThis gave Vietnam a trade surplus of $123.5 billion with the US. But one man's trade surplus is another man's trade deficit - which Trump finds unpalatable, akin to being \"ripped off.\"\n\nDividing $123.5 billion (Vietnam's trade surplus) by $136.6 (Vietnam's exports) gives 0.90, or 90% when translated into tariffs. In a supposed act of \"kindness,\" Trump nearly halved this, meaning Vietnam will now face a tariff of 46%.\n\nAnd so Trump's tariffs were designed to punish countries for having trade surpluses with the US - not for imposing actual tariffs\n\nUS stock futures plunged Sunday evening after two sessions of selloffs that wiped away more than $5.4 trillion in market value. Larry Summers, former Treasury Secretary under President Barack Obama, joined CNN's Jessica Dean to discuss the chaos.\n\nAs White House officials offered mixed messages Sunday on whether tariffs are here to stay or a negotiating ploy, Summers wrote on X that he has \"never seen as much incoherence and irrationality\" from Trump administration officials.\n\n\"This Administration doesn't have a coherent message on why it's doing the largest tax increase the country's had in 50 years. Usually when you do something consequential, you have a clear rationale that's consistently delivered, and we're not getting that,\" Summers said.\n\nTop Trump administration officials are offering mixed messaging on the possibility of negotiations on the president's newly announced tariffs , downplaying severe market volatility .\n\nUS President Donald Trump has left the door open to cutting tariff deals with countries. But messaging from his top economic lieutenants Sunday painted a murkier picture.\n\nMore than 50 countries - including Vietnam, India and Israel - have approached the White House to talk about lowering tariffs, officials said Sunday.\n\nThat outreach, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS News' \"Face the Nation,\" shows \"that all these countries know that they've been ripping us off, and the day has come for that to end.\"\n\nBut asked about the example of Vietnam and the potential lifting of tariffs, Trump's senior counselor on trade and manufacturing, Peter Navarro, said earlier on Sunday that the administration wasn't negotiating.\n\n\"This is not a negotiation. This is a national emergency based on a trade deficit that's gotten out of control because of cheating. We're always willing to listen, that's what Donald Trump does best,\" he told Fox News' \"Sunday Morning Futures.\"\n\nAgriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins also could not say whether tariffs are here to stay.\n\n\"This is the ultimate dealmaker who is a businessman at the head of our government. ... But the president is resolute in his focus and his boldness and his fearlessness and in his relentlessness to ensure that we're putting America first by using these tariffs,\" she told CNN's Jake Tapper on \"State of the Union.\"\n\nElon Musk , the world's richest man and a key aide to US President Donald Trump, said Saturday that he hopes for a \"zero-tariff situation\" between Europe and the United States.\n\nMusk's comments - in a video interview Saturday with Italy's far-right Deputy Prime Minister Matteo Salvini - are the strongest sign of splits within the Trump administration over the president's tariff announcement that sparked a global market rout.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I hope it's agreed that both Europe and the United States should move ideally, in my view, to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone between Europe and North America,\" Musk said, in contrast to the trade policy of the US president he helped elect.\n\nMusk has seen Tesla sales plunge in recent months amid his controversial cost-cutting role with the so-called Department of Government Efficiency. Sales fell 49% in Europe alone in the first two months of the quarter, according to the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association .\n\nMusk's comments come as questions swirl about his future in the White House. Last week, Politico reported - citing MAGA insiders - that Musk had overstayed his welcome in Washington and could be ousted within weeks. The White House called the Politico report \"garbage\" and Musk dismissed it as \"fake news.\"\n\nGlobal markets plunged on Monday, deepening a global stocks rout triggered by US President Donald Trump's trade war and China's forceful response to unexpectedly high tariffs.\n\nGermany's Dax opened down 9%, while London's FTSE was about 5% lower. European markets were, on the whole, faring better than Asian markets in early trade. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index closed 7.9% lower, while the broader Topix finished down 7.7%. Tech giant Sony plummeted more than 10%.\n\nIn mainland China, where markets reopened after a public holiday, the Shanghai Composite Index closed more than 7% lower. The blue-chip CSI300 index also lost about 7%. In Hong Kong, the benchmark Hang Seng index last traded just under 12% lower. Chinese tech giants Alibaba and Tencent were each down more than 14% and 10% respectively.\n\nTrading volumes in Hong Kong surged on Monday, which she said was \"a clear sign of widespread forced liquidations and what can only be described as a full-blown panic.\"\n\nAsian markets are tracking the worst two-day stretch for Wall Street stocks in five years. US stock futures plunged Sunday evening after two sessions of sell-offs that wiped away over $5.4 trillion in market value.\n\nUS stocks fell sharply on Friday after China retaliated fiercely , imposing a 34% tariff on all US goods, raising fears of an escalating and damaging trade war fueled by continuing trade tension between the world's two largest economies.\n\nRead the full story here\n\nDespite his tariffs wiping away trillions from the market value of global stocks, US President Donald Trump appeared untroubled late Sunday evening.\n\n\"I don't want anything to go down. But sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,\" Trump told reporters on Air Force One.\n\nIn his \"Liberation Day\" announcement last week, Trump claimed that the US has been \"ripped off for more than 50 years,\" saying this is \"not going to happen anymore.\"\n\nAlthough Trump's tariffs were billed as \"reciprocal,\" the levies were calculated to punish countries like Vietnam and Cambodia with whom the US has large trade deficits.\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Trump's refusal to blink on tariffs raises the risks of an ugly endgame\n\nFollow:\n\nPresident Donald Trump doesn't look like he's going to blink.\n\nChaos and fear unleashed by his \"Liberation Day\" trade war has only made him more adamant about his lifelong conviction that the world's greatest economy is a victim of cheating rivals bent on ripping it off.\n\nTrump did say Monday he's open to trade talks with powers like Japan and Israel. The prospect of nascent negotiations meant there was no repeat of gargantuan losses of last week on US markets.\n\nBut he also threatened to raise cumulative tariffs on China to over 100% - a move that could lead to massive price increases for US shoppers for iPhones, computers and toys. He also implied that the America's erstwhile friends in the European Union were such implacable foes that there can never be a fair deal.\n\nTrump's attitude seemed to dash the hopes of some observers - including some Republican senators - that he's simply trying to create leverage to get better trade conditions for the US. And judging by his comments during an Oval Office press availability, foreign trade negotiators will bang their heads against a brick wall if they seek traditional pacts that allow each side to claim they emerged victorious.\n\n\"We can make a really fair deal ... a good deal for the United States, not a good deal for others,\" Trump said, explaining his approach. \"This is America first.\"\n\nThe president's refusal to bend means that the risks that his policies could trigger a loss of global economic confidence and raging inflation will grow. That may even include the \"economic nuclear winter\" that hedge fund boss Bill Ackman invoked Sunday .\n\nPerhaps at some point, the economic and political consequences will hit such a critical mass that they force him to change course. But that equation is a daunting one, since it would become all about how much pain Americans can bear.\n\nSo far, however, a president who believes he enjoys almost absolute power and who has torn off the constraints of his first term is not looking for an off-ramp. And his zeal for confrontation and sense of mission may also have implications beyond the economy and for other policy areas - such as his expansionist designs on Greenland and Canada, his mass migrant deportations and cultural warfare.\n\n\"Nobody but me would do this,\" Trump told reporters. \"You know, it's nice to serve a nice easy term, but we have an opportunity to change the fabric of our country. We have an opportunity to reset the table on trade.\"\n\nIt's hard to work out what is next because there's a massive contradiction at the center of Trump's policy.\n\nHe insists he's trying to restore the late 19th-century glory of America's manufacturing base - a project that would require protectionism for years to come and even permanent tariffs. But he and top aides also say they are open to negotiations on trade deals - a process that would by definition fall short of the complete overhaul of the global trading system the president is after.\n\n\"Both can be true. There can be permanent tariffs and there can also be negotiations because there are things that we need beyond tariffs,\" Trump said during an Oval Office appearance with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThat dynamic seems to offer little for potential US negotiating partners.\n\nHopes of swift resolution to the trade crisis may also founder on the absolute conviction of Trump's beliefs on trade - one of the few consistent ideological principles of his life as a businessman and politician.\n\nHis ideas appear to make sense only according to his own internal logic and conflict with accepted economic theory, the advice of experts or even reality.\n\nThe complexity of any trade talks US partners may face was also laid bare in Trump's meeting with Netanyahu.\n\nThe Israeli prime minister brought with him a proposal to eliminate Israel's trade deficit with the United States - after America's sworn friend was hit by a surprising 17% duties last week. But when asked whether he'd cancel the tariff in return, Trump revealed his view that even allies are taking from the United States. \"Maybe not, maybe not. Don't forget, we help Israel a lot. You know, we give Israel $4 billion a year. That's a lot. My congratulations, by the way,\" he told his visitor.\n\nAsked to respond to the European Union's offer to zero out tariffs on cars and industrial goods with the United States, Trump implied that almost any concession would not be enough. \"The EU has been very tough over the years. It was - I always say it was formed to really do damage to the United States in trade,\" he said.\n\nTaken at face value, Trump's strategy is designed to respond to the hollowing out of US industrial heartlands by the flight of low-cost jobs overseas. He's not the first president to try this, and there were signs in the Biden administration that manufacturing was rebounding.\n\nThere's no disputing the damage done to some Americans by globalization, which left millions of working Americans lacking purpose and good livelihoods and caused social dislocation.\n\nBut is Trump's vision for the return of factory towns and large-scale industrial manufacturing realistic?\n\nHe tried to explain how it would work on Monday.\n\n\"You've got to build a thing called a factory, you have to build your energy, you have to do a lot of things,\" he said. But such a complex project would take a decade or more - certainly more than the few years left in his term. There's no guarantee company bosses will agree to make such massive investments because of the possibility that the next administration would dismantle tariffs. And factories require huge initial outlays that take years to pay for themselves.\n\nExperts also point out that the modern US economy is increasingly rooted in services and high-tech development. It's hard to see many Americans lining up for low-wage jobs in heavy industry or textile sweat shops. And if they did, it's unlikely that the US firms could produce goods as cheaply as competitors abroad.\n\nThe policies needed to enact such a vision could bring immediate vulnerabilities for the economy.\n\nThat's why some Wall Street finance houses are raising their warnings of a recession. Goldman Sachs, for instance, increased its probability assessment of such an outcome from 35% to 45% on Monday.\n\nLael Brainard, a former vice chair of the Federal Reserve, told CNN's Jake Tapper that Trump had created the possibility of a \"self-inflicted recession.\"\n\n\"The consequences of this path are already visible,\" said Brainard, a former senior Clinton administration official. \"We are seeing Americans with their 401(k) accounts very severely damaged by the last few days, and it won't be long before they are going to stores or shopping online and seeing tariff surcharges could be 20% ... on an iPhone or a washing machine.\"\n\nThere are some signs that Trump is not immune to the laws of political gravity. A handful of Republican senators have signed up for a bill that would pull back trade authority from the president to Congress in a rare break with their party leader.\n\nBut Senate GOP Majority Leader John Thune said Monday he wouldn't bring up the measure since it had no chance of passage in the Republican House. And the White House has already threatened a veto in any case. House Speaker Mike Johnson signaled no daylight with the president, telling CNN's Manu Raju, \"I think you've got to give the president the latitude, the runway to do what it is he was elected to do and that is get this economy going again and get our trade properly balanced with other countries.\"\n\nBut the president's willingness to pursue this course has many economists deeply worried.\n\n\"If President Trump carries through on this, this is economic malpractice on a grand scale - something we haven't seen in half a century,\" Greg Mankiw, who chaired the Council of Economic Advisers for President George W. Bush, told Tapper.\n\n\"I don't know what the endgame is going to be,\" Mankiw continued, \"but if he persists in this, the outcome is going to be very ugly.\"\n\n© 2025 Cable News Network.

      "text": "Here's what the smartest people in markets and economics are saying about Trump's tariffs\n\nPresident Donald Trump announced his \"Liberation Day\" tariffs on April 2 - and people have been reacting as global markets take a hammering.\n\nHere's what big names in business and economics have been saying:\n\nJoshua Bolten, the CEO of Business Roundtable, an association that represents more than 200 CEOs, said in a statement the tariffs \"run the risk of causing major harm to American manufacturers, workers, families and exporters.\" He added: \"Damage to the US economy will increase the longer the tariffs are in place and may be exacerbated by retaliatory measures.\"\n\nHe said the Business Roundtable \"supports President Trump's goal of securing better and fairer trade deals with our trading partners\" but called on him to introduce \"additional reasonable exemptions\" and a \"transparent, predictable exclusion process.\"\n\n\"Never before has an hour of Presidential rhetoric cost so many people so much,\" Larry Summers, a former Treasury secretary, wrote on X. \"The best estimate of the loss from tariff policy is now closer to $30 trillion.\"\n\nSummers added that the tariffs were the most expensive and \"masochistic\" the US had imposed in decades.\n\n\"The price action in global financial markets in the immediate aftermath of the US tariff announcement points to major worries about global economic growth,\" Mohamed El-Erian, the former CEO of bond giant PIMCO and the chief economic advisor at Allianz, said on X.\n\n\"These tariffs will cause inflation in the United States; they will cause lower consumer power of US workers. The estimates are between $1,700 to $5,000 per family in terms of the costs of these tariffs,\" Mariana Mazzucato, an economics professor at University College London, told ITV's \"Peston\" program.\n\nBoaz Weinstein, Saba Capital Management's founder, doesn't expect Trump to change course, posting on X: \"I'm often wrong, but I don't see him doing a u-turn. This is not a buy-the-dip opportunity. It's a sell the dip opportunity.\"\n\n\"So, this tariff file is now being labeled 'Make America Wealthy Again'? What is with that adverb 'again' which is defined as 'returning to a previous condition'? The previous condition, I can tell you, was not nearly as good as the current condition, seeing as US net national net worth just reached a record level of $157 TRILLION (a cool $1.2 million per household ... too bad we don't all live at the average!),\" David Rosenberg, the founder and president of Rosenberg Research & Associates, said on X.\n\n\"Have tariffs really stood in the way of wealth creation in America? I think the title should simply be the truth: 'Let's Make the World Poor Again' (and then we can buy it at a discount),\" Rosenberg added.\n\nNouriel Roubini, a professor emeritus of the NYU Stern School of Business, said the \"Liberation Day\" label was \"Orwellian doublespeak.\"\n\n\"Whatever the consequences of these tariffs will be - ie lower growth and higher inflation and how much of it depending on the eventual size of these tariffs post-negotiations that will be ugly and long-drawn. There is absolutely no 'liberation' at all in them: not for US consumers, workers and businesses, let alone for the rest of the world,\" he said on X.\n\n\"He's gone full-on crazy,\" Paul Krugman, a Nobel Memorial Prize-winning economist and former MIT and Princeton University professor, wrote in his Substack newsletter.\n\n\"If you had any hopes that Trump would step back from the brink, this announcement, between the very high tariff rates and the complete falsehoods about what other countries do, should kill them,\" Krugman added.\n\n\"March continued with President Trump's rapid executive orders and policy changes, as tariffs (along with their potential impact on the economy), inflation, employment and consumer spending became the main concerns of the market, which pulled back with increased trading on strong negative breadth,\" wrote Howard Silverblatt, a senior index analyst of S&P Dow Jones Indices, in a S&P Global column.\n\n\"Adding to the concern were Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) government employment reductions, as well as US layoffs, which have increased (along with retail warnings),\" he added.\n\n\"The price level from all 2025 tariffs rises by 2.3% in the short-run, the equivalent of an average per household consumer loss of $3,800 in 2024$. Annual losses for households at the bottom of the income distribution are $1,700,\" wrote the Yale Budget Lab in a new analysis published on April 2, shortly after Trump's blanket tariff announcement.\n\n\"Tthe United States is a large and dominant country. And it is a relatively closed country, meaning we depend less on trade than most other countries,\" said Jared Bernstein, the US's former chief economist, in his newsletter. \"That means, as Trump has correctly argued, we can hurt them more than they can hurt us. He fails to give a coherent rationale for why we need to start a trade war with Canada, Mexico, Japan, Europe, and other traditionally reliable trading partners.\"\n\n\"First, though they've been explicitly cavalier about the pain they're causing, higher inflation, slower growth, lower investment, falling stock prices - as of this moment, the Dow is down 1,200 points - and higher recession chances could force them to recant. But, at least so far, that may have been the way of Trump 1; it's not the way of Trump 2,\" he added.\n\n\"Monstrously destructive, incoherent, ill-informed tariffs based on fabrications, imagined wrongs, discredited theories and ignorance of decades of evidence. And the real tragedy is that they will hurt working Americans more than anyone else,\" said Justin Wolfers, an economics professor at University of Michigan and public policy scholar, on BlueSky.\n\n\"If these tariffs were more targeted and on specific goods, I wouldn't be so sure we would have stagflation. But these appear to be extremely broad, so I expect higher inflation and lower or even negative economic growth,\" said Daryl Fairweather, Redfin's chief economist, on BlueSky.\n\n\"Home construction was already going to be weak this year, but these tariffs (combined with labor problems from immigration policy) will mean fewer homes built,\" she added.\n\nThe latest set of tariffs is \"a similar event to going off the gold standard in 1971. It's an epic event. It's not something where you can time quickly for a market bottom. It's something that we're going to have to live with as long as President Trump continues with this stance,\" Bill Gross, the cofounder of Pimco, told CNBC.\n\n\"I don't think he's going to back down. President Trump, to be very blunt, is a macho male, and this macho male is not going to back down tomorrow simply because the Nasdaq's down 5%,\" said Gross, who's also known as \"Bond King.\"\n\nGross said it's not a time for investors to bottom fish, likening it to \"catching a falling knife.\"\n\n\"Tariffs attack US trading partners but, in effect, attack US corporate profit margins first,\" wrote Steven Blitz, the chief US economist at GlobalData.TS Lombard. \"The 40-odd years of profits rising relative to GDP has ended. The macro risk hitting markets is real, but only accentuates the devaluation process.\"\n\n\"Further exacerbating market volatility is redirection of foreign capital from the US to wherever multiple expansion appears more promising,\" Blitz wrote.\n\nJim O'Neill, a former chief economist at Goldman Sachs, told BBC News on Friday that the \"sensible\" thing to do would be for the UK to speak to other members of G7, aside from the US, about lowering trade barriers between each other, particularly for cross-border services.\n\nHe said this would be \"very healthy for all those countries because it's the one area of global trade that most countries haven't done enough in.\"\n\nIf the US wants to continue down this \"kamikaze path,\" the UK will have to respond, O'Neill added. \"It is the US which is going to be hurt more, especially in the short-term, from these rather insane moves.\"\n\n\"Just had a journalist ask me to explain \"Liberation Day,\"\" Stephanie Kelton, the author of The Deficit Myth, wrote in a post on X. \"I told him it's about liberating Americans from some of the cash in their wallets.\"\n\nGeorge Saravelos, a Deutsche Bank analyst, said in a Friday note that markets were pricing in a global recession.\n\n\"This is a US-centric fiscal shock driven by the Trump administration and it is fiscal policy that can unwind it. The countries that respond the quickest and most forcefully to this shock are those whose currencies will likely be the most resilient. And, on the flipside, the more the US fiscal strategy under the Trump administration lacks visibility, the more the market will punish the dollar and US assets.\n\n\"One last point: don't expect a reluctant-to-cut Fed to support the dollar. Remember that during the European supply-shock of 2022, the ECB turned hawkish. The euro sold-off regardless because real rates and growth expectations collapsed.\"\n\nKristalina Georgieva, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, warned that US tariffs posed a \"significant risk\" to the global economy.\n\n\"We are still assessing the macroeconomic implications of the announced tariff measures, but they clearly represent a significant risk to the global outlook at a time of sluggish growth,\" she said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nChristine Lagarde, the president of the European Central Bank, told Ireland's Newstalk that the tariffs would be \"negative the world over.\"\n\nShe said Trump's move \"will not be good for the global economy and it will not be good for those who inflict the tariffs and those who retaliate.\"\n\nLloyd Blankfein, the former Goldman Sachs CEO, posted on X on Friday:\n\n\"The switchboard at the WH must be burning up with gov'ts trying to surrender in this trade war. Why not give them a chance? Make the 10pct min tariff immediate but defer the \"reciprocal\" part 6 mos. Take the win! The Prez said he'd make us tired of winning...I'm there now!\"\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell on Friday said that the scope of Trump's tariffs actions surpassed all expectations.\n\n\"While uncertainty remains elevated, it is now becoming clear that the tariff increases will be significantly larger than expected,\" Powell said at a conference for business journalists. \"The same is likely to be true of the economic effects, which will include higher inflation and slower growth.\"\n\nThe central bank president repeatedly said it was too early to tell what the Fed's response might be.\n\n\"We've taken a step back and we're watching to see what the policies turn out to be and the ways in which they will affect the economy, and then we'll be able to act, he said.\"\n\nKevin Corinth, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning, DC-based think tank, wrote in an article published Friday that the formula behind Trump's tariffs , which puts heavy emphasis on trade deficits, makes \"no economic sense.\"\n\n\"The trade deficit with a given country is not determined only by tariffs and non-tariff trade barriers, but also by international capital flows, supply chains, comparative advantage, geography, etc,\" Corinth wrote. \"But even if one were to take the Trump Administration's tariff formula seriously, it makes an error that inflates the tariffs assumed to be levied by foreign countries four-fold.\"\n\nIn a post on X on Thursday, Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, warned that a recession could \"hit imminently and extend until next year\" should Trump continue with his tariffs and other countries retaliate.\n\n\"Real GDP will fall close to 2% peak to trough, and unemployment will increase from its current 4% to 7.5% at its peak next year. I attach a 15% probability to this dark scenario,\" he predicted.\n\nSpeaking to Bloomberg TV, veteran analyst Ed Yardeni said he hoped the \"message that the stock market is sending to the administration is being heard.\"\n\n\"The market is giving a big thumbs down to this tariff policy,\" he added.\n\nBrad Setser , the former senior advisor to the US trade representative and a fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations, said the latest round of tariffs will be \"painful.\"\n\n\"I think what the announcement on Wednesday showed is that the decision of the administration, not surprisingly, was to follow President Trump's instincts, not the instincts of his more moderate advisors, to go all in,\" Setser said on Bloomberg's Odd Lots podcast.\n\nSetser said the goal is to \"radically restructure the US and global economies using tariffs as a tool, with some flexibility perhaps to negotiate at the edges. But fundamentally, this is a test of what you can and cannot do with tariffs, and there was very little restraint, I would say, apart for, strangely enough, Canada and Mexico, USMCA, on the level of the tariffs.\"\n\nGreg Daco, the chief economist at Ernst & Young, told Yahoo Finance that \"the risk of a recession are very real\" with the tariffs in place.\n\n\"The risks of a particularly severe recession are real, because if these tariffs remain in place on a persistent basis, you would see a drag on US economic activity worth about 1% to 1.5% of growth,\" he said. \"In an economy that is expected to grow around 1.5%, that puts the economy essentially into stagnation. Add to that a 1% to 1.5% lift on inflation, and you have stagflation.\"\n\nDouglas Irwin, the trade historian and economics professor at Dartmouth College, wrote in The Economist that Trump's tariffs \"blow an enormous hole\" in the trade policy that the US has advanced since World War II.\n\n\"The president now touts his tariffs as mainly 'reciprocal': 'Whatever they charge us, we charge them.' This makes them sound fair. Far from it,\" Irwin said.\n\n\"Perhaps the most shocking aspect of this week's events is the ability of one person to completely remake American trade policy. A situation in which the occupant of the White House can make such momentous changes on his own, unchecked, reflects serious political decay in American politics.\"\n\nOne day before Trump's latest tariff announcement, the economist Thomas Sowell told the Hoover Institution that the president's tariffs could lead to a global trade war.\n\n\"It's painful to see a ruinous decision from back in the 1920s being repeated,\" Sowell said. \"If you set off a worldwide trade war, that has a devastating history.\"\n\n\"Everybody loses because everybody follows suit,\" he continued. \"And all that happens is that you get a great reduction in international trade.\"\n\nBillionaire investor Bill Ackman wrote on X that the US's global economic war against the world risks destroying confidence in America as a trading partner and investment destination.\n\nAckman, the founder of Pershing Square, suggested a 90-day time-out to negotiate and resolve \"unfair asymmetric tariff deals.\"\n\n\"If, on the other hand, on April 9th we launch economic nuclear war on every country in the world, business investment will grind to a halt, consumers will close their wallets and pocket books, and we will severely damage our reputation with the rest of the world that will take years and potentially decades to rehabilitate,\" wrote Ackman.\n\nAnalysts at Goldman Sachs hiked their probability for a US recession from 35% to 45% on a sharp tightening in financial conditions, overseas consumer boycotts, and a spike in policy uncertainty that will depress capital spending.\n\nThe forecast is based on their assumption that the effective tariff rate rises by 15 percentage points - which is less than what has been announced. If most of the tariffs take effect on Wednesday, that would raise the effective tariff rate by 20 percentage points. In that case, the analysts expect a recession, they wrote.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Trump's new tariffs are poised to hit an already-battered economy\n\nCompanies have warned of rising prices . Markets have plunged. Bad vibes are back. President Donald Trump's tariff plans might not be in full force yet - but Americans are feeling the strain.\n\nTrump's so-called \"Liberation Day\" is here. It's the name he gave April 2, when he's expected to unveil a range of broad tariffs on key trading partners. Leading up to the announcements, the University of Michigan's consumer survey in late March found that Americans' outlook on the economy took a dive - consumer sentiment was down 11.9% from February and 28.2% from one year ago.\n\nInflation fears largely drove the downturn, and consumers are worried about \"the potential for pain amid ongoing economic policy developments,\" the survey said. One of those developments is Trump's tariff plans; Trump has maintained that his trade policies would bring in revenue and restore jobs but acknowledged in February that Americans would feel \"some pain\" as a result.\n\nThat pain has already started taking shape. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said during a March press conference that American consumers' gloomy outlook - particularly around high grocery prices - \"probably has to do with turmoil at the beginning of an administration that's making big changes in policy.\"\n\nPowell also said that \"a good part\" of the Federal Open Market Committee's latest inflation projections, which showed higher inflation than its December forecast, was a response to Trump's shifting tariff announcements.\n\n\"I do think with the arrival of the tariff inflation, further progress may be delayed,\" Powell said.\n\nTrade policy experts have said companies might absorb some of the cost of Trump's planned tariffs, but Americans are likely to see higher prices on goods like groceries and cars. While Trump has also said that his plans would promote production in the US, the uncertainty is leaving markets, businesses, and Americans on edge.\n\nAlex Jacquez, an advisor on the National Economic Council under former President Joe Biden, told reporters on a Tuesday press call that uncertainty around Trump's trade policy makes it \"hard for the American people to see that they are going to have a strategy long term for how they should be spending their money and investing.\"\n\n\"When the president doesn't have a clear strategy or direction, it is extremely difficult for businesses in particular and consumers as well, to plan for the future, and that's why you're seeing so much uncertainty in the consumer market right now and so much uncertainty in the business community,\" Jacquez said.\n\nKush Desai, a White House spokesperson, told Business Insider that \"fearmongering by the media and Democrats about President Trump's America First economic agenda isn't going to change the fact that industry leaders have already made trillions in investment commitments to make in America.\"\n\n\"President Trump used tariffs to deliver historic job, wage, and economic growth with no inflation in his first term, and he's set to restore American Greatness in his second term,\" Desai said.\n\nJoseph Dennis, 73, voted for Trump but previously told BI he was concerned about the administration's decisions on tariffs and federal job cuts and wished they were less extreme. He's one of many retirees watching their investments fluctuate in value under Trump.\n\n\"I hope he knows what he's doing, but I'm not so sure,\" Dennis said.\n\nStock markets worldwide have swung wildly in anticipation of Trump's Liberation Day. Major US stock indexes dropped sharply to start the week before staging a rebound and ended Tuesday's session mostly higher as investors braced for the tariff announcement.\n\nIt's not just Liberation Day - markets have been fluctuating for weeks in response to Trump's shifting tariff announcements. Additionally, some companies have been preparing to raise prices in anticipation of Trump's tariff plans. Target CEO Brian Cornell told CNBC in early March that Trump's tariff policy could lead the company to raise prices on produce.\n\nTrump has previously said a range of tariffs would go into effect on April 2, including levies on goods from Canada and Mexico, automobiles, and reciprocal tariffs on the countries that have imposed tariffs on US goods. However, the president told reporters on March 23 that he \"may give a lot of countries a break.\"\n\n\"I don't change. But the word flexibility is an important word,\" Trump said.\n\nThat \"flexibility\" is making it difficult for businesses and consumers to prepare for the future, Heather Boushey, an economist who served on former President Joe Biden's Council of Economic Advisors, told reporters.\n\n\"Both businesses and consumers are getting shaken by this approach,\" Boushey said. \"They see it as chaotic. They don't see what the plan is, but there's a concept of a plan, and that expectations are falling and falling rapidly.\"\n\nHave a tip or story to share?

      "text": "Meet the most powerful women in the Trump administration\n\nIn an appearance on \"The View\" ahead of the 2024 election, Mark Cuban said that President Donald Trump \"doesn't like to be challenged\" by \"strong, intelligent women.\"\n\nSusie Wiles, Trump's 2024 campaign manager who went on to become his White House chief of staff, had something to say about that.\n\n\"I'm told @mcuban needs help identifying the strong and intelligent women surrounding Pres. Trump,\" she wrote in a rare social media post on X. \"Well, here we are! I've been proud to lead this campaign.\"\n\n(Cuban later apologized for his wording, but added that \"I stand by my opinion that he does not like being challenged publicly.\")\n\nTrump's history with women is complex, with a record of inflammatory comments , lawsuits , and contentious political actions such as laying the groundwork to overturn Roe v. Wade . However, Trump has also made notable gains with women voters. In 2024, 45% of women voted for Trump compared to 55% of men - a narrower gender gap than in 2016 and 2020, according to the Center for American Women and Politics .\n\nDuring his second non-consecutive term, Trump has named women to several historic appointments in his administration, including the first female White House chief of staff and the youngest-ever press secretary.\n\nAccording to the Center for American Women and Politics, one-third of Trump's Cabinet and Cabinet-level appointments - eight out of 24 - are women.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nMeet the most powerful women in the Trump administration.\n\nAt his 2024 election victory party , Trump said that Susie Wiles \"likes to stay in the background,\" but she has emerged as a key figure in Trump's political operation.\n\nWiles is the first woman in US history to serve as a president's chief of staff. A longtime member of Trump's inner circle, she ran his Florida campaigns in 2016 and 2020 and acted as his campaign manager in 2024.\n\n\"Susie is tough, smart, innovative, and is universally admired and respected,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social when announcing Wiles as his White House chief of staff. \"Susie will continue to work tirelessly to Make America Great Again.\"\n\nIn a March interview on Lara Trump's \"My View\" show on Fox News, Wiles described herself as \"quietly competitive.\"\n\n\"I see my job as just sort of keeping the trains on the tracks and running on time here, so that the subject matter experts, and particularly the president and the vice president, can do what they need to do to fix the country,\" she said.\n\nAt 27, Karoline Leavitt is the youngest-ever White House press secretary. During Trump's first presidency, she interned at the White House as a college student and worked with then-press secretary Kayleigh McEnany after graduating. After running for Congress in New Hampshire in 2022, she joined Trump's 2024 presidential campaign as his national press secretary.\n\nLeavitt has spoken about navigating motherhood as a high-powered member of Trump's presidential campaign, telling The Conservateur in October that going back to work after having her baby was \"incredibly challenging emotionally, physically, spiritually.\" She took just four days off after giving birth in July, returning to work after Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally on July 13 in Butler, Pennsylvania.\n\n\"He doesn't care if you're a man or a woman, with kids or no kids,\" Leavitt said of working for Trump. \"He just wants the hardest worker and the best person for the job. And that's what makes him a great boss.\"\n\nAs press secretary, Leavitt continues to shape the narrative of the Trump administration, establishing a \"new media seat\" in the White House briefing room and restricting the access of outlets that don't follow Trump's executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America .\n\nAfter former Rep. Matt Gaetz withdrew from consideration for the role of US attorney general in November, Trump nominated Pam Bondi , the former attorney general of Florida, to lead the Justice Department.\n\nBondi represented Trump during his first impeachment trial in 2020.\n\n\"For too long, the partisan Department of Justice has been weaponized against me and other Republicans - Not anymore,\" Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social announcing Bondi's nomination. \"Pam will refocus the DOJ to its intended purpose of fighting Crime, and Making America Safe Again.\"\n\nTulsi Gabbard , a former Democratic congresswoman and presidential candidate who supported Sen. Bernie Sanders' 2016 campaign, made a hard-right pivot after dropping out of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. She became a Fox News contributor, campaigned with GOP candidates, and joined Trump's 2024 transition team along with Robert F. Kennedy Jr .\n\nAs director of national intelligence, Gabbard leads 17 organizations in  the US Intelligence Community. She did not have prior intelligence experience beyond serving on House committees during her time in Congress.\n\n\"As a former Candidate for the Democratic Presidential Nomination, she has broad support in both Parties - She is now a proud Republican! I know Tulsi will bring the fearless spirit that has defined her illustrious career to our Intelligence Community, championing our Constitutional Rights, and securing Peace through Strength,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social in his announcement of her nomination.\n\nGabbard was one of the Trump officials added to a Signal group chat created by national security advisor Mike Waltz discussing attack plans against Houthi militants in Yemen , which also inadvertently included The Atlantic editor Jeffery Goldberg.\n\nKristi Noem formerly served as a Republican congresswoman and governor of South Dakota. She was reportedly considered as a potential running mate for Trump's 2024 campaign.\n\nAs Trump's homeland security secretary, Kristi Noem oversees US Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the US Secret Service.\n\nImmigration and border security were defining issues of the 2024 election, and Trump has already implemented a hardline approach with executive orders declaring a national emergency at the southern border and attempting to end birthright citizenship.\n\nNoem has followed suit, wearing border patrol and ICE uniforms while visiting detention centers and ports of entry and warning those who have entered the country illegally to \"leave now\" because \"the gravy train is over.\"\n\nWhen nominating Linda McMahon for education secretary, Trump wrote on Truth Social that \"We will send Education BACK TO THE STATES, and Linda will spearhead that effort.\"\n\nMcMahon, the former CEO of WWE, served as the head of the Small Business Administration during Trump's first term before stepping down to chair the pro-Trump super PAC America First Action. She also served on the Connecticut Board of Education for one year.\n\nIn March, Trump signed an executive order directing McMahon to begin dismantling the Department of Education . In a radio interview with WABC 770 AM's \"Cats & Cosby,\" McMahon said Trump was \"dead serious about the fact that he wants me to fire myself.\"\n\nLori Chavez-DeRemer, a former Republican representative from Oregon, is widely viewed as a more moderate member of the Trump administration because of her support for pro-union legislation.\n\n\"Lori has worked tirelessly with both Business and Labor to build America's workforce, and support the hardworking men and women of America,\" Trump wrote in his announcement of her nomination on Truth Social. \"I look forward to working with her to create tremendous opportunity for American Workers, to expand Training and Apprenticeships, to grow wages and improve working conditions, to bring back our Manufacturing jobs.\"\n\nThe Department of Labor has faced significant cuts as Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency moves to end numerous programs and slash millions from its budget. In March, the official DOGE account on X praised Chavez-DeRemer for \"canceling $577M in 'America Last' grants for $237M in savings.\"\n\nAlina Habba rose to prominence as Trump's personal attorney during a series of high-profile lawsuits including his civil fraud trial and defamation trial in which the verdict awarded columnist E. Jean Carrol $83 million.\n\nIn March, Trump appointed Habba as interim US attorney for the District of New Jersey.\n\n\"Just like I did during my time as President Trump's personal attorney, I will continue to fight for truth and justice. We will end the weaponization of justice, once and for all,\" Habba wrote on X .\n\nKelly Loeffler, a millionaire businesswoman and former CEO of the bitcoin company Bakkt, previously served as a senator from Georgia.\n\n\"Kelly will bring her experience in business and Washington to reduce red tape, and unleash opportunity for our Small Businesses to grow, innovate, and thrive,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social. \"She will focus on ensuring that SBA is accountable to Taxpayers by cracking down on waste, fraud, and regulatory overreach.\"\n\nAs head of the Small Business Administration, Loeffler has visited Los Angeles to assess post-wildfire recovery efforts for small businesses and announced that the SBA would move six of its offices out of \" sanctuary cities \" that refuse ICE detention requests and relocate them to \"municipalities who share this Administration's commitment to secure borders and safe communities.\"\n\nIn Trump's first White House administration, Brooke Rollins served as director of the Domestic Policy Council, assistant to the president for strategic initiatives, and director of the Office of American Innovation. She went on to serve as the president and CEO of the America First Policy Institute, a conservative think tank.\n\n\"Brooke's commitment to support the American Farmer, defense of American Food Self-Sufficiency, and the restoration of Agriculture-dependent American Small Towns is second to none,\" Trump said in a statement announcing her nomination.\n\nRollins' main focus as agriculture secretary has been lowering the price of eggs , which rose 237% from January 2021 to January 2025.\n\nJanette Nesheiwat is a family and emergency physician educated at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. She is also the medical director of CityMD, an urgent-care center chain in New York and New Jersey, and a former Fox News contributor.\n\nTrump called Nesheiwat \"a fierce advocate and strong communicator for preventive medicine and public health\" in his Truth Social post announcing her nomination.\n\nNesheiwat has not yet been confirmed by the Senate.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Here's where all the firms in the Trump-Big Law fight stand\n\nAs Donald Trump has taken aim at Big Law in recent weeks, some law firms have made deals with the president, while others are refusing to throw in the towel.\n\nThe president's wide-reaching orders have prompted reviews of each firm's government contracts, canceling security clearances for some employees and, in certain cases, blocking them from entering federal buildings - including courthouses.\n\nTrump has accused the Big Law firms - including Paul Weiss, Perkins Coie, and Covington & Burling, among others - of weaponizing the judicial system. His orders have, in turn, made it harder for the firms to continue conducting business as usual. Several firms have alleged in lawsuits that the executive orders intended to chill free speech and deter clients from doing business with them. Others have agreed to work with the administration to avoid punitive executive actions against them.\n\nThe president has singled out a string of law firms that he says have wronged him in some capacity, have worked with his political opponents, or have had diversity initiatives that are counter to his anti-DEI efforts.\n\nWhat's more, Trump instructed Attorney General Pam Bondi to identify firms with \"frivolous\" cases against the administration so that they could be targeted for further executive action.\n\nWhether they're on the ropes or down for the count, here are the firms Trump is taking on, how they've responded, and where the legal process stands for those who have challenged him in court.\n\nOn March 14, Trump issued an executive order directed at the prominent New York City-based law firm Paul Weiss, where he railed against the attorney Mark Pomerantz and decried what he said was \"unlawful discrimination\" from diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives at the firm.\n\nPomerantz previously left Paul Weiss to aid the Manhattan District Attorney's office as it probed Trump's finances. When Pomerantz resigned as special district attorney in February 2022, he wrote in a departing letter that he believed Trump was \"guilty of numerous felony violations.\"\n\nIn the order, Trump sought to revoke security clearances and bar access to government buildings for attorneys of the firm. Such a sweeping directive could also include federal courthouses, a scenario that would be detrimental to the firm's work.\n\nHowever, Trump just days later rescinded the executive order and announced an agreement with Paul Weiss chairman Brad Karp. Trump said the firm would provide $40 million in pro bono work for causes that the administration supports and end its DEI policies.\n\nKarp received a heap of criticism, with many questioning why Paul Weiss didn't challenge Trump's order. In an email to the firm's attorneys , he said there was a desire from the outset to challenge the directive. In the same email, though, Karp argued that even if Paul Weiss won in court, it would become \"persona non grata\" with the Trump White House, which could prompt a wave of clients to switch to other firms and subsequently threaten the viability of the firm.\n\n\"It was very likely that our firm would not be able to survive a protracted dispute with the administration,\" Karp wrote in the email.\n\nOn March 6, Trump targeted the law firm Perkins Coie , issuing an executive order to suspend the security clearances of the firm's attorneys and criticizing its diversity and inclusion policies.\n\nIn the order, Trump called out what he said was the firm's \"dishonest and dangerous activity.\"\n\nThe president, in his order, highlighted the firm's representation of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton - his rival in the 2016 presidential election - during that year's tumultuous campaign.\n\nHowever, Perkins Coie struck back, filing a lawsuit against the administration for actions that it said \"violates core constitutional rights, including the rights to free speech and due process.\"\n\n\"At the heart of the order is an unlawful attack on the freedom of all Americans to select counsel of their choice without fear of retribution or punishment from the government,\" Perkins Coie managing director Bill Malley said in a statement in March. \"We were compelled to take this action to protect our firm and our clients.\"\n\nThe day after Perkins Coie filed its suit, a federal judge agreed to temporarily block part of the president's executive order.\n\nPerkins Coie, in a statement, said the ruling was \"an important first step in ensuring this unconstitutional Executive Order is never enforced.\"\n\nTrump on February 25 signed a memorandum to evaluate federal contracts and direct the suspension of security clearances for some employees at Covington & Burling, a DC-based law firm known for its antitrust work.\n\nThe president in the memo said he was suspending the clearances of individuals who advised former special counsel Jack Smith.\n\nSmith brought two federal cases against Trump - one for election interference in the 2020 presidential election and the other for retaining classified documents - but both were dropped after the president won reelection to a second term in November 2024.\n\nIn the memo, Trump went after individuals whom he said were \"involved in the weaponization of government\" and named Peter Koski, a lawyer at Covington representing Smith.\n\nA Covington spokesperson in March said it was representing Smith in an \"individual\" capacity.\n\n\"We recently agreed to represent Jack Smith when it became apparent that he would become a subject of a government investigation,\" the spokesperson said in a statement. \"We look forward to defending Mr. Smith's interests and appreciate the trust he has placed in us to do so.\"\n\nSkadden made a deal with Trump , acting before it was singled out in any executive orders. The firm promised to provide $100 million in pro bono legal services \"to causes that the President and Skadden both support,\" Trump announced on March 28.\n\nSkadden also affirmed its commitment to merit-based hiring and employee retention, Trump said. The firm also agreed that it would refrain from engaging in \"illegal DEI discrimination,\" according to a copy of the agreement that Trump shared on Truth Social.\n\nIn a statement, Jeremy London, Skadden's executive partner, said the firm \"engaged proactively\" with the administration to reach the agreement.\n\n\"We firmly believe that this outcome is in the best interests of our clients, our people, and our Firm,\" London said.\n\nSpeaking from the White House, Trump referred to the deal as \"essentially a settlement.\"\n\nWithin the firm, some associates and employees expressed frustration about the deal, calling it the beginning of the end for Skadden.\n\nIn the weeks leading up to the agreement, Skadden associate Rachel Cohen publicly resigned and circulated an open letter among associates at top firms calling out their employers for what she has described as inaction in the face of the administration's attacks.\n\nAfter the deal was announced, another employee, Brenna Frey , also resigned publicly in an announcement on LinkedIn.\n\nThe chair of Elias Law Group took a different approach after it was targeted by the administration.\n\nTrump named the Elias Law Group in his \"frivolous\" lawsuits memo, formally titled \"Preventing Abuses of the Legal System and the Federal Court.\"\n\nIt claimed that the law firm was \"deeply involved in the creation of a false 'dossier' by a foreign national designed to provide a fraudulent basis for Federal law enforcement to investigate a Presidential candidate in order to alter the outcome of the Presidential election.\"\n\nThe memo went on to say that the firm \"intentionally sought to conceal the role of his client - failed Presidential candidate Hillary Clinton - in the dossier.\"\n\nMarc Elias, the Democratic election lawyer who founded and chairs the group, released a statement swinging back at Trump, whose actions target \"every attorney and law firm who dares to challenge his assault on the rule of law,\" he said.\n\n\"President Trump's goal is clear,\" Elias said in the statement. \"He wants lawyers and law firms to capitulate and cower until there is no one left to oppose his Administration in court.\"\n\nAdding that American democracy is in a state of \"peril,\" Elias said his law firm would not cower.\n\n\"Elias Law Group will not be deterred from fighting for democracy in court,\" he said. \"There will be no negotiation with this White House about the clients we represent or the lawsuits we bring on their behalf.\"\n\nTrump signed an order naming Jenner & Block on March 25 that revoked security clearances from the firm's attorneys and ordered a review of the firm's contracts with the federal government.\n\nTrump's order singled out Andrew Weissmann, a former Jenner attorney who Trump accused of building his career around \"weaponized government and abuse of power.\" Weissmann was a lead prosecutor in Robert Mueller's Special Counsel's Office, which investigated Trump's 2016 presidential campaign and its ties to Russia.\n\nJenner issued a statement calling the order an \"unconstitutional executive order that has already been declared unlawful by a federal court.\"\n\n\"We remain focused on serving and safeguarding our clients' interests with the dedication, integrity, and expertise that has defined our firm for more than one hundred years and will pursue all appropriate remedies,\" the statement from Jenner said.\n\nJenner also fought back with a lawsuit. The firm is represented by Cooley LLP, a liberal-leaning firm that has hired lawyers from Democratic administrations.\n\nOn March 28, Judge John D. Bates of the US District Court for the District of Columbia issued a temporary restraining order that keeps the Trump administration from taking action against Jenner. On April 1, Bates extended this order until a final judgement has been made. Both the Justice Department and Jenner consented to the extension.\n\nFollowing the ruling, Jenner said in a statement that the order holds \"no legal weight.\"\n\n\"We will continue to do what we have always done, our job as lawyers and fearless advocates for our clients,\" the firm said.\n\nThe Trump administration has also targeted WilmerHale , which employed Mueller and other lawyers who worked with the Justice Department to investigate ties between Russia and Trump's 2016 campaign.\n\nOn March 27, Trump signed an executive order that suspended security clearances for WilmerHale employees and limited their access to federal buildings. The order also revoked WilmerHale's government contracts for engaging in \"partisan representations to achieve political ends\" and \"efforts to discriminate on the basis of race.\"\n\nIn contrast with other firms that have inked deals with the president, WilmerHale filed a lawsuit.\n\nThe firm hired Paul Clement, the conservative legal superstar of the firm Clement & Murphy, to fight back against the Trump administration.\n\n\"This lawsuit is absolutely critical to vindicating the First Amendment, our adversarial system of justice, and the rule of law,\" Clement told Business Insider in a statement.\n\nOn the afternoon of March 28, Judge Richard J. Leon of the US District Court for the District of Columbia approved a motion for a temporary restraining order to halt executive actions against WilmerHale.\n\n\"There is no doubt this retaliatory action chills speech and legal advocacy, or that it qualifies as a constitutional harm,\" Leon wrote.\n\nA spokesperson for WilmerHale called the executive order unconstitutional and praised the court's \"swift action.\"\n\nOn April 2, Trump announced on Truth Social that he had struck a preemptive deal with Milbank without targeting the firm for executive action.\n\nThe terms of the deal, according to the president's announcement, include the firm's agreement to end any DEI-based hiring practices, and to perform at least $100 million worth of pro bono legal work to advance causes supported by the Trump administration, such as \"assisting veterans\" and \"combatting antisemitism.\"\n\nIn addition, Milbank's pro bono committee will ensure the firm takes on cases representing \"the full political spectrum, including Conservative ideals,\" and commits that it \"will not deny representation to clients\" based on the personal political views of individual lawyers, per Trump's announcement.\n\n\"Milbank LLP approached President Donald J. Trump and his Administration, stating their resolve to help end the Weaponization of the Justice System and the Legal Profession,\" reads a statement from the White House included in Trump's post. \"The President continues to build an unrivaled network of Lawyers, who will put a stop to Partisan Lawfare in America, and restore Liberty and Justice FOR ALL.\"\n\nMilbank's chairman, Scott Edelman, said in a statement posted by Trump that, after a \"constructive dialogue,\" the firm was \"pleased we were so quickly able to find common ground\" with the administration.\n\nWhen reached by Business Insider, a spokesperson for the firm provided a letter sent by Edelman to Milbank's staff in which he said the agreement \"is very much in Milbank's interest.\"\n\n\"The Administration's expressed concerns about big law firms, and in some cases its entry of Executive Orders against particular firms, have created uncertainty for law firms like ours,\" Edelman's letter to staff reads. \"With this agreement, we believe we have gone a long way to putting these issues behind us. But we have done so in a way that allows us to continue to focus on the Firm's values and missions, including with respect to pro bono and our hope to foster an inclusive, non-discriminatory community where all of our members have an equal opportunity to succeed.\"\n\nEdelman added: \"Having now reached an agreement with the Administration, we can continue to do what we do best - focus on providing the best possible advice, counseling and service to our clients.\"\n\nOn April 9, Trump signed an executive memorandum targeting Susman Godfrey, a specialized litigation firm.\n\nIn a fact sheet, the White House accused Susman of spearheading \"efforts to weaponize the American legal system and degrade the quality of American elections.\"\n\nTrump's order sought to immediately suspend any Susman security clearances held by the firm's employees, \"pending a review of whether such clearances are consistent with the national interest.\" The federal government said it would also terminate any contracts with the firm.\n\nThe firm's hiring practices will also be reviewed \"to ensure compliance with civil rights laws against racial bias.\"\n\nOn April 11, Susman filed a complaint against the Trump administration, arguing that Trump's executive order was in violation of the Constitution.\n\n\"Unless the Judiciary acts with resolve-now-to repudiate this blatantly unconstitutional Executive Order and the others like it, a dangerous and perhaps irreversible precedent will be set,\" the complaint reads.\n\n\"If President Trump's Executive Orders are allowed to stand, future presidents will face no constraint when they seek to retaliate against a different set of perceived foes. What for two centuries has been beyond the pale will become the new normal,\" it adds.\n\nWillkie Farr & Gallagher , which employs Doug Emhoff, husband of former Vice President Kamala Harris, struck a deal with the administration, pledging at least $100 million in pro bono legal work for conservative causes, Trump said in an April 1 social media post.\n\n\"Willkie Farr & Gallagher LLP proactively reached out to President Trump and his Administration, offering their decisive commitment to ending the Weaponization of the Justice System and the Legal Profession,\" the White House said, according to Trump's post on Truth Social.\n\nThe firm's ties to Trump go to the 1990s when it represented the then real estate developer in a bankruptcy case.\n\nIn 2023, Willkie brought Tim Heaphy as partner. Heaphy was the former chief investigative counsel for the congressional committee that investigated the January 6, 2021, attacks on the Capitol.\n\nThe firm also represents X, Elon Musk's social media platform.\n\nTrump said that Willkie Farr & Gallagher also committed to \"Merit-Based Hiring, Promotion, and Retention,\" which touches on the Trump's efforts to dismantle DEI initiatives.\n\nA representative for Willkie Farr & Gallagher did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump said in a Truth Social post April 11 that the administration had come to an agreement with Cadwalader, Wickersham & Taft, saying the law firm agreed to provide $100 million in pro bono legal services.\n\nThe services would go toward causes supported by Trump and the law firm, including assisting veterans and law enforcement, combatting antisemitism, and \"ensuring fairness in our justice system.\"\n\nThe statement said the firm also agreed to \"not engage in illegal DEI discrimination and preferences\" or to deny legal representation \"because of the personal political views of individual lawyers.\"\n\n\"The substance of our agreement is consistent with the principles that have guided Cadwalader for over 230 years: We always put our client's interests first; We believe that Justice should be available to everyone; and We are committed to attracting, retaining and nurturing the very best talent from all backgrounds,\" Patrick Quinn, managing partner at Cadwalader, said in a statement shared by Trump.\n\nCadwalader did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nTrump also announced on April 11 the administration had come to an agreement with an additional four law firms, including Kirkland & Ellis. The president said in a Truth Social post the firms agreed to provide a total of $500 million in pro bono legal services to go toward the same types of causes, with each firm contributing $125 million.\n\nThe firms also agreed to engage outside counsel to oversee their hiring practices and ensure they comply with antidiscrimination laws.\n\nTrump said as a result of the agreement, he would end an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission investigation into the law firms over their DEI practices, which was initially announced on March 17.\n\nIn a joint statement shared by Trump, the senior executives at the four law firms said: \"We have resolved this matter while upholding long-held principles important to each of our Firms: Equal Employment Opportunity; providing pro bono assistance to a wide range of underserved populations, and ensuring fairness in the Justice System; and representing a broad spectrum of clients on various matters.\"\n\nIn a firm-wide internal memo obtained by BI, the Kirkland & Ellis executive committee said the agreement \"resolves the EEOC's investigation, including its broad request for information about our people and our clients, which we no longer will be required to provide, and we will not be the target of an executive order.\"\n\n\"We made the decision to pursue this solution because at our very core our mission is to protect and support our people and our clients, and this agreement does both,\" the memo said.\n\nA&O Shearman was among the law firms with which Trump said on April 11 that his administration had reached an agreement. The firm agreed to provide $125 million in pro bono legal services to causes supported by the administration. It also agreed to engage outside counsel to oversee its hiring practices, and the EEOC investigation into the firms has stopped.\n\nA&O Shearman did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nSimpson Thacher & Bartlett also reached an agreement with the White House to provide $125 million in pro bono legal services to causes supported by the firm and Trump, as well as engage outside counsel to ensure its hiring practices comply with antidiscrimination laws.\n\nAs a result of the agreement, the EEOC investigation into the firm's hiring practices was stopped.\n\nSimpson Thacher & Bartlett did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLatham & Watkins was also among the four firms that reached an agreement with Trump, according to the April 11 announcement. The firm agreed to provide $125 million in pro bono legal services as well as engage outside counsel to oversee its hiring. As a result, the Trump administration ended the EEOC investigation into the firm.\n\nLatham & Watkins did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "'Extremely regrettable' and 'totally unwarranted': World leaders react to Trump's 'Liberation Day' tariffs\n\nWorld leaders are reacting to President Donald Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs , which saw the US imposing a 10% baseline tariff on all countries.\n\n\"April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn, the day America's destiny was reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again,\" Trump said in his tariff announcement on Wednesday.\n\nSome countries were hit harder than others. The US imposed a 46% tariff on Vietnam, a 20% tariff on the European Union, and a 32% tariff on Taiwan.\n\nTrump did not increase tariffs on Canada and Mexico, keeping them consistent at 25%. China, however, was hit with an additional 34% tariff, bringing its total to 54%.\n\nWorld leaders have called the tariffs unwarranted and regrettable and are urging Trump to reconsider or provide exemptions.\n\nMeanwhile, the US treasury secretary, Scott Bessent, said countries should refrain from imposing retaliatory tariffs. He told Bloomberg on Wednesday that without retaliatory measures, the April 2 tariffs would remain \"the high end of the number.\"\n\nSpeaking to CNN, Bessent said his advice for other countries is to \"sit back\" and \"take a deep breath.\"\n\n\"Let's see where this goes because if you retaliate, that's how we get escalation,\" Bessent said.\n\nAustralia's prime minister, Anthony Albanese, said the tariffs were not unexpected but \"totally unwarranted.\" Australia was hit with a 10% tariff.\n\n\"The administration's tariffs have no basis in logic and they go against the basis of our two nations' partnership. This is not the act of a friend,\" Albanese said in a video on X.\n\nOur Government will always stand up for Australia. These are uncertain times - but all Australians can be certain of this: we will always stand up for Australian jobs, Australian industry, Australian consumers and Australian values. These tariffs are not unexpected, but they... pic.twitter.com/bXaFTcvnN8\n\nHowever, he added that Australia would not impose reciprocal tariffs.\n\n\"We will not join a race to the bottom that leads to higher prices and slower growth,\" Albanese said.\n\nCanada's prime minister, Mark Carney, responded to the tariffs in a Wednesday post on X, saying Canada would \"fight these tariffs with countermeasures.\"\n\n\"We are going to protect our workers, and we are going to build the strongest economy in the G7. In a crisis, it's important to come together, and it's essential to act with purpose and with force, and that's what we will do,\" Carney said.\n\nMy response to President Trump's announcement today: pic.twitter.com/HHU1UJP1GN\n\nChina's commerce ministry has responded to Trump's additional 34% tariffs, which piled onto the existing 20% levy imposed in earlier months.\n\nThe ministry said China will \"resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its own rights and interests\" - but as of press time, China has not unleashed retaliatory tariffs.\n\n\"Historical evidence shows that increasing tariffs does not solve America's problems. They instead harm America's interests and threaten global economic development and supply chain stability,\" the commerce ministry's statement read.\n\n\"Trade wars have no winners, and protectionism has no way out. The Chinese side urges the US to immediately lift its unilateral tariff measures and properly resolve differences with trading partners through equal dialogue,\" it added.\n\nTrump first imposed a 10% tariff on Chinese goods in February before doubling them to 20% last month. While on the campaign trail, Trump said he would impose tariffs of more than 60% on Chinese goods if elected.\n\nOn both occasions, China was quick to respond to Trump's tariffs. In February, China imposed a 10% tariff on crude oil and agricultural equipment and a 15% tariff on coal and liquefied natural gas. Then, in March, China introduced a 10% tariff on US soybeans, pork, and beef imports, as well as a 15% tariff on chicken and cotton imports.\n\nThe European Commission's president, Ursula von der Leyen, said in a Wednesday statement on X that Trump's tariffs are a \"major blow to the world economy\" with \"dire\" consequences for millions of people.\n\nThe universal tariffs announced by the US are a major blow to businesses and consumers worldwide. Europe is prepared to respond. We'll always protect our interests and values. We're also ready to engage. And to go from confrontation to negotiation ↓ https://t.co/WbXqsN4ZX7\n\n\"At the same time, we are prepared to respond. We are already finalizing the first package of countermeasures in response to tariffs on steel, and we're now preparing for further countermeasures to protect our interests and our businesses,\" she added.\n\nItaly's prime minister, Giorgia Meloni, said in a Facebook post on Wednesday that US tariffs on the European Union were wrong and do not \"suit any party.\"\n\n\"We will do everything we can to work a deal with the United States, aiming to prevent a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global actors,\" Meloni said.\n\nBut Italy will \"act in the interests of Italy and its economy,\" she added.\n\nJapan was hit with a 24% tariff - and its trade minister, Yoji Muto, called the measure \"extremely regrettable.'\"\n\nMuto said at a press conference in Tokyo that the country will \"continue to urge the US to exempt Japan from these tariffs.\"\n\nMuto said he spoke to Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick before the tariffs were announced, where he explained how Trump's measures would \"adversely affect the US economy by undermining the ability of Japanese companies to invest.\"\n\n\"We discussed frankly how to pursue cooperation in the interest of both Japan and the United States in a way that does not rely on tariffs,\" Muto said.\n\nJapan's chief cabinet secretary, Yoshimasa Hayashi, said the government will continue to examine \"the content of these measures and their impact on Japan.\"\n\n\"We believe that the recent measures and other broad trade restrictions imposed by the US government could have a significant impact on economic relations between Japan and the US, and ultimately on the global economy and the multilateral trading system as a whole,\" Hayashi said.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Here's why the US is picking a fight with Denmark over Greenland - and what Greenland thinks about it\n\nDanish officials have repeatedly told President Donald Trump that Greenland is \"not for sale.\"\n\nTrump doesn't seem to care.\n\nThe president has continued to promote his vision for taking over Greenland , a semiautonomous territory of Denmark, arguing the island is needed to bolster US security and its stocks of strategic resources.\n\nDuring his joint address to Congress earlier this month, the president said the United States would take control of Greenland \"one way or the other.\" Trump recently declined to rule out military force to accomplish that.\n\nVice President JD Vance and his wife, Usha, arrived in Greenland on Friday, embarking on a scaled-back trip that included a stop at the US-operated Pituffik Space Base on the island's northwest coast. But even before the US delegation arrived, they were met with broad opposition to Trump's annexation plans.\n\nHere's why the United States has shown so much interest in Greenland amid the territory's own push for independence.\n\nBefore Vance's trip to Greenland, Trump said the island was needed for \"international safety and security.\"\n\n\"We need it. We have to have it,\" he told the podcaster Vince Coglianese during a recent interview. \"I hate to put it that way, but we're going to have to have it.\"\n\nThe feeling isn't mutual.\n\nA recent survey by the pollster Verian, commissioned by the Danish newspaper Berlingske and the Greenlandic daily Sermitsiaq, found that 85% of Greenlanders do not want to be a part of the US.\n\nOnly 6% of respondents said they wanted to join the United States, and 9% of respondents said they were undecided.\n\nDenmark gave Greenland and its population of about 57,000 people broad self-governing autonomy in 2009, which included the right to declare its independence from Denmark through a referendum.\n\nBefore Vance's arrival, Greenland's outgoing prime minister, Mute Egede, told Sermitsiaq that the visit was \"very aggressive,\" especially considering the presence of the national security advisor Michael Waltz.\n\n\"What is the national security advisor doing in Greenland? The only purpose is to demonstrate power over us,\" Egede, who's advocated for Greenland's independence, told the newspaper. \"His mere presence in Greenland will no doubt fuel American belief in Trump's mission - and the pressure will increase.\"\n\nJens-Frederik Nielsen was sworn in as Greenland's new prime minister on Friday, the same day Vance arrived on the island.\n\nIn a Facebook post on Sunday, Nielsen wrote that Greenland \"cannot be owned.\"\n\n\"President Trump says the United States will 'beat Greenland.' Let me be clear: The US cannot do that. We cannot be owned. We will shape our own future,\" he wrote.\n\nAfter arriving in Greenland, Vance criticized Denmark, accusing it of leaving the island vulnerable to China and Russia.\n\nVance argued that Greenland would benefit from being under the \"security umbrella\" of the US - as opposed to Denmark.\n\n\"Our message to Denmark is very simple - you have not done a good job by the people of Greenland,\" he said. \"You have underinvested in the people of Greenland, and you have underinvested in the security architecture of this incredible, beautiful land mass.\"\n\nIn recent weeks, protesters have assembled in Nuuk, Greenland's capital and most populous city, to rail against Trump's rhetoric.\n\nWith independence potentially within sight, many of its citizens are anxious about Trump's threats to annex the island.\n\nTrump, however, sees an opportunity and isn't letting go.\n\nThe US sees a future where global powers jockey for Greenland's untapped mineral resources - particularly oil and gas - given that much of the island is within the Arctic Circle. And with melting ice transforming parts of the island, strategic shipping channels could open up.\n\nThat makes Greenland a major target for Trump's America-first agenda.\n\nMarch 31, 2025: This story has been updated to include a statement from Jens-Frederik Nielsen, Greenland's new prime minister.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "For the first time, a majority of Americans don't like Trump's economic policies\n\nAmericans are souring on President Donald Trump's handling of the economy.\n\nIn a CNN/SSRS poll released on Wednesday, 56% of respondents disapproved of the president's handling of the economy for the first time since CNN began polling the topic in his first term.\n\nPrior to this poll, his worst showing in the survey was in December 2017, when 49% of respondents disapproved of his handling of the economy while 44% approved of it.\n\nIn a separate question, respondents overwhelmingly expressed displeasure with Trump's tariffs. More than 60% of respondents disapproved of the tariffs, the highest of any category pollsters asked about. Trump's highest marks were in his handling of immigration, with 51% of respondents approving his actions.\n\nIn response to the polling, the White House said that business leaders have responded to Trump's policies by making major investments in the US.\n\n\"Since President Trump was elected, industry leaders have responded to President Trump's America First economic agenda of tariffs, deregulation, and the unleashing of American energy with trillions in investment commitments that will create thousands of new jobs,\" Kush Desai, a White House spokesperson, said in a statement to Business Insider. \"President Trump delivered historic job, wage, and investment growth in his first term, and is set to do so again in his second term.\"\n\nTrump has doubled down on his shifting tariff policy, arguing that the nation should ignore the stock market slump in favor of potential long-term economic gains. On Wednesday, the White House followed through with Trump's promise to impose a 25% tariff on imported steel and aluminum.\n\nBusiness leaders have complained that Trump's vacillation - various tariffs have been announced and then reversed, sometimes within the same day - has caused economic uncertainty.\n\n\"You'll have a lot, but we may go up with some tariffs, it depends, we may go up,\" Trump told Fox News host Maria Bartiromo in an interview on Sunday when she asked if businesses had enough clarity on tariff plans.\n\n\"They have plenty of clarity, they just use that, it's almost like a sound bite, 'We want clarity,'\" he said\n\nThe White House has also refused to rule out the possibility of a recession. Trump and his top economic advisors have also warned that tariffs may lead to \"an adjustment period\" with possible price increases.\n\nOther polls have found Trump's approval rating on the economy slipping.\n\nA recent Emerson College poll found that 48% of registered voters disapproved of Trump's handling of the economy. A February Gallup poll of US adults found that 54% disapproved of his handling of the economy.\n\nPresident Joe Biden had far worse numbers by comparison. Biden's economic approval never exceeded 40% from the start of 2022 until he left office. In CNN's final poll before he left office, 67% of respondents disapproved of Biden's handling of the economy.\n\nThe good news for Trump is that he's run his last campaign. If the current trend continues, congressional Republicans may be stuck with the bill. The president's party typically loses seats in the midterm elections, and Democrats would need to net only a handful of seats to flip the House.\n\nTrump's overall approval is slipping, too. He began his second term with relatively meager numbers, and in recent days those have started to dip as well. Nate Silver's Silver Bulletin found that Trump has a net negative approval on average.\n\nJump to"

The measures include talking up the potential to cut deals with key trading partners, pointing to tax cuts as a way to balance out the economic hit and deploying officials to speak to jittery business groups.\n\nFollow live politics coverage here\n\n\"The feeling among Hill Republicans is we've got to get rolling on the tax cuts right now,\" a senior Senate Republican aide said. \"We have to offer some candy to the business community in terms of offering them certainty and helping with pro-growth policies.\"\n\nTwo administration officials confirmed that members of the administration were taking calls from business groups and setting up private meetings to allay worries.\n\n\"The Trump administration maintains regular contact with business leaders, industry groups, and everyday Americans, especially about major policy decisions like President Trump's reciprocal tariff action,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement. \"The only special interest guiding President Trump's decision-making, however, is the best interest of the American people - such as addressing the national emergency posed by our country running chronic trade deficits.\"\n\nThe tariffs - which could quickly become the defining policy of his second term - put two core Trump identities in conflict: the protectionist who spent decades calling for steeper tariffs to combat what he sees as the country's being ripped off by its trading partners, and the deal-maker, the persona he spent years building in New York real estate and as the protagonist of \"The Apprentice.\"\n\n\"Nobody but me would do this,\" Trump told reporters Monday in the Oval Office. \"You know, it would be nice to serve a nice, easy term, but we have an opportunity to change the fabric of our country. We have an opportunity to reset the table on trade.\"\n\nMarkets have not been fans of resetting the table. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 had smaller dips Monday as administration officials talked up dealmaking and a misleading headline briefly led investors to believe Trump was pausing the measures. Since Wednesday, when Trump announced his tariffs - which were calculated using a widely derided formula based on U.S. trade deficits with other countries - the Dow and the S&P 500 have both declined by more than 10%.\n\nTrump's billionaire backers and business executives are sounding the alarm. On Monday, JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Trump's tariffs will weigh down the economy and raise prices. Bill Ackman, the outspoken Trump supporter and billionaire hedge fund executive, railed against the policies in a series of social media posts over the weekend, calling on Trump's advisers to revise their tariff formula \"before the President makes a big mistake,\" suggesting all capital gains will be wiped out in 2025. Dave Portnoy, the founder of Barstool Sports and a vocal Trump supporter , readied for a turbulent day for markets Monday that he proclaimed \"#orangemonday,\" a not-so-thinly veiled shot at the president.\n\nWhite House chief of staff Susie Wiles made at least one phone call over the weekend to an associate asking about the level of concern in the private sector about the market downturn, according to a person close to the White House.\n\nAnother member of the business community who seems displeased by Trump's tariff agenda is Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of Tesla and SpaceX who has been Trump's right-hand man in rapidly slashing government programs and workers. Musk promoted free trade and went after Peter Navarro, Trump's top trade adviser, saying Navarro \"ain't built s--t.\" He also also laughed at at Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's explanation for the administration's placing tariffs on an uninhabited island .\n\nA senior White House official, who insisted Trump's team is not worried about cracks forming in the coalition, said, \"Elon is entitled to his own opinion.\"\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Trump started his Monday calling for supporters to weather the storm.\n\n\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" he wrote on his Truth Social platform. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"\n\nA White House official stressed Monday that the president and the White House have no set period for how long they would endure the market strain, emphasizing that offering such a timeline would open Trump up to additional criticism should they continue past it.\n\nBut administration officials, including Trump, spent the last few days touting how many countries are calling them up to cut deals to avert or lower the new tariffs, with multiple officials touting outreach from 50 countries.\n\n\"They're offering things to us that we wouldn't have even considered asking for,\" Trump said Monday in the Oval Office.\n\nThe White House official named Vietnam, Cambodia, Israel and Poland as countries seeking to quickly come to agreements.\n\nBoth Trump and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Monday praised a call with Japanese officials to negotiate an agreement while criticizing China for quickly retaliating against Trump's new measures. Trump has threatened further escalation with China if it does not withdraw its retaliatory tariffs by Tuesday, saying he will impose an additional 50% tariff on top of what he has already proposed.\n\nThere is a universe where the Trump administration ramps up a trade war with China while cutting deals with other countries. Steve Bannon, a Trump ally and former top White House official, said Monday the trade war would soon focus much more on China.\n\nChina \"dared to cross Trump with retaliation after they had been warned,\" Bannon said. \"The Trade War they have been pursuing for years against America is now going to get hot. Isolated  from the world, this is a war China can't win.\"\n\nThe White House and the president himself continue to offer mixed messaging about their game plan. Asked Monday whether the tariffs are permanent or open to negotiation, Trump insisted that \" they can both be true .\"\n\nOther administration officials have been more insistent that the tariffs are coming regardless of any negotiations. Lutnick said Sunday on CBS' \"Face the Nation\" that \" there is no postponing \" the new tariffs, claiming it will soon be a reality that \"the army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing, is going to come to America.\"\n\n\"They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks,\" Lutnick said of the measures.\n\nAsked about Vietnam in an interview Sunday on Fox News, Navarro said, \"This is not a negotiation.\" On Monday, he told CNBC that Vietnam's offering to reduce its tariffs to zero \"means nothing to us, because it's the non-tariff cheating that matters.\"\n\nSen. John Kennedy, R-La., said more clarity about the tariffs from Trump \"would help a lot.\"\n\n\"Some of the president's aides are saying we need to do this to raise money; other aides are saying we need to do this to make other countries pay us back for ripping off America through unfair trade,\" Kennedy said. \"Others have said it's good news because many countries want to lower their tariffs, in some cases to zero, which I happen to think is good news. They're just all over the map.\"\n\n\"I think it would be better if they would talk to their boss and find out what the message is,\" he added. \"It'd actually be better if some of them would shut up, but that's not likely to happen.\"\n\nA senior Senate GOP aide who supports Trump's effort to reorient global trade reiterated that congressional Republicans \"don't really know what's going on.\"\n\n\"This is what he's wanted to do his whole life,\" this person said. \"And he does not care. He truly believes this and wants to correct it. The markets don't scare him. He's just going to push through.\"\n\nThe White House sought Monday to promote support of his policy, highlighting comments from groups like the United Auto Workers and the National Council of Textile Organizations.\n\n\"I think there's some who believe in what he is doing and the need for short-term pain to address long-standing trade imbalances and some who think this is pure chaos with no real thought behind it,\" said a Republican strategist who has worked with the White House previously. \"Corporate world is frustrated with the lack of clarity. Political world is frustrated that he and the White House have not made their case in a consistent enough way.\"\n\nOn Tuesday and Wednesday, U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will testify before the Senate and House about Trump's trade policy. In his opening remarks Tuesday, he plans to tell senators that Argentina, Vietnam, Israel and other countries have already indicated they will reduce their tariffs and non-tariff barriers to come to agreements.\n\nAlthough seven Senate Republicans have already signed on to a bill that would curtail Trump's tariff powers - a bill he pledged Monday to veto if it is passed - two Republicans who spoke with NBC News said House Republicans are more nervous about the tariffs than their Senate counterparts. Those rank-and-file Republicans are starting to panic about the markets and want more guidance from the White House about Trump's long-term strategy.\n\nDuring a House GOP conference call Sunday, Rep. Darrell Issa, R-Calif, asked whether they could get a detailed briefing from the White House on tariffs, according to two people on the call. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told members that he would talk to Trump and vowed to arrange for someone in the administration to brief the conference, the sources said. They added that Johnson counseled members during Sunday's conference call to just trust the tariff process and stand by Trump's trade policy, arguing he helped deliver a strong economy during his first term.\n\nBut there are some signs of anxiety even among GOP leaders. Johnson has argued, both in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter over the weekend and on the conference call, that they need to quickly coalesce around a budget resolution - which Republicans need to unlock Trump's tax and spending cut package - because of the market turmoil.\n\n\"There is a fork in the road as to what's going to happen,\" Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, said on his podcast Monday. \"If President Trump uses this moment as leverage, he's got an extraordinary opportunity to lower tariffs of every country on Earth to U.S. goods and lower our own tariffs in response. ... On the other hand, there are voices in the White House that want high tariffs forever. There are angels and demons sitting on President Trump's shoulders. Who does he listen to? I hope he listens to the angels.\"\n\nStephen Moore, a former economic adviser to Trump, said Trump must more effectively target his tariffs. Ultimately, the end game should be to negotiate new trade agreements.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the only solution here that I can see is for the other countries to start making those phone calls to the Oval Office and making some deals with Trump,\" he said.\n\nTrump spent the past weekend golfing at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida, providing plenty of material to critics who said he was not taking the market downturn seriously.\n\nA person who was at the LIV Golf Tournament said the tariffs and the market downturn were not front and center.\n\n\"It is not something that was much of a topic of conversation,\" the person said. \"I think there was sort of a storm cloud over it to some degree. I mean, people in the room were aware, no doubt, but it was just not the forum to bring it up, and it's not like the sort of people who were going to bring up bad news or try and check Trump.\"\n\nDemocratic activists organized large , nationwide protests Saturday opposing his administration , at which some protesters held signs decrying the impact of his policies on their 401(k) investments .\n\nA White House official told NBC News that Trump was not concerned about the optics of golfing amid the economic turmoil.\n\nThis person said Trump's golfing during the market strain was like \"going to a birthday party after a friend has had surgery,\" adding that he can enjoy his time in Florida while continuing to work when needed on weekends.\n\nThe official then expressed what administration officials are confident of - for now.\n\n\"The economy will be fine,\" this person said.\n\nAllan Smith is a political reporter for NBC News.\n\nPeter Nicholas is a senior White House reporter for NBC News.\n\nMatt Dixon is a senior national politics reporter for NBC News, based in Florida.\n\nMelanie Zanona is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News.\n\nYamiche Alcindor is an NBC News Washington correspondent.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

      "text": "Trump says he 'couldn't care less' if foreign automakers raise prices due to tariffs\n\nProfile\n\nSections\n\nLocal\n\ntv\n\nFeatured\n\nMore From NBC\n\nFollow NBC News\n\nnews Alerts\n\nThere are no new alerts at this time\n\nPresident Donald Trump told NBC News in an interview Saturday that he would not fire anyone involved in the Signal group chat in which military attack plans were inadvertently divulged to a journalist and added later that he \"couldn't care less\" if automakers raised prices because of new tariffs.\n\nIn a phone interview that lasted more than 10 minutes, Trump also discussed his commitment to annexing Greenland and reiterated that a military option was not off the table.\n\nFollowing a week of headlines about Signal, tariffs and Greenland, the president waved off concerns that his agenda is causing volatility on Wall Street or decreasing consumer confidence, pointing to polling that shows that the share of Americans who believe the country is on the right track is at record highs .\n\n\"What I see is right track, wrong track. And the right track was the first time in like 40 years where it was right track,\" the president said, at one point putting Alexander Stubb, the president of Finland, on the phone as well. The two men were golfing in Florida on Saturday.\n\nMore from Trump's interview with NBC News:\n\nThe president said he \"couldn't care less\" if automakers raised prices after he announced he would impose 25% tariffs on all foreign-made automobiles.\n\nAsked what his recent message was to motor industry CEOs, and whether he had warned them against raising prices, Trump said, \"The message is congratulations, if you make your car in the United States, you're going to make a lot of money. If you don't, you're going to have to probably come to the United States, because if you make your car in the United States, there is no tariff.\"\n\nWhen pressed if he told CEOs not to raise prices, as reported in the The Wall Street Journal , Trump added, \"No, I never said that. I couldn't care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars.\"\n\nTrump continued, \"I couldn't care less. I hope they raise their prices, because if they do, people are gonna buy American-made cars. We have plenty.\"\n\nAsked if he was concerned about car prices going up, Trump said, \"No, I couldn't care less, because if the prices on foreign cars go up, they're going to buy American cars.\"\n\nAfter the interview, an aide followed up with NBC News to say Trump was referring specifically to foreign car prices.\n\nNBC News reported this week that foreign auto parts would also be taxed at 25% even if the vehicles they go into are assembled domestically. Companies that import vehicles under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA) will get special consideration until the government establishes a process for levying the 25% duties, according to the White House.\n\nUntil that time, USMCA-compliant auto parts will remain tariff-free.\n\nThe president also said the tariffs would be permanent.\n\n\"Absolutely, they're permanent, sure. The world has been ripping off the United States for the last 40 years and more. And all we're doing is being fair, and frankly, I'm being very generous,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump's tariff announcement on Wednesday came just weeks before his planned April 2 \"Liberation Day,\" when tariffs on a variety of consumer goods are set to take effect. They drew swift condemnation from international leaders like Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba and Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney.\n\nIn remarks on Thursday, Carney told reporters the tariffs were \"unjustified\" and that \"the old relationship we had with the United States based on deepening integration of our economies and tight security and military cooperation is over.\"\n\nTrump on Saturday maintained that he does not plan to further delay the imposition of the April 2 tariffs, and he would consider negotiating on that point \"only if people are willing to give us something of great value. Because countries have things of great value, otherwise, there's no room for negotiation.\"\n\nTrump said he has no plans to fire anyone following news that national security adviser Michael Waltz added a journalist to a Signal app group chat with senior members of the Trump administration who were discussing plans to strike Houthi militants in Yemen earlier this month.\n\n\"I don't fire people because of fake news and because of witch hunts,\" Trump said, calling the story \"fake news\" throughout the interview.\n\n\"I do,\" the president said when asked whether he still has confidence in Waltz and Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, who was also in the Signal chat and sent a detailed timeline of the planned strikes before they happened.\n\n\"I think it's just a witch hunt and the fake news, like you, talk about it all the time, but it's just a witch hunt, and it shouldn't be talked [about],\" Trump added. \"We had a tremendously successful strike. We struck very hard and very lethal. And nobody wants to talk about that. All they want to talk about is nonsense. It's fake news.\"\n\nTrump's comments come as he has faced calls - including from his allies - to fire Waltz after The Atlantic's editor-in-chief Jeffrey Goldberg wrote on Monday that he had been added to a chat group on a private messaging app with senior administration officials.\n\nIn the chat, the officials appeared to discuss their plans to strike Houthi rebels, which the Trump administration has since repeatedly claimed were not classified .\n\n\"I have no idea what Signal is. I don't care what Signal is,\" Trump said on Saturday. \"All I can tell you is it's just a witch hunt, and it's the only thing the press wants to talk about, because you have nothing else to talk about. Because it's been the greatest 100-day presidency in the history of our country.\"\n\nThe president on Saturday also said he has \"absolutely\" had real conversations about annexing Greenland, which is currently a semiautonomous Danish territory.\n\n\"We'll get Greenland. Yeah, 100%,\" Trump said.\n\nHe added that there's a \"good possibility that we could do it without military force\" but that \"I don't take anything off the table.\"\n\nThis comes one day after Vice President JD Vance visited Greenland with his wife, Usha, and spoke to service members at Pituffik Space Base, a U.S. Space Force base on the northwestern coast of Greenland.\n\nWhile there, Vance said, \"Our message to Denmark is very simple - you have not done a good job by the people of Greenland.\"\n\nGreenland Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen pushed back against Trump's plan to annex the nation, writing Sunday on Facebook: \"President Trump says the United States is 'getting Greenland.' Let me make this clear: The U.S. is not getting that. We don't belong to anyone else. We decide our own future.\"\n\n\"We must not act out of fear. We must respond with peace, dignity and unity. And it is through these values that we must clearly, clearly and calmly show the American president that Greenland is ours. It was like that yesterday. That's how it is today. And that's how it will be in the future,\" he added.\n\nAsked what message acquiring Greenland would send to Russia and the rest of the world, Trump said, \"I don't really think about that. I don't really care. Greenland's a very separate subject, very different. It's international peace. It's international security and strength.\"\n\n\"You have ships sailing outside Greenland from Russia, from China and from many other places. And we're not going to allow things to happen that are going to be - that are going to hurt the world or the United States,\" he added.\n\nCLARIFICATION : This article was updated to reflect that after the interview, an aide followed up with NBC News to say Trump was referring to foreign car prices.\n\nKristen Welker is the moderator of \"Meet the Press.\"\n\nAlexandra Marquez is a politics reporter for NBC News.\n\n© 2025 NBCUniversal Media, LLC"

In response, the Chinese Commerce Ministry said China \"firmly opposes\" Trump's tariff threats, calling its previous countermeasures \"entirely justified.\"\n\n\"If the U.S. insists in its own way, China will fight to the end,\" the ministry said in a statement Tuesday, adding that Trump's threat to escalate tariffs on China is a \"mistake upon a mistake.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nRob Wile\n\nTrump has proposed sweeping tariffs targeting U.S. trading partners, including a 10% across-the-board baseline tariff that went into effect Saturday.\n\nIn response, investors have initiated a massive stock sell-off amid fears that the scale of what Trump has proposed threatens to remake the world economic order - and weaken overall global output, including growth in the United States.\n\nBut Trump and other White House officials have shown no sign they will back off from the proposal, which includes duties of more than 40% on some nations - and with 104% threatened on China.\n\nFollowing are recent comments from senior administration officials making the case for the duties.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nAllan Smith\n\nPeter Nicholas\n\nMatt Dixon\n\nMelanie Zanona Melanie Zanona is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News.\n\nYamiche Alcindor\n\nTrump sees an opportunity to \"change the fabric\" of the United States with his sprawling plan to institute new global tariffs - a policy that has had markets shaking for days while cracks form in his political coalition.\n\nBut even as Trump, administration officials and key allies say he will not back down from his tariff plan, they are looking for ways to ease the concerns of wary supporters. The measures include talking up the potential to cut deals with key trading partners, pointing to tax cuts as a way to balance out the economic hit and deploying officials to speak to jittery business groups.\n\n\"The feeling among Hill Republicans is we've got to get rolling on the tax cuts right now,\" a senior Senate Republican aide said. \"We have to offer some candy to the business community in terms of offering them certainty and helping with pro-growth policies.\"\n\nTwo administration officials confirmed that members of the administration were taking calls from business groups and setting up private meetings to allay worries.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nThe American Library Association sued the Trump administration over the gutting of the Institute of Museum and Library Services and requested that it be reinstated.\n\n\"Libraries play an important role in our democracy, from preserving history to providing access to government information, advancing literacy and civic engagement, and offering access to a variety of perspectives,\" American Library Association President Cindy Hohl said in a statement.\n\n\"These values are worth defending. We will not allow extremists to threaten our democracy by eliminating programs at IMLS and harming the children and communities who rely on libraries and the services and opportunities they provide,\" she added.\n\nThe Institute of Museum and Library Sciences is a small agency that provides funding grants to libraries and museums across the country. It underwent funding cuts and mass layoffs as a result of Trump's executive order last month titled \"Continuing the reduction of the federal bureaucracy.\"\n\nThe lawsuit argues that the library institute was created by Congress and enjoyed bipartisan support throughout its history, adding that it is bound by law to report on important issues to Congress and conduct activities to support libraries.\n\nThe plaintiffs say that only Congress can dismantle the agency and that, therefore, the Trump administration broke the law by unilaterally taking that step.\n\nScott Wong\n\nBen Kamisar\n\nRepublican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott today said he had selected Nov. 4 as the date for the special election to fill the House seat that had been occupied by Democrat Sylvester Turner , who died unexpectedly last month.\n\nThe decision means the deep-blue, Houston-based congressional seat will be vacant for roughly eight months.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., and other Democrats had accused Abbott of deliberately delaying calling the special election to help pad the GOP's tiny majority in the House. Republicans hold just a 220-213 advantage over Democrats in the House, meaning Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., can afford only three GOP defections on any vote.\n\nBut in a statement today, Abbott pointed the finger at Harris County, saying officials there do a poor job conducting elections.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nLawrence Hurley\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nThe Supreme Court tonight threw out the order of a federal judge who had blocked the removal of men alleged to be members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua to El Salvador without any legal process under the Alien Enemies Act.\n\nThe 5-4 ruling essentially clears the path for the Trump administration to resume deportations under the rarely used wartime law, so long as detainees are given due process. That means they must be given time to challenge their detentions and make the administration prove the legality of their confinements.\n\n\"AEA detainees must receive notice after the date of this order that they are subject to removal under the Act. The notice must be afforded within a reasonable time and in such a manner as will allow them to actually seek habeas relief in the proper venue before such removal occurs,\" the court wrote in its majority opinion.\n\nThe decision lifts orders issued by Washington-based U.S. District Judge James Boasberg, who blocked the move on March 15, while litigation continues. The original lawsuit was filed by five Venezuelans, with Boasberg provisionally certifying it as a class action that applies to all Venezuelans in U.S. custody who are not U.S. citizens.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nZoë Richards\n\nThe Environmental Protection Agency announced today that it will \"review new scientific information\" about what it called possible health risks tied to adding fluoride to drinking water .\n\nThe review will be conducted in coordination with the Department of Health and Human Services and its secretary, Robert F.  Kennedy Jr., the EPA said.\n\n\"Secretary Kennedy has long been at the forefront of this issue. His advocacy was instrumental in our decision to review fluoride exposure risks and we are committed to working alongside him, utilizing sound science as we advance our mission of protecting human health and the environment,\" EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said in a statement .\n\nKennedy told T he Associated Press after a news conference in Salt Lake City this afternoon that he plans to tell the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention soon to stop recommending fluoride in drinking water across the country and that he is building a task force on the matter.\n\nKennedy said on the campaign trail last year that the Trump administration would recommend that fluoride be removed from public water, which he linked to a variety of illnesses, in spite of widespread backing from medical associations for its use to strengthen teeth and reduce cavities.\n\nZoë Richards\n\nTrump said on Truth Social this evening that he will get his annual physical exam Friday.\n\n\"I have never felt better, but nevertheless, these things must be done!\" he wrote.\n\nThe exam is scheduled to take place at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nTrump, 78, has been opaque in the past about his health, and he provided limited details about his physical fitness ahead of last year's election. Democrats drew attention to the issue and his public vow to release his medical records before the election, which didn't happen. He told NBC News in December that he had \"no problem\" with releasing his full medical reports.\n\nElyse Perlmutter-Gumbiner\n\nDareh Gregorian\n\nThe Trump administration is in the \"early stages\" of planning a large-scale parade in Washington, D.C., Mayor Muriel Bowser told reporters today.\n\nBowser, a Democrat, was asked about a report in the Washington City Paper that said plans are underway for a military parade honoring the 250th anniversary of the Army on June 14 - which is both Flag Day and Trump's 79th birthday.\n\nThe report cited a single anonymous source for the information, which NBC News has not confirmed. The Army did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBowser said the Trump administration had \"reached out\" about an event.\n\n\"I don't know if it's been characterized as a military parade, but maybe it has. I haven't been directly involved in it yet,\" she said. \"I think it was Homeland Security. Maybe the White House reached out to our Special Events Task Force, which is what most people wanting to do a parade do in the District. So I would say it's at early stages.\"\n\nTrump had planned to hold a military parade during his first term in office, but the plan was eventually scuttled after he complained about the \"ridiculously high\" price the city said such a parade could cost.\n\nFrank Thorp V producer and off-air reporter\n\nKatie Taylor\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nSen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, ramped up his criticism of Trump's tariffs today, saying they could end up being bad for both his home state and the country as a whole.\n\n\"The last I checked, we still have the income tax, and we have these tariffs. That's just a ton more taxes. If you want to get rid of the income tax, then we can talk, but I don't see anyone proposing getting rid of the income tax,\" Cruz said on his podcast, \"Verdict.\"\n\n\"If the outcome from these tariffs is really high tariffs from every country on Earth against American goods and really high tariffs from America against goods from every other country on Earth, that is going to be really bad for Texas and really bad for America,\" he added.\n\nCruz has previously criticized the tariffs, and he became one of the first Trump-allied Republican voices to do so. He argued last week that they would hurt American consumers.\n\n\"So what I'm urging is for the president to come and make major deals and make them quickly. Look, to calm the stock market down, a few major deals quickly would really, really help,\" Cruz said on his podcast today.\n\nGarrett Haake\n\nTara Prindiville\n\nReporting from Boyers, Pennsylvania\n\nAs you ride in a golf cart into the mouth of the Iron Mountain limestone mine, the temperature change is immediately noticeable. The natural climate control provided by the rough-hewn stone walls of the decommissioned mine - a day's drive from the nation's capital and about an hour outside Pittsburgh - helped make it an ideal site for the federal government to process and store retirement records beginning in 1960.\n\nSixty-five years later, when so much is now done online, this mine is largely still how the Office of Personnel Management manages the documents of the 100,000 or so retirements from federal service each year.\n\nProcessing a retirement can take months, with a single missing signature sometimes setting the task back days or weeks.\n\n\"It is still done on paper,\" said Alita Haniwalt, an OPM program manager in retirement claims. \"I think it becomes overwhelming because there are no two retirements that are the same.\"\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nBen Kamisar\n\nRepublican Rep. John James of Michigan announced today that he is running for governor as one of the most pivotal elections on the ballot in 2026 continues to draw big-name politicians.\n\nIn a message on his social media channels, James lamented Democratic governance in the state and argued that \"it's time to get Michigan's government out of fantasyland and back to common sense.\"\n\n\"Oue state has suffered long enough. Michigan is strong. Our people are strong. But we are being held back by a lack of strong, competent leadership,\" he wrote.\n\nAhead of a potentially crowded primary, James signaled he would run as an ally of Trump, who narrowly won the state in 2016 and 2024 and lost there in 2020.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nAdam Edelman\n\nThe North Carolina Supreme Court today temporarily blocked a lower court's ruling that would have required that more than 65,000 votes cast in the disputed 2024 state Supreme Court race be recounted and verified.\n\nThe two-sentence order prevents a ruling from Friday from going into effect so the court can review an appeal from the Democratic candidate.\n\nThe ruling is the latest development in a long and winding saga after a close finish in the Supreme Court race in November.\n\nDemocratic Justice Allison Riggs, who was appointed in 2023, emerged after Election Day narrowly ahead of Republican candidate Jefferson Griffin, a state appeals court judge, triggering a series of recounts.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nDavid Ingram\n\nElon Musk's brother, Kimbal Musk, sharply criticized Trump today over Trump's tariff policies.\n\n\"Who would have thought that Trump was actually the most high tax American President in generations,\" Kimbal Musk wrote on X , the social media app owned by his more famous brother.\n\n\"Through his tariff strategy, Trump has implemented a structural, permanent tax on the American consumer,\" he wrote.\n\nElon Musk has been subtle r in his critiques. He posted a video earlier today of economist Milton Friedman advocating for free trade.\n\nKimbal Musk is a board member of Tesla, where Elon Musk is the CEO, and the two brothers have had a close relationship. They cofounded a tech startup in the 1990s called Zip2, which kick-started their business careers.\n\nKimbal Musk described himself last year as a registered Democrat , in contrast with his brother's shift toward Trump-style MAGA politics.\n\nRob Wile\n\nBrian Cheung\n\nSteve Kopack\n\nWall Street ended largely lower today after a wild trading day as Trump pressed forward with aggressive tariffs that have rocked the global economy , leaving investors unsure about what's to come.\n\nThe S&P closed down 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial average fell 0.9%, or 350 points. The tech-heavy Nasdaq ended the day up 0.1%, led by a rally in chipmaker Nvidia, which finished 3.5% higher.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nTrump declined to rule out military action in Iran if its talks with the United States aren't successful.\n\n\"I think if the talks aren't successful with Iran, I think Iran is going to be in great danger, and I hate to say it - great danger,\" Trump told reporters in the Oval Office, adding that Tehran \"cannot have a nuclear weapon.\"\n\n\"If the talks aren't successful, I think it'll be a very bad day for Iran,\" he added.\n\nDareh Gregorian\n\nTrump again promoted the idea of taking control of the Gaza Strip , saying it could become \"a freedom zone.\"\n\n\"That's a hell of a place. You know what I call it? A great location that no one wants to live in,\" Trump said.\n\n\"I think it's an incredible piece of important real estate. And I think it's something that we would be involved in, but, you know, having a peace force like the United States there, controlling and owning the Gaza Strip, would be a good thing,\" he said.\n\nRaquel Coronell Uribe\n\nTrump said the United States will have direct nuclear talks with Iran beginning Saturday. Iran had brushed off offers for direct talks with the United States in recent days.\n\nAsked at what level the talks were happening, Trump said they were \"very high-level\" talks and that the United States would not use surrogates but that it would rather deal with Iran directly, adding that it would be in \"Iran's best interests\" if the talks are successful.\n\n\"We're having direct talks with Iran, and they've started. It'll go on Saturday. We have a very big meeting, and we'll see what can happen. And I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious. And the obvious is not something that I want to be involved with or, frankly, that Israel wants to be involved with if they can avoid it,\" Trump said.\n\nDareh Gregorian\n\nAsked about mixed messaging from the administration about whether the tariffs are permanent or a negotiating tactic, Trump told reporters, \"Both can be true.\"\n\n\"There can be permanent tariffs and there can also be negotiations,\" he said. \"There are things we need beyond tariffs.\"\n\nAsked whether he was concerned that the tariffs could push other countries into making deals with China, Trump said, \"I'm not worried.\"\n\nKyle Stewart\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., said on his way to his Capitol office today that Congress would give Trump \"the space necessary\" to handle tariffs.\n\nAsked about legislation aimed at giving Congress more authority over tariffs, he said, \"Congress will weigh in on it with the president, with the administration in tandem.\"\n\n\"I think we need to give the president the latitude, the runway to do what it is he was elected to do,\" Johnson said. \"That is, get this economy going again and get our trade properly balanced with other countries.\"\n\nHe added that \"most of the American people understand the necessity of that.\"\n\nAsked whether the White House should brief members of Congress on tariffs, Johnson said the Trump administration is \"engaged with members and we'll have answers.\"\n\nRob Wile\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent said today that he would begin trade negotiations with Japan.\n\nBessent said Monday afternoon on X that he and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer would \"open negotiations\" with Japanese Prime Minister Shigero Ishiba and his Cabinet \"to implement the President's vision for the new Golden Age of Global Trade.\"\n\nBessent linked to a post in which Trump said earlier in the day that he was hearing from \"countries from all over the world\" and that he had specifically spoken with Japan's prime minister , who was sending \"a top team\" to negotiate.\n\nIshiba said earlier today that he told Trump on the call that he was \"deeply concerned\" the U.S. tariffs \"will reduce the investment capacity of Japanese companies.\"\n\nRob Wile\n\nKatherine Doyle\n\nWith Trump's latest threat of 50% duties on imports from China, the total new tariffs he imposed on goods imported into the United States from China would be as much as 104%.\n\nIt's the sum of the 50% plus two rounds of 10% tariffs Trump has already imposed in response to China's alleged inaction on curbing the flow of fentanyl, plus the 10% all-nations baseline tariff that kicked in Saturday and the 24% tit-for-tat tariff that would kick in Wednesday.\n\nThe 104% tariff does not include pre-existing tariffs on certain items that Trump imposed during his first term and the Biden administration largely kept or the 25% tariff Trump seeks to impose on nations doing business with Venezuela.\n\nSahil Kapur\n\nThe White House is threatening to veto a bipartisan Senate bill that would limit Trump's power to impose tariffs, saying it would \"severely constrain the President's ability to use authorities long recognized by Congress and upheld by the courts to respond to national emergencies and foreign threats.\"\n\nThe bill would require the president to notify Cabout of new tariffs within 48 hours of imposition while providing his reasons and an analysis of the impacts on U.S. consumers and businesses. Then Congress would have 60 days to approve it. If that didn't happen, the tariffs would expire.\n\nThe legislation, called the Trade Review Act of 2025, was introduced by Sens. Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. It has picked up six more GOP co-sponsors: Jerry Moran, of Kansas; Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska; Mitch McConnell, of Kentucky; Thom Tillis, of North Carolina; Todd Young, of Indiana; and Susan Collins, of Maine.\n\n\"Tariffs are a critical component of that policy and this legislation runs contrary to those aims,\" the White House Office of Management and Budget said in a statement today. \"S. 1272 eliminates leverage over foreign trading partners, inhibits reshoring and supply chain resilience, fosters market uncertainty, and introduces procedural micromanagement that reduces the energy and dispatch required by the President to effectively guarantee the nation's security. If passed, this bill would dangerously hamper the President's authority and duty to determine our foreign policy and protect our national security.\"\n\nThe veto threat means it would require two-thirds of the GOP-controlled House and Senate to enact the bill into law.\n\nKatherine Doyle\n\nThe White House has canceled a planned news conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this afternoon, with Trump instead planning to take questions from reporters in the Oval Office.\n\nThe news conference in the East Room was scheduled to occur following a bilateral meeting between the two leaders. Now, a smaller group of reporters, known as the \"pool\" and assigned to cover the president's movements each day, will have an opportunity to ask questions.\n\nIt is typical for Trump to hold both an informal Q&A in the Oval Office and a formal news conference when world leaders visit.\n\nTrump, greeting Netanyahu at the White House moments ago, ignored multiple questions from the pool about his sweeping new tariffs, the market turmoil that has followed his announcement and the war in Gaza. He told reporters yesterday that he expects to discuss trade and the situation in the Middle East with the Israeli leader.\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nNetanyahu has arrived at the White House, where he was greeted outside by Trump. Trump ignored shouted questions from a reporter as the two men went inside.\n\nFacing mounting pressure over the economy, Trump is not backing down, calling his global tariffs a \"beautiful thing to behold\" and arguing he's fulfilling a campaign promise to bring back American jobs. It comes as he draws new backlash for spending days on the golf course as stock markets take a nosedive and 401(k)s plummet. NBC's Gabe Gutierrez reports for TODAY.\n\nMelanie Zanona Melanie Zanona is a Capitol Hill correspondent for NBC News.\n\nSome congressional Republicans are growing anxious about the markets and want more guidance from the White House about Trump's long-term trade strategy.\n\nDuring a House GOP conference call yesterday, Rep. Darrell Issa, of California, asked if lawmakers could receive a detailed briefing from the White House about Trump's tariffs, according to two sources on the call.\n\nRep. French Hill, of Arkansas, chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, said the Trump administration has been great to work with on a whole host of issues, but has been frustrated when it comes to how the White House has operated on tariffs, the sources said.\n\nSpeaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told members that he'd talk to Trump and vowed to arrange for someone in the administration to brief the conference, the sources said.\n\nMembers of Congress will also get a chance to publicly question a key Trump official about tariffs this week. U.S trade representative Jamieson Greer is scheduled testify before a Senate committee on Tuesday and a House panel Wednesday. Greer also held a private call for members of the House Ways and Means Committee last Friday, according to a GOP aide.\n\nStill, many Republican lawmakers - who will face their constituents starting next week for a two-week recess break - feel like they have received little direction from the White House about Trump's endgame on tariffs and have been frustrated by some of the mixed messaging coming out of the administration.\n\nJohnson counseled members during Sunday's conference call to trust the tariff process and stand by Trump's trade policy, arguing he helped deliver a strong economy during his first term, according to the sources on the call.\n\nBut there are some signs of anxiety even among GOP leaders. Johnson has argued, both in a letter to his colleagues over the weekend and on the conference call, that they need to quickly coalesce around a budget resolution to unlock Trump's legislative agenda because of the market turmoil.\n\nElyse Perlmutter-Gumbiner\n\nJennifer Jett\n\nTrump ordered a new review of a Japanese steelmaker's $15 billion proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel, raising hopes that the deal could be revived after former President Joe Biden blocked it in January on national security grounds.\n\nBiden's order prohibiting the acquisition by Nippon Steel, Japan's largest steelmaker, gave Trump the right to review the decision. In a White House memo today, Trump directed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States, which examines foreign investments for national security risks, to review the proposal within 45 days \"to assist me in determining whether further action in this matter may be appropriate.\"\n\nBoth Nippon Steel and U.S. Steel have sued CFIUS over the blocking of the deal, saying it did not receive fair consideration as Biden sought support in his re-election campaign from the United Steelworkers union in the swing state of Pennsylvania, where U.S. Steel is based. Trump had also expressed opposition to the deal.\n\nThe share price of U.S. Steel up rose more than 13% after news of the deadline extension, Reuters reported.\n\nGary Grumbach Gary Grumbach is a NBC News Legal Affairs Reporter, based in Washington, D.C.\n\nDareh Gregorian\n\nThe Justice Department today asked the Supreme Court to stay a judge's ruling ordering it to bring back to the U.S. a man it acknowledges it mistakenly sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador.\n\nIn an emergency application to the high court, the DOJ argued U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis' directive that Kilmar Abrego Garcia be returned by midnight tonight \"unprecedented and indefensible\" and \"patently unlawful.\"\n\n\"The United States' negotiations with a foreign sovereign should not be put on a judicially mandated clock, least of all when matters of foreign terrorism and national security are at stake,\" they write.\n\nThe government acknowledged in court last week that Garcia, whom it alleges without providing evidence is a member of the gang MS-13, should not have been sent to El Salvador because of a 2019 order from an immigration judge explicitly barring him from being deported there.\n\nAn attorney for the Justice Department said at a hearing Friday that he could not explain why Garcia, who has no criminal record in the U.S. or his native El Salvador, was taken into custody in the first place, saying, \"The government made a choice here to produce no evidence.\"\n\nAsked by the judge why the administration couldn't ask El Salvador to return Garcia, the attorney, Enez Reuveni, said he'd asked the same thing, \"I have not yet received an answer that I find satisfactory,\" he added.\n\nU.S. Attorney General Pam Bondi placed Reuveni on administrative leave over the weekend.\n\nThe administration had also asked the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to stay Xinis' order, which rejected the request earlier today.\n\nRead the full story.\n\nBerkeley Lovelace Jr.\n\nKate Santaliz\n\nThe Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor and Pensions is postponing a hearing it hoped would feature Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s testimony after thousands of health agency workers were fired , a spokesperson for the committee's chair, Bill Cassidy, R-La., said today.\n\nLast week, Cassidy and committee ranking member Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., wrote a letter to Kennedy inviting him to publicly testify about the mass layoffs at the Department of Health and Human Services last Tuesday. But the committee is required to give public notice of a hearing at least seven days in advance, meaning it would have needed to release an official notice last Thursday, a Cassidy spokesperson, Ty Bofferding, said.\n\nKennedy's team has confirmed that it received the invitation to testify, Bofferding said, but hasn't provided an official response on whether the health secretary would do so at some point.\n\nBoth sides are working to find a date for testimony that would work. Bofferding did not respond to a request for comment on when the new hearing date might be. Cassidy has said that Kennedy agreed to come before the health committee \"on a quarterly basis.\"\n\nThe update comes after Texas health officials reported over the weekend that a second child had died in a fast-growing measles outbreak that has infected nearly 500 people in the state since January.\n\nKennedy said Sunday on X that he was in Gaines County, the epicenter of the outbreak, to meet with families in the community. He also met with the families of the children who died.\n\n\"The most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine,\" he said in the post, although he did not encourage people to get vaccinated.\n\nIn response to Kennedy's post, Cassidy said on X: \"Completely agree and encourage all parents to make sure their children are vaccinated against measles.\"\n\nJ.J. McCorvey\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nTrump has threatened an additional 50% tariff on goods imported from China if the country does not withdraw its retaliatory tariffs.\n\nChina, one of the U.S.'s largest trading partners, said it would place a 34% tariff rate on U.S. imports after the Trump administration increased U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods to at least 54%.\n\nIn a Truth Social post, Trump said today that if the country did not reverse course by tomorrow, he would impose \"ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th.\"\n\n\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated!\" said Trump. \"Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately.\"\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nRepublican Sens. Ron Johnson and Mike Lee posted in favor of Trump taking up the E.U. on its offer of zero-for-zero tariffs.\n\n\"Let's take that deal!\" Lee, of Utah, said on X , sharing a video of European Commission President Urula von der Leyen talking about the proposal. \"Much to gain.\"\n\nJohnson reposted Lee's comments, saying he agreed.\n\n\"Totally agree with @BasedMikeLee,\" the Wisconsin Republican said. \"At some point, you have to take YES for an answer.\"\n\nYamiche Alcindor\n\nTrump is not concerned about the optics of golfing in Florida on the weekends as the market sinks and economists worry that his tariffs will slow the U.S. economy, make inflation worse and even lead to a recession, a White House official said.\n\nThe official said Trump sees the Dow Jones plummeting and market strains as a temporary issue that will resolve itself.\n\nThe official said Trump's golfing during the market strain was like \"going to a birthday party after a friend has had surgery,\" adding that the friend - the U.S. economy - will recover and that the president can enjoy his time in Florida while continuing to work.\n\n\"The economy will be fine,\" the official said.\n\nRebecca Shabad\n\nSarah Dean\n\nWhen asked on Fox New this morning about business leaders' criticizing Trump's tariffs, top White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett downplayed the impact and said foreign imports only make up a small part of the U.S. economy.\n\nReferring to billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, one of the critics, Hassett said, \"I would urge everyone, especially Bill, to ease off the rhetoric a little bit. The fact is the 10% baseline tariff is on what, 14% of GDP, that's about how much trade we have, how many imports. And so 86% of the GDP is affected by the deregulation and the tax cuts and everything else.\"\n\nAckman, a staunch Trump supporter, called for a pause on the tariffs Sunday in posts on X and said the U.S. may be headed toward a \"self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down.\"\n\nHassett added that \"the idea that it's going to be a nuclear winter or something like that is completely irresponsible rhetoric.\"\n\nRob Wile\n\nAs part of their defense of his economic policy and tariffs rollout, Trump and other White House officials have pointed to demand for government bonds increasing, which has caused borrowing rates to decline - in theory, making it easier for his administration to continue to finance the U.S.'s massive debt obligations.\n\nHowever, bond demand has proven considerably more volatile than what those officials have portrayed - and the reasons for the price movements in either direction do not necessarily portend favorable economic outcomes.\n\nIn short, the fear of stagflation - accelerating inflation without solid economic growth - is affecting how bond yields, or how much investors earn on a bond, are moving.\n\nDemand for bonds tends to be correlated to inflation expectations. When people expect more inflation, the yield rises; with less price growth expected, the yield falls.\n\nToday, even amid the collapse in stocks, bond yields are still hovering above 4%, well above pre-pandemic levels. That suggests that even as economic growth looks to pull back dramatically, hotter inflation could still be present.\n\n\"Slowing growth and rising inflation create an increasingly uneasy macro environment that resembles stagflation, even if it doesn't fully meet the definition,\" Christian Floro, a market strategist at Principal Asset Management, said in a note today. \"This mix only adds complexity to the policy outlook.\"\n\nRob Wile\n\nGabe Gutierrez\n\nStocks saw a sharp but brief rally around 10:15 a.m., around the same time that a headline began circulating on social media that Trump was considering a 90-day pause.\n\nHowever, the White House said no such pause was being considered in a post to X.\n\nThe pause suggestion appeared to have originated from a small account on X, but spread quickly after some well-followed finance accounts reposted it without verifying it.\n\nTop White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett was asked about a 90-day pause during a Fox News interview this morning, but did not say such a pause was on the table.\n\n\"I think the president is going to decide what the president is going to decide,\" Hassett said. \"There are more than 50 countries in negotiation with the president.\"\n\nRyan J. Reilly\n\nReporting from Washington\n\nTwo Democratic members of Congress have sent letters to law firms that have reached deals or are reportedly negotiating with the Trump White House to avoid executive orders targeting the firms.\n\nThe letters - from Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., the ranking member of the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee's investigations subcommittee, and Rep. Jamie Raskin, D-Md., the ranking member of the House Judiciary Committee - were sent to Paul Weiss; Sullivan & Cromwell; Kirkland; Skadden Arps; Wilkie; and Milbank, as well as to White House Counsel David Warrington.\n\nBlumenthal and Raskin wrote that the executive orders targeting law firms were \"in blatant violation of the rights guaranteed to all Americans by the First, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments of the United States Constitution\" and were  \"part of a broader effort by President Trump to use the powers of the presidency to intimidate and silence his perceived enemies.\" The executive orders \"have turned into an illegal shakedown of the legal profession,\" they wrote.\n\n\"If every law firm targeted by the President were to accede to his unlawful demands, the resulting threat to Americans' constitutional protections would erode our democratic values and cherished civil liberties, as well as cost the legal profession dearly and for many years to come,\" one of the letters states. \"Indeed, American Bar Association's (ABA) Model Rules of Professional Conduct state that it is professional misconduct for a lawyer to 'engage in conduct that is prejudicial to the administration of justice.'\"\n\nThe letters came as Raskin and Sen. Adam Schiff, D-Calf., plan to hold a \"shadow hearing\" today to highlight what they see as the Trump administration's attack on the rule of law . The hearing will feature testimony from Justice Department employees who have been pushed out in the first few months of the Trump administration.\n\nAlexandra Marquez\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent dismissed concerns Americans might be having about a potential recession and the status of their retirement plans, saying Trump and his administration are \"building the long-term economic fundamentals for prosperity.\"\n\nIn an interview yesterday with NBC News' \"Meet the Press,\" Bessent called it a \"false narrative\" that people who are close to retiring may be reluctant after their retirement savings dropped last week because of the stock market downturn.\n\n\"I think that's a false narrative,\" he told moderator Kristen Welker. \"Americans who want to retire right now, the Americans who put away for years in their savings accounts, I think they don't look at the day-to-day fluctuations.\"\n\n\"In fact, most Americans don't have everything in the market,\" he added. \"People have a long-term view. ... The reason the stock market is considered a good investment is because it's a long-term investment. If you look day to day, week to week, it's very risky.

They have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade.\"\n\nIn South Korea, another key U.S. ally in Asia, Trade Minister Cheong In-kyo is preparing for a two-day visit to Washington this week for tariff negotiations, his ministry said today. Last week, Trump announced a 25% tariff on South Korean goods, in addition to existing tariffs on steel, aluminum, cars and auto parts.\n\n\"The government will put in all-out efforts in negotiations with the U.S. to minimize the impact of Washington's trade policies on Korean businesses and industries,\" the ministry said, according to the Yonhap news agency.\n\nAbigail Williams\n\nThe U.S. is revoking the visas of all South Sudanese passport holders in the country, the State Department said, at a time when the East African nation is at risk of returning to civil war.\n\nDeputy Secretary of State Christopher Landau confirmed that the decision was made after South Sudan refused \"to accept one of their nationals certified by their own Embassy in Washington and repatriated to their country.\"\n\n\"Effective immediately, all visa appointments are cancelled, no new visas will be issued, no existing visas will be effective, and hence NO ONE from South Sudan will be entering the United States on a visa until this matter is resolved,\" he said in a post on X .\n\nSecretary of State Marco Rubio announced the move on Saturday, saying, \"It is time for the Transitional Government of South Sudan to stop taking advantage of the United States.\"\n\n\"Enforcing our nation's immigration laws is critically important to the national security and public safety of the United States,\" he said in a statement. \"Every country must accept the return of its citizens in a timely manner when another country, including the United States, seeks to remove them.\"\n\nPeter Guo\n\nReporting from Hong Kong\n\nChina could get a reduction in tariffs if it approves a deal to sell TikTok's U.S. operations, Trump says.\n\n\"If I gave a little cut in tariffs, they'd approve that deal in 15 minutes, which shows you the power of tariffs,\" he told reporters on Air Force One yesterday.\n\nTrump confirmed reports that China and the U.S. had been \"pretty close\" to a deal on the short-video app, but that Beijing backed out due to the additional 34% tariff he announced on Chinese goods last week. On Friday, Trump extended the deadline by 75 days for TikTok's China-based owner, ByteDance, to sell its U.S. operations or face a ban.\n\nChinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters in Beijing today that China would handle any TikTok sale \"in accordance with its laws and regulations.\" He urged the U.S. to provide an \"open, fair, just and nondiscriminatory business environment\" for Chinese firms in the U.S.\n\nByteDance said Saturday that it was still in negotiations with the U.S. government and has not reached any agreement.\n\n\"There are still differences on many key issues between the two sides,\" the company said in a statement. \"According to Chinese law, any agreement must go through relevant review procedures.\"\n\nPeter Guo\n\nMalaysia, the current chair of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations , will seek a consensus among the bloc's 10 member states in response to Trump's new tariffs, its prime minister said.\n\nMalaysia \"will continue to coordinate efforts to present a united regional front, maintain open and resilient supply chains,\" Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim said in a video yesterday.\n\nAnwar denied Trump's claim that Malaysia imposes a 47% tariff on U.S. imports, which he used to justify a 24% tariff on Malaysian goods. But he said Malaysia would not retaliate until it resolved detailed issues with the U.S. and consulted with ASEAN members.\n\nSingaporean Prime Minister Lawrence Wong, whose city-state was hit by a baseline 10% tariff, said on Facebook last week that it is now \"more important than ever\" for ASEAN neighbors to strengthen cooperation and solidarity.\n\nSoutheast Asia's largest economy, Indonesia, which is subject to a 32% tariff, also said it will not hit back at the U.S., The Jakarta Post reported, citing a top economic official.\n\nVietnam, home to the fourth-largest U.S. trade deficit and facing among the highest new tariffs, at 46%, has offered to cut its tariffs on U.S. goods to zero if it can negotiate a deal with the U.S.\n\nMegan Lebowitz\n\nTrump continued defending his policies this morning amid a stock market rout being felt around the world over his tariffs, telling people in a social media post to not be \"weak\" or \"stupid.\"\n\n\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO.

But JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said in a shareholder letter today that the tariffs \"will likely increase inflation and are causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession.\"\n\nIn his post, Trump also called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. The Fed left interest rates unchanged last month , noting that \"uncertainty around the economic outlook has increased.\"\n\nTrump criticized China for announcing 34% tariffs on goods imported from the U.S., saying that China was \"not acknowledging my warning for abusing countries not to retaliate.\"\n\nPeter Guo\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said today that Trump's reciprocal tariffs will likely raise prices on both domestic and imported products and slow down economic growth.\n\n\"We are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices, as input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products,\" Dimon, who has run the largest U.S. bank for nearly two decades, wrote in an annual letter to shareholders.\n\nWhile it's still unknown whether the tariffs will cause a recession, the duties will slow down growth in the U.S. economy, he said.\n\nThere are many \"uncertainties\" surrounding the new tariff policy, including potential retaliatory actions from other countries and the possible impact on the U.S. dollar, he said.\n\n\"The quicker this issue is resolved, the better because some of the negative effects increase cumulatively over time and would be hard to reverse,\" he wrote.\n\nRyan J.

      "text": "Trump's election order could jeopardize 'hundreds of thousands' of future mail ballots\n\nAshley Lopez\n\nAn election worker sorts vote-by-mail ballots for the presidential primary at King County's elections office in Renton, Wash., in March 2020. Jason Redmond/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nThe state of Washington has been allowing election officials to count mail ballots that don't make it to their office until after Election Day for more than a hundred years now. It's a practice that could be prohibited in upcoming elections, thanks to a sweeping executive order signed by President Trump last month.\n\n\"All the way back in 1917, we started this tradition and have since modified the language a little bit,\" said Stuart Holmes, the director of elections for Washington's Secretary of State's Office.\n\nHolmes said this grace period is something that many voters in Washington have come to rely on. In the last presidential election, state officials reported they counted more than 250,000 ballots that didn't make it to their offices until after Election Day.\n\n\"At no fault of the voters, there could be some unforeseen delay in getting that to the county auditor's office or otherwise prevented to be received on Election Day,\" Holmes told NPR. \"And so, Washington's had this long-standing tradition as long as we've been absentee voting to allow ballots to be received after Election Day and counted and included in the election results.\"\n\nAccording to the National Conference of State Legislatures, 18 states - plus the Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C. - count mail-in ballots that are received by election officials after Election Day. Most states require the ballots be postmarked by or before Election Day.\n\nStates with a large share of mail ballots often take more time to count votes. Mail-in ballots take longer to process. Election officials are often counting ballots in the days after Election Day regardless of whether ballots make it back to them before or after in-person voting ends.\n\nRepublicans have argued, without evidence, that the longer a state takes to count ballots after Election Day, the less secure their elections are. Misinformation about this - which proliferated after the 2020 election - has led to calls for limits to the counting of mail ballots.\n\nTo that end, Republicans have sought to eliminate these grace periods in states across the country - both through legislation and legal challenges. The success of those efforts has been mixed.\n\nThis effort got a significant boost last month, however, when Trump signed an executive order that, among other things, specifically prohibits this practice. He cited voter fraud while signing the order.\n\n\"This will go a long way toward ending it,\" Trump said. \"There are other steps that we will be taking next in the coming weeks.\"\n\nBarbara Smith Warner with the National Vote at Home Institute - which advocates for wider access to mail-in voting - said there's no proof that counting ballots after Election Day makes elections less secure. She said getting rid of these grace periods would mostly just trip up voters who are used to returning their ballots closer to Election Day.\n\n\"It's going to lead to voter confusion,\" Warner said, \"and ultimately not only disenfranchisement of those folks, but the bigger term impact is going to be people being afraid to vote, or thinking, 'OK, I'm afraid I'm going to do this wrong, and so I'm just not going to do it at all.' It is going to keep people from voting.\"\n\nAccording to data provided to NPR, six states - Alaska, Illinois, Maryland, Nevada, Ohio and Oregon - plus Washington, D.C., counted more than 170,000 mail-in ballots in total during the last presidential election that were received after Election Day. In California - where more than 13 million mail-in ballots were cast last year - voters have a week-long grace period.\n\nIn Washington state, Holmes said he and other officials in the state do not want their voters to lose access to voting because of issues with the post office. He said he anticipates that if Trump's order stands, it would disproportionately affect rural voters across the country, as well as busy people who remembered to put their ballots in the mail closer to Election Day.\n\n\"The impacts for the voters would be substantial and significant,\" he said, \"likely resulting in thousands, hundreds of thousands of ballots being rejected simply just based on timeliness alone.\"\n\nWhether Trump's order stands, though, is an open question. So far, there's been a slew of lawsuits filed against the Trump administration in response to this election order - including one recently filed by 19 states.\n\nUltimately, Warner said, she thinks Trump will not be allowed to tell states they can't count mail ballots after Election Day.\n\n\"The president has no ability to tell the states how to run their elections,\" she said. \"That is actually in the Constitution, a right that is given to the states to determine how they run their elections.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Trump says the US and Iran will have direct nuclear talks soon. Vahid Salemi/AP/AP hide caption\n\nPresident Trump said that the United States will hold direct talks with Iran on its nuclear program, starting Saturday. \"We have a very big meeting, and we'll see what can happen. And I think everybody agrees that doing a deal would be preferable to doing the obvious,\" Trump said, as he met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office.\n\nDuring his first term, Trump withdrew from the 2015 landmark nuclear deal with Iran negotiated by then-President Barack Obama.\n\nTrump offered few details about the upcoming talks, only saying the meeting will be at \"almost the highest level.\"\n\nNetanyahu, who has frequently called the possibility of a nuclear-armed Iran an existential threat to Israel, said he and Trump are united in the goal that Tehran will never get nuclear weapons.\n\n\"If it can be done diplomatically in a full way, the way it was done in Libya, I think that would be a good thing, Netanyahu said. \"But whatever happens, we have to make sure that Iran does not have nuclear weapons.\"\n\nTrump said it would be in Tehran's best interests to make a deal with his administration.\n\n\"We are dealing with them directly and maybe a deal is going to be made. That would be great, it would be really great for Iran,\" he said,  warning that if the talks weren't successful \"it will be a very bad day for Iran.\"\n\nGaza 'freedom zone'\n\nThe meeting Monday was the second between the U.S. and Israeli leaders since Trump began his second term. During their first meeting, also at the White House, Trump announced a proposal to remove the Palestinian population of some 2 million people from the Gaza Strip, where Israel has been fighting Hamas since the militant group launched an assault on Israel in October 2023.\n\nNetanyahu's visit comes just weeks after the Israeli military resumed a major ground offensive in Gaza, shattering hopes that a ceasefire would be extended to get out more  of the remaining 58 Israeli hostages taken by Hamas 18 months ago. More than 30 are believed to be dead.\n\nTrump said he hoped a new ceasefire could be worked out, and that remaining Israeli hostages would be released.\n\nHe also returned to his vision of the future of a post-war exodus of Palestinians from Gaza, which Arab nations have roundly rejected.\n\n\"I think it's an incredible piece of important real estate, and I think it's something that we would be involved in. But, you know, having a peace force like the United States, there controlling and owning the Gaza Strip, would be a good thing,\" he said.\n\nHe said if the Palestinians were moved to other countries, the Gaza Strip could then become what he termed a \"freedom zone.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

After falling steeply for three sessions, U.S. stocks rebounded on Tuesday. Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images hide caption\n\nU.S. stock markets fell once again on Tuesday, continuing a sell-off that has seen equity markets across the world crater since President Trump's announcement of tariffs.\n\nThe losses came after U.S. stocks attempted earlier to rebound after shares in Europe and Asia gained on Tuesday following the tumultuous day on global markets on Monday.\n\nBut tariff concerns returned later in the session after the White House confirmed it would proceed with a 104% tariff on China that will kick in on Wednesday.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial average ended down over 300 points, or 0.8%, after earlier gaining as much as 3.8%.  The S&P 500 fell 1.6%, while the Nasdaq ended down a little over 2%.\n\nThe losses on Tuesday, though not as harsh as in previous few days, will nonetheless add to the value destruction that has already seen trillions of dollars in investor wealth wiped out.\n\nU.S. investors had earlier been heartened by gains in global markets on Tuesday.\n\nThe major stock markets in Hong Kong and Shanghai - the Hang Seng Index and Shanghai Composite, respectively - closed slightly higher on Tuesday, while Tokyo's Nikkei ended the day's trading in Japan up more than 6%. It hit its lowest level in 18 months on Monday, with its listed stocks having lost almost a fifth of value over the past two weeks.\n\nEuropean markets also posted gains on Tuesday, but investors in the continent's major stock markets have also suffered significant losses in the past week, and that's even before exporters have really begun to feel the effects of significant tariffs on European products sold to the United States.\n\nCurrency traders watch computer monitors near the screen showing news reporting with a picture of President Donald Trump at a foreign exchange dealing room in Seoul, South Korea on Tuesday. Lee Jin-man/AP hide caption\n\nAs investors seek out assets that can serve as a bulwark against uncertainty in other markets, the price of gold has continued to soar to above $3,000 an ounce, prompting financial analysts to liken the current geopolitical and economic uncertainty to that of the late 1970s and 1980s, when gold prices also spiked significantly.\n\nAnd in light of the uncertainty over the United States' future role on the world stage, analysts say another asset usually considered a safe haven for investors - the dollar - may also continue to weaken against other global currencies.\n\nIn China, a number of large, government-backed businesses and listed companies have announced they will buy back their own shares, as part of a wider effort to calm the local equity markets.\n\nOfficials in China said Tuesday that they wouldn't back down in the face of Trump's threats to impose a further 50% tariff on Chinese exports to the U.S., saying \"China will fight till the end if the U.S. side is bent on going down the wrong path.\"\n\nBut other countries have expressed willingness to negotiate, according to the White House.  For example, President Trump said on social media on Tuesday that South Korea was sending a team to the U.S. to try to negotiate a deal after the U.S also imposed tariffs last week on the Asian country.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Trump still fired them\n\nAndrea Hsu\n\nSherrell Pyatt (left) and Mahri Stainnak were removed from their federal government positions soon after President Trump signed two executive orders ending diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) efforts in the federal government. That's despite the fact that they were not working in DEIA offices at the time of their dismissals. Alyssa Pointer and Tristan Spinski for NPR hide caption\n\nMahri Stainnak had just started a job at the Office of Personnel Management focused on bringing more engineers, technologists and scientists into the government.\n\nSherrell Pyatt helped to resolve personnel disputes, including through mediation, at the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nJessica Swan's position at the Department of Education was overseeing grants to help some 5 million children in the U.S. learn English.\n\nEach brought years of experience to their roles. Each was removed from their position soon after President Trump signed two executive orders ending diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility (DEIA) efforts in the federal government.\n\nThat's despite the fact that they were not working in DEIA offices at the time of their dismissals. They contend their jobs don't conflict with those executive orders.\n\nInstead, they believe they are among hundreds and possibly thousands of federal employees targeted because of their past involvement with government DEIA programs and initiatives - or perhaps because the Trump administration merely associated them with the concepts of diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility. Many of these workers say they've never received an explanation for why they're being fired.\n\nNow, Stainnak, who uses they/them pronouns, is asking for their job back. They are the named appellant in a complaint filed with the independent agency tasked with hearing personnel disputes within the federal government. The complaint alleges that Stainnak was among a pool of federal employees unlawfully fired by the Trump administration as a punishment for \"their perceived political affiliations.\"\n\nMahri Stainnak had just started a job at the Office of Personnel Management focused on bringing more engineers, technologists and scientists into the government when they were removed from their position following Trump's executive orders to end DEIA efforts. Tristan Spinski for NPR hide caption\n\n\"It's not right that myself and others have been targeted and illegally fired based on who the Trump administration thinks we are or the assumptions they make about our values,\" says Stainnak.\n\nSwan and Pyatt have both been told they will be terminated in the coming months. They plan to join the complaint once they are separated from the government.\n\nAs Trump and his billionaire adviser Elon Musk have swiftly made good on their promises to dramatically slash the federal government , legal challenges have piled up . So have warnings that the government is losing talented, experienced civil servants who have faithfully served the American public through multiple administrations.\n\n\"It's the opposite of trying to develop the meritocracy economy that we want to have,\" says Kelly Dermody, a managing partner with Lieff, Cabraser, Heimann & Bernstein, one of the law firms that together with the American Civil Liberties Union of the District of Columbia brought the complaint on behalf of federal workers. \"It's a huge loss.\"\n\nUnder federal law, government employees generally cannot take their personnel disputes directly to court. Instead, they must work through the Merit Systems Protection Board, an agency set up by Congress to hear such complaints.\n\nBut now, that board itself faces uncertainty. In February, Trump fired one of its members, Democrat Cathy Harris. Harris has sued to get her seat back, citing federal law that protects board members from removal for reasons other than cause. On Monday, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated her, though the Trump administration is expected to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in.\n\nIn response to NPR's questions about the class complaint and the legal fight at the merit board, White House spokesperson Anna Kelly wrote: \"President Trump has the authority to manage personnel within his Executive Branch, end unlawful DEI practices in government offices, and ensure hiring and firing decisions are based only on merit.\"\n\nIn one of his executive orders , Trump says the federal government and many institutions outside government have adopted and are actively using \"dangerous, demeaning, and immoral race- and sex-based preferences\" masquerading as DEI.\n\nThe order says those policies \"undermine the traditional American values of hard work, excellence, and individual achievement in favor of an unlawful, corrosive, and pernicious identity-based spoils system.\"\n\nStainnak first learned something was up on Jan. 21, the day after Trump returned to the White House to start his second term.\n\n\"I was having dinner with my family and my personal cell phone rang,\" they recall. It was someone from human resources at the Office of Personnel Management. Stainnak began shaking.\n\nStainnak believes their firing had nothing to do with their new position - and everything to do with their work over the previous four years when they were in a DEIA role during the Biden administration. Tristan Spinski for NPR hide caption\n\nHours earlier, the Trump administration had directed agencies to shut down their offices focused on diversity, equity, inclusion and accessibility, citing Trump's executive orders.\n\nSure enough, Stainnak was told they were being put on administrative leave immediately. \"I was incredibly shocked,\" they recall. \"The first thing I said was 'I'm not in a diversity, equity and inclusion role.'\"\n\nAt that time, Stainnak was in a brand-new job as the director of OPM's Talent Innovation Group, focused on bringing more people with technical skills into the government. Stainnak had only been in that job for a week.\n\nBut the Trump administration had asked agencies to identify all employees who were working in DEIA roles as of Nov. 5, 2024, the day Trump was reelected - two and a half months before he'd signed the new executive orders.\n\nBack in 2024, Stainnak was in a DEIA role. Under the Biden administration, Stainnak had worked at OPM's Office of Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and Accessibility, including on LGBTQ issues and later as deputy director, supporting workers across the government.\n\n\"My team put together events that helped veterans and people with disabilities and recent graduates, including from minority serving institutions, be able to learn about federal jobs across agencies that might be of interest to them,\" says Stainnak. \"Having a government that represents all segments of society ... absolutely makes us stronger.\"\n\nStainnak was officially terminated from their new job on March 26, some 60 days after being given formal notice.\n\nStainnak believes their firing had nothing to do with their new position - and everything to do with their work over the previous four years.\n\nTheir complaint before the MSPB asserts that the Trump administration is not merely resetting priorities, as new administrations always do, but attempting to punish those it believes supported its political opponents.\n\n\"President Trump has explicitly associated DEIA programs with his Democratic predecessor, Joseph R. Biden, without regard to the worker's skills or current job assignment,\" the complaint alleges. \"Most notably, President Trump repeatedly has called DEI work the function of a 'leftist ideology' and a 'woke' political agenda.\"\n\nThe complaint also asks the merit board to examine whether Trump's anti-DEIA executive orders discriminated against - or adversely affected - federal workers who are not white or male, which would be a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.\n\nIt's not yet clear how many federal employees might join the class complaint. Attorneys involved with the case say they currently represent nearly a dozen employees at the Federal Aviation Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the National Institutes of Health, and the departments of Labor, Homeland Security and Labor.\n\nSome, like Stainnak, worked in DEIA offices under Biden. For others, the only DEIA-related activity attorneys say they could find was involvement in a training or employee resource group.\n\nSherrell Pyatt was put on administrative leave after a decade working in the federal government at several agencies. Alyssa Pointer for NPR hide caption\n\nSherrell Pyatt began her federal career a decade ago with a job at the U.S. Postal Service, where four generations of her family have served. Her work there included research into how to stop illegal drugs from entering the country through the mail. It led to other roles in the government.\n\nDuring the first Trump administration, she worked as a congressional liaison for Immigration and Customs Enforcement, helping members of Congress find legislative fixes to problems. As part of her job, Pyatt brought lawmakers to the border and into detention facilities to get an up-close view of conditions there.\n\n\"It was a way not only to support our agents and officers at the border so that they could get what they needed, but also so that the American public could see exactly what was going on and understand why we were saying there was a crisis at the border,\" she says.\n\nLater, Pyatt was part of a Customs and Border Protection team that examined what went wrong in the in-custody deaths of two people, work that was recognized with a commissioner's award.\n\nAfter Biden took office during the pandemic, Pyatt was detailed to FEMA, where she helped communities in the Southeast get information about COVID vaccines. As the sole Spanish speaker on her team, she also helped Latino communities understand how to get help after a hurricane.\n\n\"It was ensuring that the public could trust information that was coming out of the government and was also able to access the services that we provide,\" says Pyatt.\n\nIn January 2024, she moved to the Department of Homeland Security's Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties, and a month before Trump's inauguration, she transitioned into an equal opportunity specialist role in that office.\n\nSherrell Pyatt holds pins she received while working for the Department of Homeland Security, the United States Postal Service and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Alyssa Pointer for NPR hide caption\n\nTitle VII of the Civil Rights Act requires that federal agencies establish equal employment opportunity programs to ensure that personnel decisions involving workers and job applicants are free of discrimination.\n\n\"It's not something that is 'DEI.' It is mandated by law,\" Pyatt says.\n\nStill, on Jan. 30, she was put on administrative leave and told it was because of Trump's anti-DEI executive orders. Last month, the entire Office for Civil Rights and Civil Liberties received a termination notice , citing a different executive order focused on maximizing efficiency through a downsizing of the federal workforce.\n\n\"These offices have obstructed immigration enforcement by adding bureaucratic hurdles and undermining [the department's] mission,\" DHS spokesperson Tricia McLaughlin said in a statement, referring to Pyatt's office and two others.\n\nPyatt's official termination date is May 27, after which she says she will join Stainnak's complaint before the merit board.\n\nPyatt points out that all the government jobs she's held are nonpartisan. \"We don't pick a side. We don't get to decide who our boss is,\" she says.\n\nDermody says this is true for many of her clients - federal employees whose work crosses administrations.\n\n\"They don't serve any particular person in the White House or the Congress,\" she says.\n\nPyatt worries the loss of so many people who have stepped up to serve the country will cost the American public.\n\nSherrell Pyatt holds a commissioner's award she received for work she did at Customs and Border Protection examining in-custody deaths. Alyssa Pointer for NPR hide caption\n\n\"The community at large suffers when you have these sort of rash actions that are not based in any kind of research or evidence,\" she says.\n\nThe White House press office did not respond to NPR's question about whether these mass layoffs are resulting in a brain drain in the federal workforce .\n\nJessica Swan worries about a particular community being affected by the cuts: the 5 million children in the U.S. who are English language learners.\n\nSwan, who joined the Department of Education in 2020 after decades in the field, including as an educator, had a job administering grants to prepare teachers to meet these children's needs.\n\n\"My role is not considered a DEI position,\" says Swan. \"In fact, if I had to sum up the importance of my role, it is in being a guardrail for federal funding ... to prevent any fraud, waste or abuse.\"\n\nYet she, too, received an email sent on Jan. 31, informing her that she was being put on leave because of Trump's anti-DEIA executive orders.\n\n\"I was immediately in tears because I know I have spent the last three decades of my life working to support this particular population of kids - our English learners,\" says Swan.\n\nShe spent the next 10 days calling people at the Education Department, trying to figure out why she and her colleagues in the Office of English Language Acquisition had been swept up in the DEIA purge.\n\n\"To date, I've been given no answer,\" she says.\n\nSwan conferred with others at the Education Department who'd similarly been put on leave.\n\n\"The only commonality that we could find was that we all had enrolled at some point in a diversity training that was recommended that we take by former Secretary Betsy DeVos under the first Trump administration,\" she says.\n\nAsked if this was the reason some Education Department staff were put on leave, Madi Biedermann, deputy assistant secretary for communications at the department, wrote: \"At the Department of Education, we are evaluating staffing in line with the commitment to prioritizing meaningful learning ahead of divisive ideology in schools and putting student outcomes above special interests.\"\n\nTwo months into her leave, Swan still hasn't received her official termination notice but expects it is coming soon, as the Trump administration takes steps to dismantle the entire Education Department .\n\nClosing down her office makes no sense, Swan says, especially in light of Trump's executive order making English the official language of the U.S.\n\n\"We've got over 5 million kids who will need access to English, who will need the ability to learn and to grow in the language,\" she says. \"These are our kids. This is the present and the future of our country, of our democracy.\"\n\nHave information you want to share about ongoing changes across the federal government?

      "text": "A look at the economics of President Trump's trade war\n\nBy\n\nScott Horsley\n\n,\n\nLeila Fadel\n\nPresident Trump's trade war is rattling businesses and financial markets around the world, and many investors are eager to see an off-ramp. So what are the economics of this trade war?\n\nLEILA FADEL, HOST: President Trump's trade war is sending shockwaves around the world and rattling investors here at home. Stocks briefly rallied yesterday based on a rumor Trump might pause some of the new tariffs but fell again once the White House denied there would be a pause, which means import taxes are set to go even higher starting tomorrow. NPR's chief economics correspondent Scott Horsley is here to talk through this trade war. Good morning, Scott. SCOTT HORSLEY, BYLINE: Good morning, Leila. FADEL: So if all of these tariffs do go into effect, what is that going to mean for businesses and shoppers in the U.S. and around the world? HORSLEY: It's likely to mean both higher prices and slower economic growth. We've seen a lot of forecasters warn that this could tip the United States into recession. Certainly, other countries that rely on exporting to the U.S. are looking at a big economic slowdown. That's why markets have nosedived all around the world in recent days and why investors are so desperate for any sign that maybe there's an off-ramp here. Now, Trump did have that phone call yesterday with Japan's prime minister. The head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen says her side is willing to make a deal. But as things stand right now, products from the E.U. are going to be slapped with a 20% tariff tomorrow. Japanese goods are facing a 24% tariff, and imports from China could be looking at tariffs of over 100%. FADEL: Now, the president called on the Federal Reserve to cushion the fallout by lowering interest rates. How likely is that? HORSLEY: If we do fall into recession and see a spike in unemployment, the Fed will probably have to lower interest rates. But that's not where we are right now. In fact, the jobs report we got last week showed a stronger labor market than many forecasters had expected. And, of course, we're still not out of the woods on inflation. Prices are climbing faster than most people would like, and these high tariffs could push prices even higher. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned he and his colleagues could end up caught in a tug of war between higher unemployment and higher inflation. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) JEROME POWELL: It's difficult for a central bank because higher unemployment would call for speeding up the economy and higher inflation would call for slowing it down. HORSLEY: Right now, the Fed is not inclined to cut interest rates and speed the economy up. It's more likely to keep rates elevated to avoid rekindling inflation. But if we do start to see a lot of layoffs as these tariffs kick in, then that balancing act could change. FADEL: Could there be some economic benefits of the trade war if it brings other countries to the negotiating table? HORSLEY: Yeah, we'll have to wait and see. There is some truth to the president's complaint about other countries making it hard for the U.S. to tap into their markets. Although, in many cases, the tariffs that Trump is levying in response exaggerate the scale of those trade barriers. Supporters say the president is merely employing hardball negotiating tactics, but critics have a different view. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, for example, describes Trump's tactics here as predatory, especially when tariffs are used to bully some of America's closest allies. LARRY SUMMERS: I think this is a moment, with all the threats in the world, when alliances are very important. And when we engage in the kind of threatening behavior we have engaged in, we make things much more dangerous in an already dangerous world. HORSLEY: Summers told me recently that he had been disappointed there was not more vocal pushback from businesses and political leaders unhappy with the president's approach. A lot of people have been cowed by Donald Trump. We have started to hear some of that pushback this week from people like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. And if stock prices fall a lot further or if other prices start to climb because these tariffs, more people may feel empowered to speak out against this trade policy. FADEL: NPR's Scott Horsley.

But if we do start to see a lot of layoffs as these tariffs kick in, then that balancing act could change. FADEL: Could there be some economic benefits of the trade war if it brings other countries to the negotiating table? HORSLEY: Yeah, we'll have to wait and see. There is some truth to the president's complaint about other countries making it hard for the U.S. to tap into their markets. Although, in many cases, the tariffs that Trump is levying in response exaggerate the scale of those trade barriers. Supporters say the president is merely employing hardball negotiating tactics, but critics have a different view. Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, for example, describes Trump's tactics here as predatory, especially when tariffs are used to bully some of America's closest allies. LARRY SUMMERS: I think this is a moment, with all the threats in the world, when alliances are very important. And when we engage in the kind of threatening behavior we have engaged in, we make things much more dangerous in an already dangerous world. HORSLEY: Summers told me recently that he had been disappointed there was not more vocal pushback from businesses and political leaders unhappy with the president's approach. A lot of people have been cowed by Donald Trump. We have started to hear some of that pushback this week from people like JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon and hedge fund manager Bill Ackman. And if stock prices fall a lot further or if other prices start to climb because these tariffs, more people may feel empowered to speak out against this trade policy. FADEL: NPR's Scott Horsley.

FADEL: So if all of these tariffs do go into effect, what is that going to mean for businesses and shoppers in the U.S. and around the world? HORSLEY: It's likely to mean both higher prices and slower economic growth. We've seen a lot of forecasters warn that this could tip the United States into recession. Certainly, other countries that rely on exporting to the U.S. are looking at a big economic slowdown. That's why markets have nosedived all around the world in recent days and why investors are so desperate for any sign that maybe there's an off-ramp here. Now, Trump did have that phone call yesterday with Japan's prime minister. The head of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen says her side is willing to make a deal. But as things stand right now, products from the E.U. are going to be slapped with a 20% tariff tomorrow. Japanese goods are facing a 24% tariff, and imports from China could be looking at tariffs of over 100%. FADEL: Now, the president called on the Federal Reserve to cushion the fallout by lowering interest rates. How likely is that? HORSLEY: If we do fall into recession and see a spike in unemployment, the Fed will probably have to lower interest rates. But that's not where we are right now. In fact, the jobs report we got last week showed a stronger labor market than many forecasters had expected. And, of course, we're still not out of the woods on inflation. Prices are climbing faster than most people would like, and these high tariffs could push prices even higher. Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell warned he and his colleagues could end up caught in a tug of war between higher unemployment and higher inflation.

      "text": "UAW President Shawn Fain explains why he supports Trump's tariffs\n\nSteve Inskeep\n\nShawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers (UAW), during a campaign event with former U.S. Vice President Kamala Harris, in Flint, Mich., on Friday, Oct. 4, 2024. Bloomberg/Via Getty Images hide caption\n\nPresident Trump's announcements on tariffs have dismayed many of his erstwhile supporters on Wall Street. The suddenness - and steepness - of the tariffs announced last Wednesday prompted some global manufacturers to pause shipments to the U.S., and led economists to raise the odds of recession.\n\nBut an earlier set of tariffs still has the support of Shawn Fain, president of the United Auto Workers.\n\nFain supported Democrat Kamala Harris with a fiery convention speech in 2024, and opposes many of Trump's stances on union labor, but contends the president struck a blow that leaders of both parties have resisted for decades.\n\nFain represents nearly a million current and retired workers in multiple industries, of whom he estimates a few hundred thousand are now employed by the auto industry. It's a dramatic decline from the 1.5 million autoworkers alone the UAW represented in the mid-20th century.\n\nBelow are five key points Fain made.\n\nHe's not sure about all the tariffs but favors those for his industry.\n\nFain referred to last Wednesday's announcement of global tariffs as \"reckless,\" but firmly supports an earlier round of tariffs on the U.S. auto industry. Those tariffs both help and hurt U.S. auto companies, because they produce so much in Canada and Mexico. Auto parts typically cross the border multiple times as a car is assembled. GM has already said it will move some production back to Indiana - but Stellantis ordered layoffs.\n\nFor Fain, tariffs address a historic wrong. \"We've sat here for the last 30 plus years, with the inception of [the North American Free Trade Agreement] back in 1993-94, and watched our manufacturing base in this country disappear,\" he said.\n\nHe doesn't care much about the stock market's decline.\n\n\"You know, half of Americans don't even have stock,\" he said. (Some estimates say well over half of Americans own some stock.)\n\n\"Sixty percent of Americans have no retirement savings,\" he said. \"So when I hear all the crying about the stock market, this is just Wall Street. They're people that are already rich, and at the end of the day, most working class people are trying to survive right now. And it's infuriating that our livelihoods have been stripped from us for decades and no one's cared.\"\n\nHe acknowledges that tariffs may raise prices.\n\nMost economists have said that the cost of import taxes is passed on to consumers. Asked if that is good for the working class, Fain replied, \"Well, no, but that's a choice. This is the problem with our system. It's so upside down. The billionaire class and the corporate class, they always get their profits. They always take their cut, and they always pass anything bad on to consumers.\"\n\nFain nonetheless acknowledged that he sees tariffs as a way to prevent exceptionally low prices driven by cheap labor: \"The point of tariffs is to eliminate the race to the bottom where we're exploiting people.\"\n\nDespite the suddenness of Trump's move, he insists the auto industry can adjust.\n\nFain was calling from Warren, Mich., from which Stellantis recently shifted some production to Mexico. \"There's 2,000 workers that got laid off. They could put them back to work in a month and be building Ram trucks back there,\" he added.\n\nHe dismisses the idea that the disruption may not work out\n\nFain rejected Wall Street warnings of a recession, including one by a JP Morgan economist.\n\n\"Where was JPMorgan, all these people, when the companies were jacking up prices and price gouging the last three and four years?\" he said. \"Where was their outcry then? As long as the stock market's doing good, that's all they care about.\"\n\nHe also minimized an idea advanced by many economists: that any factories \"reshored\" to the U.S. are likely to be highly automated, because of the advances in robotics and the high cost of labor. He said such factories would at least require \"skilled trade jobs which are even better paying jobs. We just have to train people.\"\n\n\"The sad reality of this is [the idea that] it's a bad thing that we put manufacturing back in this country because labor is expensive. That is pathetic. I believe it was one of the former presidents [who] said, I pity the businessman that wants to make a coat so cheap that the person making the coat will starve in the process. I mean, that is sad,\" Fain said.\n\nThe audio version of this interview was produced by Mansee Khurana and edited by Arezou Rezvani.

Andrew Harnik/Getty Images hide caption\n\nMost days this year, in courtrooms all over the country, the Justice Department has been busy defending President Trump's executive actions.\n\nBut in many of those cases, the government's own lawyers have been struggling to answer questions and having to correct the record. It's a function of how aggressively Trump has moved so far - and how the attorneys have been having a hard time keeping up.\n\n\"There have been over 130 lawsuits that have been filed in the past two months and that would be an extraordinary amount of litigation for DOJ to defend even if it were fully staffed, which it is not,\" said Kelsi Brown Corkran, who spent six years at the Justice Department. \"It is far from it.\"\n\nBy some accounts, the unit inside DOJ that defends the federal government has lost more than a third of its lawyers this year. Top Justice officials have posted hiring notices on LinkedIn for some of those jobs, even as the department fired or transferred other senior lawyers.\n\n\"It's sort of well-known that when Trump came into office there were a number of people at DOJ who decided to step down and even those who perhaps didn't choose to step down were nudged out, as they might say, so I think they were dealing with fewer people willing to help with these cases,\" said Josh Blackman, a professor at the South Texas College of Law in Houston.\n\nThat tight squeeze is leading to some mistakes. Last month, there was a typo on the first page of an appeals court brief signed by the attorney general and other senior officials.\n\nRyan Goodman, of New York University's law school, said he has a bigger concern: that DOJ lawyers are unable or unwilling to answer questions from judges.\n\n\"The Justice Department is fast losing credibility before the courts,\" Goodman said.\n\nGoodman follows all these cases closely, starting with a challenge to Trump's order getting rid of birthright citizenship.\n\n\"The first one that had a hearing with a Reagan-appointed judge in Seattle, he actually said to the lawyers, 'Where were the lawyers in the room when you did this?'\" Goodman said, loosely citing court transcripts.\n\nThat birthright citizenship order clashes with the 14th Amendment to the Constitution and a separate statute. And, Goodman said, the judge wanted to know who signed off that the order was legal.\n\nThe Justice Department office that usually does that review largely has been sidelined this year.\n\nFederal judges also have had lots of questions about who's running DOGE , the Department of Government Efficiency team tied to Elon Musk, that's been slashing federal agencies. One DOJ lawyer told a judge they didn't know.\n\n\"It's not just, like, a fact, it's not a small detail,\" said Goodman. \"It is a knowable fact. And to me that either suggests bad faith on the part of the Department of Justice or, and I think more likely, that they're not in the loop.\"\n\nA DOJ spokesperson said in a written statement to NPR that \"vigorously defending President Trump's executive actions in federal court is a top priority for this Department of Justice.\"\n\nOn her first day in office, Attorney General Pamela Bondi exhorted federal prosecutors to provide \"zealous\" representation to their government clients. In years past, including the first Trump administration, DOJ career attorneys could ask their supervisors not to participate in certain cases, because of moral or personal concerns.\n\nBut Bondi's memo suggested such requests would no longer be accommodated and that lawyers could be subject to discipline or termination if they failed to advance \"good faith\" arguments.\n\nBlackman, who's a conservative lawyer, said every day brings a fire drill of emergency litigation in the courts.\n\n\"Usually, there are these fairly intricate interagency communications where people from different departments will meet and discuss what's sort of going on,\" Blackman said.\n\nBut that normal process seems not to be happening, partly because of so many executive orders and so many lawsuits.\n\nBlackman said it's not fair to blame DOJ lawyers for not having some of those details.\n\n\"These are sort of novel times,\" he said. \"And I think the government's lawyers are doing the best they can to deal with sort of this new paradigm that President Trump has brought in with his agenda, which is moving just very fast.\"\n\nBut in other cases, the Trump administration seems to be making a choice not to share information.\n\nTake the lawsuit about dozens of alleged Venezuelan gang members who were sent to a notorious prison in El Salvador last month.\n\nLawyers for DOJ said they didn't know when the planes took off, or when Trump signed that order. When the judge grew upset, the administration invoked the state secrets privilege to avoid answering the question.\n\n\"That's not attorneys who are unprepared,\" said Corkran, the former DOJ lawyer who now serves as the Supreme Court director at the Institute for Constitutional Advocacy and Protection at Georgetown. \"That's a strategic decision that the government has made not to divulge information.\"\n\nAnd that decision, she said, will be tested by the courts.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

These stories provide context for current developments and the history that led up to them.\n\nBy\n\nHadeel Al-Shalchi\n\n,\n\nAya Batrawy\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu meets with President Trump in the Oval Office of the White House, Feb. 4, in Washington, D.C. Evan Vucci/AP hide caption\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is in Washington for a second meeting since President Trump took office and as Israel's war in Gaza marks a year and a half. Netanyahu says he expects to discuss efforts to release Israeli hostages from Gaza, as well as new U.S. tariffs .\n\nThe Trump administration imposed 17% tariffs on Israel as part of new trade measures on goods from many countries.\n\nNetanyahu is facing pressure at home from former Israeli security chiefs, protesters and the families of hostages still held in Gaza to return to ceasefire negotiations, which his far-right coalition has resisted.\n\nDuring Netanyahu's last visit in February, Trump suggested the United States should take over the Gaza Strip, move Palestinians out and make it into a \"riviera of the Middle East.\"\n\nMonday's meeting with Trump comes on the 18-month mark since Israel's war in Gaza began, following the deadly Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas-led attack on Israel. Israel has ramped up its military offensive since ending two months of ceasefire. It has also enforced five weeks of a blockade on aid and goods into the Gaza Strip.\n\nHuman rights groups and the United Nations have criticized the blockade saying it violates international law.\n\nIsrael's government says it is seeking to increase pressure on Hamas to release all hostages and eventually eliminate the militant group.\n\nHamas' 2023 attack killed nearly 1,200 people in Israel and took 251 hostage, according to Israeli officials.\n\nIsrael's military response has killed more than 50,750 Palestinians in Gaza, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. On Monday, the territory's health authorities said more than 50 people were killed in the past 24 hours.\n\nIn one incident overnight, an Israeli airstrike targeted a tent where journalists were sheltering in the southern Gaza city of Khan Younis, killing two people and injuring nine others, according to health officials in Gaza.\n\nJournalist Alem-al Din al-Sadeq said a group had gathered overnight to eat together before the strike hit.\n\n\"I saw my colleague sitting on a chair engulfed in flames,\" he said. \"We had no water to put out the flames.\"\n\nThe Israeli military says it was targeting a member of Hamas who took part in the attack on Israel, but did not name the two people who were killed.\n\nIsrael also says it targeted an area of central Gaza from which rockets had been launched toward Israel on Sunday.\n\nMeanwhile, violence has also continued in the Israeli-occupied West Bank. A Palestinian U.S. citizen was killed by Israeli forces this weekend in the village of Turmus Ayya, according to Palestinian health officials there.\n\nThe Israeli military said it opened fire toward three people who were endangering drivers by hurling rocks at a highway in the village. It said forces killed one of them and injured two others.\n\nWest Bank health officials said that 14-year-old Palestinian American Amer Rabie was killed in that operation, and another U.S. citizen was injured.\n\nThe U.S. State Department has not commented.\n\nRabie is one of several U.S. citizens killed by Israeli forces in the West Bank.\n\nThe United Nations humanitarian office said last Israeli forces had killed almost 100 Palestinians in the West Bank this year.\n\nThis is a developing story and may be updated.\n\nAnas Baba contributed reporting from Gaza.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Andy Wong/AP hide caption\n\nBEIJING - China said on Tuesday it will not back down in the face of President Trump's fresh threat to impose an additional 50% tariff on Chinese imports, as the trade war between the world's top two economies intensifies.\n\nTrump said on Truth Social he would impose the new tariffs on China if Beijing did not retract a 34% retaliatory tariff on U.S. goods that it announced in response to Trump's initial salvo last Wednesday.\n\nIn a strongly worded statement , China's commerce ministry said the country \"will resolutely take countermeasures to safeguard its rights and interests.\"\n\n\"The U.S. tariff escalation threat against China compounds its mistake and further exposes its nature of blackmail, which China will never accept,\" the statement said. \"China will fight till the end if the U.S. side is bent on going down the wrong path.\"\n\nGlobal equity markets have been pummeled as recession fears have grown following Trump's \"Liberation Day\" announcement of tariffs that affect most countries across the world and most U.S. imports.\n\nOn Tuesday, however, Asian stocks took a breather, after heavy losses on Monday. Key indexes in Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea were up. In China, stocks rose too amid reports that state-backed investors known as \"the national team\" were on a buying spree to prop up the market.\n\nIf Trump follows through, the U.S. will have hit Chinese imports this year with combined new tariffs of 104%. Trump imposed 20% in tariffs in the first weeks of his presidency and then an additional 34% on Wednesday.\n\nAccording to the office of the U.S. Trade Representative , the U.S. imported $438.9 billion in goods from China last year, up 2.8% from 2023.\n\nGabriel Wildau, a managing director at the consultancy Teneo, said he expects Beijing to \"hunker down for a protracted economic war of attrition.\"\n\n\"This strategy of patient resistance is based on a conviction that seven years of efforts to reduce reliance on the U.S. has rendered China economically resilient to the trade war now underway,\" Wildau wrote in a note. \"China's leaders believe that over the long term, Trump is ill-equipped to withstand the political pressure that his tariff policies will generate.\"\n\nChina stands out in Asia for its willingness to go toe-to-toe with the United States. Leaders from other countries have decried the tariffs but avoided retaliation, opting instead to lean into the possibility of negotiations with Washington.\n\nTaiwan's President Lai Ching-te said on Monday that Taiwan \"has no plans to adopt retaliatory tariffs.\" He said Taiwan would seek to purchase more American products and lower nontariff barriers.\n\nHong Kong, which is part of China but considered a different trade jurisdiction, has not followed Beijing's lead with tariffs on U.S. goods. Major U.S. trading partners India, Japan and South Korea have also refrained from retaliatory measures.\n\nVietnam, which is being hit by one of the highest tariff rates, 46%, named a deputy prime minister as special envoy and sent him to the U.S. this week for talks. Hanoi has called for a delay in the implementation of tariffs, which are set to kick in on Wednesday, pending negotiations.\n\nThe European Commission, the EU's executive body, is among the few major U.S. trade partners openly considering countermeasures. At the same time, it has sought negotiations and offered to eliminate tariffs on industrial goods if the U.S. agrees to roll back its tariffs.\n\nOn Tuesday, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen had a call with Chinese Premier Li Qiang, the country's No. 2 leader.\n\nA statement from the commission said von der Leyen \"called for a negotiated resolution to the current situation, emphasizing the need to avoid further escalation.\"\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect official translations.\n\nAowen Cao contributed to this report.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Jackie Lay/NPR hide caption\n\nMany Americans are worried that their First Amendment right to free speech is fading.\n\nNPR's Morning Edition has talked to legal experts, activists, immigration lawyers, scientists, students, teachers and others over several weeks to understand why.\n\nOur series \"The State of the First Amendment: The Right From Which All Other Rights Flow\" will explore who felt censored before President Trump returned to office and who feels stifled now.\n\nOur reporting found that scientists are scrubbing reports and federal grant applications of words the Trump administration has banned . Some student activists are afraid that participating in protests could lead to deportation. Teachers are nervous about a new online portal where students or parents can file complaints about diversity, equity and inclusion lessons in class with the U.S. Department of Education.\n\n\"When students make connections to events in history that don't frame the current administration in a positive light and then ask questions, it gives me pause,\" says E., a high school history teacher, who asked NPR to use only her first initial for fear she could be reported for speaking out. \"I've had to hold back, sometimes changing the subject abruptly, telling them that I can't comment.\"\n\nTune in to NPR and visit NPR.org every day this week for in-depth stories on \"The State of the First Amendment: The Right From Which All Other Rights Flow.\"\n\nYet plenty of others - including anti-abortion activists, the far-right activist group Moms for Liberty and members of university Republican clubs - say they feel more free today to express views without fear of a backlash now that President Trump is back in office.\n\n\"We now have more members who are willing to help us publicize the club, attach their faces to the club, and be outwardly and openly conservative than we did before the election,\" says Miguel Muniz, president of the College Republicans at the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nFree speech ranked as the second most important issue for voters heading into the 2024 presidential election, ahead of crime, immigration and health care, according to a poll by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression taken a month before the election. Republicans were more likely to rate it \"very important\" and nearly half of Republican respondents said they spoke less freely under President Joe Biden than they did under President Trump.\n\nLoading...\n\nThat may be why soon after President Trump was sworn back into office, one of the first actions he took was to sign an executive order aimed at \"restoring freedom of speech and ending federal censorship.\"\n\nHis critics say his concern for free speech is only for speech his administration finds acceptable.\n\nYou can find all the stories in this series here .\n\nThe audio version of this story says that the Supreme Court last year rejected the claim that social media companies were pressured to take down posts about COVID-19 and the 2020 election. It should have noted that the court rejected the claim on procedural grounds but that the justices rejected a lower court's broad assertion that the companies made all of their decisions to take down posts about COVID-19 and the 2020 elections due to pressure by the government.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "The October Story That Outlined Exactly What the Trump Administration Would Do to the Federal Bureaucracy\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. This story was originally published in our Dispatches newsletter; sign up to receive notes from our journalists.\n\nIn late October, ProPublica published one of its most prophetic stories in our history. You can be forgiven if you missed it at the time. There was a lot going on in the days before the election, and the headlines were dominated by seemingly consequential issues like the racist humor of a comedian who addressed Donald Trump's rally at Madison Square Garden.\n\nBut if you weren't among the several hundred thousand people who read our story, \"' Put Them in Trauma': Inside a Key MAGA Leader's Plans for a New Trump Agenda ,\" in real time, you may have seen it referenced since Trump took office in January.\n\nThe story drew on private recordings of a series of speeches given in 2023 and 2024 by Russell Vought obtained by our colleagues at Documented , a news site with a remarkable knack for uncovering information powerful interests would prefer remained secret.\n\nVought, a self-described Christian nationalist who served as the director of the Office of Management and Budget in Trump's first term, was known for his provocative public pronouncements. But he went even further in private, envisaging a Trump presidency in which regulatory agencies would be shut down and career civil servants would be too depressed to get out of bed.\n\n\"We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,\" Vought said in one recording . \"When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can't do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so.\n\n\"We want to put them in trauma.\"\n\nVought spoke openly about the ongoing planning to defund independent federal agencies and demonize government scientists. \"We have detailed agency plans,\" he said. \"We are writing the actual executive orders. We are writing the actual regulations now, and we are sorting out the legal authorities for all of what President Trump is running on.\"\n\nVought argued that the radical steps were necessary because Trump's opponents were themselves attempting to end democracy. \"The stark reality in America is that we are in the late stages of a complete Marxist takeover of the country,\" he said in one speech. \"Our adversaries already hold the weapons of the government apparatus, and they have aimed it at us. And they are going to continue to aim it until they no longer have to win elections.\"\n\nIt's hard to imagine a more prescient piece of journalism. The story captured, as few did, the breadth and ferocity of the coming attack on the federal government. Vought has returned to his post as the budget office's director, and his plans for eviscerating entire agencies and decimating the morale of federal workers have turned into reality. Trump 47 looks very different from Trump 45, just as Vought told his audiences that it would.\n\nSo why didn't this story drive more of a national conversation when it appeared?\n\nAs a news organization that tries to spur change by bringing new facts to light, we think about this question a lot. Our job at ProPublica is to both get the story and get it into the heads of a critical mass of citizens and elected officials.\n\nI've been an investigative reporter and editor for nearly three decades, and I still struggle to predict which of our stories will catalyze national conversations. Our 2018 story about the recording of a young girl in a immigration detention center prompted the Trump administration to end its policy of family separation at the border. Many other powerful stories fail to break through.\n\nPart of the problem, of course, is the proliferation of media. Every day, dozens of important-sounding stories vie for readers' attention along with the flood of posts on social media and texts from friends and colleagues. And that's not to mention all the podcasts and multipart dramas on Netflix and HBO.\n\nThis was an issue long before Trump and his allies adopted a \"flood the zone\" strategy with multiple norm-challenging actions, but it seems even more acute right now.\n\nIt is often said of journalists that we write the rough draft of history. But our work differs from historians in a crucial aspect: Scholars typically are chronicling events after the outcome is clear. As journalists, we face a tougher challenge as we try to find the stories in the cacophony of daily events that tell us something about where we're going.\n\nA lot of what we do as reporters is akin to squinting through opaque windows at events unfolding in a very dimly lit room. We can see who is inside and how they're moving, but our lack of context often prevents us from understanding what's really happening. We default to assuming that the future will be roughly like the past, guessing that, say, Trump 47 will be roughly like Trump 45 with fewer guardrails.\n\nVought could not have been clearer that this was not the case, and he had the credentials that should have made what he was saying entirely credible. After all, Vought was the author of the plan in Trump's first term to make it easier to fire large numbers of civil servants. He was a key member of Project 2025, the Heritage Foundation project that described in copious detail how a second Trump administration might unfold.\n\nStill, there was at least one data point that perhaps prevented readers from viewing his speeches as predictive as they turned out to be. As our story made clear, Vought despises the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies, a core Republican ally in bringing conservative voices into the judiciary and federal law enforcement. We quoted him as asserting that \"the vaunted so-called Federalist Society and originalist judges\" were serving as a \"Praetorian Guard\" for the Democrats.\n\nThat view would seem to make him something of a fringe thinker in MAGA world, which relied on the Federalist Society to pick the judges who make up the conservative supermajority on the high court.\n\nThings look different today. Seen against the backdrop of recent events, Vought's disdain for the rule-of-law scruples of Federalist Society legal thinkers seems entirely in line with Trump's recent post suggesting a federal judge shouldn't have authority over his administration.\n\nRead More\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Danielle Sassoon, one of the Federalist Society's bright lights, a Yale Law graduate who had clerked for conservative icon Antonin Scalia, resigned as acting U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York rather than carry out orders from the Trump Justice Department. In refusing to drop the corruption case against New York Mayor Eric Adams, Sassoon wrote that she understood her duty as a prosecutor to mean \"enforcing the law impartially, and that includes prosecuting a validly returned indictment regardless of whether its dismissal would be politically advantageous, to the defendant or those that appointed me.\"\n\nMany years ago, a New York Times investigative reporter and I were discussing a story we had worked on that had been sharply and justifiably criticized as new facts emerged. \"I can be fair and accurate,\" he said. \"But fair, accurate and prescient is beyond me.\"\n\nIt seems appropriate to give Vought the last word since the worldview he described has proven so accurate. What sounded grandiose in the preelection days seems today like a reasonable summary of the path Trump and his allies have chosen.\n\n\"We are here in the year of 2024, a year that very well [could] - and I believe it will - rival 1776 and 1860 for the complexity and the uncertainty of the forces arrayed against us,\" Vought said, citing the years when the colonies declared independence from Britain and the first state seceded over President Abraham Lincoln's election.\n\n\"God put us here for such a time as this.\"\n\nI'm not sure about the role of the almighty in ProPublica's work in the coming years.

      "text": "Trump Says He'll Fight for Working-Class Americans. His First Presidency Suggests He Won't.\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nWhen Donald Trump was president, he repeatedly tried to raise the rent on at least 4 million of the poorest people in this country, many of them elderly or disabled. He proposed to cut the federal disability benefits of a quarter-million low-income children , on the grounds that someone else in their family was already receiving benefits. He attempted to put in place a requirement that poor parents cooperate with child support enforcement , including by having single mothers disclose their sexual histories , before they and their children could receive food assistance.\n\nHe tried to enact a rule allowing employers to pocket workers' tips. And he did enact a rule denying overtime pay to millions of low-wage workers if they made more than $35,568 a year.\n\nTrump and his vice presidential pick JD Vance have been running a campaign that they say puts the working class first, vowing to protect everyday Americans from an influx of immigrant labor , to return manufacturing jobs to the U.S., to support rural areas and families with children and, generally, to stick it to the elites.\n\nCritics reply by citing Project 2025, a potential blueprint for a second Trump presidency that proposes deep cuts to the social safety net for lower-income families alongside more large tax breaks for the wealthy. But Trump, despite his clear ties to its authors, has said that Project 2025 doesn't represent him.\n\nStill, his views on working-class and poor people can be found in specific actions that he tried to take when, as president, he had the power to make public policy.\n\nProPublica reviewed Trump's proposed budgets from 2018 to 2021, as well as regulations that he attempted to enact or revise via his cabinet agencies, including the departments of Labor, Housing and Urban Development, and Health and Human Services, and also quasi-independent agencies like the National Labor Relations Board and the Social Security Administration.\n\nWe found that while Trump was in the White House, he advanced an agenda across his administration that was designed to cut health care, food and housing programs and labor protections for poor and working-class Americans.\n\n\"Trump proposed significantly deeper cuts to programs for low- and modest-income people than any other president ever has, including Reagan, by far,\" said Robert Greenstein, a longtime federal poverty policy expert who recently published a paper for the Brookings Institution on Trump's first-term budgets.\n\nNo matter who wins the presidential election,  ProPublica is planning to deepen its reporting on poverty issues, from housing to child support to Social Security benefits and Medicaid. We will be covering how the incoming administration handles federal poverty policy, as well as state and local social services agencies and private companies that profit off of the poor. Are you a current or former federal employee with insight into federal poverty programs? Are you someone with stories to pitch us on any of these topics? Reach out directly at [email protected] .\n\nTrump was stymied in reaching many of these goals largely because he was inefficient about pursuing them until the second half of his term. According to reporters covering him at the time, he'd been unprepared to win the presidency in 2016, let alone to fill key positions and develop a legislative and regulatory strategy on poverty issues.\n\nHe did have control of both the House and Senate during his first two years in office, but he used his only shots at budget reconciliation (annual budget bills that can't be filibustered by the opposing party) to cut taxes for the rich and to try to repeal Obamacare. By 2019, there wasn't much time left for his cabinet agencies to develop new regulations, get them through the long federal rulemaking process and deal with any legal challenges.\n\nTrump and his allies appear focused on not repeating such mistakes should he win the White House again. Republican leaders in Congress have said that this time, if they retake majorities in both chambers, they'll use their reconciliation bills to combine renewed tax cuts with aggressive cuts to social spending. Meanwhile, Trump would likely put forward new regulations earlier in his term, in part so that legal challenges to them get a chance to be heard before a Supreme Court with a solid conservative majority he created.\n\nIf he relies on his first-term proposals, that would mean:\n\nTrump also never gave up on his goal of dismantling the Affordable Care Act, which disproportionately serves lower-income Americans. He cut in half the open-enrollment windows during which people can sign up for health insurance under the ACA, and he cut over 80% of the funding for efforts to help lower-income people and others navigate the system. This especially affected those with special needs or who have limited access to or comfort with the internet.\n\nAs a result of these and other changes , the number of uninsured people in the U.S. increased in 2017 for the first time since the law was enacted, then increased again in 2018 and in 2019. By that year, 2.3 million fewer Americans had health insurance than when Trump came into power, including 700,000 fewer children.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has reversed many of these changes. But Trump could reverse them back, especially if he has majorities in Congress.\n\nPerhaps the main thing that Trump did with his administrative power during his first term - that he openly wants to do more of - is reduce the civil service, meaning the nonpolitical federal employees whom he collectively calls \"the Deep State.\"\n\nThis, too, would have a disproportionately negative impact on programs serving poor and working Americans. Agencies like the Social Security Administration and the Department of Housing and Urban Development, which provide disability and survivor benefits and housing assistance to lower-income families in times of need, rely heavily on midlevel staff in Washington, D.C., and local offices to process claims and get help to people.\n\nTrump campaign national press secretary Karoline Leavitt did not respond to a detailed list of questions from ProPublica about whether Trump wants to distance himself from his first-term record on issues affecting working-class people or whether his second-term agenda would be different.\n\nInstead, she focused on Social Security and Medicare, saying that Trump protected those programs in his first term and would do so again . \"By unleashing American energy, slashing job-killing regulations, and adopting pro-growth America First tax and trade policies, President Trump will quickly rebuild the greatest economy in history,\" Leavitt said.\n\nOne new ostensibly pro-worker policy that Trump, as well as his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris, have proposed: ending taxes on tips.\n\nTrump officials and Republican politicians have long said that more federal spending on safety net programs is not the solution to poverty and that poor people need to be less dependent on government aid and exercise more personal responsibility.\n\nAnd working-class voters - especially white men without a college degree who feel that their economic standing has diminished relative to other demographic groups - have joined the Trump movement in increasing numbers. What's more, some counties that have seen large upticks in food stamp usage in recent years continue to vote for him , despite his attempts to shrink that program and others that people in these places rely on. (All that said, Trump's supporters are better off on average than the media often portrays them to be .)\n\nMeanwhile, pandemic relief, including stimulus checks , did start during the Trump administration and helped reduce poverty rates. But those efforts were temporary responses to a crisis and were mostly proposed by Democrats in Congress ; they were hardly part of Trump's governing agenda.\n\nAmid a presidential race that has at times focused on forgotten, high-poverty communities - with Vance repeatedly touting his Appalachian-adjacent roots - it is surprising that journalists haven't applied more scrutiny to Trump's first-term budgets and proposals on these issues, said Greenstein, the poverty policy expert.\n\nRead More\n\nWould Trump, given a second term, continue the Biden administration's efforts to make sure that the IRS isn't disproportionately auditing the taxes of poor people ? Would he defend Biden's reforms to welfare , aimed at making sure that states actually use welfare money to help lower-income families?\n\nTrump hasn't faced many of these questions on the campaign trail or in debates or interviews, as the candidates and reporters covering them tend to focus more on the middle class.\n\nFiled under -\n\nI'm a ProPublica reporter who writes about issues affecting poor and working-class people across the country.\n\nI'm interested in hearing from current and former insiders at federal agencies that administer anti-poverty programs, as well as working-class people of all stripes about how their lives are changing.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "\"Put Them in Trauma\": Inside a Key MAGA Leader's Plans for a New Trump Agenda\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nWe are still reporting. Do you have any information about the Office of Management and Budget or Russell Vought? You can reach Andy Kroll on Signal at 202-215-6203.\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nA key ally to former President Donald Trump detailed plans to deploy the military in response to domestic unrest, defund the Environmental Protection Agency and put career civil servants \"in trauma\" in a series of previously unreported speeches that provide a sweeping vision for a second Trump term.\n\nIn private speeches delivered in 2023 and 2024, Russell Vought, who served as Trump's director of the Office of Management and Budget, described his work crafting legal justifications so that military leaders or government lawyers would not stop Trump's executive actions.\n\nHe said the plans are a response to a \"Marxist takeover\" of the country; likened the moment to 1776 and 1860, when the country was at war or on the brink of it; and said the timing of Trump's candidacy was a \"gift of God.\"\n\n\"Their Entire Apparatus Is Exposed to Our Strategy\"\n\nProPublica and Documented obtained videos of the two speeches Vought delivered during events for the Center for Renewing America, a pro-Trump think tank led by Vought. The think tank's employees or fellows include Jeffrey Clark, the former senior Justice Department lawyer who aided Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election result; Ken Cuccinelli, a former acting deputy secretary in the Department of Homeland Security under Trump; and Mark Paoletta, a former senior budget official in the Trump administration. Other Trump allies such as former White House adviser Steve Bannon and U.S. Reps. Chip Roy and Scott Perry either spoke at the conferences or appeared on promotional materials for the events.\n\nVought does not hide his agenda or shy away from using extreme rhetoric in public. But the apocalyptic tone and hard-line policy prescriptions in the two private speeches go further than his earlier pronouncements. As OMB director, Vought sought to use Trump's 2020 \"Schedule F\" executive order to strip away job protections for nonpartisan government workers. But he has never spoken in such pointed terms about demoralizing federal workers to the point that they don't want to do their jobs. He has spoken in broad terms about undercutting independent agencies but never spelled out sweeping plans to defund the EPA and other federal agencies.\n\nVought's plans track closely with Trump's campaign rhetoric about using the military against domestic protesters or what Trump has called the \"enemy within.\" Trump's desire to use the military on U.S. soil recently prompted his longest-serving chief of staff, retired Marine Gen. John Kelly, to speak out , saying Trump \"certainly prefers the dictator approach to government.\"\n\nOther policies mentioned by Vought dovetail with Trump's plans, such as embracing a wartime footing on the southern border and rolling back transgender rights. Agenda 47, the campaign's policy blueprint, calls for revoking President Joe Biden's order expanding gender-affirming care for transgender people; Vought uses even more extreme language, decrying the \"transgender sewage that's being pumped into our schools and institutions\" and referring to gender-affirming care as \"chemical castration.\"\n\nSince leaving government, Vought has reportedly remained a close ally of the former president. Speaking in July to undercover journalists posing as relatives of a potential donor, Vought said Trump had \"blessed\" the Center for Renewing America and was \"very supportive of what we do,\" CNN reported .\n\nVought did not respond to requests for comment.\n\n\"Since the Fall of 2023, President Trump's campaign made it clear that only President Trump and the campaign, and NOT any other organization or former staff, represent policies for the second term,\" Danielle Alvarez, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, said in a statement. She did not directly address Vought's statements.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, his campaign's national press secretary, added there have been no discussions on who would serve in a second Trump administration.\n\nIn addition to running his think tank, Vought was the policy director of the Republican National Committee's official platform committee ahead of the nominating convention. He's also an architect of Project 2025, the controversial coalition effort mapping out how a second Trump administration can quickly eliminate obstacles to rolling out a hard-right policy agenda.\n\nAs ProPublica and Documented reported, Project 2025 has launched a massive program to recruit, vet and train thousands of people to \"be ready on day one\" to serve in a future conservative administration. (Trump has repeatedly criticized Project 2025, and his top aides have said the effort has no connection to the official campaign despite the dozens of former Trump aides and advisers who contributed to Project 2025.)\n\nVought is widely expected to take a high-level government role if Trump wins a second term. His name has even been mentioned as a potential White House chief of staff . The videos obtained by ProPublica and Documented offer an unfiltered look at Vought's worldview, his plans for a Trump administration and his fusing of MAGA ideology and Christian nationalism .\n\nIn his 2024 speech, Vought said he was spending the majority of his time helping lead Project 2025 and drafting an agenda for a future Trump presidency. \"We have detailed agency plans,\" he said. \"We are writing the actual executive orders. We are writing the actual regulations now, and we are sorting out the legal authorities for all of what President Trump is running on.\"\n\nVought laid out how his think tank is crafting the legal rationale for invoking the Insurrection Act, a law that gives the president broad power to use the military for domestic law enforcement. The Washington Post previously reported the issue was at the top of the Center for Renewing America's priorities.\n\n\"We want to be able to shut down the riots and not have the legal community or the defense community come in and say, 'That's an inappropriate use of what you're trying to do,'\" he said. Vought held up the summer 2020 unrest following George Floyd's murder as an example of when Trump ought to have had the ability to deploy the armed forces but was stymied .\n\nVought's preparations for a future Trump administration involve building a \"shadow\" Office of Legal Counsel, he told the gathered supporters in May 2023. That office, part of the Justice Department, advises the president on the scope of their powers. Vought made clear he wants the office to help Trump steamroll the kind of internal opposition he faced in his first term.\n\n\"We're Trying to Build a Shadow Office of Legal Counsel\"\n\nHistorically, the OLC has operated with a degree of independence. \"If, all of a sudden, the office is full of a bunch of loyalists whose only job is to rubber-stamp the White House's latest policy directive, whose only goal is to justify the ends by whatever means, that would be quite dangerous,\" said an attorney who worked in the office under a previous Republican administration and requested anonymity to speak freely.\n\nAnother priority, according to Vought, was to \"defund\" certain independent federal agencies and demonize career civil servants, which include scientists and subject matter experts. Project 2025's plan to revive Schedule F, an attempt to make it easier to fire a large swath of government workers who currently have civil service protections, aligns with Vought's vision.\n\n\"We want the bureaucrats to be traumatically affected,\" he said. \"When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can't do all of the rules against our energy industry because they have no bandwidth financially to do so.\n\n\"We want to put them in trauma.\"\n\n\"We Want the Bureaucrats to Be Traumatically Affected\"\n\nVought also revealed the extent of the Center for Renewing America's role in whipping up right-wing panic ahead of the 2022 midterms over an increase in asylum-seekers crossing at the U.S.-Mexico border.\n\nIn February 2022, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich released a legal opinion claiming the state was under \"invasion\" by violent cartels and could invoke war powers to deploy National Guard troops to its southern border. The legally dubious \"invasion\" theory became a potent Republican talking point.\n\nVought said in the 2023 speech that he and Cuccinelli, the former top Homeland Security official for Trump, personally lobbied Brnovich on the effort. \"We said, 'Look, you can write your own opinion, but here's a draft opinion of what this should look like,'\" Vought said.\n\nThe nonpartisan watchdog group American Oversight later obtained an email in which Vought pitched the \"invasion\" framework to Brnovich.\n\nBrnovich wrote in an email to ProPublica that he recalled multiple discussions with Cuccinelli about border security. But he added that \"the invasion opinion was the result of a formal request from a member of the Arizona legislature. And I can assure you it was drafted and written by hard working attorneys (including myself) in our office.\"\n\nIn the event Trump loses, Vought called for Republican leaders of states such as Florida and Texas to \"create red-state sanctuaries\" by \"kicking out all the feds as much as they possibly can.\"\n\nThe two speeches delivered by Vought, taken together, offer an unvarnished look at the animating ideology and political worldview of a key figure in the MAGA movement.\n\nOver the last century, Vought said, the U.S. has \"experienced nothing short of a quiet revolution\" and abandoned what he saw as the true meaning and force of the Constitution. The country today, he argued, was a \"post-constitutional regime,\" one that no longer adhered to the separation of powers among the three branches of government as laid out by the framers.\n\nHe lamented that the conservative right and the nation writ large had become \"too secular\" and \"too globalist.\" He urged his allies to join his mission to \"renew a consensus of America as a nation under God.\"\n\nAnd in one of his most dramatic flourishes, he likened the 2024 election to moments in America's history when the country was facing all-out war.\n\n\"We are here in the year of 2024, a year that very well [could] - and I believe it will - rival 1776 and 1860 for the complexity and the uncertainty of the forces arrayed against us,\" Vought told his audience, referring to years when the colonies declared independence from Britain and the first state seceded over President Abraham Lincoln's election. \"God put us here for such a time as this.\"\n\nVought said that independent agencies and unelected bureaucrats and experts wield far too much power while the traditional legislative process is a sham. He extended that critique to agencies like the Department of Justice and the Federal Reserve, whose independence from the White House had long been protected by both political parties.\n\n\"The left in the U.S. doesn't want an energetic president with the power to motivate the executive branch to the will of the American people consistent with the laws of the country,\" he said in the 2024 speech. \"They don't want a vibrant Congress where great questions are debated and decided in front of the American people. They don't want empowered members. They want discouraged and bored backbenchers.\"\n\nHe added, \"The all-empowered career expert like Tony Fauci is their model, wielding power behind the curtains.\" Fauci was one of the top public health experts under Trump at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic and a key figure in coordinating the national response.\n\nWhat sets Vought apart from most of his fellow conservative activists is that he accuses powerful organizations on the right of being complicit in the current system of government, singling out the Federalist Society for Law and Public Policy Studies, the conservative and libertarian legal network co-chaired by activist Leonard Leo. The society is widely seen as an instrumental force in cultivating young conservative lawyers and building a bench of future judges whose embrace of legal theories like originalism and textualism have led to decisions overturning abortion rights, environmental protections and social welfare policies.\n\nYet in his 2024 speech, Vought accused the Federalist Society and \"originalist judges\" of being a part of the problem, perpetuating the \"post-constitutional structure\" that Vought lamented by not ruling more aggressively to weaken or dismantle independent regulatory agencies that Vought and his allies view as illegitimate or unconstitutional.\n\nIt was \"like being in a contract quietly revoked two decades ago, in which one party didn't tell the other,\" he said. \"At some point, reality needs to set in. Instead, we have the vaunted so-called Federalist Society and originalist judges acting as a Praetorian Guard for this post-constitutional structure.\"\n\nEchoing Trump's rhetoric, Vought implicitly endorsed the false claim of a stolen 2020 election and likened the media's debunkings of that claim to Chinese Communist propaganda.\n\n\"In the aftermath of the election, we had all these people going around saying, 'Well, I don't see any evidence of voter fraud. The media's not giving enough [of] a compelling case,'\" he said. \"Well, that compelling case has emerged. But does a Christian in China ask and come away saying, 'You know, there's no persecution, because I haven't read about it in the state regime press?' No, they don't.\"\n\n\"A Compelling Case\"\n\nVought referred to the people detained for alleged crimes committed on Jan. 6, 2021, as \"political prisoners\" and defended the lawyers Jeffrey Clark and John Eastman, who have both faced criminal charges for their role in Trump's attempts to overturn the 2020 election. Federal law enforcement agencies, he added, \"are keeping political opponents in jail, and I think we need to be honest about that.\"\n\nThe left, Vought continued, has the ultimate goal of ending representative democracy altogether. \"The stark reality in America is that we are in the late stages of a complete Marxist takeover of the country,\" he said, \"in which our adversaries already hold the weapons of the government apparatus, and they have aimed it at us. And they are going to continue to aim it until they no longer have to win elections.\"\n\nWhen Democrats called Trump an \"existential threat to democracy,\" they were not merely calling for his defeat at the ballot box, he said, but were using \"coded language the national security state uses overseas when they are overthrowing other governments\" to discourage the military from putting down anti-Trump protests should he win.\n\n\"They're making Trump out to be a would-be dictator or an authoritarian,\" he said. \"So they're actively working now to ensure, on a number of levels, that the military will perceive this as dictatorial and therefore not respond to any orders to quell any violence.\"\n\nRead More\n\nTrump, Vought insisted, has the credibility and the track record to defeat the \"Marxist\" left and bring about the changes that Vought and his MAGA allies seek. In his view, the Democratic Party's agenda and its \"quiet revolution\" could be stopped only by a \"radical constitutionalist,\" someone in the mold of Thomas Jefferson or James Madison. For Vought, no one was in a better position to fill that role than Trump.\n\n\"We have in Donald Trump a man who is so uniquely positioned to serve this role, a man whose own interests perfectly align with the interests of the country,\" Vought said. \"He has seen what it has done to him, and he has seen what they are trying to do to the country.\n\n\"That,\" he added, \"is nothing more than a gift of God.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nMolly Redden is a ProPublica reporter covering politics.\n\nI cover justice and the rule of law, including the Justice Department, U.S. attorneys and the courts.\n\nSend me tips and documents about changes in administration policy, political interference, conflicts of interest and abuses of power inside the DOJ, OMB, the White House and other law enforcement agencies.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "How Trump Plans to Seize the Power of the Purse From Congress\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nDonald Trump is entering his second term with vows to cut a vast array of government services and a radical plan to do so. Rather than relying on his party's control of Congress to trim the budget, Trump and his advisers intend to test an obscure legal theory holding that presidents have sweeping power to withhold funding from programs they dislike.\n\n\"We can simply choke off the money,\" Trump said in a 2023 campaign video . \"For 200 years under our system of government, it was undisputed that the president had the constitutional power to stop unnecessary spending.\"\n\nHis plan, known as \"impoundment,\" threatens to provoke a major clash over the limits of the president's control over the budget. The Constitution gives Congress the sole authority to appropriate the federal budget, while the role of the executive branch is to dole out the money effectively. But Trump and his advisers are asserting that a president can unilaterally ignore Congress' spending decisions and \"impound\" funds if he opposes them or deems them wasteful.\n\nTrump's designs on the budget are part of his administration's larger plan to consolidate as much power in the executive branch as possible. This month, he pressured the Senate to go into recess so he could appoint his cabinet without any oversight. (So far, Republicans who control the chamber have not agreed to do so.) His key advisers have spelled out plans to bring independent agencies, such as the Department of Justice, under political control.\n\nIf Trump were to assert a power to kill congressionally approved programs, it would almost certainly tee up a fight in the federal courts and Congress and, experts say, could fundamentally alter Congress' bedrock power.\n\n\"It's an effort to wrest the entire power of the purse away from Congress, and that is just not the constitutional design,\" said Eloise Pasachoff, a Georgetown Law professor who has written about the federal budget and appropriations process. \"The president doesn't have the authority to go into the budget bit by bit and pull out the stuff he doesn't like.\"\n\nTrump's claim to have impoundment power contravenes a Nixon-era law that forbids presidents from blocking spending over policy disagreements as well as a string of federal court rulings that prevent presidents from refusing to spend money unless Congress grants them the flexibility.\n\nIn an op-ed published Wednesday , tech billionaire Elon Musk and former Republican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy, who are overseeing the newly created, nongovernmental Department of Government Efficiency, wrote that they planned to slash federal spending and fire civil servants. Some of their efforts could offer Trump his first Supreme Court test of the post-Watergate Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 1974, which requires the president to spend the money Congress approves. The law allows exceptions, such as when the executive branch can achieve Congress' goals by spending less, but not as a means for the president to kill programs he opposes.\n\nTrump and his aides have been telegraphing his plans for a hostile takeover of the budgeting process for months. Trump has decried the 1974 law as \"not a very good act\" in his campaign video and said, \"Bringing back impoundment will give us a crucial tool with which to obliterate the Deep State.\"\n\nMusk and Ramaswamy have seized that mantle, writing, \"We believe the current Supreme Court would likely side with him on this question.\"\n\nDo you work in the federal government? We want to hear from you if critical programs at your agency are being cut or halted. Learn how to contact ProPublica reporters securely.\n\nThe once-obscure debate over impoundment has come into vogue in MAGA circles thanks to veterans of Trump's first administration who remain his close allies. Russell Vought, Trump's former budget director, and Mark Paoletta, who served under Vought as the Office of Management and Budget general counsel, have worked to popularize the idea from the Trump-aligned think tank Vought founded, the Center for Renewing America.\n\nOn Friday, Trump announced he had picked Vought to lead OMB again. \"Russ knows exactly how to dismantle the Deep State and end Weaponized Government, and he will help us return Self Governance to the People,\" Trump said in a statement.\n\nVought was also a top architect of the controversial Project 2025. In private remarks to a gathering of MAGA luminaries uncovered by ProPublica , Vought boasted that he was assembling a \"shadow\" Office of Legal Counsel so that Trump is armed on day one with the legal rationalizations to realize his agenda.\n\n\"I don't want President Trump having to lose a moment of time having fights in the Oval Office about whether something is legal or doable or moral,\" Vought said.\n\nTrump spokespeople and Vought did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe prospect of Trump seizing vast control over federal spending is not merely about reducing the size of the federal government, a long-standing conservative goal. It is also fueling new fears about his promises of vengeance.\n\nA similar power grab led to his first impeachment. During his first term, Trump held up nearly $400 million in military aid to Ukraine while he pressured President Volodymyr Zelenskyy to open a corruption investigation into Joe Biden and his family. The U.S. Government Accountability Office later ruled his actions violated the Impoundment Control Act .\n\nPasachoff predicted that, when advantageous, the incoming Trump administration will attempt to achieve the goals of impoundment without picking such a high-profile fight.\n\nTrump tested piecemeal ways beyond the Ukrainian arms imbroglio to withhold federal funding as a means to punish his perceived enemies, said Bobby Kogan, a former OMB adviser under Biden and the senior director of federal budget policy at the left-leaning think tank American Progress. After devastating wildfires in California and Washington, Trump delayed or refused to sign disaster declarations that would have unlocked federal relief aid because neither state had voted for him . He targeted so-called sanctuary cities by conditioning federal grants on local law enforcement's willingness to cooperate with mass deportation efforts. The Biden administration eventually withdrew the policy.\n\nTrump and his aides claim there is a long presidential history of impoundment dating back to Thomas Jefferson.\n\nMost historical examples involve the military and cases where Congress had explicitly given presidents permission to use discretion, said Zachary Price, a professor at the University of California College of the Law, San Francisco. Jefferson, for example, decided not to spend money Congress had appropriated for gun boats - a decision the law, which appropriated money for \"a number not exceeding fifteen gun boats\" using \"a sum not exceeding fifty thousand dollars,\" authorized him to make.\n\nPresident Richard Nixon took impoundment to a new extreme, wielding the concept to gut billions of dollars from programs he simply opposed, such as highway improvements, water treatment, drug rehabilitation and disaster relief for farmers. He faced overwhelming pushback both from Congress and in the courts. More than a half dozen federal judges and the Supreme Court ultimately ruled that the appropriations bills at issue did not give Nixon the flexibility to cut individual programs.\n\nVought and his allies argue the limits Congress placed in 1974 are unconstitutional, saying a clause in the Constitution obligating the president to \"faithfully execute\" the law also implies his power to forbid its enforcement. (Trump is fond of describing Article II, where this clause lives, as giving him \"the right to do whatever I want as president.\")\n\nThe Supreme Court has never directly weighed in on whether impoundment is constitutional. But it threw water on that reasoning in an 1838 case, Kendall v. U.S. , about a federal debt payment.\n\nRead More\n\n\"To contend that the obligation imposed on the President to see the laws faithfully executed, implies a power to forbid their execution, is a novel construction of the constitution, and entirely inadmissible,\" the justices wrote.\n\nDuring his cutting spree, Nixon's own Justice Department argued roughly the same.\n\n\"With respect to the suggestion that the President has a constitutional power to decline to spend appropriated funds,\" William Rehnquist, the head of the Office of Legal Counsel whom Nixon later appointed to the Supreme Court, warned in a 1969 legal memo, \"we must conclude that existence of such a broad power is supported by neither reason nor precedent.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nMolly Redden is a ProPublica reporter covering politics.\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

      "text": "The Globetrotting Con Man and Suspected Spy Who Met With President Trump\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThis is part two of an investigation into a revolutionary money laundering system involving Chinese organized crime, Latin American drug cartels and Chinese officials, and how a major figure in the scheme managed to meet former President Donald Trump. Read part one: \" How a Chinese American Gangster Transformed Money Laundering for Drug Cartels .\"\n\nIn July 2018, President Donald Trump met at his New Jersey golf club with a Chinese businessman who should have never gotten anywhere near the most powerful man in the world.\n\nTao Liu had recently rented a luxurious apartment in Trump Tower in New York and boasted of joining the exclusive Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey.\n\nBut Liu was also a fugitive from Chinese justice. Media reports published overseas three years before the meeting had described him as the mastermind of a conspiracy that defrauded thousands of investors. He had ties to Chinese and Latin American organized crime. Perhaps most worrisome, the FBI was monitoring him because of suspicions that he was working with Chinese spies on a covert operation to buy access to U.S. political figures.\n\nYet there he sat with Trump at a table covered with sandwiches and soft drinks, the tall windows behind them looking onto a green landscape.\n\nA longtime Trump associate who accompanied Liu was vague about what was discussed, telling ProPublica that they talked about the golf club, among other things.\n\n\"He was a climber,\" said the associate, Joseph Cinque. \"He wanted to meet Trump. He wanted to meet high rollers, people of importance.\"\n\nDocumented by photos and interviews, the previously unreported sit-down reveals the workings of a Chinese underworld where crime, business, politics and espionage blur together. It also raises new questions about whether the Trump administration weakened the government's system for protecting the president against national security risks.\n\nFor years, Liu had caromed around the globe a step ahead of the law. He changed names, homes and scams the way most people change shoes. In Mexico, he befriended a Chinese American gangster named Xizhi Li, aiding Li's rise as a top cartel money launderer, according to prosecution documents and interviews with former national security officials.\n\nRead More\n\n\"I've been doing illegal business for over 10 years,\" Liu said in a conversation recorded by the Drug Enforcement Administration in 2020. \"Which country haven't I done it in?\"\n\nLiu surfaced in the U.S. political scene after Trump took office. In early 2018, he launched a high-rolling quest for influence in New York. He courted political figures at gatherings fueled by Taittinger champagne and Macanudo cigars, at meals in Michelin-starred restaurants and in offices in Rockefeller Center. He may have made at least one illegal donation to the GOP, according to interviews.\n\nBy the summer, Liu had achieved his fervent goal of meeting Trump. Two months later, he met the president again at Bedminster.\n\nOn both occasions, Liu apparently found a loophole in a phalanx of defenses designed to protect the president. The Secret Service screens all presidential visitors on official business, subjecting foreigners to intense scrutiny. In addition to their top priority of detecting physical threats, agents check databases for people with ties to espionage or crime who could pose a risk to national security or a president's reputation.\n\nAsked about Liu's encounters with the president, the Secret Service's chief of communications, Anthony Guglielmi, said, \"There were no protective or safety concerns associated with these dates. The Bedminster Club is a private facility, and you will have to refer to organizers when it comes to who may have been allowed access to their facilities.\"\n\nThe Secret Service does not have a record of Liu meeting Trump on the president's official schedule, a Secret Service official said. Instead, the encounters apparently occurred during periods when the president did not have official business, according to the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. While staying at his clubs at Mar-a-Lago and Bedminster as president, Trump often left his living quarters to mingle with members and their guests in public areas. The Secret Service screened those people for weapons, but did not do background checks on them, current and former officials said.\n\n\"Did the Secret Service know every name involved?\" the Secret Service official said. \"No. Those are called 'off-the-record movements,' and we are worried about physical safety in those situations. We don't have the time to do workups on everybody in that environment.\"\n\nAs a member or a member's guest, Liu could have entered the club without showing identification to the Secret Service and met with Trump, the official said. It appears, in short, that Liu avoided Secret Service background screening.\n\nDuring both visits, Liu accompanied Cinque, with whom he had cultivated a friendship and explored business ventures. Cinque said that he and his guests had easy access to the president at Bedminster.\n\n\"I just go in every time I want,\" Cinque said in an interview with ProPublica. \"I'm with Donald 44 years. ... The Secret Service, they trust me. Because I got a great relation with the Secret Service and I'm not gonna bring anybody bad next to Trump.\"\n\nBut Cinque now regrets ever having met Liu.\n\n\"He's a professional con man,\" Cinque said. \"There was a lot of flimflam with him. He conned me pretty good.\"\n\nCinque has given conflicting accounts about the July 2018 meeting. In an interview with a Chinese media outlet that year, he said Liu had spent three hours with the president. Last week, though, he told ProPublica that he had exaggerated the length of the conversation and Liu's role in it.\n\nA spokesperson for Trump and officials at the Trump Organization and Bedminster club did not respond to requests for comment. The Chinese embassy also did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLiu's case is one of several incidents in which Chinese nationals sought access to Trump in murky circumstances, raising concerns in Congress , law enforcement and the media about espionage and illegal campaign financing.\n\nLiu did catch the attention of other federal agencies. His political activity in New York caused FBI counterintelligence agents to begin monitoring him in 2018, ProPublica has learned, before his encounters with Trump at Bedminster. His meetings with the president only heightened their interest, national security sources said.\n\nThen, in early 2020, DEA agents came across Liu as they dismantled the global money laundering network of his friend Li. Reconstructing Liu's trail, the DEA grew to suspect he was a kind of spy: an ostentatious criminal who made himself useful to Chinese intelligence agencies in exchange for protection.\n\nThe DEA agents thought Liu could answer big questions: What was he doing with the president? Was he conducting an operation on behalf of Chinese intelligence? And what did he know about the murky alliance between Chinese organized crime and the Chinese state?\n\nBut the DEA clashed with the FBI over strategy. And by the time DEA agents zeroed in on Liu, he had holed up in Hong Kong. The pandemic had shut down travel.\n\nIf the agents wanted to solve the walking mystery that was Tao Liu, they would have to figure out a way to go get him.\n\nThis account is based on interviews with more than two dozen current and former national security officials based in the U.S. and overseas, as well as lawyers, associates of Liu and others. ProPublica also reviewed court documents, social media, press accounts and other sources. ProPublica granted anonymity to some sources because they did not have authorization to speak to the press or because of concerns about their safety and the sensitivity of the topic.\n\nLiu grew up in comfort and privilege.\n\nBorn in 1975 in Zhejiang province, he studied business in Shanghai and began prowling the world. He accumulated wealth and left behind a trail of dubious ventures, failed romances and children, according to court documents, associates and former national security officials. He lived in Poland and Hong Kong before moving in 2011 to Mexico City, where he dabbled in the gambling and entertainment fields.\n\nSoon he met Li, the Chinese American money launderer, who also sold fraudulent identity documents. Liu bought fraudulent Guatemalan and Surinamese documents from Li and acquired a Mexican passport, according to prosecution documents and interviews. He played a crucial early role helping Li build his criminal empire, according to former investigators.\n\nBoth men had links to the 14K triad, a powerful Chinese criminal syndicate, according to former investigators and law enforcement documents. Moving between Mexico and Guatemala, they were on the vanguard of the Chinese takeover of the underworld that launders money for the cartels.\n\nBut in 2014, Liu embarked on a caper in China. He touted a cryptocurrency with an ex-convict, Du Ling, known as the \"queen of underground banking,\" according to interviews, media reports and Chinese court documents.\n\nIt was all a fraud, authorities said. Chinese courts convicted the banking queen and others on charges of swindling more than 34,000 investors from whom they raised over $200 million.\n\nAlthough accused of being the mastermind, Liu eluded arrest, according to court documents, associates and other sources. He popped up in Fiji as a private company executive promising infrastructure projects inspired by President Xi Jinping's visit months earlier to promote China's development initiative, according to news reports and interviews. Liu even hosted a reception for the Chinese ambassador, according to news reports.\n\nLiu's activities in Fiji fit a pattern of Chinese criminals aligning themselves with China's foreign development efforts for mutual benefit, national security veterans say. Liu claims corrupt Chinese officials were his partners in Fiji, \"but then they threw him under the bus,\" said his lawyer, Jonathan Simms.\n\nAfter allegations surfaced about his role in the cryptocurrency scandal in China, Liu fled to Australia. Airport police there downloaded his phone and found discussions about fraudulent passports from countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America, according to Simms and other sources.\n\nIn 2016, Liu returned to Mexico. He soon obtained a U.S. business/tourist visa by making false statements to U.S. authorities about whether he was involved in crime, prosecution documents say.\n\nNow known as Antony Liu, he was ready to make a name for himself.\n\nYuxiang Min is an entrepreneur in Manhattan's Chinatown. For years, he has nurtured a \"Chinese American dream\": to prosper in the herbal medicine industry by planting 16,000 acres of licorice in a desert in China's Gansu province.\n\nAfter meeting Min in early 2018, Liu promised to make the dream a reality, Min said.\n\n\"He made me believe he was very well-connected in China,\" Min said. \"And I think he was. He showed me photos of himself with top Chinese officials.\"\n\nMin said one photo appeared to show Liu with Xi, China's president, before he took office. Between 2002 and 2007, Xi served in senior government positions in two places where Liu had lived, Zhejiang and Shanghai. But Min said he did not have the photo, and ProPublica has not confirmed its existence.\n\nLiu rented Chinatown offices from Min, who said he helped the wealthy newcomer buy a top-of-the-line BMW and find a translator. Despite his weak English, Liu was charismatic and persuasive, associates said. He bankrolled dinners, a concert, an outing on a yacht; he flaunted the flashy details on his social media. He founded Blue Ocean Capital, an investment firm that did little actual business, according to associates, former national security officials and court documents.\n\nHe even gained access to the United Nations diplomatic community, sharing his office suite in Rockefeller Center with the Foundation for the Support of the United Nations. The foundation's website says it is a nongovernmental organization founded in 1988 and that it is affiliated with the UN. A UN spokesperson confirmed that the foundation had \"consultative status,\" which gave its representatives entry to UN premises and activities.\n\nLiu became a financial benefactor of the foundation and was named its \"honorary vice chairman.\" Through the foundation, he was able to organize a conference at UN headquarters with speakers including publishing executive Steve Forbes and former Mexican President Felipe Calderón, according to interviews, photos and media accounts.\n\nThe Bulgarian mission to the UN helped secure the venue for the event, and ambassadors from seven countries attended, according to online posts and interviews. The mission did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAlthough it is startling that someone with Liu's background could play a role in hosting an event at the UN, it is not unprecedented. In past cases, wealthy Chinese nationals suspected of links to crime and Chinese intelligence have infiltrated UN-affiliated organizations as part of alleged bribery and influence operations.\n\nJanet Salazar, the president of the foundation, did not respond to phone calls, texts or emails. Efforts to reach foundation board members were unsuccessful. Emails to Salazar and the foundation in New York bounced back.\n\nUN officials did not respond to queries from ProPublica about what vetting Liu received, if any.\n\n\"We are not aware of the story of Mr. Tao Liu,\" the UN spokesperson said.\n\nCalderón said in an email that he was invited through a speakers bureau to give a talk on sustainable development. The event included Asian participants who did not appear to speak English, Calderón said, and he had little interaction with them other than posing for photos.\n\nForbes' staff did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nLiu also met U.S. political figures through his latest romantic partner: a Chinese immigrant with contacts of her own. She introduced him to Félix W. Ortiz, then the assistant speaker of the New York State Assembly, who socialized with the couple on several occasions.\n\nOrtiz, a Democrat who formerly represented Brooklyn, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nBecause Liu was not a legal resident, U.S. law barred him from contributing to political campaigns. But he attended political events, according to photos, social media and associates. He also met with two veteran GOP fundraisers in the Asian community, Daniel Lou and Jimmy Chue.\n\n\"He was interested in political donations and fundraising,\" Lou said in an interview. \"He wanted to participate. He was willing to help politicians here. That's for sure.\"\n\nLou said he did not engage in fundraising with Liu. In an email, Chue said he knew of \"no illegal activities\" related to Liu. He declined to comment further.\n\nOn April 27, 2018, Liu's friend Min contributed $5,000 to the New York Republican Federal Campaign Committee, campaign records show. In reality, Liu told Min to make the donation and paid him back, Min said in an interview.\n\nMin said he received the money in cash and did not have evidence of the alleged reimbursement. But if his account is true, it appears that Liu funneled a political donation illegally through Min, a U.S. citizen.\n\nThe New York GOP did not respond to emails, phone calls, or a fax seeking comment.\n\nAs he built his profile in Manhattan, Liu made it clear to associates that he was eager to meet Trump. For help, he turned to Cinque, the longtime Trump associate, according to interviews, photos and social media posts.\n\nCinque, 86, heads the American Academy of Hospitality Sciences, which gives international awards to hotels, restaurants and other entities. It has given at least 22 awards to Trump ventures, including the Bedminster club, and it once billed Trump as its Ambassador Extraordinaire.\n\nCinque has a colorful past. In 1990, he pleaded guilty to receiving stolen property, a valuable art collection, according to press reports. A profile in New York Magazine in 1995 quoted him discussing his interactions with \"wiseguys\" and a shooting that left him with three bullet wounds.\n\nIn 2016, Trump told the Associated Press that he didn't know Cinque well and was unaware of his criminal record. In an article in Buzzfeed, Cinque's lawyer said his client had no connection to the mob.\n\nLiu dined with Cinque in May 2018 and they hit it off, according to photos and Liu's associates. Cinque said he could make an introduction to the president, a close associate of Liu said.\n\nCinque told ProPublica that people in the Chinese American community introduced him to Liu, describing him as a wealthy entrepreneur and a \"good person.\" Liu impressed Cinque with his luxury car and entrepreneurial energy. He said they could make a lot of money by pursuing a lucrative cryptocurrency venture, Cinque said.\n\nLiu and Cinque got together more than a dozen times , according to social media photos and interviews. At a June gala at the Harvard Club to launch Liu's company, Cinque gave him a Six Star Diamond Award for lifetime achievement - an award he had previously bestowed on Trump .\n\n\"He was gonna pay me big money for giving him the award,\" Cinque said. \"So I did an award. I didn't check his background, I'm not gonna lie to you.\"\n\nLiu indicated he would pay as much as $50,000 for the honor, but he never actually paid up, Cinque said.\n\nLiu followed a familiar playbook for well-heeled foreigners seeking access to Trump, according to national security officials: pour money into his properties.\n\nIn July, Cinque helped Liu rent a one-bedroom apartment above the 50th floor in Trump Tower by providing a credit report to the landlord as a guarantor, according to Cinque, a person involved in the rental and documents viewed by ProPublica. Liu paid a year's worth of the $6,000 monthly rent upfront. Cinque believes Liu chose Trump Tower in an effort to gain favor with the president.\n\nLiu also told friends he joined the Bedminster golf club, three associates said. Liu told Min he paid $190,000 for a VIP membership, Min said.\n\nBut Cinque doesn't think Liu genuinely became a member. In fact, he said he brought Liu to Bedminster partly because Cinque hoped to impress Trump by persuading his well-heeled new friend to join the club.\n\n\"I was trying to get him to join, where I look good in Trump's eyes if he joined,\" Cinque said. But he said Liu \"never gave 5 cents. He was a deadbeat.\"\n\nOn July 20, CNBC aired an interview with Trump in which he complained about the trade deficit with China.\n\n\"We have been ripped off by China for a long time,\" Trump said.\n\nBy the next day, Liu's efforts to gain access to the president had paid off. He met Trump at Bedminster, according to interviews and photos obtained by ProPublica.\n\nThe images show the president with Liu and Cinque at a table covered with food, drinks and papers. Three other men are at the table. Trump also posed for photos with Liu and Cinque.\n\nLiu was discreet about the conversation, according to Min. Cinque did most of the talking because of Liu's limited English, Liu's close associate said.\n\nProPublica found a few details in an interview of Cinque by SINA Finance, a Chinese media outlet. In the video posted that September, Cinque and a manager of his company announced a business partnership with Liu involving blockchain technology and the hospitality industry. And then Cinque said he had introduced Liu to the president at Bedminster.\n\n\"Antony Liu played a big role,\" Cinque told the SINA interviewer. \"Donald met him, and he wound up staying with him for three hours, just enjoying every moment.\"\n\nThe video displayed a photo of the president with Liu and Cinque during the visit.\n\nCinque and Liu's companies posted a shorter version of the interview on their social media pages. That video omitted the reference to Liu meeting Trump and the photo of the three of them.\n\nIn the interview with ProPublica, Cinque gave a distinctly different version than the one he gave to the Chinese outlet. He said he brought Liu along because Liu implored him for the opportunity of a meeting and photo with Trump. Cinque also said he \"exaggerated the truth\" when he said Liu spent three hours with the president.\n\nThe meeting lasted \"maybe twenty minutes, a half hour,\" Cinque said.\n\nCinque was vague about the topic of the conversation with the president, indicating it had to do with the golf club and the awards he gives.\n\nChanging his account once again, he insisted that Liu did not say much.\n\n\"He just sat there,\" said Cinque, who also denied discussing Liu's business deals with Trump. \"How I could tell anything good to Donald about him where he's gonna do a deal? First I wanted to see if I could earn anything with him.\"\n\nLiu and Cinque met the president again that Sept. 22 during an event at Bedminster, according to interviews and photos. One photo shows Trump smiling with Liu, Cinque and three men who, according to a close associate, were visiting Liu from China for the occasion.\n\nThe photos appeared on the Chinese website of the Long Innovations International Group, also known as the Longchuang International Group. The consulting firm owned by Lou, the GOP fundraiser, has organized events allowing Chinese elites to meet U.S. leaders . A caption with the photos said: \"Longchuang Group and Blue Ocean expert consultant team Trump luncheon.\"\n\nBut Lou insists he didn't know anything about such an event. He said colleagues in China controlled his company's Chinese website.\n\n\"I categorically deny I was involved in this,\" Lou said. \"I was not there. I did not know about it. Tao Liu did offer to me at one point: You are the pro-Trump leader in the community. How about organizing an event at Bedminster? ... But I did not.\"\n\nCinque, meanwhile, said he brought Liu and his visitors to the club. He disagreed with the company website's description of an event with the president.\n\n\"There's no political - it's a golf situation there,\" he said. \"And people love being in [Trump's] company.\"\n\nAlthough Cinque denied receiving money from Liu for himself or the president, he said he didn't know if other visitors paid Liu for the chance to meet Trump, or if Liu made campaign donations through others.\n\nMuch about the two Bedminster meetings remains unclear. Did Liu arrange a political event for Trump in September? Or did he bring a group of visitors to the club and manage to encounter the president? Either scenario raises once again the question of vetting.\n\nThe Secret Service screens all official presidential visitors for weapons and, along with White House staff, checks them in law enforcement and intelligence databases. Foreign nationals require added scrutiny that can include reviewing raw intelligence from overseas. If questions arise, the Secret Service can consult with the FBI and other agencies, said a former acting undersecretary for intelligence at the Department of Homeland Security, John Cohen, who worked on presidential protection issues.\n\nIt is not clear if databases available to the Secret Service held information about the charges against Liu in China and his other alleged illicit activities. But by 2018, Chinese media reports and court documents had described the fraud case complete with photos of Liu. English-language press had also detailed his troubles in the South Pacific and China. Despite Liu's use of different first names, a diligent web search could have found some of that information.\n\nBut Liu apparently avoided background screening altogether, according to Secret Service officials, Cinque and other sources. Although visitors cannot schedule an official meeting with the president without being vetted, it is possible that they could communicate through the private club to set up an informal meeting, Secret Service officials said. Cinque said he took Liu to Bedminster on days he knew Trump would be there.\n\nThe case is another example, national security veterans said, of unique vulnerabilities caused by the freewheeling atmosphere at Trump's clubs.\n\n\"Trump has chosen to reside in places that are open to the public,\" Cohen said. \"He has provided an opportunity to people who join these clubs to get access to him. We have seen that the president enjoys making himself available to people in these settings. A top priority for foreign intelligence is that kind of setting: infiltrating, gaining access. If the former president decides to allow access to criminals and spies, there is not much the Secret Service can do.\"\n\nA week after the Bedminster visit, Liu accompanied the Chinese American GOP fundraisers to West Virginia to see Trump speak at a rally. Liu sat in the VIP section.\n\nA year later, Liu's American spree was in shambles.\n\nHis romantic partner had a child, but they broke up. Liu accumulated angry business associates, including Min, who says Liu owes him $83,000. Liu owed another $2 million in a legal settlement with an investor who sued him for fraud in New York over a cryptocurrency deal, according to court documents.\n\nIn the fall of 2019, Liu stopped paying rent at Trump Tower, according to associates and other sources. His family left behind a crib and a bronze statuette of Trump. Liu went to California and departed the country on foot via Tijuana, later saying he \"snuck out\" to travel with his Mexican passport, according to his associates, national security officials and court documents.\n\nBy early 2020, Liu was back in Hong Kong. He set himself up in a high-rise hotel with a waterfront view. Then the pandemic shut down the world.\n\nMeanwhile, the DEA had filed charges against his friend Li. Agents scouring a trove of communications, photos and other data realized that Liu had been an important figure in Li's criminal activity.\n\nThe agents believed that Liu could tell them more about the money laundering for Latin American drug cartels and the alleged alliance between Chinese organized crime and the Chinese state. And his U.S. political activity intrigued and baffled them. They suspected that he had been operating in a gray area where crime and espionage mix.\n\n\"The theory is he was gathering information and feeding it back to Chinese intelligence in order to keep him in good graces to allow him to do his criminality,\" a former national security official said. \"His currency was influence. And the Chinese would use him as necessary based on his influence. And he was a willing participant in that. The DEA thought it could use him to get at targets in mainland China.\"\n\nBut the pandemic had prompted Hong Kong to close its borders, and the authorities there were generally obedient allies of Beijing.\n\nThe Special Operations Division of the DEA often goes overseas to capture desperados with elaborate undercover stings. In that tradition, the agents came up with a plan.\n\nIn April 2020, Liu received a phone call. The caller spoke Chinese. He said he was a money launderer in New York. He said he had gotten the number from Li, their mutual friend in Mexico, court documents say.\n\nThe name apparently did the trick.\n\n\"Tao is in his apartment on lockdown,\" Simms said. \"He can't go anywhere. He's bored, talkative. He just talks and talks.\"\n\nLiu talked about teaching Li the tricks of the money laundering trade, according to Simms and court documents. He reminisced about Li's casino in Guatemala. He boasted about using five different passports to slip across borders.\n\nSoon, his new phone friend made a proposal, court documents say. He knew a crooked State Department official with a precious commodity to sell: bona fide U.S. passports.\n\nAgreeing to a price of $150,000 each, Liu requested passports for himself and associates, according to prosecution documents and former national security officials. One of the associates was linked to the 14K triad, the former national security officials said.\n\nBy July, Liu had wired a total of $10,000 in advance payments. He received a realistic mock-up of his passport. He showed it off during a video call to Min.\n\n\"I'll be back in America soon,\" Liu exulted, according to Min.\n\nIn reality, the phone friend was an undercover DEA agent. Liu had taken the bait. DEA agents recorded their phone conversations over six months, court documents say.\n\nBut a complication arose. The DEA learned that the FBI was conducting a separate investigation of Liu, national security sources told ProPublica.\n\nFBI counterintelligence agents in New York became aware of him soon after he began spreading money around and cultivating political contacts in early 2018, national security sources said. Then his contact with Trump spurred an investigation to determine if Chinese intelligence was working with Liu to gain political access, the sources said.\n\nHis years as a fugitive gave credence to that idea. Although Chinese authorities had been pursuing him in relation to the cryptocurrency scandal since 2015, China did not issue an Interpol notice for him until 2020. Chinese authorities apparently made little effort to arrest him while he sheltered in Hong Kong for nearly a year.\n\nThe DEA and the FBI clashed over the imperatives of counterintelligence and law enforcement. FBI agents wanted to keep monitoring Liu to trace his contacts; DEA agents favored capturing him.\n\nThe DEA prevailed. That October, the undercover agent told Liu he had arranged for a private jet to pick him up in Hong Kong, according to court documents and former national security officials. It would take him to Australia, where they would seal the passport deal in person. Agents sent Liu a menu for the flight complete with a choice of cocktail. He thought that was \"very high class,\" his close associate said.\n\nThe stakes were high too. If Chinese authorities learned of the clandestine foray, a diplomatic uproar was likely.\n\nOn Oct. 13, the weather was warm and rainy. The DEA's private jet landed in Hong Kong. Liu came aboard without hesitation, according to an associate and former national security officials.\n\nHours later, the plane touched down in Guam, which is a U.S. territory. DEA agents arrested Liu.\n\n\"He was surprised,\" the close associate said. \"So many police cars. He said it was like a 007 movie.\"\n\nOn April 14 of last year, Liu pleaded guilty in a federal courtroom in Virginia to conspiracy to bribe a U.S. official in the passport sting and to conspiracy to commit money laundering. A judge sentenced him to seven years in prison.\n\nBut two explosive questions remain unanswered: why he had contact with Trump and other politicians, and whether he worked with Chinese spy agencies.\n\nThe government has kept most of the story secret. Liu's public court file does not mention his political activity. The DEA and Justice Department declined to discuss Liu with ProPublica. An FBI spokesperson said the agency could not confirm or deny conducting specific investigations.\n\nLiu, meanwhile, accepted an interview request. But the Bureau of Prisons refused to allow ProPublica to talk to him in person or by phone, citing \"safety and security reasons.\"\n\nThe FBI investigation of Liu apparently focused on political and counterintelligence matters. Last year, agents questioned Min and at least two other associates of Liu. The agents asked Min about Liu's interactions with Cinque and former Assemblyman Ortiz, and if Liu gave them money. Min said he told the agents he did not know.\n\nIn an interview with the close associate of Liu, FBI agents asked about Liu's contact with Trump, whether he raised money for Trump and Ortiz, his relationship with Cinque, and his contacts with politicians in China. They also asked about money laundering in Mexico, the close associate said.\n\n\"I think the FBI thought he was a spy,\" the close associate said. \"I don't think he's a spy. His English is very bad. He just wanted to show off to Chinese people. This is the way a lot of Chinese business guys operate. A lot of American business guys, too. Getting close to politicians, taking photos with them.\"\n\nCinque said federal agents have not questioned him about Liu.\n\n\"I just think he was a fraudulent hustler,\" Cinque said. \"I don't think he would do anything against the country, but then I could be wrong. Look, he did a lot of things.\"\n\nAs often happens in counterintelligence cases, Liu remains an ambiguous figure: a con man, or a spy, or possibly both. People familiar with the case are suspicious about his ability to roam the world for years and his success at infiltrating high-level U.S. politics.\n\n\"Guys like this never do this kind of thing on their own,\" a national security source said. \"They always do it for someone else.\"\n\nDo You Have a Tip for ProPublica?

      "text": "Multiple Trump Witnesses Have Received Significant Financial Benefits From His Businesses, Campaign\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nNine witnesses in the criminal cases against former President Donald Trump have received significant financial benefits, including large raises from his campaign, severance packages, new jobs, and a grant of shares and cash from Trump's media company.\n\nThe benefits have flowed from Trump's businesses and campaign committees, according to a ProPublica analysis of public disclosures, court records and securities filings. One campaign aide had his average monthly pay double, from $26,000 to $53,500. Another employee got a $2 million severance package barring him from voluntarily cooperating with law enforcement. And one of the campaign's top officials had her daughter hired onto the campaign staff, where she is now the fourth-highest-paid employee.\n\nThese pay increases and other benefits often came at delicate moments in the legal proceedings against Trump. One aide who was given a plum position on the board of Trump's social media company, for example, got the seat after he was subpoenaed but before he testified.\n\nSignificant changes to a staffer's work situation, such as bonuses, pay raises, firings or promotions, can be evidence of a crime if they come outside the normal course of business. To prove witness tampering , prosecutors would need to show that perks or punishments were intended to influence testimony.\n\nWhite-collar defense lawyers say the situation Trump finds himself in - in the dual role of defendant and boss of many of the people who are the primary witnesses to his alleged crimes - is not uncommon. Their standard advice is not to provide any unusual benefits or penalties to such employees. Ideally, decisions about employees slated to give evidence should be made by an independent body such as a board, not the boss who is under investigation.\n\nDo you have any information about Trump's campaign or his businesses that we should know? Robert Faturechi can be reached by email at [email protected] and by Signal or WhatsApp at 213-271-7217. Justin Elliott can be reached by email at [email protected] or by Signal or WhatsApp at 774-826-6240.\n\nEven if the perks were not intended to influence witnesses, they could prove troublesome for Trump in any future trials. Prosecutors could point to the benefits to undermine the credibility of those aides on the witness stand.\n\n\"It feels very shady, especially as you detect a pattern. ... I would worry about it having a corrupt influence,\" Barbara McQuade, a former U.S. attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan, said after hearing from ProPublica about benefits provided to potential Trump witnesses.\n\nBut McQuade said these cases are difficult to prove, even if the intent were actually to influence testimony, because savvy defendants don't explicitly attach strings to the benefits and would more likely be \"all wink and a nod, 'You're a great, loyal employee, here's a raise.'\"\n\nIn response to questions from ProPublica, a Trump campaign official said that any raises or other benefits provided to witnesses were the result of their taking on more work due to the campaign or his legal cases heating up, or because they took on new duties.\n\nThe official added that Trump himself isn't involved in determining how much campaign staffers are paid, and that compensation is entirely delegated to the campaign's top leaders. \"The president is not involved in the decision-making process,\" the official said. \"I would argue Trump doesn't know what we're paid.\"\n\nCampaign spokesperson Steven Cheung said in a statement that \"the 2024 Trump campaign is the most well-run and professional operation in political history. Any false assertion that we're engaging in any type of behavior that may be regarded as tampering is absurd and completely fake.\"\n\nTrump's attorney, David Warrington, sent ProPublica a cease-and-desist letter demanding this article not be published. The letter warned that if the outlet and its reporters \"continue their reckless campaign of defamation, President Trump will evaluate all legal remedies.\"\n\nIt's possible the benefits are more widespread. Payments from Trump campaign committees are disclosed publicly, but the finances of his businesses are mostly private, so raises, bonuses and other payments from those entities are not typically disclosed.\n\nProPublica did not find evidence that Trump personally approved the pay increases or other benefits. But Trump famously keeps close watch over his operations and prides himself on penny-pinching. One former aide compared working for the Trump Organization, his large company, to \"a small family business\" where every employee \"in some sense reports to Mr. Trump.\" Former aides have said Trump demands unwavering loyalty from subordinates, even when their duties require independence. After his Attorney General Jeff Sessions decided to recuse himself against then-President Trump's wishes, paving the way for a special counsel to investigate his campaign's ties to Russia, Trump fumed about being crossed. \"Where's my Roy Cohn?\" Trump asked, referring to the notorious former aide to Sen. Joseph McCarthy who later served as Trump's faithful fixer long before Trump became president.\n\nTrump campaign adviser\n\nBenefit: Pay more than doubled\n\nHead of Trump campaign\n\nBenefit: Payments to firm spiked, campaign hired her daughter\n\nTrump aide\n\nBenefit: Received a roughly 20% raise\n\nTrump aide\n\nBenefit: Appointed to board of Trump Media\n\nTrump attorney\n\nBenefit: Payments to her law firm dramatically increased\n\nTrump lawyer\n\nBenefit: Payments to his law firm dramatically increased\n\nTrump Organization executive\n\nBenefit: Lucrative severance package\n\nIn addition to the New York case in which Trump was convicted last week, stemming from hidden payments to a porn star, Trump is facing separate charges federally and in Georgia for election interference and in another federal case for mishandling classified documents.\n\nAttempts to exert undue influence on witnesses have been a repeated theme of Trump-related investigations and criminal cases over the years.\n\nTrump's former campaign manager and former campaign adviser were convicted on federal witness tampering charges in 2018 and 2019. The campaign adviser had told a witness to \"do a 'Frank Pentangeli,'\" referencing a character in \"The Godfather Part II\" who lies to a Senate committee investigating organized crime. Trump later pardoned both men in the waning days of his presidency. (He did not pardon a co-defendant of the campaign manager who had cooperated with the government.)\n\nDuring the congressional investigation into the storming of the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, a former White House staffer testified that she got a call from a colleague the night before an interview with investigators . The colleague told her Trump's chief of staff \"wants me to let you know that he knows you're loyal and he knows you'll do the right thing tomorrow and that you're going to protect him and the boss.\" (A spokesperson for the chief of staff denied that he tried to influence testimony.)\n\nLast year, Trump himself publicly discouraged a witness from testifying in the Georgia case. Trump posted on social media that he had read about a Georgia politician who \"will be testifying before the Fulton County Grand Jury. He shouldn't.\"\n\nOne witness has said publicly that, when he quit working for Trump in the midst of the classified documents criminal investigation, he was offered golf tournament tickets, a lawyer paid for by Trump and a new job that would have come with a raise. The witness, a valet and manager at Mar-a-Lago, had direct knowledge of the handling of the government documents at the club, the focus of one of the criminal cases against the former president. \"I'm sure the boss would love to see you,\" the employee, Brian Butler, recalled Trump's property manager telling him. (The episode was first reported by CNN .)\n\nIn an interview with ProPublica, Butler, who declined the offers, said he looked at them \"innocently for a while.\" But when he added up the benefits plus the timing, he thought \"it could be them trying to get me back in the circle.\"\n\nOne Trump aide who plays a key role in multiple cases is a lawyer named Boris Epshteyn, who became an important figure in Trump's effort to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\n\nA college classmate of one of Trump's sons who worked on the 2016 campaign and briefly in the White House, Epshteyn was involved in assembling sets of false electors around the country after Trump lost the 2020 election, and Epshteyn's emails and texts have come up repeatedly in investigations.\n\nIn 2022, he testified before the Georgia grand jury that later indicted Trump on charges related to attempts to overturn the election. The FBI seized his phone, and in April 2023 he was interviewed by the federal special counsel.\n\nIn early August 2023, the special counsel charged Trump with conspiracy to defraud the United States and conspiracy to obstruct an official proceeding as part of an effort to overturn the 2020 election. A couple weeks later, the Georgia grand jury handed down an indictment accusing Trump of racketeering as part of a plot to overturn the election results in the state. From November 2022 to August 2023, the Trump campaign had paid Epshteyn's company an average of $26,000 per month. The month after the indictments, his pay hit a new high, $50,000, and climbed in October to $53,500 per month, where it has remained ever since.\n\nEpshteyn is a contractor with the campaign and the payments go to his company, Georgetown Advisory, which is based at a residential home in New Jersey. The company does not appear to have an office or other employees. Campaign filings say the payments are for \"communications & legal consulting.\"\n\nKenneth Notter, an attorney at MoloLamken who specializes in white-collar defense, said that a defendant should have a good explanation for a major increase in pay like Epshteyn's. \"Any change in treatment of a witness is something that gets my heart rate up as a lawyer.\"\n\nAlready in early 2023, months before the pay bump, a Trump campaign spokesperson described Epshteyn to The New York Times as \"a deeply valued member of the team\" who had \"done a terrific job shepherding the legal efforts fighting\" the investigations of Trump. The Times reported then that Epshteyn spoke to Trump multiple times per day.\n\nTimothy Parlatore, an attorney who left Trump's defense team last year citing infighting , found Epshteyn's large raise baffling. He questioned Epshteyn's fitness to handle high-stakes criminal defense given his scant experience in the area. \"He tries to coordinate all the legal efforts, which is a role he's uniquely unqualified for,\" Parlatore said.\n\nThe Trump campaign official told ProPublica that Epshteyn got a pay raise because Trump's legal cases intensified and, as a result, Epshteyn had more legal work to coordinate. The official declined to say if he started working more hours: \"All of us are working 24/7, ... every second of the day.\" Epshteyn declined to comment on the record.\n\nEven after the major pay increase, Epshteyn has not devoted all of his working time to the Trump campaign. He has continued to consult for other campaigns in recent months, disclosure filings show. And in November, he got a new role as managing director of a financial services firm in New York called Kenmar Securities, regulatory filings show .\n\nPayments to Boris Epshteyn's Company Jump\n\n$60K\n\nIn Aug. 2023, Trump is indicted in election interference cases in which Epshteyn is a witness\n\n40K\n\nPayments\n\n20K\n\nJan\n\nJan\n\nApr\n\nJuly\n\nOct\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\nIn Aug. 2023, Trump is indicted in election interference cases in which Epshteyn is a witness\n\n$60K\n\n40K\n\nPayments\n\n20K\n\nJan\n\nJan\n\nApr\n\nJuly\n\nOct\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\nOther employees in Trump's political orbit have followed a similar pattern - including his top aide.\n\nTrump campaign head Susie Wiles, a Florida political consultant, was present when Trump allegedly went beyond improperly holding onto classified documents and showed them to people lacking proper security clearances.\n\nWhen Trump was indicted on June 8, 2023, over his handling of the documents, the indictment described Wiles as a \"PAC representative.\" It described Trump allegedly showing her a classified map related to a military operation, acknowledging \"that he should not be showing it\" and warning her to \"not get too close.\"\n\nThat June, Right Coast Strategies, the political consulting firm Wiles founded, received its highest-ever monthly payment from the Trump campaign: $75,000, an amount the firm has equaled only once since.\n\nWiles had been a grand jury witness before the indictment. News reports indicated Wiles had told others that she continued to be loyal to Trump and only testified because she was forced to. (And, according to Wiles, Trump was told she was a witness sometime before the indictment's June release.)\n\nThe Trump campaign official told ProPublica that the spike in payments was largely because Wiles was billing for previous months.\n\nShe also got a 20% raise that May, from $25,000 to $30,000 per month. \"She went back and redid her contract,\" the official said, adding that her role as a witness was not a factor in that raise.\n\nA few months later, the Wiles family got more good news. Wiles' daughter Caroline, who had done some work for Trump's first campaign and in the White House, where she reportedly left one job because she didn't pass a background check, was hired by his campaign. Her salary: $222,000, making her currently the fourth-highest-paid staffer. (The Trump campaign official said her salary included a monthly housing stipend.)\n\nSusie Wiles said she and another campaign official were responsible for hiring her daughter, who she said has an expertise in logistics and was brought on to handle arrangements for surrogates taking Trump's place at events he couldn't attend. Wiles said Trump wasn't involved in the hire.\n\nCaroline Wiles told ProPublica her mother's position in the campaign played no role in her getting a job, but she declined to describe the circumstances around the job offer. \"How did I get the job? Because I have earned it,\" she said. \"I don't think it has anything to do with Susie.\"\n\nThe indictment suggests Susie Wiles herself has been aware of efforts to keep potential witnesses in the fold. Soon after the FBI found classified documents at Mar-a-Lago, a Trump employee was asked in a group text chat that included Wiles to confirm that the club's property manager \"was loyal.\"\n\nWiles told ProPublica she couldn't talk about the details of the case, but she called the text message exchange \"a nothing.\"\n\nMore generally, she said she was unaware of the need to ensure employees who are witnesses do not appear to be receiving special treatment. \"It's the first time I've heard that's best practice,\" she said. \"I don't mind telling you I conduct myself in such a way that I don't worry about any of that.\" Trump, she said, had never talked to her about her role as a witness.\n\nLess powerful aides who are witnesses have also enjoyed career advances.\n\nMargo Martin, a Trump aide who, like Wiles, allegedly witnessed Trump showing off what he described as a secret military document, got a significant raise not long after the classified documents case heated up with the search at Mar-a-Lago.\n\nAccording to the indictment, Trump told Martin and others the military plan was \"secret\" and \"highly confidential.\" \"As president I could have declassified it,\" he allegedly told the group. \"Now I can't, you know, but this is still a secret.\"\n\nA few months before her grand jury appearance, she moved from the payroll of a Trump political committee to a job with the campaign as it was launching. Martin was given a roughly 20% pay raise, from $155,000 to $185,000 per year, according to the Trump campaign. Campaign finance filings show a much larger pay increase for Martin, but the Trump campaign said the filings are misleading because of a difference in how payroll taxes and withholdings are reported by the two committees.\n\nBecause of that quirk, it's impossible to know who else got raises and how big they were. The campaign official said that at least one other witness also got a pay raise but did not provide details about how much and when.\n\nDan Scavino is a longtime communications aide who Trump once called the \"most powerful man in politics\" because he could post for Trump on the president's social media accounts. Scavino was among the small group of staff who had an up-close view of Trump during the final weeks of his presidency - a focus of the congressional inquiry into the Jan. 6 insurrection and the criminal probe into election interference.\n\nIn August 2021, a month after the congressional investigation began, securities filings show that the parent company behind Truth Social, Trump's social media company, gave Scavino a consulting deal that ultimately paid out $240,000 a year.\n\nThe next month, lawmakers issued a subpoena to Scavino to ask him what the White House knew about the potential for violence before the attacks and what actions Trump took to try to overturn the election results. The panel gave Scavino a half-dozen extensions while negotiating with him, but he ultimately refused to testify or turn over documents and was held in contempt.\n\nIn September 2022, Scavino received a subpoena to testify before the criminal grand jury in the federal election interference probe. This time, he wasn't able to get out of it and was seen leaving the Washington, D.C., courthouse in May 2023.\n\nBits of Scavino's testimony were reported by ABC News, citing unnamed sources. Though his recollections of Trump from Jan. 6 painted the former president unfavorably, his reported testimony didn't include significant new information. He testified Trump was \"very angry\" that day, and, despite pleas from aides to calm the Capitol rioters, Trump for hours \"was just not interested\" in taking action to stop it. When the testimony was reported, Trump's spokesperson said Scavino is one of the former president's \"most loyal allies, and his actual testimony shows just how strong President Trump is positioned in this case.\"\n\nBetween getting the subpoena and testifying, Scavino was given a seat on the board of the Trump social media company.\n\nScavino was also granted a $600,000 retention bonus and a $4 million \"executive promissory note\" paid in shares, according to SEC filings. The company's public filings do not make clear when these deals were put in place.\n\nAs one of the few aides who Trump was with on Jan. 6, Scavino is likely to be called if Trump's election interference cases go to trial.\n\nReached by ProPublica, Scavino declined to answer questions about how he got the board seat and other benefits from the Trump media company. \"It has nothing to do,\" he said, \"with any investigation.\"\n\nA Trump Media spokesperson declined to answer questions about who made the decision to give Scavino the benefits and why, but said, \"It appears this article will comprise utterly false insinuations.\"\n\nWhen Atlanta attorney Jennifer Little was hired to represent Trump in his Georgia election interference case, it marked the high point of her career.\n\nA former local prosecutor who started her own practice, she had previously taken on far more modest cases. Highlights on her website include a biker who fell because of a pothole, a child investigated for insensitive social media comments and drunk drivers with \"DUI's as high as .19.\" Little had made headlines for some higher profile cases, like a candidate for lieutenant governor accused of sexual harassment, but everything on her resume paled in comparison to representing a former president accused of plotting to reverse the outcome of an election.\n\nThen in May 2022, her job got even more complicated when Trump pulled her into his brewing showdown with the Justice Department over classified documents at Mar-a-Lago. Despite multiple requests, Trump had not returned all of the documents he had brought with him from the White House to his Florida club. The Justice Department had just elevated the matter by subpoenaing Trump for the records, and Trump wanted her advice.\n\nLittle told him, according to news reports, that unlike the government's prior requests, a subpoena meant he could face criminal charges if he didn't comply.\n\nWhen Trump ultimately did not turn over the records and the criminal investigation intensified, Little's involvement in that pivotal meeting got her called before a grand jury by federal prosecutors.\n\nSome of her testimony before that grand jury, which determines whether someone will be indicted, may have been favorable for Trump. In one reported instance, Little's recollections undermined contemporaneous documentary evidence that was damaging to Trump. Investigators had obtained notes from another lawyer at the May 2022 meeting indicating Trump suggested they not \"play ball\" with federal authorities: \"Wouldn't it be better if we just told them we don't have anything here?\"\n\nLittle told the grand jury she remembered the question more benignly, according to an ABC News story that cited anonymous sources, and said she couldn't recall Trump recommending they not \"play ball.\"\n\nTrump has since been indicted over his handling of the classified documents. If the case goes to trial, Little's testimony could prove crucial as the two sides try to make their case about Trump's consciousness of guilt and whether he purposely withheld documents. (Trump has pleaded not guilty in that case and has said he did nothing wrong.)\n\nJust after Little was forced to testify before the grand jury in March 2023, a Trump political action committee paid her $218,000, by far the largest payment she'd received while working for Trump. In the year after she became a witness, she has made at least $1.3 million from the Trump political committee, more than twice as much as she had during the year prior.\n\nLittle told ProPublica the large payment she received soon after she was compelled to testify was due to a lengthy motion she filed around then to block the release of the Georgia grand jury's findings and prevent Trump from being indicted. Her hourly rate did not change, she said, the workload increased. The elevated payments in the year after she became a witness did coincide with the Georgia case heating up and Trump getting indicted.\n\nThe Trump campaign official said the spike in payments to Little after she became a witness was the result of her billing for multiple time periods at once.\n\nPayments to Jennifer Little's Law Firm Increase After She Becomes a Witness\n\n$300K\n\nIn March 2023, Little is compelled to give grand jury testimony\n\n200K\n\nPayments\n\n100K\n\nJul\n\nJan\n\nJul\n\nJan\n\n2022\n\n2023\n\n2024\n\n$300K\n\nIn March 2023, Little is compelled to give grand jury testimony\n\n200K\n\nPayments\n\n100K\n\nJan\n\nJul\n\nJul\n\nJan\n\n2023\n\n2022\n\n2024\n\nA similar pattern played out for the other Trump lawyer present at the Mar-a-Lago meeting about the subpoena.\n\nEvan Corcoran, a former federal prosecutor who specializes in white-collar criminal defense, was new to the team at the time. And it was his notes, obtained by investigators, that memorialized Trump suggesting they not \"play ball.\" His notes also included a description of Trump seeming to instruct him to withhold some sensitive documents from authorities when the former president made a \"plucking motion.\"\n\n\"He made a funny motion as though - well okay why don't you take them with you to your hotel room and if there's anything really bad in there, like, you know, pluck it out,\" Corcoran's notes read, according to the indictment.\n\nLike Little, Corcoran tried to fight being forced to testify before a grand jury, asserting that as Trump's lawyer, their communications were protected. But prosecutors were able to convince a judge that the protection didn't apply because their legal advice was used to commit crimes.\n\nCorcoran's notes from his conversations with Trump formed the backbone of the eventual indictment, and his descriptions of those meetings are expected to be a critical component at trial. The lawyer made an initial appearance before the grand jury in January 2023 and appeared again in another session in March.\n\nAround the time he was forced to be a witness, Corcoran recused himself from the classified documents case, but he continued to represent Trump on other matters. Nevertheless his firm's compensation shot up for a few months.\n\nJust days after his March grand jury testimony, the Trump campaign sent two payments to his firm totaling $786,000, the largest amount paid in a single day in his almost two years working for Trump. The firm brought in a total of $1.4 million in that four-week span, more than double its payments from any other comparable period during Corcoran's time working for Trump.\n\nCorcoran did not respond to questions from ProPublica. The Trump campaign official said the spike in payments came because the firm was billing for more hours of work as Trump's cases ramped up. The official added that the number of lawyers from the firm working on the case may have increased but could not provide specifics.\n\nThe issue of witnesses who have received financial rewards from Trump has already come up at both of the former president's New York trials.\n\nIn the civil fraud case last year, prosecutors questioned the Trump Organization's former controller about the $500,000 in severance he had been promised after retiring earlier in the year. During his testimony, the former controller broke down in tears as he complained about allegations against an employer he loved and defended the valuations at the center of the case as \"justified.\" At the time of the testimony, he was still receiving his severance in installments.\n\nFormer chief financial officer Allen Weisselberg got a $2 million severance agreement in January 2023, four months after the New York attorney general sued Trump for financial fraud in his real estate business. The agreement contains a nondisparagement clause and language barring Weisselberg from voluntarily cooperating with investigators.\n\nIt came up in Trump's hush money trial last month when prosecutors told the judge that the severance agreement was one of the reasons they would not call Weisselberg . He was still due several payments.\n\n\"The agreement seems to preclude us from talking to him or him talking to us at the risk of losing $750,000 of outstanding severance pay,\" one prosecutor said .\n\nIn last year's fraud trial, the judge wrote of the severance agreement, \"The Trump Organization keeps Weisselberg on a short leash, and it shows.\"\n\nA Trump Organization spokesperson said in a statement that after Weisselberg and the controller announced their retirement plans, \"the company agreed to pay them severance based on the number of years they worked at the company. President Trump played no role in that decision.\" Weisselberg's severance agreement was signed by Trump's son Eric.\n\nAnother witness from the civil trial last year, longtime Trump friend and real estate executive Steve Witkoff, was called as an expert witness by Trump's defense team, and he defended the Trump Organization real estate valuations at the heart of the case.\n\nRead More\n\nTwo months after Witkoff's testimony, Trump's campaign for the first time started paying his company, the Witkoff Group, for air travel. The payments continued over several weeks, ultimately totalling more than $370,000.\n\nThe Trump campaign official confirmed the campaign used Witkoff's private jet for multiple trips, including Trump's visit to a stretch of the Texas border in February, saying it \"appropriately reimbursed\" him for the flights. The official said it sometimes used commercial charter jet services but opted for Witkoff's plane because of \"availability, space, and convenience.\"\n\nWitkoff and The Witkoff Group did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nDo you have any information about Trump's campaign or his businesses that we should know?

      "text": "Trump Just Endorsed an Oath Keeper's Plan to Seize Control of the Republican Party\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has officially endorsed a plan, created by a man who has self-identified with the Oath Keeper militia, that aims to have Trump supporters consolidate control of the Republican Party.\n\nThe plan, known as the \"precinct strategy,\" has been repeatedly promoted on Steve Bannon's popular podcast. As ProPublica detailed last year, it has already inspired thousands of people to fill positions at the lowest rung of the party ladder. Though these positions are low-profile and often vacant, they hold critical powers: They help elect higher-ranking party officers, influence which candidates appear on the ballot, turn out voters on Election Day and even staff the polling precincts where people vote and the election boards that certify the results.\n\n\"Just heard about an incredible effort underway that will strengthen the Republican Party,\" Trump said Sunday in a statement emailed to his supporters. \"If members of our Great movement start getting involved (that means YOU becoming a precinct committeeman for your voting precinct), we can take back our great Country from the ground up.\"\n\nTrump's email named Dan Schultz, an Arizona lawyer and local party official who first developed the precinct strategy more than a decade ago. Schultz spent years trying to promote his plan and recruit precinct officers. In 2014, he posted a callout to an internal forum for the Oath Keepers militia group, according to hacked records obtained by ProPublica.\n\n\"Why don't you all join me and the other Oath Keepers who are 'inside' the Party already,\" Schultz wrote under a screen name. \"If we conservatives were to do that, we'd OWN the Party.\"\n\nFederal prosecutors in January charged the leader of the Oath Keepers and 10 of its other members with seditious conspiracy in last year's attack on the U.S. Capitol. One of them pleaded guilty, as have several members of the group in related cases who are cooperating with the investigation. The group's leader, Stewart Rhodes, pleaded not guilty.\n\nThere is no indication that Schultz had any involvement in the Capitol riot.\n\nSchultz told ProPublica he never became a formal member of the Oath Keepers organization. \"I have taken oaths to support and defend the Constitution as a West Point cadet, as a commissioned U.S. Army officer and as a practicing attorney,\" Schultz said in a text message. \"Those oaths do not have expiration dates, by my way of thinking, and I have kept my oaths. In that sense, I am an 'oath keeper.'\"\n\nAccording to experts on extremist groups, the Oath Keepers recruit military and law enforcement veterans using the idea that their oath to defend the Constitution never expired. The group then urges people to resist what they say are impending orders to take away Americans' guns or create concentration camps.\n\n\"I don't ever want to be pulling the trigger on an AR-15 in my neighborhood,\" Schultz said in a 2015 conference call with fellow organizers, referring to the semi-automatic rifle. \"Oath Keepers, I love them for instilling the oath. But what they need to do also, I think, is spread the message that hey, we can do stuff politically so we never get to the cartridge box.\"\n\nIn more recent interviews on right-wing podcasts and internet talk shows, Schultz has repeatedly described his precinct strategy as a last alternative to violence.\n\n\"It's not going to be peaceful the next go-round, perhaps,\" Schultz said in a June interview with the pro-Trump personality David Clements. \"But it ought to be, and the way to ensure that it will be is we've got to get enough of these good decent Americans to take over one of the two major political parties.\"\n\nIt was not clear whether Trump or his aides were aware that Schultz has self-identified with the Oath Keepers. Trump's spokesperson, Liz Harrington, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nSchultz has spent months trying to get his idea in front of Trump. Steve Stern, a fellow movement organizer, told ProPublica that he met a former Trump administration official for lunch at Mar-a-Lago, the ex-president's private club in Palm Beach, in December. While there, Stern said, he got a chance to briefly mention the project to Trump.\n\nThen, last month, Schultz and Stern landed an interview on a talk show hosted by Mike Lindell, the MyPillow CEO who promotes conspiracy theories about the 2020 election. Lindell said he would discuss the plan with Trump personally. Schultz and Stern followed up with a conference call with Harrington and Bannon, according to Stern. Harrington previously worked at Bannon's \"War Room\" website.\n\n\"I know the president's very jacked up about it,\" Bannon said on his podcast, speaking with Schultz after Trump released the endorsement. \"Help MAGA, help the America First movement, right? Help the deplorables, help President Trump, help yourself, your country, community, your kids, grandkids, all of it. Put your shoulder to the wheel.\"\n\nBannon, who led Trump's 2016 campaign, originally lifted the precinct strategy to prominence in a podcast interview with Schultz last year. After the episode aired, thousands of people answered Bannon's call to become precinct officers in pivotal swing states, according to data compiled by ProPublica from county records and interviews with local party officials.\n\nAs of last August, GOP leaders in 41 counties reported an unusual increase in sign-ups since Bannon's first interview with Schultz, adding a total of more than 8,500 new precinct officers. The trend appears to have continued since then. New precinct officers started using their powers to remove or censure Republican leaders who contradicted Trump's election lies and to recruit people who believe the election was stolen into positions as poll watchers and poll workers.\n\nRead More\n\nBannon received a last-minute pardon from Trump after the former adviser was charged with financial fraud. He has pleaded not guilty to contempt of Congress for defying a subpoena from the committee investigating the Jan. 6 attack. Bannon's spokesperson did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nIn addition to Bannon and Lindell, the precinct strategy has won support from pro-Trump figures such as former national security adviser Michael Flynn, who urged Trump to impose martial law, and lawyers Sidney Powell and Lin Wood, who led some of the lawsuits seeking to overturn the election results. Right-wing groups such as Turning Point Action, which organized buses to transport rallygoers on Jan. 6, also joined the effort to recruit precinct officers.\n\nWhile Stern said he's thrilled about Trump's written statement endorsing the precinct strategy, he said he hopes to hear it from Trump's own lips at an upcoming rally.

      "text": "Trumpâs border czar nudges Congress: âItâs taking too longâ\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nThe Republican-controlled Congress is still in the early phases of what the party expects will become a massive tax-and-border bill over the next several months â but thatâs not quite soon enough for President Donald Trumpâs border czar.\n\nTom Homan, who works closely with Trump advisers like Stephen Miller on the presidentâs deportation and border security efforts, described deportation efforts as âgoodâ so far during a wide-ranging phone interview with Semafor on Monday. More than 100,000 migrants already have been removed from the US, Homan said, even as court battles over deportation flights continue to stoke scrutiny of the administrationâs work.\n\nEven so, Homan was clear that he wants Congress to act fast on new border funding. His work might have gotten extra money already, had Republicans chosen the two-track legislative solution that the Senate initially proposed to advance Trumpâs agenda. But the Houseâs push for âone big, beautiful billâ won out , which has left Homan still waiting for Capitol Hill.\n\nEven once lawmakers act, he said heâs still concerned about having the manpower and space to accomplish deportations on the scale Trump wants.\n\nIn addition to congressional action, Homan talked about tariffs, the case of a Maryland father who courts have ordered returned to the US, and more.\n\nThis interview has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nShelby Talcott: Youâve talked a little bit before about there being concerns about manpower and space for migrants being detained. Does that remain a concern? And are you going to specific places for additional resources for that?\n\nTom Homan: Well, it is a concern. Weâve got to have Congress fund this operation. I mean, weâre hoping to get some funding through reconciliation, but now thatâs â we got to hope Congress gets that done, because there is a limited amount of funds. And to do more, we got to buy more detention beds. We need more flights. We need more officers. We need more overtime. Bottom line is: The more money we get, the more successful we will be.\n\nAfter four years of millions of people entering the country illegally, we got a lot of people â¦ but resources matter. We got to hire more agents. And the biggest issue I see right now is the need for more detention beds.\n\nIs it taking too long for Congress to get you border money? Because weâve heard you supported the two-bill approach that would have conceivably delivered it by now.\n\nI support any approach that gives us the money we need to do this operation. Is it taking too long? Yes, itâs taking too long. I wish they would have passed it by now.\n\nIâll leave it up to the Hill to do their job. I think the American people think President Trump [has] a mandate â this immigration issue is a No. 1 issue.\n\nThereâs also legislation pending in Congress that would eliminate nationwide injunctions, which could make border policy easier for the administration. Is that something you support?\n\nAbsolutely support that. I donât think a single district court judge can make a rule for the entire country. So I think thereâs been a war against Trump, and theyâre using the activist judges to try to slow Trumpâs agenda down.\n\nI want to ask about the Abrego case. First, do you plan to get involved at all in relations with the Bukele government over this repatriation case?\n\nI guess the State Department does those types of relationships with the countries, so weâll leave it with the State Department to work with El Salvador on next steps. But this decision is being litigated by DOJ. Iâm the border czar, so weâll let DOJ do their job in litigation.\n\nAre you confident that this guy was a gang member?\n\nYes.\n\nHave you seen [evidence]? Can you share any specifics [on evidence]?\n\nEvidence in the case file â I believe the El Salvadorian government even agreed that he was an MS-13 member. But the most important thing: The men and women of ICE did a deep dive in these cases. â¦ I gotta leave [it] up [to] the men and women of ICE, who are professionals. They do a lot of work on these targets. Theyâve done â whether itâs social media, whether itâs criminal investigations, whether itâs immigration records, whether itâs statements from other confidential informants, thereâs a myriad of things they look at to make the determination.\n\nSo I support that. I havenât seen no evidence that heâs not.\n\nAre tariffs affecting your deportation efforts at all yet?\n\nNo.\n\nHave any countries pushed back on accepting flights, or do you anticipate they will?\n\nNo, not that Iâm aware of, not yet. And I donât think they will. We got a strong president, President Trump. He puts Americans first. A lot of countries that werenât taking back their people are taking back their people because of President Trump.\n\nAnd if they donât, we always got a second option. We can remove them to a third nation thatâs willing to accept them, and thatâs what weâll do if a country wonât take them back.\n\nYouâve talked, and President Trump has talked a little bit, about potential military action against cartels in Mexico. What would it take for the US to strike against them?\n\nWell, itâs above my pay grade. What Iâve said is â that decision [is] way above me. But Iâm saying, with criminal cartels trying to harm our soldiers, trying to harm Border Patrol agents, we got a strong president who will not hesitate to take action against these cartels. We got Mexican military now on the border, we got US military on the border.\n\nI think together, they will send a strong message to the cartels: If you harm an American soldier, harm an American agent, there will be consequences. So Iâll leave that question up to [Defense Secretary] Pete Hegseth and people above me.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Republicans link arms with Trump amid tariff and spending stress\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nOn one of the most politically stressful days of Donald Trumpâs presidency, his party sent a more reassuring signal: Most Republicans are ready to back his new tariffs and the next step of his slow-moving Hill agenda.\n\nEven after a high-profile loss in a Wisconsin judicial race raised the specter of future midterm problems, most Republicans lined up Wednesday in defense of Trumpâs Canada tariff plans and forthcoming reciprocal tariffs. Simultaneously, Trump helped Senate Majority Leader John Thune secure the votes needed to advance a bare-bones budget resolution that defers a lot of tough decisions about his agenda.\n\nThatâs in part thanks to evaporating skepticism from conservatives like Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., who has raised a lot of questions about the budget as well as Trumpâs tariffs.\n\nAfter meeting with Trump on Wednesday, though, Johnson said heâs âfeeling a lot more comfortableâ about the budget that tees up future action on tax and spending cuts. Trump is facing a symbolically significant rebellion on the Senate floor against his tariffs on Canada, but Johnson scoffed at the idea of voting with Democrats and a handful of fellow Republicans to rebuke him.\n\nâIâm not going to support their effort to just poke a stick and try and do the president damage,â Johnson said after the meeting.\n\nTrump still faces serious headwinds, the harshest of his presidency so far, as he and his party recover from a Wisconsin Supreme Court loss on Tuesday evening that has sparked worries within the GOP about a 2018-style electoral meltdown. But most Republicans are ready to buy into Trumpâs promise that tariffs can extract more favorable trade deals with other countries.\n\nThatâs thanks in large part to active behind-the-scenes work to shore up support in the party. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was dispatched to the House on Tuesday and the Senate on Wednesday, where he urged unity on tariffs and taxes.\n\nâHeâs a numbers guy and then some, and heâs just going through the numbers. He believes in the plan, as I do,â Rep. Dan Meuser, R-Pa., told Semafor of Bessent afterward. âAre we breaking a few eggs to make an omelette? Yeah. Maybe thatâs why the price of eggs is so high.â\n\nTrump said Wednesday that he would declare a national emergency that allows him to implement sweeping new tariffs, taxing all imports at 10 percent starting April 5 and imports from select countries at higher rates that Trump described as âhalf of what they â¦ have been charging us,â starting April 9. That includes a 34 percent tariff on Chinese imports â to be stacked with an existing 20 percent tariff â and a 20 percent tariff on European Union imports.\n\nâReciprocal: That means they do it to us and we do it to them,â Trump said from the Rose Garden. âVery simple. Canât get any simpler than that.â\n\nAt least one moment is still likely to go awry for the White House: A public rebuke of Trumpâs tariffs on Canada authored by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., looks set to pass the Senate with at least four GOP votes. Even so, other key Republicans said theyâd oppose the condemnation after Trump publicly urged his party to vote it down.\n\nPerhaps most urgently, Trump is successfully getting his agenda moving in Congress after weeks of circular debate among Republicans congealed into a decision to punt big choices about reducing spending until far later in the year. When pressed directly on spending cuts on Wednesday, Trump told Senate Republicans heâd work with them on slashing federal dollars.\n\nThat vow completed a successful courtship of conservatives who had threatened to bring down the budget. Republicans are now confident they can get 50 of their senators to vote for a budget that essentially makes no ironclad commitments to cut spending â which had been a key ask from the right just a few days ago.\n\nâAll of us budget hawks â Iâm one of them â heard the president say, âI recognize this is a rare and wonderful opportunity to right-size the budget and Iâll support your effort to achieve that,ââ recounted Sen. John Kennedy, R-La. âI think it was important for a couple of my colleagues to hear him say that.â\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe quartet of Senate Republicans defying him on Canada tariffs â Susan Collins, Lisa Murkowski, Rand Paul and Mitch McConnell â arenât exactly Trump stalwarts. As Trump posted about those âunbelievably disloyalâ senators and urged his party to deny Democrats a âvictory,â most Republicans backed him.\n\nâI think President Trump has a plan, and weâll be able to execute that plan,â Sen. Joni Ernst, R-Iowa, told Semafor.\n\nHer Iowa colleague Chuck Grassley agreed: âI see it as nothing but to bring up something to obstruct what Trumpâs doing on tariffs.â\n\nTrump and top advisers spent significant time crafting options for Wednesdayâs tariffs, coming to a final decision only in the hours before the event. Even before he finalized the plan, the White House worked to defend the tariffs, with top aides and officials appearing genuinely excited about what Trump dubbed âLiberation Day.â\n\nHouse Republicans said Bessent assured them Tuesday there would be a âcapâ on the tariffs and that other countries have already signaled a willingness to scale back their own tariffs in response. Leading up to Wednesdayâs Rose Garden announcement, the administration blasted out defenses of tariffs and dispatched advisors and Cabinet secretaries onto TV.\n\nIt may not totally convince free-traders to become tariff lovers â but thatâs not what Trump needs. He needs most Republicans to join his bet that widespread levies on foreign imports will pay off economically.\n\nâThe benefits of free trade are held as a stalwart position of conservatives,â said Rep. John Rose, R-Tenn. But, he added, âmost in the Republican Party are willing to give him a pretty long leash in terms of pursuing opening markets.â\n\nAs for Trumpâs tax cuts, thereâs a lot of private handwringing over what Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., called a âmessyâ process.\n\nA couple of senators said the work isnât done: Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., said he wants to balance the budget; Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said only that things are moving in the âright direction.â Both also attended Wednesdayâs meeting with Trump; the budget resolution was unveiled shortly after that meeting.\n\nItâs still not quite clear how the two chambers will come together on the nuts and bolts of a tax plan as text released Wednesday laid out disparate instructions. The House is planning to cut at least $1.5 trillion to pay for tax cuts, while the Senate is leaving those details for later; the chambers also are still in dispute over whether extensions of expiring tax cuts need to be paid for.\n\nLawmakers are simultaneously pressing the White House for a rescission package that allows Congress to pare back federal spending with simple majority votes.\n\nâAt some point,â Kennedy said, âPresident Trump is going to have to step in and say let me help you folks and share our ideas in order for us to reach a consensus.â\n\nTo the extent Trump has had to twist arms in Congress in his three months in office, heâs mostly concentrated on the House. Now itâs the Senateâs turn, and his grip remains strong.\n\nIf Republicans have a breaking point on Trumpâs tariffs, most clearly havenât hit it. Thereâs also not much evidence Republicans would be willing to slow down Trumpâs tax cut plans, as long as he uses the bully pulpit to promote them and pledges to keep working with conservatives.\n\nKennedy said Trump didnât explicitly urge Republicans to support the budget on Wednesday, but it wasnât really needed. The implication of a meeting with the president about his agenda is that the party needs to come together, stop circular debate and support the president.\n\nSen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, is an outlier, one of her conferenceâs two moderates. But as the only Senate Republican representing a state Trump has never won, sheâs a good barometer for how Trumpâs policies are playing.\n\nCollins doesnât like the Canada tariffs and said sheâs âheard considerable concernâ about the broader levies among her colleagues.\n\nâThe Canadian tariffs would cause incredible harm to Maine, families and economies of Maine communities. I also think that theyâre misguided. Canada is not the source of our fentanyl problem in the United States,â Collins told Semafor.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Trump weighs recognizing Crimea as Russian territory in bid to end war\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nThe Trump administration is considering recognizing Ukraineâs Crimea region as Russian territory as part of any future agreement to end Moscowâs war on Kyiv, according to two people familiar with the matter.\n\nAdministration officials have also discussed the possibility of having the US urge the United Nations to do the same, according to both people. Such a request would align the Trump administration with the position of Russian President Vladimir Putin, who has long seen Crimea as his nationâs territory.\n\nThe administrationâs previously unreported openness to those options comes as Trump prepares for a Tuesday call with Putin, with a potential 30-day ceasefire deal on the table. Trump told reporters Sunday evening aboard Air Force One that negotiators had already discussed â dividing up certain assets .â\n\nTrump has not formally made any decisions, and the possible Crimea moves are two of a multitude of options being floated as his administration pushes for an end to the war.\n\nThe White House declined to comment. In a statement to Semafor after publication of this story, National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes said that the administration has âmade no such commitments and we will not negotiate this deal through the media.â\n\nâJust two weeks ago, both Ukraine and Russia were miles apart on a ceasefire agreement, and we are now closer to a deal thanks to the leadership of President Trump. The goal remains the same: stop the killing and find a peaceful resolution to this conflict,â Hughes added.\n\nIn this article:\n\nTrump administration officials have talked openly about the need for Ukraine to make territorial concessions to Russia in order to bring the three-year war to an end, and the president himself has said in the past that heâs willing to consider Crimea to be part of Russia. But since Trump took office, his advisers havenât publicly divulged many specifics about what they might offer to Putin.\n\nUkrainians have âsuffered greatly and their people have suffered greatly, and itâs hard in the aftermath of something like that to even talk about concessions,â Secretary of State Marco Rubio told reporters last week. âBut thatâs the only way this is going to end to prevent more suffering.â\n\nA push by the US to formally recognize Crimea â which Russia invaded and illegally annexed from Ukraine in 2014 â as Russian land would likely draw tremendous pushback from Europe as well as from Kyiv, where Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has firmly resisted territorial concessions. The US, Ukraine, and much of the international community have recognized Crimea as Ukrainian, despite Russiaâs occupation of the peninsula.\n\nAt the same time, security experts have serious doubts about Ukrainian forcesâ ability to retake Crimea through military means. Even Zelenskyy acknowledged last year that the territory could only be restored to Ukraine through diplomacy, something Russia is unlikely to agree to.\n\nTrump first floated the prospect of recognizing Crimea as Russian territory years before Russia launched the full-scale invasion of Ukraine. While running for president in 2016 â and subsequently, during his first term â the president repeatedly said heâd âlook atâ whether the US would move to recognize it.\n\nâThe people of Crimea, from what Iâve heard, would rather be with Russia than where they were,â Trump said during a 2018 interview with ABC Newsâ George Stephanopoulos. âAnd you have to look at that, also.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

Trump isnât currently considering exemptions for the country-based tariffs, said White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt, who indicated the levies would also penalize countries that enact other trade barriers. Itâs still possible for Trump to change his mind, especially given sinking consumer sentiment , declining approval of his handling of the economy and trade, and stock market losses , but the betting site Polymarket puts the odds of Trump imposing large tariffs at around 70%. His administration may, however, provide some reprieve for farmers impacted by retaliatory measures. Administration officials will offer more clues about Trumpâs strategy today when they issue recommendations on global tariffs and trade relations with China.\n\nâ Morgan Chalfant\n\nTrump may know later today whether Senate Republicans will take the next big step on enacting his tax and border agenda, as Senate Majority Leader John Thune readies possible action on a budget resolution for this week. Senate Republicans will meet this afternoon, potentially determining whether itâs go time for a budget vote thatâs likely to leave a lot of the Senateâs budget-cutting decisions for later to avoid running afoul of the chamberâs arcane rules (missing a spending cut target could dismantle the entire billâs filibuster-proof protections later in the process). âWeâre going to move as quickly as we can,â Thune told reporters. He said the party will make sure theyâll have full attendance, and get clearance from the parliamentarian, in addition to ensuring all Senate Republicans are âcomfortableâ with the vote.\n\nâ Burgess Everett\n\nThe Trump administration is facing another week of potentially make-or-break court action â including a possible ruling on its use of the Alien Enemies Act, which it asked the Supreme Court to weigh in on last week. An update on that drama is expected today: The court told those challenging Trumpâs use of the 18th-century law to respond to his emergency request by Tuesday. In the meantime, the administration is continuing deportation flights of alleged gang members using different authorities, Semafor reported . Thatâs not the only legal fight the president and his advisers are waging: The administration faces more than 130 lawsuits , according to The Associated Press, including over the presidentâs mass firing of government workers, his push to end birthright citizenship, and his effort to end Temporary Protected Status for Venezuelan migrants in the US.\n\nâ Shelby Talcott\n\nRepublicans have nationalized todayâs supreme court race in Wisconsin and special House elections in Florida, hoping to fire up GOP turnout by linking their candidates to Trump. âDonât mess with Trump, donât mess with DOGE, donât mess with Elon and donât mess with Wisconsin,â said Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy at Muskâs Sunday rally in Green Bay. Musk has put more than $20 million into the Wisconsin race, with ads that portray liberal candidate Susan Crawford as soft on crime and conservative candidate Brad Schimel as a Trump ally. Democrats homed in on Musk in TV ads and leaflets that warned âMusk knows Brad Schimel is for sale.â Trumpâs support also faces a test in Floridaâs special election to fill Mike Waltzâs former seat; Republican Randy Fine did little campaigning until Democrat Josh Weil, who raised $10 million, began outperforming him in early votes.\n\nâ David Weigel\n\nSenate Democrats are probing Trumpâs pick to lead the Federal Housing Finance Agency, Bill Pulte, over âsweeping changesâ at FHFA and the mortgage firms he oversees in a pair of new letters shared with Semafor. âGiven that our nation is facing one of the worst housing affordability crises in history, it is essential to carefully examine any actions that could potentially increase housing costs,â Delaware Sen. Lisa Blunt Rochester led seven colleagues, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, in writing. Blunt Rochester and Warren also signed onto another letter, led by Rhode Island Sen. Jack Reed , alleging that staffing changes at Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae âdo not appear to be consistent with federal law.â The senators asked Pulte to appoint new board members and provide âa full explanationâ of his actions â including any plans to release the firms from conservatorship.\n\nâ Eleanor Mueller\n\nThe White House Correspondentsâ Association is trying to coordinate a response to the Trump administrationâs changes to the seating plan in the White House press briefing room , Semaforâs Max Tani scoops . On Sunday, members of the WHCA, including its leaders and some White House bureau chiefs, met to discuss what to do. Two people told Semafor theyâre considering a âsit-inâ-style protest, where reporters would hang onto their old seats and refuse to leave them, though the situation is in flux. The new seating arrangement, which the White House says is âbased on metrics more reflective of how media is consumed today,â is the administrationâs latest effort to control press access to the president, and favor friendlier reporters over wire services like the AP. The goal, the WHCA said Monday , is to make it âeasier to exact punishment on outlets over their coverage.â\n\nStaffers for Joe Biden used fluorescent tape to guide him through a fundraiser at New Jersey Gov.

      "text": "US scales back Greenland visit after criticism\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nThe Trump administration said Tuesday it would scale back a visit by high-profile US delegates to Greenland this week, after the plans triggered intense criticism from Danish and Greenlandic officials.\n\nThe White House said the delegation â which includes National Security Advisor Mike Walz, Energy Secretary Chris Wright and second lady Usha Vance â would only visit the USâ military base at Pituffik, cancelling a planned stop at a popular dog-sled race on the island.\n\nVice President JD Vance will now head the visit: âThere was so much excitement around Ushaâs visit to Greenland this Friday that I decided that I didnât want her to have all that fun by herself!â he said in a video posted to X.\n\nThe decision came after Denmarkâs Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen criticized the US for putting â unacceptable pressure â on Greenland and Denmark amid concerns that the Trump administration is looking to seize the Arctic island.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened to take over the strategic, semi-autonomous Danish territory â one way or the other .â\n\nRussia and Chinaâs growing military presence in the Arctic and Donald Trumpâs renewed interest in Greenland have forced Denmark to bolster the islandâs depleted security, The Washington Post noted: âWe have not invested enough in the Arctic for many years, now we are planning a stronger presence,â the Danish defense minister said in December. Still, âwhen President Trump says the US needs military control â well, in a sense it already has it ,â a Royal Danish Defense College analyst told the paper: A 1951 treaty with Denmark permits the US to maintain military bases on Greenland for mutual defense purposes, although just one remains operational after a sharp decline in Americaâs footprint there following the Cold War.\n\nDonald Trumpâs remarks âhave rekindled decades-long debates in Greenland about decolonization and independence,â a Chatham House analyst wrote. âMany politicians and business people in Greenland worry that Trump could try to exploit any push towards independence ,â the Financial Times wrote, because secession from Denmark â which contributes more than half of Greenlandâs budget â could hurt living standards on the island. Greenlandâs center-right Demokraatit party won the islandâs most recent election by campaigning on a gradual independence process and a promise to resist Trump, while the runner up, pro-rapid independence centrists seemed more open to the US attention.\n\nThe spat is one of many that together signify a crumbling of the post-1945 proscription against seizing territory, an analyst argued in Foreign Affairs. This weakening may be traceable to Russiaâs 2014 invasion of Crimea, and current suggestions that Ukrainian territory should be ceded to Russia â further normalize territorial conquest .â In turn, Donald Trumpâs threats toward Greenland, Canada, Panama, and Gaza are âworrying steps in the wrong direction.â Itâs unclear whether Trumpâs statements should be taken at face value, yet they are â creating a permissive space â for other leaders bent on land acquisition, analysts told The Guardian.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives."

Trump ally Steve Bannon believes the president has learned some lessons since then, describing a âno scalps policyâ thatâs in part fueled by the ghosts of term one. âThe lessons of Mike Flynn are resonating in this,â Bannon said. Trump is partly reluctant to fire folks â even Mike Waltz, whoâs at the center of the Signal drama â because he doesnât want to be seen as giving opponents a win: One administration official noted that if they âsmell blood in the water,â it becomes âa feeding frenzy.â The president is surrounded by hand-picked allies this term, and heâs more confident in them as a result.\n\nâ Shelby Talcott and Burgess Everett\n\nTrump came after the Tea Party and changed the GOP â but make no mistake, those fiscal conservatives are still in Congress. And there are enough of them to make a difference as GOP leaders prepare to call a budget vote as soon as next week, Semaforâs Burgess Everett reports. Senate Majority Leader John Thune is trying to assuage conservative senators like Mike Lee, Ted Cruz, Rick Scott and Ron Johnson with a bid to boost spending cuts to $2 trillion, but they want more. âThey say, âThis is the first step here, we can always do more,ââ Johnson told Semafor. Unless the party cuts spending now, he said: âWeâre not going to do more.â Will conservatives block a budget resolution Trump supports? Probably not. But they could certainly delay things until they get their way.\n\nA pair of congressional Republicans broke from their party Thursday to oppose separate pushes to lift restrictions on how much banks charge for overdrafts and to crack down on colleges and universities that receive money from foreign governments. âBanks are a very, very powerful lobby,â said Sen. Josh Hawley, R-Mo., who was the only Senate Republican to vote against scrapping the overdraft cap. âWhy would we help the big banks at the expense of working people? Why would we help them charge their customers more? I just donât understand it.â In the House, Rep. Don Bacon, R-Neb., was the lone Republican to vote ânoâ on the higher education bill after hearing that it would be âvery onerousâ on schools in his district. He went on to say an earlier vote to give Trump expanded tariff authority was a âmistake .â\n\nâ Eleanor Mueller\n\nSen. Mitch McConnell received the Star of Ukraine Award from the US-Ukraine Foundation last night â and let loose on Trump and his team. He said when it comes to deterring adversaries, some of the presidentâs advisers âdonât seem ready to summon the resources and national will it requires,â and warned âthe outcome weâre headed for today is the one we can least afford: a headline that reads, âRussia wins, America loses.ââ McConnell has been a steadfast backer of Ukraine but is choosing when to shoot his shots now that Trump is president. The former Senate GOP leader felt the need to respond last night, though, amid nervousness in Europe over Trumpâs approach: âWhen American officials court the favor of an adversary at the expense of allies â¦ [and] when they mock our friends to impress an enemy â¦ they reveal their embarrassing naivete.â\n\nâ Burgess Everett\n\nThe White House is learning the hard way that plucking members of Congress for administration positions isnât always the best course with a slim majority , Semaforâs Congress team reports . Trump revealed Thursday that he was withdrawing Elise Stefanik as his pick for US ambassador to the United Nations, despite the expectation she would sail through confirmation as soon as next week. Sheâll now remain in the House. The news came as Republicans have been fretting over an imminent special election to fill national security adviser Mike Waltzâs former seat. In the House, where there are currently four open seats, lawmakers will have to take a fresh vote on a budget proposal that unlocks Trumpâs tax-cut plans after the Senate takes action, as soon as April. âThe real need for votes is about to start. That simple,â a White House official explained.\n\nVice President JD Vance is in Greenland today for a scaled-back visit that had received an icy reception this week. Vance and his wife, Usha Vance, are visiting Pituffik Space Base for an Arctic security briefing and meet-and-greet with US service members. The second lady scrapped earlier plans to visit historical sites and attend an annual dogsled race, which was panned by Greenlandic and Danish leaders . While Greenland and Denmark welcomed the change to the schedule, Trumpâs recent comments musing about gaining control of the strategically valuable autonomous Danish territory have triggered fresh alarm. âWeâll go as far as we have to go,â Trump told reporters Wednesday. âWe need Greenland. And the world needs us to have Greenland, including Denmark.â Greenlanders âhave not been cowed,â Denmarkâs prime minister wrote in advance of the visit.\n\nThe White Houseâs attempt to appoint a senior Africa director has fallen apart for the third time , Semaforâs Yinka Adegoke reports . Col. Jean-Philippe Peltier, a career intelligence officer who was born in Chad and raised across Francophone Africa, had been lined up for the top Africa role. But after he and the White House failed to reach an agreement on housing compensation, he will no longer be joining the administration, according to two sources. The White Houseâs previous candidates were Joe Foltz, a Republican congressional aide, and John Tomaszewski, a senior aide to Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Jim Risch. The news comes as reports suggest that Trump is considering folding United States Africa Command into its European counterpart, and amid broader skepticism about the fate of the African Growth Opportunity Act (AGOA) trade pact.\n\nOne of the most powerful but elusive figures in the conservative movement, Leonard Leo, opened up about Trump, the rocky Brett Kavanaugh confirmation process, and the mark he made on the federal judiciary through his first-term advice to the president. In a lengthy interview with the Free Pressâ Bari Weiss, Leo, a conservative legal activist and longtime co-chairman of the Federalist Society, said he has little direct involvement in Trumpâs current administration but denied the two had a âfalling out.â Leo acknowledged he was surprised by the sexual assault allegations that nearly derailed Kavanaughâs confirmation. Leo also defended Justice Amy Coney Barrett amid a surge of attacks on the right. And he argued that, even post-Dobbs, the anti-abortion movement is âat its lowest point in history.â\n\nStories that are being largely ignored by either left-leaning or right-leaning outlets, curated with help from our partners at Ground News.\n\nWhat the Left isnât reading: NPR CEO Katherine Maher said she regrets a tweet calling President Trump a fascist and a racist.\n\nWhat the Right isnât reading: Attorney General Pam Bondi indicated she will not pursue an investigation into the use of Signal to discuss attack plans by top administration officials.\n\nUnited States Interior Secretary Doug Burgum will join top global leaders at Semaforâs 2025 World Economy Summit.

      "text": "What Steve Daines told Chinese leaders about Trump\n\nSign up for Semafor Principals: What the White House is reading. Read it now .\n\nSteve Daines has traveled to China on congressional business six times since 2013. Last weekâs visit could prove the most consequential of them.\n\nThatâs in part because of the Montana Republican senatorâs outsized influence in his party right now: Heâs close to President Donald Trump, just led the National Republican Senatorial Committee during a majority-making election cycle, and recently joined the Foreign Relations Committee.\n\nDaines, who spent six years of his career working for Procter and Gamble in China, met with several high-ranking officials while in China this month, including Premier Li Qiang. He recalled Li reminding him that the late Mike Mansfield, another Montana senator, visited the country in 1972 at a critical âicebreaker momentâ for the US and China.\n\nAs Trumpâs Washington trades tariffs with Beijing, Daines added, the premier told Daines that he, too, was visiting China at an âicebreaker moment.â\n\nSemafor spoke to Daines about that moment and others that helped him understand how the two countries can move forward.\n\nThis conversation has been edited for length and clarity.\n\nBurgess Everett: How did you work with the White House on this trip?\n\nSteve Daines: Before I went to China, in what I think was a consequential moment in the relationship, I met with President Trump in the Oval Office. He stressed the importance of addressing the fentanyl issue. So that was really the focus of my discussions with the Chinese leadership, that we currently have a drug war going on. I donât want to see a trade war. The Chinese donât want to see a trade war.\n\nBut I emphasized to the Chinese leadership, we currently have a drug war in the United States. The leading cause of death for 18- to 45-year olds [is fentanyl, according to the Drug Enforcement Administration], and itâs the raw materials, the precursors that come from China, primarily to the Mexican cartels. Some goes to Canada. So I said: They need to bring that to a halt.\n\nDo they understand how big a problem fentanyl is here?\n\nI went to great lengths to make sure they understood that fentanyl was not an excuse for the additional tariffs. It is the issue, nearly 100,000 Americans dying every year. And every state is affected by fentanyl. My guest to one of President Bidenâs State of the Union addresses â¦ was a father from Butte, Montana, who lost his son, who found him lying dead in his yard due to fentanyl poisoning. I told these stories to the Chinese to make sure they understood itâs personal, itâs significant. Itâs a top-of-mind issue for the American people, but most important, itâs a top of mind issue for President Trump.\n\nHow worried are people in China about President Trumpâs tariffs?\n\nThereâs concern that this could escalate into a larger trade war. The United States and China combined account for 43% of the worldâs GDP â¦ So this is a significant moment â not only for our two countries, but frankly, globally â because weâre such a big part of the worldâs GDP. So I think both sides want to find a path forward here.\n\nBut weâve got to get their cooperation and leadership â in not just talking, but taking action.\n\nYouâre a free trader. Are you comfortable with the White Houseâs handling of this issue?\n\nThe White House is not afraid to take bold, decisive action with China at the risk of creating a trade war, because they want to end this drug war we currently are facing in America.\n\nItâs affecting your home beef industry too. Did you bring that up?\n\nNearly 400 processing licenses granted by the Chinese for processing and export from US packers expired. Theyâve not been renewed. I made my request clear to the Chinese that we need these licenses to be renewed, because this would have a big impact. Itâs somewhere between 50 and 80% in terms of supply of that market to China.\n\nI made that request directly to Vice Premier He Lifeng. It was noted. I havenât heard if itâs been resolved yet. But I made a direct ask.\n\nHow was it to bring an important message from the administration, but not as a diplomatic envoy?\n\nI was there with extensive experience â we had two children born in Hong Kong â in China. And I want to use my experience and relationships I had, and the respect I have in China, to be able to clearly communicate President Trumpâs policies. Specifically, the presidentâs focus on stopping the flow of fentanyl into the United States.\n\nIâve also been in communication with David Perdue [a former senator and Trumpâs nominee to be ambassador to China]. Davidâs been a friend of mine. Iâll be introducing him at the Foreign Relations Committee hearing when he comes before the committee.\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor principals"

      "text": "Republicans put Trumpâs court fight on the ballot\n\nSign up for Semafor Americana: An insiderâs guide to American power. Read it now .\n\nIn this article:\n\nOCONOMOWOC, Wis. â On Monday night, hundreds of conservatives packed into a brewhouse overlooking a baseball diamond to rally for a judge.\n\nâAmerica, last November, stepped right up to the edge of the abyss,â said Brad Schimel, the GOP-backed candidate for state supreme court on April 1. âDo you think the job is done? No wayâ¦ We want freedom-loving people who donât want to be a socialist nation to be heard.â\n\nDonald Trump Jr. warned that Republicans might âlose Wisconsinâ for good if Schimel didnât beat Democratic Party-backed nominee Susan Crawford and flip the courtâs current 4-3 liberal majority. Staff from Turning Point Action, which organized the rally and a âChase the Voteâ campaign, circled the room to find more volunteers. And former GOP Gov. Scott Walker said that the president needed their help to deport foreign criminals.\n\nâWhoâs trying to stop him? A judge,â said Walker. âWe donât want Susan Crawford and three other radicals on this court to say theyâre not going to let us deport the worst of the worst back to where they belong! We need Brad Schimel on the court!â\n\nWisconsinâs court race, already the most expensive in the stateâs history, pits a Democratic Party thatâs gotten very good at turning out in lower-profile elections against a MAGA coalition thatâs trying to catch up. As early voting began this week, the specter of judges overruling Trump motivated Republicans; the specter of pro-Trump judges taking his side scared Democrats, with still-fresh memories of a 2020 Trump campaign lawsuit that came one vote away from overturning the stateâs election.\n\nIn this article:\n\nThatâs meant more money from new sources â more than $11 million so far from Elon Musk and his PACs, his first intervention in a state court race. Itâs been spent behind a former state attorney general who entered the race early with a plan to ânationalize thisâ and âunite conservatives,â matching the expected out-of-state spending from liberals.\n\nDemocrats have worked to make Musk a problem for Republicans, with Crawford labeling her opponent âElon Schimelâ and national party figures holding anti-âoligarchyâ and anti-Musk rallies across the state.\n\nâDemocrats are looking for any possible way to fight back, to do something to relieve the just constant anxiety of this Trump/Musk onslaught,â said Democratic Party of Wisconsin chairman Ben Wikler, while hosting a âpet the voteâ event in Madison alongside his family dog, Pumpkin. âOrganizing to elect Susan Crawford gives them a channel for that energy.â\n\nRepublicans, just as confidently, have leaned on Trump. Unlike Dan Kelly, whose 2023 defeat gave liberals their majority, Schimel has embraced the GOP and campaigned at MAGA rallies; direct mail ads from Muskâs America PAC tell Republicans that the judge will âsupport President Trumpâs agendaâ if he wins.\n\nThis week, as early voting got underway, the presidentâs court reversals and denunciations of unfriendly judges echoed in Wisconsin. At the Oconomowoc rally, Trump Jr. marveled at how a deportation flight was halted by âsome random judge in the middle of nowhere,â linking it to the Schimel-Crawford race.\n\nâA liberal judge, just like this, wants to overrule the will of the President of the United States and the people who put him there with a mandate to end this nonsense,â Trump Jr. said.\n\nThe paid TV messaging that most voters will see, from the campaigns and Muskâs $10 million-plus PAC buys, have focused more on lurid crime stories than Trump. They include stories of child sex predators who didnât get maximum sentences (in anti-Crawford ads) and backlogged rape kits (in anti-Schimel ads) â little of it related to cases that would come before the stateâs high court.\n\nThe Trump angle is reserved for voters, contacted at their homes in person and in direct mail. In some settings, like his sole televised debate with Crawford, Schimel says he would rule impartially in any interaction with Trump or Musk. With conservative audiences, he is much more direct about his support for Trump, which supporters see as the way to pull out hundreds of thousands of Republicans who would otherwise ignore the race.\n\nâPeople are really fired up,â said Brett Galaszewski, the vice chair of the Milwaukee County GOP and national enterprise director at Turning Point Action, which has hundreds of paid staff in the state reaching Republicans who typically skip non-presidential elections. âTheyâre seeing the effects of what DOGE is doing, and what Trump has done in these first days of his presidency, and the everyday Wisconsinite wants more of that.â\n\nCrawford has gone after Schimelâs Musk and GOP ties, and has spoken more carefully about her own support from Democrats. The risk of the GOPâs MAGA campaign, she told Semafor, would be âthat it undermines the confidence of Wisconsin citizens in the impartiality of the judiciary and of the Supreme Court, in particular.â Schimel entered the race, he said on Monday, because he saw the Democrats working to âunravel the very foundation of our judicial system by promising how youâre going to rule on cases that arenât even filed.â\n\nBut the candidates have implemented those theories of the race very differently. Schimel has encouraged the president to endorse him, and to come to Wisconsin, but as a corrective to liberal overreach. Crawford has stayed well away from high-profile events organized by Bernie Sanders and Tim Walz.\n\nâIâm not going to discourage anyone who can attract a large audience, and wants to support my candidacy, from showing up,â she told Semafor. âBut I do want voters to understand that Iâm not coordinating with these folks.â The election, technically, is nonpartisan. But the campaign is not.\n\nThe trick to winning Wisconsinâs off-year spring elections, since the parties started polarizing and prioritizing them, is getting out the largest fraction of the usual partisan vote. Hundreds of thousands of people who voted red or blue for president will skip it. Thatâs inevitable. Two years ago, Justice Janet Protasiewicz won just 62% as many votes as Joe Biden did in 2020, but that was enough for a double-digit popular vote victory. Thatâs what Republicans want to overwhelm.\n\nTheyâve never tried to do that by running back to Trump voters. But the basic idea â telling voters that they have a partisan reason to vote in this nonpartisan race â has worked before. Five years ago, Republicans narrowly won the race for another seat on the court after Democrats out-spent them, running ads about conservative blog posts by candidate Brian Hagedorn. The Republican State Legislative Committee made a last-minute buy that accused liberals of lobbing âfalse attacks â¦ just like they did against Justice Kavanaugh.â\n\nThat was the last Democratic loss before Wikler took over the party. Republicans, through their alliance of outside groups, are trying to replicate what they think he did: selling national donors on the importance of the race, and organizing very early to find unlikely voters. The goal now, said Wikler, is to blow past the huge turnout from 2023 â more than 1 million votes for their candidate, a Democratic record â with deeper organizing. Holding the seat had been part of a multi-year plan to break Republican control of the state, and they would use Musk to remind them of the stakes.\n\nâDoor knocks more than double what we did in 2023, phone calls more than double,â said Wikler. âRelational friend to friend outreach, more than quadrupled.â\n\nDemocratsâ data suggests that the Musk message is the most powerful motivator for their voters, now that the brief liberal majority has fulfilled one of their 2023 campaign goals, new legislative district maps, and may fulfill another: striking down the stateâs 1849 abortion ban. Republicans believe that their issues are more vital and immediate to the hard-to-get voters. Every day, they are hearing about some Trump setback, and theyâre being told that this is a way to stop them.\n\nIf that works for Republicans, at a moment when Democrats are feeling depressed by their partyâs national leaders, it would reveal a strategy that the GOP can use for the rest of the year. And it would devastate Democrats, who have been outperforming in special elections since they turned over the White House. When I asked Walz what defeat would mean, he didnât try to spin it. âOh my God, thatâs it,â he said. âThatâs the country. Thatâs the republic. Thatâs everything.â\n\nShah Mehdi, 40, who planned to vote early for Schimel, said that he was sick of Democratic attacks on both Musk and Trump, who he has complete faith in; he had traveled to DC for Trumpâs inauguration rally and caught one of the pens the president threw to the audience after signing a pile of executive orders.\n\nâThey are attacking patriot Elon and heâs rescuing astronauts from space and removing waste from our hard-earned tax dollars,â Mehdi said. âItâs crazy.â\n\nSammie Sackmann, a Democrat whoâd come to Eau Claire to hear Walz speak, said that a Schimel win would empower Trump to do so many things she feared. âOur town is already behind in so many things, like education,â she said. âFor us to take things away from people who canât even vote yet, to take away their future â it would be unthinkable.â\n\nTransparent news, distilled views, and global perspectives.\n\nSign up for Semafor americana"

      "text": "Trump Doubles Down on Trade War, Threatening China With More Tariffs\n\nP resident Donald Trump on Monday doubled down on his trade war and threatened to levy even higher tariffs on China this week, as markets endured a third day of intense volatility.\n\n\"We've been ripped off and taken advantage of by many countries over the years, and can't do it anymore,\" Trump told reporters during a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in the Oval Office on Monday. \"We have many, many countries that are coming to negotiate deals with us, and they're going to be fair deals.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump's commitment to his tariffs comes amid mounting pressure from economists, investors, and even Republicans in Congress for the White House to pause a trade strategy many fear could drive a global recession. Last week, Trump imposed a 10% across-the-board tariff on imports, as well as additional tariffs on some 90 countries. On Sunday, Goldman Sachs said the probability of a recession in the next 12 months had jumped to 45%.\n\n\"We have $36 trillion in debt. I want to get rid of it, and we can do it quickly with proper deals,\" Trump said Monday. \"Countries don't allow us to sell our product, but we allow them to sell their product...They charge us massive amounts of money for the privilege of going into their country. Those days are over.\"\n\nThe meeting marked the first time Trump met in-person with a foreign leader since he unveiled the sweeping new tariffs last week in a rambling and unclear announcement in which he described an opaque formula used to calculate higher tariff rates on adversaries and allies alike. The strategy drew puzzlement from economists, who quickly found errors and inconsistencies in how the administration calculated the new tariff rates.\n\nSome countries have attempted to quickly show they can address Trump's unhappiness with the current trade status quo. During Monday's press meeting, Netanyahu claimed he would work hard to \"quickly\" eliminate the trade deficit with the U.S.-though President Trump did not respond with a commitment to reduce the new 17% tariff on the country. \"Don't forget, we help Israel a lot,\" Trump said in reference to the billions of aid the U.S. sends their closest Middle Eastern ally.\n\nOthers have responded more firmly. China retaliated with a 34% tariff against American imports, which the President criticized during the press conference and on his social media platform.  \"If China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading abuses by tomorrow, April 8th, 2025, the United States will impose ADDITIONAL Tariffs on China of 50%, effective April 9th,\" Trump threatened on Truth Social Monday morning.\n\nSeveral business leaders have called on Trump to pause the implementation of his tariffs and impose a more predictable strategy to pressure more manufacturers to produce goods inside the U.S. Bill Ackman, a hedge fund manager who has supported Trump, warned of a \"self-induced, economic nuclear winter\" if Trump doesn't change course. \"By placing massive and disproportionate tariffs on our friends and our enemies alike and thereby launching a global economic war against the whole world at once, we are in the process of destroying confidence in our country as a trading partner, as a place to do business, and as a market to invest capital,\" Ackman wrote Sunday on X.\n\nTrump said he wasn't worried about driving trading partners to China, claiming that many countries have already approached him about negotiations.\n\nTo some extent, Trump recognized that building up domestic manufacturing and bringing back jobs would take time.\n\n\"You got to build a thing called the factory. You have to build your energy. You have to do a lot of things,\" he said. \"I'm giving them energy. You know, we're going to let them build their own power plants. They'll be their own ... We need massive amounts of electricity. We're going to compete with China and others.\"\n\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Mike Johnson Could Shut Down Trump's Tariffs\n\nSenior Correspondent\n\nSenior Correspondent\n\nT his article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME's politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nThere is one person aside from Donald Trump who could definitely put an end to this economic chaos . His name is Mike Johnson. And the House Speaker would really, really like it if you could keep his name out your mouth.\n\nAs the President continues to goad a global meltdown unseen in decades, Speaker Johnson is trying to keep the MAGA meltdown away from his fellow House Republicans. Trump has triggered an utter circus that may haunt GOP lawmakers for a generation and retirees into their graves. Even Trump allies like Sens. Rand Paul and Chuck Grassley-for different reasons, sure-are sounding an alarm about the repercussions of these add-ons.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRep. Don Bacon, an Omaha Republican, has legislation teed up in the House to make a move against Trump's unilateral emergency tariffs. His bill lacks sufficient public support from GOP colleagues for now, but the private frustrations among lawmakers are starting to pile up. For now, most are not willing to defy the President. A similar bill in the Senate has bipartisan backing , and would almost certainly draw more Republicans if they could be sure they weren't walking the plank only to see Johnson toss it in a desk drawer to die.\n\nIf Johnson were to give the green light to a measure reasserting Congress' authority over tariffs, things would change really quickly on Capitol Hill. There would likely be majorities in both chambers for such legislation-perhaps even large enough to override the veto Trump promised on Monday to issue if such a bill reached his desk. But such a bold move could very well lead to Johnson getting a pink slip from his caucus, as his Speakership barely happened, and only then with Trump's intervention.\n\nFor his part, Trump seems utterly undeterred by this political quagmire.\n\n\"We're going to get fair deals and good deals with everybody. And if we don't, we're going to have nothing to do with them. They're not going to be allowed to participate in the United States,\" he said Monday.\n\nIt is, to be clear, an entirely avoidable cul-de-sac of chaos that Trump is steering the economy toward. And, if House members were willing to vote their conscience, this would end in short order. Also to be clear: they are not.\n\nAccess to international markets is the lifeblood for a lot of red districts' economies-think tractors, soy beans, medical devices-and making those products less appealing as exports is a first punch in a one-two combo that now includes higher costs in the aisles for imports that used to be cheaper goods from China, Singapore, and India.\n\nThe hit hasn't come at the check-out line just yet, but investors are seeing the trouble just around the corner and reacting with contempt. At the White House on Monday, Trump dismissed those playing the markets as stupid cowards who did not share his optimism that a golden age of American power is just off the horizon, if only they have the patience. \"Tariffs will make this country very rich,\" Trump said in a free-wheeling session in the Oval Office as the Israeli Prime Minister seemed to play the role of a potted plant.\n\nAs the White House continued to insist everything is fine and even floated a spin-up of tariffs on China to reach 130% penalties, Wall Street continued to slide into an open rebellion against a White House that not that long ago seemed like a natural ally. Even a European Union proposal to zero-out tariffs on some U.S. goods proved insufficient for Trump, who said \"the E.U. has been very tough over the years.\"\n\nThe fast-moving snowball stands to drive up prices on almost every single item in U.S. families' cupboards. Some Trump officials continue to suggest this is merely the opening of a negotiation, while the President and others say the new tariff regime is irrevocable and righteous retaliation.\n\nAll the while, the House seems to be sitting in a passive crouch, watching the tariff crisis gaining speed and acting as if it has no offramp at its disposal.\n\nThe politics of this are entirely predictable and precarious. The House map has already proven frail. The Senate map is only slightly fungible. GOP holds in state races are fragile. If you're not catching the trend, there are a lot of F-based words on the offing when it comes to Republican dominance. And it isn't getting easier as markets flail.\n\nMonday's developments were greeted with grimace around town. Goldman Sachs escalated the odds of a recession to 45% in a note to investors. K Street players have been warning lawmakers of problems in their districts on goods ranging from seed oil to auto components, airplanes to wheat thrashers. If all politics is local, then all tariffs are pitfalls.\n\nFor now, Johnson is maintaining his support of whatever Trump wants. But if the Speaker were to blink, there are very good odds that his team would shelve their red MAGA hats briefly enough to rollback Trump's tariffs. Yet any swerve away from Trump's blessed route risks ending with House Republicans pursuing a vote-of-no-confidence against Johnson, who has so far been impressively steady at the helm of a caucus that is unwieldy at best.\n\nThat's why, among some Republicans on the Hill-especially in the upper ranks of senior aides-there is a professed indifference to these rumblings.\n\n\"Everything is garbage. That much was true last week. It is true this week. It will be true next week. Everyone needs to calm down,\" a top hand in House Republicans' Leadership texted me early Monday. \"You can panic all you want. But President Trump is still the leader of the party. Speaker Johnson has the gavel. Leader [John] Thune runs the Senate. And the Supreme Court is our friend. As the kids say: STFU .\"\n\nThe bifurcated Rome-is-Burning/ Steady-as-she-Goes posture is what is driving the conservative movement in Congress at the moment. No one loves that Trump has a monopoly on the party, but it's been a marriage of necessity since 2015. But that arrangement is being tested, as the phone lines on Capitol Hill burn up with constituents worried about their retirement accounts and the future of local businesses.\n\nWhich brings us back to Johnson, an accidental Speaker whose majority is on the cusp and his loyalty is at best marginal. His rank-and-file members on Monday were feeling the burn of a Trump stunt that has cost the economy trillions in less than a week. The fall-off on markets since Trump's Inauguration Day has been as steep as any in recent memory. And no one is credibly dismissing it as a blip any longer.\n\nPut simply: the tariff crisis is Trump's doing, but it's Johnson and his Republican hostage-takers who keep it alive.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington.

      "text": "Is the U.S. Heading Into a Recession Amid Trump's Tariffs? 'Liberation Day' Fallout Sparks Fresh Fears\n\nReporter\n\nReporter\n\nO n April 2, President Donald Trump held his long-promised \"Liberation Day,\" during which he took to the Rose Garden of the White House and announced a vast swath of tariffs that he will be implementing.\n\nTrump's \"Liberation Day\" moves saw the introduction of a 10% tariff on all imported goods, and additional import taxes-of varying degrees-placed on 60 other countries.\n\nThe U.S. and global markets have already started to feel the impact of Trump's tariffs, with the U.S. stock market taking the worst hit thus far. At the end of Thursday, April 3, Dow Jones closed at 1,700 points lower. Plus, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indexes had their worst day since 2020. Thursday also ended with the U.S. dollar dipping to a six-month low against the EURO, falling along with U.S. bond yields .\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOn Friday, April 4, morning reports showed that as of 10:30 a.m. ET, the S&P 500 index was down 193 points (3.58%). The Wall Street slump and global dip in stocks has sparked fresh fears in economists and concerns as to whether the U.S. is heading into a recession.\n\nHowever, in the midst of the market turmoil, a news release from the Bureau of Labor Statistics on Friday showed a stronger-than-expected employment report , with 228,000 jobs created in March.\n\nTrump addressed the employment numbers in a Truth Social post on Friday morning, stating that the report was \"far better than expected.\" \"It's already working,\" he wrote. \"Hang tough, we can't lose.\"\n\nDuring an appearance on NBC's Meet the Press on Sunday, April 6, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent was asked about the market turmoil and said \"there doesn't have to be a recession.\"\n\n\"We get these short-term market reactions from time to time. The market consistently underestimates Donald Trump,\" Bessent said. \"I remember that in 2016, the night President Trump won, the market crashed. And it turned out he was going to be the most pro-business president in over a century, maybe in the history of the country. And we went on to very high after-inflation returns for the next four years.\"\n\nBut Sen. Adam Schiff, a Democrat serving in California, expressed deep concerns from across the aisle during his own interview on the Sunday morning show. \"I hope and pray we stay out of recession. But if we head into a recession, it will be the Trump recession. He will completely own it. This is a completely self-destructive economic act that he's engaged in,\" Schiff said. \"And it's not just the tariffs. It's also the freezing of funds, the firing of people, the alienation of our allies in California. I'm hearing from farmers who still haven't recovered market share from the tariffs during the first Trump administration. I'm hearing from people in the tourist industry. You have people from other countries now who don't want to come here, most particularly Canadians.\"\n\nEconomists also expressed concerns when talking to TIME. Felix Tintelnot, associate professor of economics at Duke University, says that though tariffs are meant to stimulate economic growth and production in the U.S., the uncertainty generated from the Trump Administration's tariff delays and changes has had the opposite effect.\n\n\"Looking back over the last few weeks, we have had so many revisions to past tariff proposals that it's really difficult to tell for decision-makers in the industry what the tariff policy will be in the next couple of months, and then the rational response to that is to delay investment,\" Tintelnot says, remarking that people are expecting even further changes. \"If everyone does that, then you're generating a recession.\"\n\nHere's what you need to know about the fresh recession fears amid Trump's highly controversial tariffs.\n\nTrump had initially publicized his tariffs as \"reciprocal tariffs\" -meaning taxes on other countries equal to the existing tariffs foreign countries have set against American goods.\n\nHowever, the tariffs announced on Trump's \"Liberation Day\" were not, in fact, reciprocally calculated but instead were calculated based on countries' U.S. trade deficit levels. Countries with which the U.S. has a higher trade deficit received a higher tariff.\n\nIn addition to this, the math used by the Trump Administration to come up with these tariffs also factored in each country's exports to the U.S.\n\nPer an Axios breakdown : \"The formula is to divide the U.S. trade deficit with each country by that country's exports to the U.S. The final reciprocal tariff was then divided by 2, with a minimum of 10% (which applies even to those countries with which the U.S. has a trade surplus).\"\n\nTintelnot says that the logic is confusing-for example, Israel eliminated tariffs on U.S. goods on April 1, but were still hit hard by a 17% tariff in the April 2 announcement. The resounding response from the global economist community has been one of confusion about how exactly the incremental tariffs added on top of the 10% tariffs was calculated.\n\n\"It's murky,\" says Brian Bethune, professor of economics at Boston College, emphasizing his belief that the tariffs are likely to change again, adding even more \"uncertainty\" to trade policies.\n\n\"The fact that countries that charge zero tariffs on the U.S. have been hit with tariffs illustrates that these are not reciprocal tariffs in their true meaning,\" Tintelnot says, in agreement. \"It is perfectly normal in an integrated global economy for a bilateral trade deficit to exist. A little introspection helps: You have a bilateral trade deficit with your grocery store, but a bilateral trade surplus with your employer. Why would you put a tariff on your local grocery store?\"\n\nTintelnot also notes that this method of tariff calculation hits a wall because \"trade deficit can change.\" This only adds to the uncertainty already being expressed by businesses, and again, economists are in agreement that uncertainty is not good for recession calculations and only fuels the risk.\n\nPer analysis conducted by The Budget Lab at Yale , Trump's April 2 tariffs are the equivalent of a rise in the effective U.S. tariff rate of 11.5 percentage points. \"The average effective U.S. tariff rate after incorporating all 2025 tariffs is now 22 1⁄2%, the highest since 1909,\" per the policy research center's data.\n\nSome countries, including Brazil, are seemingly intending to impose retaliatory tariffs back onto the U.S., thus raising concerns of a far-reaching trade war.\n\nOn Friday, April 4, China announced that they will respond with a 34% retaliatory tariff on U.S. goods beginning on April 10 , matching the U.S.' \"Liberation Day\" tariffs placed on them.\n\nAlthough Canada has not been hit with the so-called reciprocal tariffs issued on April 2, the auto industry-related tariffs and others will impact Canada. In a public address on April 3 , the newly-instated Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said: \"Three different sets of U.S. tariffs remain in place and will continue to pose significant threats to Canadian workers and business. They are all unjustified, unwarranted, and in our judgement, misguided.\"\n\nTintelnot highlights that it's important to note how \"extreme\" all of Trump's tariffs are. \"There is no other industrialized country currently in the world that charges tariffs as high as those announced by the U.S.\" he says.\n\nRead More : Why Economists Are Horrified by Trump's Tariff Math\n\nAccording to Tintelnot, recession indicators have risen as the impact of Trump's tariffs take hold.\n\nOn Thursday, Dow Jones plunged 1,700 points , the broader S&P 500 index was 4% lower, and the tech-heavy Nasdaq sank almost 6% .\n\nBethune says Americans are already concerned about a possible U.S. recession , pointing to the drop in consumer sentiment seen over the past couple of months. In March, a University of Michigan survey showed a significant drop in consumer sentiment as respondents cited tariff whiplash and policy uncertainty.\n\n\"[Consumers] are not even going to the grocery store and paying more for vegetables because there's none available from Mexico, or going to Whole Foods, for example, and finding the big sections of fresh fruit are being shut down. They haven't really felt the full impact [yet], and they're already saying something isn't right,\" Bethune says.\n\nHowever, while some economists, including Tintelnot, are more cautious in their discussion about a possible recession, Bethune says it's \"inevitable.\" The question, he says, is just how long until it happens and for how long will it occur? He sees Trump's admission of there being \" some pain\" on the horizon as only proof of the inevitability.\n\n\"At least they [the Trump Administration] are not pretending that it's not disruptive, but they're basically soft-selling it, reflecting their ignorance about the way business operates,\" Bethune claims.\n\nRead More : Is Your 401(k) Affected by Trump's Tariffs? Here's What to Know and What You Should Do\n\nOn April 3, as markets dipped, Trump told reporters that \"it's going very well.\"\n\n\"The markets are going to boom. The stock is going to boom. The country is going to boom,\" Trump said as he left the White House.\n\nTrump had previously addressed recession fears in the lead-up to the April 2 tariffs. After signing his memorandum announcing the reciprocal tariffs on Feb. 13, Trump spoke to reporters and said that prices \"could go up somewhat\" at first, but then \"prices will also go down.\"\n\nSince then, Trump has expressed the same sentiment-stating there could be \" some pain \" felt by consumers, but in the end it will be worth the trouble, and he believes our economy will ultimately benefit from the tariffs.\n\n\"I hate to predict things like that,\" Trump said when asked if he is expecting a recession this year, during an interview with Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures on March 9. \"There is a period of transition, because what we're doing is very big. We're bringing wealth back to America. There are always periods of... it takes a little time. It takes a little time. But I think it should be great for us.\"\n\nDuring another interview on Saturday, March 29, Trump told NBC News that he \"couldn't care less\" if automakers raised prices because of new moves he announced on March 26 to impose a 25% tariff on imports of automobiles and certain automobile parts. \"I couldn't care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars,\" Trump said in response to a Wall Street Journal report that stated Trump held a call in March with automaker CEOs and threatened them with even higher tariffs if they raise prices because of the import taxes. Trump denied making such a threat. Doubling down that he \"couldn't care less,\" Trump added: \"If the prices on foreign cars go up, they're going to buy American cars.\"\n\nOn April 2, ahead of Trump unveiling his tariffs, the White House posted an article titled \"Tariffs Work-and President Trump's First Term Proves It,\" pointing to tariffs in his first term as evidence that these new tariffs will stimulate the economy.\n\n\"Despite the rhetoric from politicians and the media, studies have repeatedly shown tariffs are an effective tool for achieving economic and strategic objectives-just as they did in President Trump's first term,\" the article reads.\n\nTintelnot says, though, that these tariff announcements are unlike other tariffs in the past, pointing to how the U.S. dollar has now fallen \"substantially against the Euro.\"\n\n\"I think what this is indicative of is that there's just a flight of capital and assets outside away from the U.S. in response to this policy announcement,\" Tintelnot says, adding that the tariffs are much higher this time around, \"meaning we are in for a bigger price shock than in 2018-2019.\"\n\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

      "text": "Appeasing President Donald Trump Won't Work\n\ncontributor\n\nPresident Donald Trump announces tariffs on auto imports in the Oval Office of the White House in Washington, DC, on March 26, 2025.\n\ncontributor\n\nI t's common for organizations to coach staff on de-escalating conflict. Psychiatrists and teachers, clergy and cops are all trained to defuse volatile situations before they spin out of control. The idea is not to make matters worse by adding tension to an already stressful state of affairs and to buy time to calmly assess the situation, establish some connection with those involved, and offer solutions that don't involve the use of force.\n\nAs a college president myself, I understand the value of de-escalation. Indeed, colleges and universities tend to be pretty good at this. Rather than fight with angry protesters on campus, a staff member these days is more likely to ask them questions to start a dialogue. Ideally, those considering themselves adversaries come to see each other as having some fundamental things in common. I was surprised last year during campus protests around the war in Gaza when a mediator suggested that those negotiating begin by acknowledging their shared affection for the university. It turned out to be a trust building moment that calmed things down.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt's hard to find anyone who has a bad word to say about de-escalation. The problem is that de-escalation isn't always possible and right now some powerful institutions seem to view only one other path as possible: appeasement, a method of engagement far less likely to elicit praise and far more likely to cause damage. And they're jumping to it quickly.\n\nThe paradigmatic case of appeasement , of course, is England's Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain's giving Germany a free hand to seize parts of Czechoslovakia in order to achieve what the Prime Minister called \"peace for our time.\" To \"appease\" means to satisfy someone's demands and pacify that person by giving them what they say they want. But this approach typically fails-whether it's giving in to a toddler's demand for ice cream or a dictator's demand for territory-when we are sure that the person making the demand will be back for more.\n\nAppeasement is in bad odor because it doesn't work. Stories of de-escalation recount how tense situations can be dealt with rationally once the temperature is brought down. Stories of appeasement remind us that some people may never be satisfied-no matter how much one gives into them.\n\nWhen the Trump Administration threatened earlier this month to cut off hundreds of millions of dollars of federal funding from Columbia University unless the university agreed to a list of demands, Columbia had to figure out a response. The reason given by the Administration was that the university \"may have failed to protect Jewish students,\" though there was no indication of a serious investigation into this alleged failure. Nor were established procedures for adjudicating such a failure followed; the government didn't even deign to give the appearance of doing so.\n\nBut the loss of government funding would have had profound ramifications, which is why, I presume, the university gave in to the Trump Administration's demands, promising, among other things, to hire dozens of police officers with the power to arrest students and to appoint a new senior vice provost to oversee Middle Eastern studies.\n\nIn a letter to the Columbia community, interim president Katrina Armstrong attempted to dress its decision in the rhetoric of mission, values and continuous improvement-stating that \"For Columbia and great universities like it, nothing could be more sacrosanct than academic freedom and free expression.\" But the university's statement incited fierce criticism from defenders of academic freedom while getting only a tepid nod from the Trump Administration. Indeed, the Administration's demands have been described as merely \"a precondition for formal negotiations\" ; the White House may call for other \"immediate and long-term structural reforms.\" Peace at Columbia may be quite short lived.\n\nColumbia was faced with a very difficult situation, to be sure, but the speed at which it capitulated was striking. It could have relied on its donors and its endowments to push back against the government's demands. As author Charlie Eaton recently noted , $15 billion is enough to at least try to fight a president's overreach. Many constitutional scholars (of various political leanings) thought Columbia had a strong case. Maintaining endowment strength is not unimportant, but spending power without academic freedom also buys you moral bankruptcy.\n\nIt's not only academia that has been put in a challenging position. On March 14, President Trump issued executive orders retaliating against three firms he believes challenge his priorities by denying them access to any federal buildings or security clearances and terminating their federal contracts. Of the three originally targeted firms, Covington & Burling did not respond to the order and Perkins Coie resisted and won a partial victory against the order. But Paul Weiss ultimately caved . Others now seem poised to do so .\n\nWhen Paul Weiss' managing partner Brad Karp went to the Oval Office, he may have hoped for de-escalation. He is an experienced litigator, a person well-versed in Washington politics, and someone who likely thought he might find some common ground with people in the White House-perhaps through a shared affection for the constitution. Instead, he left having promised to donate $40 million in pro bono legal work for the President's causes. In doing so, he went beyond appeasement to outright collaboration.\n\nDe-escalation works when there is a reciprocal relationship among the parties involved. People begin to recognize, often just by slowing down a little, that the intensity of the conflict serves neither side. But when at least one party is willing to wreck things, attempts to de-escalate fail. In the case of Columbia, the White House has shown no concern for if studies on diabetes, cancer, and strokes are just halted. However, the university does care and is desperate to protect the research enterprise central to its mission. That desperation means the White House has the power to demand more.\n\nPaul Weiss, meanwhile, chose to placate the President in hopes it would benefit its business, arguing it did not abandon its principles in the process. Chamberlain would have understood.\n\nAlthough the President rescinded the order against the firm, there is no guarantee he won't command more if he's displeased with a case or client they take on. Soon after the agreement, in fact, he talked derisively about law firms now wanting to \"make deals\" with him. On social media Trump crowed that Karp had admitted to wrongdoing by a previous partner and agreed to end diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) policies at the firm-even though the agreement Karp shared did not mention the former partner or DEI.\n\nHere too, giving in was not the only choice. It would not have been shocking to see a major law firm depending on the rule of law-fighting the Administration in the courts. As with Columbia, many legal experts think litigation would have had a significant prospect of success . But the short-term costs were more important than the constitutional principles.\n\nThe partners at Paul Weiss didn't serve their long-term interests, and neither did the acting president of Columbia. Leaders today must shine a bright light on abuses of power and challenge them through political channels and the courts. We must underscore that our freedoms are worth defending. Many decision makers are afraid, and so they choose a path of appeasement with a White House bent on revenge and aggrandizing power, hoping it will work. It won't.\n\nMichael S.

      "text": "Trump and Netanyahu Set to Meet Again on Monday to Discuss Gaza, Tariffs, and More\n\nAP\n\nAP\n\nP ALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla. - President Donald Trump plans to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday in what would be their second White House sit-down since Trump's return to office.\n\nThe visit, confirmed by a White House official and Netanyahu's office Saturday, comes as Israel deploys troops in a new security corridor across Gaza to pressure the Hamas militant group. Netanyahu's defense minister has said Israel will seize large areas of the territory and add them to its so-called security zones.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLast month, Israel shattered the cease-fire with a surprise bombardment in Gaza after trying to pressure Hamas to accept proposed new terms for the cease-fire, a move supported by the White House. Hundreds of Palestinians have since been killed.\n\nIsrael has pledged to escalate the war in Gaza until Hamas returns the remaining hostages seized in the Oct. 7, 2023, attack that sparked the war, disarms and leaves the territory. Israel also has halted all supplies of food, fuel and humanitarian aid into Gaza.\n\nNetanyahu's office in a statement on social media said he and Trump would discuss \"the tariff issue, the efforts to return our hostages, Israel-Turkey relations, the Iranian threat and the battle against the International Criminal Court.\" Israel faces a 17% tariff.\n\nNetanyahu is wanted by the court for alleged crimes against humanity in Gaza. The U.S. is not a member of the court.\n\nIn February, Netanyahu became the first foreign leader invited to the White House during Trump's second term. Their meeting focused on Israel's war with Hamas and the next steps as a cease-fire deal took hold.\n\nAt a joint news conference afterward, Trump made the surprise proposal that displaced Palestinians in Gaza be permanently resettled outside the territory and the United States take \"ownership\" in redeveloping the area into \"the Riviera of the Middle East.\" Palestinians objected to leaving their homeland, and Arab nations and rights groups sharply criticized the idea.\n\nThat February meeting gave Netanyahu a chance to remind the world of the Trump administration's support for Israel, defend the conduct of the war and distract from political pressures back home.\n\nThose pressures have only grown as Israelis protest both the lack of a deal to bring remaining hostages home from Gaza and Netanyahu's moves to fire the head of the country's domestic security agency and its attorney general. He also faces calls to accept responsibility for his role in failing to prevent the Oct. 7. attack.\n\nIn a statement Saturday, relatives of hostages held in Gaza pleaded with Trump to \"please use all your power to pressure Netanyahu to end this war and bring our hostages back now.\"\n\n\"We are addressing President Trump: Netanyahu is lying when he says that military pressure will bring back the abductees. The only way to quickly return all the abductees is to end the war and return them all in one fell swoop,\" Ifat Calderon, aunt of hostage Ofer Calderon, said in Tel Aviv, Israel.\n\nHamas says it will only release the remaining 59 hostages - 24 of whom are believed to be alive - in exchange for the release of more Palestinian prisoners, a lasting cease-fire and an Israeli pullout from Gaza.\n\nThe Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Some 251 hostages were taken, most of them since released in cease-fire agreements and other deals.\n\nMore than 50,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza as part of Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't say whether those killed are civilians or combatants. Israel says it has killed around 20,000 militants, without providing evidence.\n\nMeanwhile, police arrested two of Netanyahu's close associates this week on suspicion of accepting money from Qatar to promote a positive image of the Gulf Arab state in Israel. Qatar is a key mediator for Hamas in its negotiations with Israel but denies backing the militant group. Netanyahu says the case is baseless.\n\nThe prime minister is also the subject of a long-running corruption trial and regularly rails against a \"deep state\" that he alleges is out to get him.\n\nTrump says the first foreign trip of his second administration will include stops in Saudi Arabia, Qatar and possibly the United Arab Emirates, and \"other places.\" The trip could come as soon as May. Trump has said he wants to reward Saudi Arabia for its investment in the U.S. and that all three Gulf countries would be making commitments to creating jobs in the U.S. during his trip.\n\n-Associated Press writers Natalie Melzer in Jerusalem, Darlene Superville in Washington and Cara Anna contributed to this report.\n\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

      "text": "What Trump's Executive Order on Ticket Price-Gouging Could Mean for Concertgoers\n\nStaff Writer\n\nStaff Writer\n\nA new executive order signed by President Trump Monday aims to hit all the right notes with concertgoers by addressing the price-gouging of tickets for live events.\n\nIt orders the Federal Trade Commission to ensure price transparency at all stages of ticket buying and the Attorney General to ensure that ticket scalpers are abiding by the law and Internal Revenue Code. The executive order claims it will double down on enforcing the Better Online Ticket Sales (BOTS) Act, which targets scalpers who use bots to purchase tickets and resell them at much higher prices-profiting the scalper instead of the artist.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It is a big problem,\" Trump said during a signing ceremony in the Oval Office, claiming that the new executive order would be a step towards lowering \"crazy ticket prices.\"\n\nKid Rock stood next to the commander-in-chief in a red-white-and-blue jumpsuit emblazoned with the American flag.\n\n\"I want the fans to have fair ticket prices, to be able to go enjoy more shows,\" said the Grammy-nominated artist, whose real name is Robert James Ritchie. \"I'd like to take my ticket price lower, but if I set my ticket prices low, these bots immediately eat them up, and they resell for hundreds of dollars more, and I'm just making these bad actors rich.\"\n\nTrump's executive order comes after the administration of his predecessor Joe Biden sued Ticketmaster last year, accusing it of running an illegal monopoly over live events.\n\nThe New York Times recently reported on the growing number of Gen Z concertgoers who are willing to go into debt in order to see their favorite performers. In 1996, the average ticket for a top 100 tour went for about $25, while today average ticket prices are about $135, per Pollstar , a trade publication that covers the live music industry. The issue of price-gouging gained new attention in the last couple of years when tickets for Taylor Swift's Eras tour sold for tens of thousands of dollars.\n\nIn a statement published by Variety , leading ticket reseller StubHub railed against what it called the \"live entertainment monopoly\" and commended Trump for \"taking steps to better protect fans from ticket bots and bad actors who exploit vulnerabilities in the primary ticket market.\" Live Nation Entertainment, Ticketmaster's parent company, issued a press release thanking Trump for signing the executive order, stating, \"We support any meaningful resale reforms,\" including \"caps on resale prices.\"\n\nThe executive order does not get into caps. Music industry analyst Bob Lefsetz called the executive order \"grandstanding\" in his newsletter , arguing, \"In reality the order says nothing. Other than ticket scalpers make a lot of money and they must pay taxes on their revenue.\" He wrote that the BOTS act has been rarely used because not enough money has been delegated to enforce it and expressed doubt that such funds would be allocated given the new Department of Government Efficiency's efforts to reduce government spending .\n\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

      "text": "'Inflation Day Rather Than Liberation Day': How the World Is Reacting to Trump's Latest Tariffs\n\nD onald Trump's promised \"Liberation Day\" was originally planned for Tuesday, April 1, until the President told reporters last month he pushed it back 24 hours so it wouldn't be viewed as an April Fool's joke. \"Nobody would believe what I said,\" he explained.\n\nPerhaps he knew that his announcement on Wednesday, April 2, would sound a bit ridiculous-but everyone is certainly taking it seriously now.\n\nTrump announced \"reciprocal\" tariffs on imports from nearly every nation on earth-allies and adversaries alike-in a move that is expected to rock the U.S. economy and will upend global trade.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeveral world leaders have already pushed back against the latest tariffs-which were set at a minimum of 10% and rise as high as 50% for the hardest-hit countries-some promising swift countermeasures that could effectively force economies everywhere to become more insular, others asking for an opportunity to negotiate to avoid all-out trade war.\n\nHere's a rundown of the responses so far.\n\nPrime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters in Melbourne on Thursday that Trump's tariffs \"have no basis in logic and they go against the basis\" of the diplomatic alliance between Australia and the U.S. \"This is not the act of a friend,\" Albanese said, adding that Australia does not plan to retaliate with its own tariffs against the U.S.\n\nBrazil, which was hit with a 10% tariff, passed a reciprocity bill on Wednesday allowing it to retaliate against tariffs imposed on Brazilian goods by any country or trade bloc. Brazilian President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva earlier said it was considering appealing to the World Trade Organization over Trump's steel tariffs.\n\n\"The new measure, like the tariffs already imposed on the steel, aluminum, and automobile sectors, violates the United States' commitments to the World Trade Organization and will impact all Brazilian exports of goods to the United States,\" Brazil's Foreign Ministry said in a statement. \"The Brazilian government is evaluating all possible actions to ensure reciprocity in bilateral trade, including resorting to the World Trade Organization, in defense of legitimate national interests.\"\n\nThe Minister of Labour and Vocational Training for Cambodia, which was slammed with one of the highest \"reciprocal\" tariff rates at 49%, said the country will be able to manage the consequences of the U.S. tariffs, despite concerns. Heng Sour said on Thursday that the tariff increase \"is not politically motivated nor intended as a sanction against Cambodia,\" adding that several other Asian countries were hit with similarly high rates. \"Therefore, the tariff impact on Cambodia's production costs is not significantly more severe compared to other competing countries.\"\n\n\"However, by 2027,\" Heng Sour warned, \"we may face challenges if the U.S. eases tariffs on other countries, but Cambodia [does] not see such reductions.\"\n\nChina, which was slapped with a 34% reciprocal tariff on top of existing 20% tariffs on Chinese imports, vowed to impose its own countermeasures.\n\n\"China urges the U.S. to immediately revoke its unilateral tariff measures and work with trading partners to resolve differences through fair and constructive dialogue,\" China's Ministry of Commerce said in a statement in Chinese on Wednesday night. The reciprocal tariffs \"violate international trade rules, infringe upon the legitimate rights and interests of other parties, and represent an act of unilateral bullying,\" the ministry added. \"There are no winners in a trade war, and protectionism is not a viable path forward.\"\n\nA foreign ministry spokesperson also echoed the commerce ministry on Thursday, saying of Trump's tariffs: \"This gravely violates WTO rules, and undermines the rules-based multilateral trading system. China firmly rejects this and will do what is necessary to defend our legitimate rights and interests.\"\n\nColombian President Gustavo Petro posted on X on Thursday: \"Today, neoliberalism, which proclaimed a free trade policy across the globe, is dead. ... The US government now believes that by raising tariffs on its imports in general, it can increase its own production, wealth, and employment; in my opinion, this may be a big mistake.\"\n\nPetro added that Colombia and other Latin American countries could benefit from Trump's tariffs-and that Colombia will take a nuanced approach to any potential countermeasures. \"Colombian businesses must know how to take advantage of opportunities. Agro-industrial and semi-industrial products from countries outside Latin America are becoming more expensive in US markets, and if we can produce these goods more cheaply, it's time to export them there,\" he wrote. \"We will only make US imports more expensive if they take away our jobs. But we won't raise tariffs if their goods help create higher-value jobs.\"\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement on Wednesday that the European Union is finalizing a package of countermeasures in response to Trump's previously imposed 25% levy on steel-which is exempt from additional reciprocal tariffs-and is now preparing further countermeasures against Trump's 20% reciprocal tariffs on the E.U.\n\n\"We have always been ready to negotiate with the U.S., to remove any remaining barriers to Transatlantic trade,\" von der Leyen said. \"At the same time, we are prepared to respond ... to protect our interests and our businesses if negotiations fail.\"\n\nTrump's universal tariffs are a \"major blow to the world economy,\" von der Leyen added. \"Let's be clear-eyed about the immense consequences. The global economy will massively suffer. Uncertainty will spiral and trigger the rise of further protectionism. The consequences will be dire for millions of people around the globe.\"\n\n\"All businesses-big and small-will suffer from day one,\" von der Leyen said. \"From greater uncertainty to the disruption of supply chains to burdensome bureaucracy.\"\n\nFiji's Deputy Prime Minister Biman Prasad said Thursday in a statement that the tariffs are \"disproportionate\" and \"unfair.\" Fiji was hit with a 32% tariff to counter the island nation's supposed 63% tariff on U.S. goods-a White House-produced figure that Prasad rejects. Prasad said 97% of U.S. imports are either duty-free or subject to a minimal 5% tariff.\n\nFrance denounced Trump's tariffs, with government spokesperson Sophie Primas telling RTL radio on Thursday that Trump is behaving as though he is \"master of the world.\" Primas said, CNBC reported , that the E.U. will likely implement countermeasures as a bloc in mid-April and again in late April.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz called Trump's latest tariffs an \"attack on a trade system that has created prosperity all round the world\" at a news conference on Thursday. He added that the E.U. would respond proportionately if negotiations fail.\n\n\"The E.U. has the strongest internal market in the world with 450 million consumers, which gives us the strength to hold talks with the U.S. government to avert a trade war,\" Scholz said. \"We want cooperation, not confrontation, and will defend our interests. Europe will respond united, strong and proportionately to this decision.\"\n\nIn a Thursday statement , the Federation of German Industries, the country's largest industry lobby group, called on the E.U. to \"strengthen its alliances with other major trading partners and should coordinate its reaction with them. A coordinated reaction is also necessary to counter diversionary effects in international trade.\"\n\nGerman Economy Minister Robert Habeck said on Thursday: \"For U.S. consumers, this will be Inflation Day, rather than Liberation Day.\"\n\nIndia's Commerce and Trade Ministry said in a statement Thursday that they will \"remain in touch\" with the U.S. regarding Trump's latest tariffs. India, which was hit with 26% tariffs, has a relative advantage, research firm Global Trade Research Institute told Reuters, compared with other Asian nations that were slapped with even higher levies.\n\nThe statement added that \"discussions are ongoing between Indian and U.S. trade teams for the expeditious conclusion of a mutually beneficial, multi-sectoral Bilateral Trade Agreement.\"\n\nIn a Wednesday statement , Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin said: \"We see no justification for this. More than €4.2 billion worth of goods and services are traded between the E.U. and the U.S. daily. Disrupting this deeply integrated relationship benefits no one. Tariffs drive inflation, hurt people on both sides of the Atlantic, and put jobs at risk.\"\n\nMartin added that he has spoken with von der Leyen and agrees that a coordinated E.U. response is \"crucial.\"\n\nIsrael Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich told reporters on Thursday that he would convene officials to \"analyse opportunities and risks and formulate courses of action, both in relation to President Trump and his team and regarding the necessary steps to strengthen Israel's industry,\" according to Reuters . The finance minister added the new 17% \"reciprocal\" tariff could impact Israel's exports of machinery and medical equipment.\n\nIsrael, a U.S. ally, had cancelled its remaining tariffs on its U.S. imports on Tuesday, ahead of Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs rollout, believing, according to a joint statement by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his ministers, that it would \"further strengthen the alliance and ties between Israel and the United States.\"\n\nItaly's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni posted on Facebook on Wednesday night that tariffs would hurt all parties. She added that Italy will negotiate a deal with the U.S. to \"prevent a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global actors.\"\n\nJapan's Trade Minister Yoji Muto said in a press conference on Thursday that he met with U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick just before Trump's announcement to urge Japan's exemption from the tariffs. After the announcement, which did not exempt but instead levied a \"reciprocal\" tariff rate of 24% on Japan, a long-standing ally of the U.S., Muto called the move \"extremely regrettable.\"\n\nAsked if Japan would retaliate, Muto said: \"We need to decide what is best for Japan, and most effective, in a careful but bold and speedy manner.\" He added that Japan's trade ministry will closely analyze the impacts of the tariffs.\n\nPrime Minister Shigeru Ishiba said later Thursday that it was \"very disappointing that these measures were taken despite our requests,\" according to Bloomberg . Ishiba had said the previous week that Japan would put \"all options on the table\" in responding to tariffs: \"Japan is a country that is making the largest amount of investment to the United States, so we wonder if it makes sense for [the U.S.] to apply uniform tariffs to all countries. That is a point we've been making and will continue to do so.\"\n\nIshiba said Thursday he would urge the U.S. to reconsider and added: \"If it's appropriate to do so I won't hesitate at all to directly talk to President Trump.\" Speaking to reporters at the Prime Minister's Office, Ishiba added that the tariffs \"will have a tremendous impact not only on economic relations between Japan and the U.S., but also the global economy as a whole.\"\n\nMalaysia, which was hit with a 24% \"reciprocal\" tariff by Trump, has ruled out imposing retaliatory tariffs, the country's Ministry of Investment, Trade & Industry said in a Thursday statement. The country's National Geoeconomic Command Centre, the statement said, will \"evaluate the impact of this recent US announcement and will consider a comprehensive and multipronged strategy to mitigate the effects of these tariffs on our economy and industries,\" while the country uses the Trade and Investment Framework Agreement , a preexisting trade pact between the U.S. and other countries including Malaysia, to \"seek reciprocal trade gains and pursue a Technology Safeguards Agreement\" with the U.S.\n\n\"Malaysia strongly believes in constructive engagement for mutually beneficial economic relations,\" the statement added. \"MITI is committed to safeguarding Malaysia's economic interests and maintaining strong trade relations with the U.S.\"\n\nNew Zealand's Trade Minister Todd McClay disputed the Trump Administration's claim that it imposed 20% tariffs on U.S. imports, but McClay said New Zealand had no plans to retaliate to the new \"reciprocal\" tariffs imposed by the U.S.\n\n\"We are a low tariff country and we have benefitted from it,\" the country's Prime Minister Christopher Luxon said . \"What we wouldn't want to do is raise prices here in New Zealand and add to inflation here in New Zealand by [imposing retaliatory tariffs].\"\n\nLuxon added that while tariffs are \"not the way to go,\" New Zealand, which now faces a 10% U.S. tariff, is in a better position to trade with the U.S. relative to countries hit with harsher levies. \"The bigger worry,\" he said, \"will be the global impact and the wash up of the tit-for-tat trade wars that may ensue.\"\n\nGeorge Plant, the Administrator of Norfolk Island, an Australian territory in the Pacific for which Trump announced a \"reciprocal\" tariff rate of 29%, told the Associated Press on Thursday: \"To my knowledge, we do not export anything to the United States.\" Plant added: \"We don't charge tariffs on anything. I can't think of any non-tariff barriers that would be in place either, so we're scratching our heads here.\"\n\nNorway's Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre told broadcaster NRK on Wednesday that Trump's tariffs will \"have consequences for many Norwegian companies and for jobs.\" Norway is facing a 15% levy on exports to the U.S., which is \"bad news\" for a country that \"lives off exports,\" Støre said. Around 8% of mainland Norwegian exports go to the U.S., which is the country's third largest export market, NRK reported.\n\nStøre said Norway is prepared to negotiate with the U.S.\n\nPolish Prime Minister Donald Tusk posted on X on Wednesday after Trump's announcement, which included a tariff rate of 20% on the E.U., of which Poland is a member: \"Friendship means partnership. Partnership means really and truly reciprocal tariffs. Adequate decisions are needed.\"\n\nSeveral hours later, Tusk posted in Polish that the new tariffs may reduce Polish GDP by 0.4%. \"A severe and unpleasant blow, because it comes from the closest ally, but we will survive it,\" he added, while noting that the \"friendship\" between the U.S. and Poland  \"must also survive this test.\"\n\nPresidential office spokesperson Claire Castro told reporters in Manila on Thursday that the Southeast Asian country currently does not have details on which industries will be affected by the new 17% tariff imposed by Trump. Castro suggested the impact is not that \"huge,\" according to the country's trade department. She added: \"We also believe in the good relations of the U.S.-Philippine alliance, so the imposition of 17% may have been studied well enough by the U.S. administration so we will accept it.\"\n\nHit by Trump's universal 10% tariff, Singapore was spared harsher tariffs that hit many of its neighbors. Still, the country's Monetary Authority said on Thursday it is \"ready to curb excessive volatility in the Singapore dollar, and to ensure that Singapore's foreign exchange and money markets continue to function in an orderly manner.\"\n\nChua Hak Bin, co-head of macro research at Maybank, told the Straits Times that while Singapore was partly shielded by its free trade agreement with the U.S. and bilateral trade deficit, the country would still be \"impacted from the massive deflationary shock to demand and trade. Manufacturing and exports will likely turn lower and contract in the coming quarters.\"\n\nSouth Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo convened a meeting with top officials on Thursday to assess the tariffs, according to a statement issued by its industry ministry . \"As the global trade war has become a reality, the government must pour all its capabilities to overcome the trade crisis,\" Han told the ministers. Han added that the government will prepare emergency support measures for industries and companies affected by the tariffs and ordered the industry minister to negotiate with Washington to minimize the impact.\n\nSpain's Economic Minister Carlos Cuerpo said Wednesday: \"The European Union has the necessary tools to respond to [Trump's tariffs], and, of course, in this context, Europe will not be naive. We will always respond.\"\n\nSpain's Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez summoned industry leaders on Thursday to a presentation of his response plan.\n\nSweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson said in a Wednesday statement that Sweden is \"well prepared for what's happening now.\" At the same time, he underscored: \"We don't want growing trade barriers. We don't want a trade war. That would make our populations poorer and the world more dangerous in the long run.\"\n\n\"Free enterprise and competition have laid the foundations of the West's success. That's why Americans can listen to music on Swedish Spotify and we Swedes can listen to the same music on our American iPhones,\" Kristersson said.\n\nHe added that, as part of the E.U., Sweden will \"take every opportunity to reverse these developments\" and \"contain the new U.S. tariffs.\"\n\nSwiss President Karin Keller-Sutter posted on X on Wednesday that the Swiss government will \"quickly determine the next steps.\" Switzerland was hit with a 31% tariff.\n\n\"The country's long-term economic interests are paramount. Adherence to international law and free trade remain core values,\" she added.\n\nEconomiesuisse, a business federation representing around 100,000 companies in Switzerland, also posted on X on Wednesday night that U.S. tariffs are \"harmful and unfounded.\"\n\n\"A further escalation of the trade conflict must be prevented,\" the group warned. \"The Federal Council and Swiss economic diplomacy are called upon to quickly find solutions at the negotiating table with the US government.\"\n\nTaiwan's cabinet called Trump's tariffs-which stood at 32% on Taiwanese goods-\"deeply unreasonable\" and \"highly regrettable.\" Cabinet spokesperson Michelle Lee said the government would negotiate with the U.S. to \"ensure the interests of our nation and industries.\"\n\nPrior to Trump's announcement, Taiwan's Minister of Economic Affairs J.W. Kuo said an economic and trade task force established last November has been working to determine what the effects of Trump's tariffs would be and how the government should respond.\n\nAfter the U.S. previously announced tariffs on the semiconductor industry, TSMC-Taiwan's largest company and the world's largest chip producer- pledged a $100 billion investment in the U.S., which appeared to mollify Trump as semiconductors are exempt from this latest round of tariffs.\n\nPrime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra said Thailand is prepared to negotiate with the U.S. after Trump announced a 36% \"reciprocal\" tariff on its goods. The U.S. is Thailand's largest export market. Shinawatra said that Thailand's actual tariff rate on U.S. imports is on average 9% rather than the 72% figure the White House presented.\n\n\"Thailand has signaled its readiness to discuss with the U.S. government at the first opportunity to adjust the trade balance to be fair to both the parties,\" Shinawatra told reporters on Thursday. She said Thailand could become a \"friend-shoring\" country for the U.S. by importing agriculture products to process and re-export.\n\n\"Don't panic as other countries are also facing higher tariffs,\" Thai Chamber of Commerce chairman Poj Aramwattananont also told reporters on Thursday, though he admitted he did not expect more than a 25% tariff from the U.S. \"The U.S. will also have some impact from this,\" he added , \"as they still can't produce to replace the imports fast enough.\"\n\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer said Thursday morning that the U.K. would respond to Trump's tariffs with \"cool and calm heads.\" Starmer added that the U.K., which faces the baseline 10% levy, is in a \"better position than a lot of other countries from what was announced last night.\"\n\nBusiness Secretary Jonathan Reynolds told Sky News on Thursday that the U.K. \"will take any action we need to give ourselves the tools that we need to respond to announcements of this kind.\" Reynolds added that he wants negotiations with the U.S. to lead to a total removal of the tariffs on the U.K. \"I want them removed in terms of the 10% that's been announced. I want them removed on steel and aluminium. I don't think there is an argument, a strong argument, for those being in place,\" he said. \"I want not only to remove what has been announced so far, but to strengthen that relationship. I want more U.K. businesses with stronger market access to all parts of the U.S. That's the prize on offer.\"\n\nUkraine's Economy Minister Yuliia Svyrydenko posted on X on Thursday that Trump's new 10% tariffs on Ukraine are \"complicated, but not critical.\" She added that in 2024 Ukraine bought $3.4 billion worth of goods from the U.S. and exported just $874 million worth of goods to the U.S. She also said Ukrainian tariffs on U.S. goods are \"quite low-the rate on cars is 10%, on coal and oil-0%\" and that Ukraine's government will work to \"ensure better conditions for Ukraine.\"\n\n\"Ukraine has something to offer the United States as a reliable ally and partner,\" Svyrydenko said. \"Both our countries benefit from fair tariffs.\"\n\nAccording to a government website , Vietnamese Minister of Industry and Trade Nguyễn Hồng Diên sent a diplomatic note Wednesday requesting the U.S. to \"postpone the decision to impose tariffs to spend time discussing and finding a reasonable solution for both sides.\" Tạ Hoàng Linh, who heads the ministry's foreign market development department, said in the statement that \"there is still room for discussion and negotiation between the two sides to reach a mutually beneficial result.\"\n\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC.

      "text": "We Must Stop Blaming Law Firms Attacked by President Donald Trump\n\nContributor\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump talks with members of the press after signing an executive order in the Oval Office of the White House on March 26, 2025 in Washington, DC.\n\nContributor\n\nT his past month, President Donald Trump issued executive orders targeting the business of several big law firms and launched investigations into the human resource practices of many more. Some have rushed to condemn the law firms that were the victims of the President's recent threats for giving in to his demands. However, not enough focus has been placed on the real actor behind this vindictive act: Trump.\n\nThree of the targeted firms-Jenner & Block, WilmerHale, and Perkins Coie-challenged the President in court and won, obtaining restraining orders against their respective executive orders. Another firm, Covington & Burling, took no action in response to a more limited executive order, while two others, Paul, Weiss and Skadden Arps, reached cosmetic settlements with the President, allowing Trump to back down from his threats. As Paul Weiss chairman Brad Karp outlined to his colleagues, the firm's deal resolved an existential threat to the firm without compromising its policies or cultural principles. This letter also revealed that Paul Weiss became a target after Brad Karp had tried to rally the other major firms to support the early targeted peer firms. In fact, some rival firms responded just the opposite way trying to poach Paul Weiss attorneys and clients sensing vulnerability.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPaul Weiss ' and Skadden Arps ' agreements with the President have included offers of substantial pro bono legal work on causes such as veterans' rights, anti-Semitism, and promoting fairness in the legal system. These are causes the firms have long supported and in dollar amounts that are a fraction of what the firms already dedicate to pro bono work. Plus, Karp maintains that Paul Weiss' settlements did not include condemnation of previous firm engagements or HR practices, nor does it impose any formal limits on future representations, including representations against the Trump Administration. Such a deal seems like a great way to calm anxious major clients and potentially poached top attorneys.\n\nIn our legal system, conflict resolution balances protracted, expensive litigation against faster negotiated settlements. The choice depends on the strategic positions of each party. The President is unlikely to prevail in litigation challenging his executive orders. Thus, he is motivated to settle with face-saving ways of backing down, which Paul, Weiss and Skadden Arps realized. Plus, as my Yale colleague John Morley wrote in the Wall Street Journal, the firms that quickly settled had much larger corporate transaction practices, with a higher propensity of flight risk, than those firms that have larger litigation practices. It is understandable that law firms with different business models would approach this same crisis differently. With the perishable quality of law-firm assets and firms' fiduciary duties to their clients and employees, firms can make different business choices while still securing their futures with honor.\n\nThe continuing complex situation at Wilmer Hale shows further why the settlements of Paul Weiss and Skadden Arps are attractive. Wilmer Hale was granted partial relief , but the judge expressly denied relief on seeing security clearance block seeing that discretion of the purview of President Trump's executive authority requiring ongoing litigation. Clients who require their lawyers to have security clearances may not be comfortable if there is some urgency in representation.\n\nAttacks on the actions of Paul Weiss and Skadden Arps have missed the real story. The President's motive was to attack virtually every leading law firm that has represented or hired those who challenged the President's actions in court. It is noteworthy that not among the firms he attacked were such Trump-friendly firms as Jones Day, Quinn Emanuel, and Sullivan & Cromwell. In fact, one of the most disturbing aspects of this saga was that the President sought advice from the co-chairman of Paul Weiss rival, Sullivan & Cromwell, Trump's personal attorney in his appeal of his conviction on 34 counts for falsifying business records, as he was negotiating with Karp, the Wall Street Journal and others reported . It is extraordinary that this involvement has not been the subject of greater scrutiny and criticism.\n\nThe leaders in the legal profession could take a page from their peers in other fields. After financial firms were devastated by the loss of their colleagues in the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, their competitors rushed to offer assistance. Clients were not stolen and talent was not poached from the firms most affected by the attacks.\n\nSimilarly, during the 2008 financial collapse, leaders of top financial firms worked together to develop support for the TARP program, even though those firms were in competitively healthy positions to take advantage of their fallen rivals. Rivals such as UPS or FedEx routinely do not try to benefit from each other's misfortunes but instead offer assistance to one another in the face of operational failures, labor strife, and other interruptions.\n\nWhen in 2021, Delta Airlines expressed concern for the restrictive new voting laws, the President called for a boycott of Delta. I called the chief executives of American and United, who instantly expressed public support for Delta and joined a virtual forum of 100 CEOs hastily called for that purpose.\n\nCollective action by chief executives in the business world has had a profound impact on blunting unchallenged authoritarian erosion of American democratic institutions. The legal industry stands apart-and the resulting spotlight is not flattering. The hypocritical chest pounding of attorneys condemning those law firms who settled is noteworthy, because many of those same attorneys previously failed to join the efforts to support those firms from the President's attacks. Instead, they blame the victim here.\n\nHopefully, the leaders in the legal world can learn from bolder leaders in other fields. Already 80 deans of law schools have spoken out in unison in denouncing the President's attack on law firms, while smaller firms such as Munger, Tolles & Olson and Keker, Van Nest & Peters have spoken out in defense of their larger rivals, suggesting \"friend of the court\" briefs.\n\nMonday, the American College of Trial Lawyers joined the condemnation of President Trump's coercive partisan executive orders attacking these law firms, while the American Bar Association has condemned this attack on the rule of law. Perhaps the big firms can join with the scrappy little firms out of enlightened self-interest. It wouldn't hurt to hear from their clients now, either. It is not too late for the legal industry to redeem itself in this perilous moment.\n\n© 2025 TIME USA, LLC. All Rights Reserved.

      "text": "Trump's biggest gamble: Tariffs test his presidency, and everyone else\n\nDonald Trump has always been comfortable taking risks, from his early real estate deals to his late-in-life jump into electoral politics.\n\nNow by imposing tariffs that have started a global trade war, he is taking the biggest gamble of his lifetime.\n\nAnd maybe of everybody else's.\n\nTrump is betting that mainstream economists and presidents since World War II have been wrong in generally embracing trade as the best way to build prosperity at home and forge peaceful relations around the world. Instead, he argues that slapping on the steepest tariffs since the 1930s will bring a windfall in federal revenue and force an historic resurgence of manufacturing in the United States.\n\nU.S. customs agents began collecting 10% baseline tariffs on Saturday, with stiffer rounds to begin this week.\n\n\"THIS IS AN ECONOMIC REVOLUTION, AND WE WILL WIN,\" Trump posted on the social-media site Truth Social. \"HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic. We will, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"\n\nThat confidence isn't shared by everyone.\n\nInvestors, for instance. After Trump's announcement, the S&P 500 plunged 10.5%, and the Dow dropped by nearly 4,000 points, the markets' worst week since early in the coronavirus pandemic in 2020. In two days, the markets lost more than $6 trillion in value, a decline that millions of American could track in real time in their retirement accounts.\n\n\"This is the biggest self-inflicted wound we've put on our economy in history,\" former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers said Sunday on ABC's \"This Week.\" \"There's no one, virtually, who doesn't work for the president who thinks this is a good idea.\"\n\nFor the first time in the modern era, a president's policy decision - not the emergence of a deadly virus or a terrorist attack like 9/11 - has shaken the global order, the repercussions not yet clear.\n\nThe contrasts between President Trump 1.0 and President Trump 2.0 are considerable.\n\nThe stiff taxes on U.S. imports are only the latest in a series of decisions he has made since his second inauguration that demonstrate his determination to command far-reaching changes on everything from the size and role of the federal government to the traditional guardrails of the justice system.\n\nOn Saturday, tens of thousands gathered on the National Mall in Washington to protest his early weeks in office, the largest of more than 1,000 \"Hands Off\" marches planned in all 50 states. Signs and chants targeted cuts in education and health care as well as the firing of federal workers and what demonstrators called assaults on democracy.\n\nThe president wasn't around to see them. He was in Florida, competing in the Senior Club Championship being held at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter.\n\nTrump no longer feels compelled to pay much attention to the Washington establishment voices that constrained some of his instincts during his first term. This time around, only tried-and-true loyalists have been appointed to the senior White House staff and the Cabinet.\n\n\"Donald Trump has been talking about this his whole life,\" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said on CBS' \"Face the Nation,\" referring to his long-standing faith in tariffs. \"It is Donald Trump's agenda, and we're all here to help him execute it.\"\n\nThe president can cite reasons to justify his self-confidence. He has survived two impeachment trials and two assassination attempts, including one that came so close it grazed his ear, a rescue he has credited to God. Courtesy of his appointments to the Justice Department, the federal indictments he had once faced on charges of mishandling sensitive documents and subverting a free and fair election have been dismissed.\n\nEven so, Trump might have caught the classic disease of second-term presidents: overreach.\n\nOnly 18 people in history have been elected twice to the White House, so it's hardly a surprise that they tend to think highly of their political acumen and public standing. These days, they no longer have to worry about the next time they'll face voters; the Constitution's 22nd Amendment bars winning a third term.\n\nAfter his reelection in 2004, George W. Bush went on a doomed quest to partially privatize the Social Security system. The controversy that followed, along with the Iraq War, were forces behind a tsunami in the 2006 midterm elections that swept Democrats into control of the House and Senate. A \"thumpin',\" Bush called it.\n\nIn 2008, the GOP lost the White House, too.\n\nDecades earlier, Franklin Roosevelt was frustrated in his first term by Supreme Court rulings against his New Deal legislation. After he won a second term in a landslide, in 1936, he proposed expanding the high court with up to six more appointments, presumably friendlier ones.\n\nThe idea was greeted with bipartisan derision, including by his vice president, John Nance Garner. In the next midterm, Democrats lost 72 House seats and eight Senate seats.\n\nFor both presidents, their second-term misadventures cost them some of the political currency they had gained in their reelection, no longer available to spend on something else.\n\nEven a handful of congressional Republicans, who have been a compliant bunch since Trump was sworn in, are raising concerns.\n\nWith the support of four Republicans, the Senate passed a resolution last week to lift Trump's tariffs on Canada - a symbolic measure, given that the House is unlikely to pass it nor Trump to sign it, but a small alarm bell ringing for the White House anyway.\n\nSeven Republican senators are now co-sponsoring a bipartisan bill that would limit a president's power to impose tariffs and give Congress the power to end them.\n\nVoters are increasingly uneasy, too. A Wall Street Journal poll published Friday found Americans by 54%-42% opposed Trump's tariffs. Three-quarters of those surveyed predicted they would raise the cost of things they buy, which is also the view of most economists.\n\nJerome Powell, chair of the Federal Reserve, warned Friday that Trump's tariffs risks fueling inflation and slowing growth. Trump's first-term vice president, Mike Pence , called them the \"largest peacetime tax hike in U.S. history.\" Economic forecasters have raised the odds of a recession .\n\nOn Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent suggested that the tariffs give Trump leverage in negotiations to reduce trade barriers including, presumably, the tariffs he has just imposed.\n\n\"He has created maximum leverage for himself, and more than 50 countries have approached the administration about lowering their non-tariff trade barriers, lowering their tariffs, stopping currency manipulation,\" Bessent said on NBC's \"Meet the Press.\" But he also said the administration was going to \"hold the course\" on the tariff regime. \"Because, you know, after 20, 30, 40, 50 years of bad behavior, you can't just wipe the slate clean.\"\n\nNegotiations could give Trump an exit ramp, if he wanted to take it.\n\nUnlike a Social Security proposal that failed or a court-packing scheme that was ridiculed, however, the imposition of tariffs have already had consequences that will be hard to unwind - not that there are any signs so far from Trump that he wants to unwind them. Tariffs reflect not only his view of the economy but of the U.S. role in the world, of America First.\n\nChina has responded with a 34% tariff of its own on U.S. goods, and the European Union vows retribution as well. The sense of the United States as a reliable partner, through thick and thin, has been shaken. Canada's \"old relationship\" with the United States is now \"over,\" Prime Minister Mark Carney declared in a national television address.\n\nWhat comes next?"

      "text": "Social Security is changing under President Trump. Here's what retirees need to know\n\nIn June 2024, President Donald Trump told supporters at a campaign rally, \"As president, I will not cut one penny from Social Security or Medicare .\" He made a virtually identical statement in July 2024 on social media. \"I will not cut one penny from Social Security or Medicare, and I will not raise the retirement age by one day.\"\n\nPresident Trump has so far kept those campaign promises since returning to the White House for a second term. However, he has mentioned (and in some cases set in motion) changes that impact the Social Security program. Here's what retired workers should know.\n\nIn January, President Trump signed an executive order creating the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE). The agency was initially tasked with improving productivity by modernizing federal technology and software, but more recent executive orders have expanded its purview to include workforce optimization, cost efficiencies, and deregulation.\n\nThe Social Security Administration (SSA) has responded by reducing its staffing target to 50,000 employees, down from the current level of approximately 57,000 employees. The agency has also identified cost savings opportunities in contracts, grants, property, and technology, as well as \"common-sense approaches to printing, travel, and purchase card policies.\"\n\nThe total savings will exceed $800 million in fiscal 2025, according to the SSA. While that's a material portion of the estimated $6.5 billion in administrative spending, the sum is still inconsequential, compared to the $110 billion deficit built into its budget for fiscal 2025.\n\nWhat the Trump administration means for your wallet: Sign up for USA TODAY's Daily Money newsletter.\n\nDuring his campaign, President Trump wrote on social media, \"Seniors should not pay tax on Social Security.\" He has doubled down on that promise since the election. In February, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said President Trump would implement the \"largest tax cut in history,\" including the elimination of taxes on Social Security.\n\nTrump was quick to identify inefficiencies and effect spending cuts through DOGE, but I'm skeptical about his plan to eliminate taxes on Social Security . While the idea certainly has merit, the Social Security trust fund is already on pace to be depleted by 2035 . Ending taxes on benefits would accelerate the timeline and bring potential benefit cuts closer.\n\nTo elaborate, the trustees estimate tax revenue will cover only 83% of scheduled benefits when the trust fund becomes insolvent in 2035. That means benefits would automatically be cut by 17% unless Congress finds a fix for the funding problem.\n\nTaxes assessed on Social Security account for 4% of program funding. While that's a small percentage, the funding problem would still get worse if tax revenue was eliminated.\n\nFor instance, a budget model from renowned business school Penn Wharton shows Social Security could lose $1.5 trillion in revenue in the next decade if President Trump eliminates taxes on benefits. In that scenario, the trust fund would become insolvent two years earlier than currently anticipated. That means retired workers and other Social Security recipients could see benefit cuts in 2033 rather than 2035.\n\nHaving said that, Congress has never allowed the Social Security trust fund to become insolvent in the past, and I suspect lawmakers will find a solution for the financing problem before benefit cuts are necessary this time. However, eliminating taxes on Social Security would still be problematic because it would leave Congress with less time to find that solution.\n\nThe Motley Fool has a disclosure policy .\n\nThe Motley Fool is a USA TODAY content partner offering financial news, analysis and commentary designed to help people take control of their financial lives.

HANG TOUGH, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic,\" Trump said on Truth Social Saturday morning.\n\nThe Trump administration imposed a 10% minimum tariff on all imports coming into the country and even higher reciprocal tariffs on the U.S.'s biggest trading partners, including China and the European Union. The baseline tariff went into effect at 12:01 am EDT Saturday, and the reciprocal tariffs will begin April 9.\n\nTrump has argued the higher tariffs ‒ which seek to roll back decades of globalization ‒ are critical to rejuvenate America's declining domestic manufacturing sectors and create a level playing field with other countries that impose tariffs on U.S. exports.\n\nThey include a 34% tariff on chief rival China on top of recently imposed 20% tariffs on Chinese goods, meaning Chinese imports were effectively hit with a 54% tariff.\n\nEscalating a global trade war, China responded to Trump's tariffs Friday by imposing reciprocal 34% tariffs on all imports from the U.S.\n\n\"China has been hit much harder than the USA, not even close,\" Trump said in his social media post Saturday. \"They, and many other nations, have treated us unsustainably badly. We have been the dumb and helpless 'whipping post,' but not any longer. We are bringing back jobs and businesses like never before.\"\n\nTrump made the Truth Social post shortly before playing in a senior championship at the Trump National Golf Club in Jupiter, Florida, north of his Mar-a-Lago home in Palm Beach, Florida. His outing came as massive crowds took part in more than 1,000 \"Hands Off\" protests across the country, including in Washington D.C., to voice opposition to Trump's actions as president.\n\nTrump also golfed Friday at the Trump International Golf Club West Palm Beach, and on Thursday he visited Trump Doral for a dinner ahead of the LIV Golf Tournament.\n\nAfter Saturday's round concluded, the White House in a statement said: \"The President won his second round matchup of the Senior Club Championship today in Jupiter, FL, and advances to the Championship Round tomorrow.\"\n\nReach Joey Garrison on X @joeygarrison."

Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!).

They've made enough, for decades, taking advantage of the Good OL' USA! Our past 'leaders' are to blame for allowing this, and so much else, to happen to our Country.\"\n\nThe president and White House officials have been defending the plan, which was announced last week and sparked recession fears and a stock market plummet. Trump said Sunday he was elected because of the tariffs, telling reporters they will make the U.S. $1 trillion by next year.\n\nBillionaire hedge fund investor Bill Ackman, who endorsed Trump last year, offered a stark warning Sunday that tariffs would cause the economy to collapse while hurting Trump supporters the most.\n\nCNBC host Jim Cramer warned of the possibility that an event similar to \"Black Monday\" could occur, which is a reference to the market collapse of 1987, if Trump sticks to his tariff plans.\n\nThe tariffs apply to nearly every country that exports goods to the U.S. and caused concern for higher prices domestically, while the White House insists they will bring jobs to the U.S. and has called on Wall Street and critics to trust Trump.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average opened sharply down on Monday morning, hitting negative 1,500 points by 9:40 a.m. EDT.\n\nInvestors are bracing for a tough Monday after the Dow lost nearly 4,000 points over Thursday and Friday following Trump's announcement on Wednesday.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

      "text": "Trump Tariffs Disturb His Own Supporters in Conservative Media: 'Really Problematic'\n\nManage your account\n\nPresident Trump has described his new tariff plan as a \"beautiful thing to behold\" - but not everyone in conservative media feels the same way.\n\nA number of prominent right-leaning voices have shared their displeasure with the president's \"liberation day\" tariffs since he announced them last week, including Ben Shapiro, who started his show off on Monday by sharing his thoughts on the matter.\n\nShapiro said there are a few cases where tariffs are an \"important\" and \"totally understandable\" tool, including when they can be used to leverage other countries to give the U.S. better trade deals. But he said the Trump Administration's belief that \"tariffs are good\" and trade wars are \"easy to win\" is \"really problematic.\"\n\n\"The idea that this is inherently good, it makes the American economy strong is wrongheaded. It is untrue,\" Shapiro said. \"The idea that is going to result in mass reshoring of manufacturing is also untrue.\"\n\nShapiro later called the chart President Trump showed off last week at the White House, highlighting the new tariffs, was \"ridiculous.\" The Daily Wire co-founder, who has more than 7 million YouTube subscribers, said stocks on Wall Street have plummeted because of the uncertainty surrounding the president's long-term plans.\n\n\"It is absolutely unclear what President Trump is thinking at this point - and herein lies the problem,\" Shapiro said. \"You have a vast combination of radical uncertainty and policy that is being spouted by members of the administration that is overtly bad. There is no one in the administration who's making the overtly good case; there are many people in the administration who are making bad to strained cases right now.\"\n\nHis criticism stands out, considering he was one of President Trump's most vocal supporters in the lead up to the 2024 election; Shapiro was also in attendance last month for the president's speech before Congress. But he is not the only conservative commentator who has questioned the tariffs.\n\nRyan Saavedra, a reporter for The Daily Wire with more than 358,000 followers on X, has re-posted several comments that are skeptical the tariffs will work. He also shared a screenshot of a text from a right-wing friend on Sunday that blasted the \"insane\" tariffs.\n\n\"You start messing around with people's investments and 401(k)s and you're going to lose support - fast,\" Saavedra posted.\n\nSaagar Enjeti, the right-leaning co-host of \"Breaking Points\" on YouTube, which has 1.42 million subscribers, has expressed his reservations about the president's plan as well.\n\n\"Not joking: the White House would have been better off using ChatGPT than whatever the f-k this is,\" Enjeti posted on X last week in response to a picture of the president holding up a cardboard breakdown of his new tariffs.\n\nEnjeti reiterated his irritation with the new tariff plan on Monday's episode of \"Breaking Points.\" He said that, while he is generally \"pro-tariff,\" the rollout from the Trump Administration has been messy and goes beyond what he discussed on the campaign trail last year.\n\n\"Nobody - nobody - this is why the markets crashed as they were - floated a 35-40% tariff,\" Enjeti said.\n\n\"That's where this is 10 times out of step even with allegedly many of the things that he sold on the campaign trail. And that is why you're seeing the level of freak out,\" he continued. \"And very soon, real voters, you are going to feel this in a very real way. Screw retirement. We're talking layoffs.\"\n\nIn the two days following Trump's tariff announcement last week, the markets saw $5.4 trillion in value evaporate while the S&P 500 plummeted to its lowest level in 11 months. Friday's sell-off market the biggest single-day decline for the S&P 500 and Dow since COVID-19 rocked the market in March 2020, while the Nasdaq suffered its biggest single-day hit since 2020 on Thursday.\n\nPresident Trump, in a post on Truth Social before markets opened on Monday, called on investors to hang tough while global economies adjusted to his tariffs.\n\n\"The United States has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" the president posted. \"Don't be Weak! Don't be Stupid! Don't be a PANICAN (A new party based on Weak and Stupid people!). Be Strong, Courageous, and Patient, and GREATNESS will be the result!\"\n\nElon Musk does not appear to be as patient about the tariffs as the president, though.\n\nThe X owner - who prominently backed President Trump during the 2024 election and has been spearheading the new Department of Government Efficiency for the administration - posted a video on Monday of economist Milton Friedman explaining how a pencil is made with parts from all over the world. The post was viewed by many as a stealth rebuke of President Trump's plan, a day after he said the U.S. is \"not going to lose a trillion dollars for the privilege of buying pencils from China.\"\n\nThe post Trump Tariffs Disturb His Own Supporters in Conservative Media: 'Really Problematic' appeared first on TheWrap ."

      "text": "Opinion - Trump is disrupting everything - why isn't Congress doing anything?\n\nManage your account\n\nMuch of what we know about President Trump's leadership is revealed by his personal behavior. For example, during his first month in office, while Elon Musk conducted mass firings and canceled government services to cut spending, Trump spent nearly $10.7 million of taxpayer money to play golf at his properties.\n\nThe Department of Government Efficiency hasn't mentioned this. HuffPost calculated the expenditure based on Trump's tax-supported golf outings during his first term. Over those four years, he golfed 293 days at a cost of $152 million. Taxpayers footed the bill for him to travel on Air Force One, transport motorcade vehicles, and station gunships off the coast of his West Palm Beach golf club.\n\nIt's unclear whether he charged his Secret Service detail to stay at his tony resorts, as he did before.\n\nTrump's golf expenses are chump change compared to his cost-cutting and revenue-raising plans for the government. Still, they illustrate a double standard when tens of thousands of government workers have been fired with little notice and without cause, suddenly jobless and unable to waste money on something like green fees.\n\nTrump's big initiatives reflect his personality, too. They appear to be driven by impulse rather than sound analysis. Their costs and benefits are not transparent, and his decisions are mercurial. They are causing considerable disruption in the stock market, business plans and people's retirement funds.\n\nIt's not clear Trump knows what he's doing. For example, he and his advisers say import tariffs will generate billions of dollars in tax breaks. However, these are tax increases imposed on American businesses that rely on imports. Companies will pass the cost along to consumers.\n\nTrump adviser Peter Navarro seems confused, too. \"The message here is that tariffs are tax cuts,\" he told Fox News. Then, he predicted they would raise about $600 billion annually. As one business writer explains , tariffs are \"likely to represent a huge tax increase unlike anything seen in history.\"\n\nHowever, the size of the tax increase is impossible to predict because Trump keeps his plans close to his chest and keeps changing his mind. His pattern of imposing tariffs one day and suspending them the next has \"already upended diplomatic ties, shake markets, and confounded entire industries,\" the New York Times notes.\n\nWhat will Trump do with all the money? We don't know. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says the president might use it for leverage in negotiations with other countries. Other advisers would prefer to pay down the federal debt or fund more tax breaks for wealthy Americans.\n\nTrump's immigration plan is another example of his impulsiveness. Federal agents seem to be swooping in and sweeping up just about anyone who is not white and has tattoos. Suspects are shipped off to other countries illegally, without due process to determine whether they have the right to be here.\n\nMeanwhile, although career federal workers can be fired only for cause and with the right to appeal, Musk has summarily dismissed tens of thousands. He's canceling programs and entire agencies without permission from Congress or any apparent analysis of what the cuts will mean for the millions of Americans who rely on the government. If hiring should be based on merit, merit should be favored in dismissals, too. It's not hard to identify and retain the best workers because federal employees undergo annual performance reviews.\n\nTrump claims DOGE is \"saving taxpayers billions and billions of dollars every single day.\" Is it? Trump can cut federal programs, but the problems the programs addressed remain, whether it's industrial pollution, weather disasters, abject poverty, veterans' suicides or lousy schools. The problems will fester, or states and their taxpayers will have to pick the costs of dealing with them.\n\nTrump is disrupting lives and the economy on an unprecedented scale, with much more to come as Americans begin feeling the consequences of his decisions, especially if Congress codifies them.\n\nThe potential victims include the 68 million retirees who received Social Security payments in fiscal 2024, 22 million people who receive health care under the Affordable Care Act, 67 million people enrolled in Medicare, millions of families that survive because of social safety nets, 18 million veterans who receive disability and retirement benefits or medical care at the Veterans Administration's hospitals and clinics, and all 340 million Americans whose lives, health and productivity are threatened by unregulated pollution.\n\nThe disruptions also will affect al l 64 states and territories , 19,429 municipalities and 33.2 million businesses that rely on federal help for infrastructure repairs, disaster recovery, education funding and social spending, not to mention the individual Americans who count on everything from safe food to disease prevention and cancer research.\n\nWaste, fraud and abuse exist in government. No one denies it. Just last month, the Government Accountability Office reported that 68 federal programs across 16 agencies made at least $162 billion in improper payments in fiscal 2024. Since 2003, improper payments totaled at least $2.8 trillion. This is outrageous and unacceptable.\n\nHowever, in a more rational process, the administration would round up and evaluate the many other audits by the GAO, inspectors general, the press and watchdog groups that have identified waste and fraud and ideas to fix it.\n\nCongress should be asking hard questions about Trump's leadership. If Republicans don't hold hearings, Democrats should convene their own. As Congress's call volumes show, the people want to know what's going on.\n\nWilliam S.

      "text": "President Trump defends tariffs, as global markets fall\n\nManage your account\n\nWASHINGTON (NEXSTAR) - President Donald Trump is defending his sweeping tariffs, even as global markets fall.\n\nIt has been less than a week since the announcement of steep new tax rates on foreign imports from almost all of the countries the U.S. trades with.\n\nThe new tariffs are sparking economic turmoil across the world, but President Trump pushed back when asked about the stock market drop.\n\n\"I don't want anything to go down, but sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something,\" said Trump.\n\nPresident Trump argues the U.S. has been hurt by foreign trade deals that he calls unfair and says his new tariffs will fix the trade deficits.\n\n\"To me, a deficit is a loss. We're going to have surpluses, or we're at worst going to be breaking even,\" said Trump.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent defended the new tariff policies and brushed off concerns about a recession.\n\n\"Who knows how the market is going to react in a day, in a week. What we are looking at is building the long-term, economic fundamentals for prosperity,\" said Bessent.\n\nSenator Adam Schiff disagrees.\n\n\"He's wrecking our economy. I think people have seen their retirement savings on fire,\" said Schiff.\n\nSchiff fears the tariffs will have long term consequences.\n\n\"If we head into a recession, it will be the Trump recession. He will completely own it. This is a completely self-destructive economic act that he's engaged in,\" said Schiff.\n\nThe White House says leaders from more than 50 nations have reached out to try and negotiate the tariff rates.\n\n\"They're dying to make a deal. But I said, we're not going to have deficits with your country,\" said Trump.\n\nA 10% baseline tariff is already being imposed on all foreign imports, but steeper reciprocal tariffs are set to go into effect on dozens of countries starting on Wednesday.\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc.

      "text": "Growing opposition from House conservatives threatens to derail Trump's agenda\n\nManage your account\n\nGrowing opposition among hard-line House conservatives to the Senate's framework for advancing President Trump's ambitious legislative agenda is threatening to make this week's vote one of the heaviest lifts yet for Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).\n\nAt least 10 House Republicans have said they will vote \"no\" on the measure, and a handful of others have publicly criticized the resolution, creating an uphill battle for Johnson as he looks to muscle it through his razor-thin majority.\n\nJohnson is eyeing a Wednesday vote on the Senate-approved budget resolution , which would unlock the reconciliation process that Republicans are looking to use to pass tax cuts, border funding and energy policy. The Speaker is actively urging his ranks to fall in line, and the White House has begun making calls to House Republicans, a source told The Hill.\n\nBut a mounting swell of resistance among fiscal hawks who want commitments on large spending cuts upfront is putting that plan in jeopardy.\n\nUnderscoring the discontent, Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), the chair of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus who has sharply criticized the budget resolution, is advocating for the chamber to skip the vote altogether and move straight to crafting the details of the package - an unconventional move that would be a break from protocol. Asked about prospects of the bill passing, Harris said Monday: \"It doesn't need to. The committees can do their work without the budget resolution.\"\n\nThat idea, to be sure, has no chance of being picked up by House GOP leaders. Johnson told reporters \"we disagree on that\" when asked about the prospect. The view of House GOP leadership is that the House can stay in the driver's seat and secure major cuts if they pass the budget resolution and craft the details of the ultimate reconciliation legislation faster than the Senate.\n\nBut the sheer mention of the delay is signaling that conservatives have little appetite for moving forward with the measure this week. Johnson said he would be meeting with the Freedom Caucus to talk about the budget resolution later Monday evening.\n\nThe growing discontent within House Republican ranks is increasing the likelihood that Trump - who endorsed the measure and said \"We need to pass it IMMEDIATELY!\" - may have to step in personally, as he did to secure Johnson's reelection as Speaker and passage of the House budget resolution back in February.\n\nHe leaned into that lobby campaign on Monday, writing on Truth Social \"THE HOUSE MUST PASS THIS BUDGET RESOLUTION, AND QUICKLY.\"\n\n\"There is no better time than now to get this Deal DONE!\" he added.\n\nJohnson told reporters on Monday that the president has not yet gotten involved in the effort to ramp up support for the measure, but a White House official suggested that the president was ready to jump in as needed.\n\n\"President Trump has great relationships on Capitol Hill, and his team is regularly engaging with the House to urge the passage of the Senate Amendment to the House budget resolution in line with the American people's priorities,\" the White House official said.\n\nHouse GOP conference Chair Lisa McClain (Mich.), for her part, predicted that Trump's involvement would take shape soon.\n\n\"It is personal with the president. He cares very deeply about our country and the situation that we're in, and this is his vision on how to get it done,\" McClain said. \"So yes, I think he will personally get involved.\"\n\nThe first key test for Johnson and House GOP leadership will come on Tuesday, when the House Rules Committee - which includes two opponents of the framework, Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) - is expected to take up the budget resolution and dispatch it to the floor for a vote.\n\nThe committee opted to push consideration of the budget resolution from Monday - the day bills are typically examined by the panel - to Tuesday, signaling potential trouble for the resolution. Norman said he did not yet know how he plans to vote in committee, but he was clear in his opposition to the measure.\n\n\"Why are we abandoning?\" Norman asked. \"I mean, $4 billion versus $2 trillion? I don't get it; the math doesn't add up.\"\n\nOn the House floor, Johnson faces a towering math problem. In the razor-thin GOP majority, the Speaker can only afford to lose three Republican votes and clear the measure, assuming full Democratic opposition and complete attendance. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) on Monday stressed to House Democrats that it was crucial to be present for the vote.\n\nThe opposition is not limited to hard-liners like those in the Freedom Caucus. Rep. Jodey Arrington (R-Texas), the chair of the House Budget Committee, went after the resolution over the weekend, calling it \"unserious and disappointing.\"\n\nJohnson, for his part, is remaining optimistic amid the growing opposition, encouraged by the fact that he still has time to get his members in line - 48 hours is an eternity in Washington - in addition to Trump's strong endorsement of the measure.\n\n\"It's going great,\" Johnson said when asked how he plans to get the measure over the finish line. \"We're doing what we do here every week and that's building consensus, and I need a little time. Everybody's just now getting in town so we'll have plenty of time to do it.\"\n\nMcClain also struck an optimistic tone.\n\n\"Do we have the votes as we sit right here today? No, I don't think that's a surprise to anybody. You can see,\" McClain said. \"But that's how we always start out, right?\"\n\nThe concerns among hard-line conservatives are twofold. First, those on the right flank are incensed that the budget resolution includes different spending cut minimums for each chamber. House committees are directed to find at least $1.5 trillion in cuts to federal spending, the same number laid out in the lower chamber's budget resolution, while Senate panels are directed to make at least $4 billion in slashes - an enormous discrepancy.\n\nJohnson has argued that, despite the differences, the House will still pursue significant spending cuts.\n\n\"Although the Senate chose to take a different approach on its instructions, the amended resolution in NO WAY prevents us from achieving our goals in the final reconciliation bill,\" he wrote in a letter to colleagues over the weekend.\n\nHard-liners, however, are not buying it, convinced that the final product will be more closely aligned with the Senate's instructions - a fact that moderates are gunning for amid worries over potential cuts to social safety net programs.\n\n\"I don't like it,\" Rep. Beth Van Duyne (R-Texas) said of the resolution, noting that she was considering voting against it. \"There's no emphasis on the budget decreases.\"\n\nRep. Rich McCormick (R-Ga.) also said he was \"undecided\" about the budget resolution, adding: \"I want to hear the minutia of it.\"\n\nSecond, hard-liners have hammered away at the Senate for utilizing a budgetary gimmick known as current policy baseline, which assumes that the extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts will not add to the deficit - despite the Congressional Budget Office saying they could cost around $4 trillion.\n\nSenators have embraced the scoring tactic in their effort to permanently extend the 2017 tax cuts - a key request from the president - at which conservatives are rolling their eyes.\n\n\"From budget gimmicks to a pathetic $4B in spending cuts, the Senate's budget resolution is a non-starter,\" Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) wrote on the social platform X over the weekend. \"We need to be serious about delivering on President Trump's America First agenda in a FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE manner. If this comes to the floor in its current form, I'm a NO.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 Nexstar Media, Inc. All rights reserved.

      "text": "Trump's game of chicken over tariffs leaves world guessing\n\nA day before Donald Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs are scheduled to kick in, the US president appears locked in a high-stakes game of chicken, with the world's economy hanging in the balance.\n\nSome nations labelled \"worst offenders\" are scrambling to make nice with the White House to end this game before it reaches a potentially devastating climax.\n\nChina, in contrast, is playing a different game, one of retaliation and resistance.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has pressed ahead, even as some allies - in Congress and on Wall Street - wonder if he's going too far. On Sunday, when asked what level of market fall he would tolerate before changing course, he snapped that it was a \"stupid question\".\n\nSo is it all a negotiating tactic as many investors and politicians hope - or is he playing a longer game aimed at permanently restructuring the global economy and America's place in it? In this new world, whether a country is an ally or an adversary depends on whether that nation is giving the US a good deal.\n\nOn Monday afternoon, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, the first world leader to visit the president since his trade announcement, tried his hand at playing Trump's new game. He pledged that his nation - which has been slotted for tariffs of 17% - would drop its trade barriers and move to eliminate its trade surplus with the US.\n\n\"We think it is the right thing to do,\" he said. \"I think Israel can serve as a model to many countries that ought to do the same.\"\n\nOther nations appear to be pursuing a similar strategy in the hopes of a positive result.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba called Trump on Monday morning, prompting Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent to state that the US was beginning negotiations with the nation to \"implement the president's vision for the new Golden Age of Global Trade\".\n\nEuropean Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said Europe was \"ready to negotiate\" with the US, offering a mutual reduction of tariffs on industrial goods to zero - a proposal that Trump praised during remarks at the Oval Office, while saying it was still \"not enough\".\n\nThere were no such gestures from China. On Monday morning, America's top economic competitor announced that it was responding to Trump's 34% tariff increase with an additional 34% of its own.\n\nThat prompted Trump to threaten another 50% to US tariffs on China if it does not back down by Tuesday.\n\n\"China has chosen to isolate itself by retaliating and doubling down on previous negative behaviour,\" Bessent posted on X. \"Over 50 countries have responded both openly and positively to Donald Trump's historic action to create a fairer, more prosperous system of global trade.\"\n\nChina's reaction to Trump's latest move was equally blunt.\n\n\"We have stressed more than once that pressuring or threatening China is not a right way to engage with us,\" Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu told BBC partner CBS News. \"China will firmly safeguard its legitimate rights and interests.\"\n\nSuch a series of reactions and reprisals from China and the US appeared to be exactly what investors feared last week, as American stock indexes dropped by double-digit percentages.\n\nBy Monday a growing chorus of business leaders were speaking out against Trump's tariff plan, including Wall Street financiers who had been strong public supporters of his administration - trying, it appeared, to get the president to back down by force of will alone.\n\nMeanwhile, US markets were poised to jump at any reason for hope. When a social media post on Monday morning indicated that the president was contemplating a 90-day delay on new tariffs - perhaps drawn from a misinterpretation of comments made by Trump economic adviser Kevin Hassett on Fox News - US stock indexes soared. The S&P 500 index added $2.4tn in market value for about 10 minutes, only for it to all vanish once the White House quickly denied the president was contemplating such a move.\n\nTrump further closed the door on Monday afternoon, saying he was not \"looking at\" any kind of delay. It was still full speed ahead on tariffs.\n\n\"We're going to have one shot at this,\" he said.\n\nPerhaps the most concerning message for investors and foreign leaders hoping for a last-minute reprieve - and an exit ramp to stability - came from one of Trump's top trade advisers, Peter Navarro.\n\n\"This is not a negotiation,\" he wrote in a Financial Times opinion piece published on Monday afternoon. \"President Trump is always willing to listen. But to those world leaders who, after decades of cheating, are suddenly offering to lower tariffs - know this: that's just the beginning.\"\n\nSo if this is about the start of broader systemic change - what is the desired end goal worth potentially tanking the global economy?\n\nOne theory is that Trump has a plan with several of his top advisers - the \"Mar-a-Lago accord\", it is called - with the ultimate goal of compelling America's trading partners to weaken the US dollar on the international currency exchange. Such a move would make American exports more affordable to foreign markets and diminish the value of China's large reserves of US currency.\n\nIt's a plan pushed by Trump economic adviser Stephen Miran, although he has denied that it is current administration policy.\n\nThat's just one of the possible explanations for the current stock market mayhem that Trump has purposefully instigated - one that many other prominent economists warn is risky. It is far from the only one.\n\nEver since Trump shocked the world with his sweeping tariff plan, White House officials have fanned out across media to preach patience and offer a selection of sometimes contradictory explanations as to the strategy behind Trump's global trade war. He is doing it to raise revenue and protect American industry - or as a negotiating tool. The tariffs are permanent - or they are temporary. They will prompt individual deals with other nations - or compel some grand multilateral agreement.\n\nAs Trump presses on to Wednesday's tariff cliff with no signs of backing away, he seems willing to keep the world guessing.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Anti-Trump protests held in cities across the US\n\nCrowds of protesters gathered in cities across the US on Saturday to denounce President Trump, in the largest nationwide show of opposition since the president took office in January.\n\nThe \"Hands Off\" protest planners aimed to hold rallies in 1,200 locations, including in all 50 US states. Hundreds of thousands of people turned out in Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, New York and Washington DC, among other cities.\n\nProtesters cited grievances with Trump's agenda ranging from social to economic issues.\n\nComing days after Trump's announcement that the US would impose import tariffs on most countries around the world, gatherings were also held outside the US, including in London, Paris and Berlin.\n\nIn Boston, some protesters said they were motivated by immigration raids on US university students that have led to arrests and deportation proceedings.\n\nLaw student Katie Smith told BBC News that she was motivated by Turkish international student Rumeysa Ozturk , whose arrest near Boston-area Tufts University by masked US agents was caught on camera last month.\n\n\"You can stand up today or you can be taken later,\" she said, adding: \"I'm not usually a protest girlie.\"\n\nIn London, protesters held signs reading, \"WTAF America?\", \"Stop hurting people\" and \"He's an idiot\".\n\nThey chanted \"hands off Canada\", \"hands off Greenland\" and \"hands off Ukraine\", referencing Trump's changes to US foreign policy. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in annexing Canada and Greenland . He also got into a public dispute with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and has struggled to negotiate a peace deal between Ukraine and Russia.\n\nIn Washington DC, thousands of protesters gathered to watch speeches by Democratic lawmakers. Many remarks focused on the role played in Trump's administration by wealthy donors - most notably Elon Musk, who has served as an advisor to the president and spearheaded an effort to dramatically cut spending and the federal workforce.\n\nFlorida Congressman Maxwell Frost denounced the \"billionaire takeover of our government\".\n\n\"When you steal from the people, expect the people to rise up. At the ballot box and in the streets,\" he shouted.\n\nThe protests come after a bruising week for the president and his allies. Republicans won a closely watched special Florida congressional election on Tuesday, but with slimmer margins than they had hoped . Wisconsin voters elected a Democratic judge to serve on the state supreme court, roundly rejecting a Musk-backed Republican candidate by almost 10 percentage points .\n\nIn both states, Democrats sought to tap into voter anger towards the Trump administration's policies and Elon Musk's influence.\n\nSome polls show approval ratings for President Trump to be slipping slightly.\n\nOne Reuters/Ipsos poll released earlier this week found that his approval rating had dropped to 43%, its lowest point since Trump began his second term in January. When he was inaugurated on 20 January, his approval rating was 47%.\n\nThe same poll found that 37% of Americans approve of his handling of the economy, while 30% approve of his strategy to address the cost of living in the US.\n\nAnother recent poll, from Harvard Caps/Harris, found that 49% of registered voters approve of Trump's performance in office, down from 52% last month. The same poll, however, found that 54% of voters believe he is doing a better job than Joe Biden did as president.\n\nOne protester in Washington named Theresa told the BBC that she was there because \"we're losing our democratic rights\".\n\n\"I'm very concerned about the cuts they're making to the federal government,\" she said, adding that she is also concerned about retirement and education benefits.\n\nAsked if she thought Trump was receiving the protesters' message, she said: \"Well, let's see. [Trump has] been golfing just about every day.\"\n\nTrump held no public events on Saturday, and spent the day golfing at a resort he owns in Florida. He was scheduled to play golf again on Sunday.\n\nThe White House released a statement defending Trump's positions, saying he would continue to protect programs such as Medicare and pointing to Democrats as the threat.\n\n\"President Trump's position is clear: he will always protect Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for eligible beneficiaries. Meanwhile, the Democrats' stance is giving Social Security, Medicaid, and Medicare benefits to illegal aliens, which will bankrupt these programs and crush American seniors.\"\n\nOne of Trump's top immigration advisors, Tom Homan, told Fox News on Saturday that protesters held a rally outside of his New York home, but that he was in Washington at the time.\n\n\"They can protest a vacant house all they want,\" Homan said, adding that their presence \"tied up\" law enforcement and prevented officials from seeing to more important tasks.\n\n\"Protests and rallies, they don't mean anything,\" Homan continued.\n\n\"So go ahead and exercise your first amendment [free speech] rights. It's not going to change the facts of the case.\"\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nThe prominent accuser of Jeffrey Epstein and the Duke of York has died at the age of 41.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Trump urges US to 'hang tough' as 10% tariffs come into effect\n\nThe US began collecting a 10% \"baseline\" tariff on all imports on Saturday as President Donald Trump urged Americans to \"hang tough\" after market turmoil.\n\nThe UK and France are among hundreds of countries impacted and its leaders have said nothing is off the table. While China, which has been hit the hardest by President Trump's tariffs, announced a significant retaliatory response.\n\nAll three major stock indexes in the US plunged more than 5% on Friday, with the S&P 500 dropping almost 6%, capping the worst week for the US stock market since 2020.\n\nIn Washington DC, New York and other cities thousands gathered to protest against a range of Trump's policies - from the economy to government cuts.\n\nTrump described the market volatility as \"an economic revolution\", which the US \"will win\".\n\n\"Hang tough, it won't be easy, but the end result will be historic,\" he added in a post on Truth Social.\n\nHis policy changes have sent shockwaves through global supply chains.\n\nIn the UK, the FTSE 100 fell almost 5% - its steepest in five years, while Asian markets also dropped and exchanges in Germany and France faced similar declines.\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk, a close ally of Trump and responsible for the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), said the US and Europe could move towards a \"zero-tariff situation\", which could create \"a free-trade zone between Europe and North America\".\n\nHis comments, made as he travelled to meet government ministers in Italy, came days before the Trump administration introduces tariffs on goods of up to 50% on 9 April to what it calls the \"worst offenders\" for trade imbalances with the US.\n\nThe EU is due to be hit with a 20% levy.\n\nIn his first term in office, Trump scorned a proposed free-trade deal with the EU, called the Transatlantic Trade and Investment partnership, but a bubbling trade war was ended after he put threats to impose tariffs on European cars aside in 2018.\n\nBritish Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had a series of calls with world leaders following Trump's tariffs announcement on Wednesday.\n\nIn a readout issued after Sir Keir's conversation with French President Emmanuel Macron, Downing Street said the pair \"agreed that a trade war was in nobody's interests but nothing should be off the table\".\n\nSir Keir and Macron also \"shared their concerns about the global economic and security impact, particularly in South East Asia\".\n\nChina, the world's second-largest economy, was hardest hit by Trump's \"reciprocal tariffs\" towards nations he deems unfriendly to America's interest.\n\nOn Friday, Beijing announced retaliatory tariffs of 34% on US imports - the same as Washington imposed on imports from China. Beijing also filed a complaint against the new tariffs to the World Trade Organisation.\n\nIn a statement a day later, China's foreign ministry urged Washington to \"stop using tariffs as a weapon to suppress China's economy and trade, and stop undermining the legitimate development rights of the Chinese people\".\n\nIn Washington DC and across the US, around 1,200 demonstrations were expected to take place on Saturday, marking the largest single day of protest against President Trump and Musk since the White House announced policy changes to how the US government is led - expanding the power of the executive branch.\n\nThe White House is yet to comment on the protests, but Trump was pictured by an AP photographer - excluded from the press pool - with an issue of the New York Post in his hand, open to an article about China.\n\nThe impact on trade since tariffs came into place has been palpable.\n\nIn the UK, Jaguar Land Rover announced it would \"pause\" all shipments to the US as it works to \"address the new trading terms\".\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

Early in their terms, Democratic and Republican leaders alike have issued ethics guidelines for their administration. President Donald Trump did so shortly after taking office in 2017, using some of the same language as Bill Clinton's and Barack Obama's ethics pledges.\n\nThis year, President Trump has not made such a promise.\n\nHe did not sign an ethics pledge for his presidential transition process, as is called for by law. And hours after being sworn into office, he rescinded former President Joe Biden's ethics rules - without issuing a pledge covering his own administration.\n\nU.S. presidents traditionally have been expected to keep their own financial interests separate from political ones. President Donald Trump's actions have defied norms and are causing some ethics watchdogs to say new laws are needed.\n\nEven if Mr. Trump does eventually sign such an order, it's unclear who will enforce it. In his first week in office, he fired the director of the U.S. Office of Government Ethics, as well as 17 - or about 1 in 4 - of the inspectors general who serve in watchdog roles at various federal agencies (disregarding the 30-day notice to Congress required by law).\n\nOf course, pledges themselves don't guarantee ethical behavior by presidents or their administrations. During his first term, Mr. Trump raised ethical red flags by refusing to divest or put his financial holdings in a blind trust as did other presidents, saying that he would maintain a \"wall of separation\" between himself and The Trump Organization, which would be run by his sons. Foreign dignitaries frequently booked stays at Mr. Trump's golf clubs and hotels throughout his tenure, which critics called a blatant form of currying favor. And Mr. Trump himself spent substantial amounts of time at his own properties during those four years, often with other high-level government officials - at a cost of hundreds of thousands of dollars of taxpayer money.\n\nNow, less than three months into his second term, experts on ethics say Mr. Trump is pushing boundaries in new ways, reaping millions of dollars in the process. They also say that, given the prominence of business dealings in Mr. Trump's own life and in his family, it becomes hard to know whether personal interests are operating alongside his political priorities for the nation, in actions ranging from tariff negotiations to a reshaping of government.\n\n\"In the first administration, what Trump was doing to make money off his presidency closely mirrored how he had always made money,\" says Jordan Libowitz, communications director for the nonprofit Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics (CREW) in Washington. But this second Trump term, he says, \"is shaping up to be fundamentally different, both in type and scale.\"\n\nTo the president's supporters, such concerns are overblown. Mr. Trump has long had a reputation as an aggressive businessman unabashedly pursuing wealth and success, they say - and now he's doing it for the country as well as for himself. Whether he's following every ethics guideline or worrying about possible conflicts of interest doesn't so much matter as long as he's delivering results for America. Many also point to the business dealings of President Biden's son Hunter as an example of how other first families have blatantly profiteered off the power of the presidency.\n\n\"President Trump's assets are in a trust managed by his children. There are no conflicts of interest,\" Anna Kelly, deputy press secretary for the White House, emailed in response to an inquiry for this article.\n\nStill, ethics watchdogs say presidential self-dealing appears to have reached an unprecedented scale, with potentially huge amounts of money at stake. CREW estimates that during his first stint in the White House Mr. Trump made, at a minimum, hundreds of millions of dollars - separate from the question of whether ethical lines were crossed or not. That far exceeds the $400,000 salary that he has declined. And it doesn't include other administration officials and advisers with apparent conflicts of interest who could benefit personally from access to information and influence.\n\nBefore Mr. Trump returned to the White House in January, Amazon successfully bid $40 million - almost three times the next highest bid - for a documentary about Melania Trump, more than 70% of which is reportedly going directly to the first lady, The Wall Street Journal reported. A December article , also in the Journal, described CEOs \"rushing to curry favor\" with Mr. Trump, including by donating millions to his inaugural fund.\n\nUnlike in 2017, The Trump Organization this year has not pledged to pause any foreign real estate deals, only agreeing not to transact with foreign governments. Still, LIV Golf, which is funded by the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, rented Mr. Trump's Doral, Florida, golf course for a tournament this past weekend. And a new Trump Tower is being built in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia.\n\nLast month, Mr. Trump held what amounted to a live advertisement for Tesla cars at the White House with CEO and \"special government employee\" Elon Musk, who afterward signaled he wanted to donate $100 million to the Trump political operation (Mr. Musk was the top donor in the 2024 campaign, giving nearly $300 million to Republican candidates and groups). On March 19, U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told Americans to \"buy Tesla\" stock during a Fox News appearance .\n\n\"We've never seen anything remotely like this before,\" says Richard Briffault, a Columbia law professor and reporter for the American Law Institute's project on principles of government ethics.\n\nTo be sure, Washington has had its share of ethics scandals in the past. There was the Crédit Mobilier scandal in the 1860s, when Washington politicians got kickbacks from a new railroad construction, and Teapot Dome in the 1920s, when the interior secretary accepted bribes from oil companies. There was Watergate in the 1970s, when President Richard Nixon's reelection campaign secretly used donor money to spy on Democrats and his administration covered it up.\n\nBut \"None of these examples [involved] a president having business interests where he was directly benefiting from his decisions as president,\" says Kedric Payne, senior director of ethics at the Campaign Legal Center. With the first two examples, the politicians in question at least could argue that they were trying to deliver railroads or energy for the American people. And when the Watergate scandal was exposed, President Nixon resigned.\n\nThe U.S. Constitution establishes that conflicts of interest should be viewed as a grave threat to the body politic - especially when foreign governments are the ones seeking influence. Presidents are prohibited from accepting foreign gifts by the Constitution's emoluments clause. Some lawsuits during Mr. Trump's first term charged he had violated this standard , but the Supreme Court moved to dismiss those cases as he left office. One challenge is that the Constitution does not lay out a clear mechanism for enforcing the emoluments clause, and Congress has yet to pass legislation to do so.\n\nMoreover, the president and vice president are technically exempt from federal conflict-of-interest rules, since as heads of the entire government, they can't just recuse themselves from specific policy matters. Congress hasn't addressed this \"presidential loophole\" surrounding potential self-dealing, or expanded the financial disclosure requirements.\n\n\"All the way through Obama,\" presidents generally followed the expectation that they wouldn't use their own name to make money while serving in the White House, says Richard Painter, who was chief White House ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration. Mr. Trump broke that norm in his first term, Mr. Painter says, \"But it's gotten much more extreme.\"\n\nMr. Trump has made money from licensing agreements for years, lending his name to various forms of merchandise, a practice that he's continued since reentering the White House. According to a 2024 candidate disclosure form , while running for office that year Mr. Trump earned $300,000 in royalties from \"God Bless the USA Bible,\" a $60 Trump-endorsed Bible that includes copied text of the U.S. Constitution, Pledge of Allegiance, and the chorus of Lee Greenwood's song \"God Bless the USA.\" Mr. Trump also earned almost $4.5 million in royalties from the book \"Letters to Trump\" and over $500,000 in royalties from the book \"A MAGA Journey.\"\n\nAdditionally, between T Retail LLC and T Tower Retail LLC, Mr. Trump took in more than $5.5 million from retail goods, not including Trump Ice LLC, which brought in over $100,000 from Trump-branded spring water. He has put his name on gold watches costing up to $100,000 each . GetTrumpSneakers.com, where supporters can buy gold \"Never Surrender\" high-tops for $399 and preorder \"Victory 47\" cologne for $199, reiterates in its fine print that the site \"has nothing to do with any political campaign.\"\n\nBut while putting his name on bottled water and pricey watches may mark a break from presidential decorum, along with maintaining his real estate business, it may pale in comparison with the profits Mr. Trump stands to make from his publicly traded media company and cryptocurrency, say experts.\n\n\"There are only so many hotel rooms you can book. There are only so many rounds of golf one can play,\" says Mr. Libowitz. \"Trump moved from physical goods and properties to digital ones.\"\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp., which manages the president's social media site, Truth Social, went public a year ago and roughly doubled Mr. Trump's net worth, putting him back on Forbes' list of 400 richest people. Over the past few months, the company has had wide swings in share prices, with some analysts arguing that DJT - as it is known by ticker - is overvalued.\n\nThe potential conflicts of interest here are considerable: A foreign government, for example, could buy up shares and gain leverage over the president of the United States.\n\nThen there are the meme coins - $TRUMP and $MELANIA - that launched days before Mr. Trump's inauguration. Meme coins, a type of highly volatile cryptocurrency originating from an internet meme, are viewed skeptically even by many in the crypto industry. $TRUMP's market cap surpassed $14 billion shortly after launch, but has since fallen to $2.2 billion . Cryptocurrency prices briefly jumped in March when Mr. Trump signed an executive order to create a \" Strategic Bitcoin Reserve ,\" saying the move would help the nation harness \"the power of digital assets for our prosperity.\"\n\nBut cryptocurrency values are only one part of the moneymaking equation: Coin issuers like Mr. Trump's business entities make money on both coin sales and trading fees . By some estimates those fees have reached $100 million for the Trump coins. \"He makes money on crypto whether it goes up or down,\" says Mr. Payne. \"For Trump it's just win, win, win.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

It's harder to stop one. And it's almost impossible to win one.\n\nOn Wednesday, President Donald Trump unleashed such a war on the world. He imposed a 10% tariff, or tax, on all foreign goods coming into the United States. He fired bigger volleys at about 60 nations or trading blocs, imposing tariffs as high as 50%. Asian nations came under especially heavy attack: 46% for Vietnam, and 54% for China, including earlier tariffs. The European Union got hit with a 20% duty.\n\nGlobal stock markets tumbled, with America's S&P 500 down nearly 5% Thursday, and down 12% from its Feb. 19 peak of 6,144.\n\nPresident Donald Trump appears convinced that tariffs can help - not hurt - a nation's growth. The success of his global trade shake-up may hinge on whether he uses tariffs as a tool to break down trade barriers or as a permanent shield for U.S. factories.\n\nThe next phase is a more dangerous one: the nations' response, especially large trading partners like China and the European Union.\n\nSome past trade wars have escalated with rounds of tit-for-tat tariffs. That's what happened in the 1930s. It could happen again.\n\nThey could eliminate their tariffs and other policies that crimp demand for U.S. goods, as President Donald Trump has urged them to. They could negotiate, but they have little time. America's universal 10% tariffs go into place Saturday, with bigger targeted ones going into effect April 9. They could do nothing and simply let their economies adjust as best as they can. Or they could retaliate with their own tariffs on U.S. goods crossing their borders. China, Japan, and the EU have all threatened tariffs.\n\nHe claims the rest of the world is taking advantage of the United States by imposing unfair barriers to American goods. He has a point. After World War II, Washington was eager to rebuild democracies and gave various nations generous trade deals to speed the process. Those barriers have come down dramatically over the ensuing decades as nations negotiated trade-barrier reductions through various rounds of trade talks.\n\nBut a pattern of chronic and huge trade imbalances has developed, with the U.S. consistently importing much more than it exports, and with the U.S. share of global manufacturing declining. Pushing back against these trends, Presidents Trump and Joe Biden began to raise U.S. tariffs in 2017 and beyond.\n\nStill, before this year, a foreign product coming into the U.S. got tagged with a typical tariff of just 2.2%, less than in major trading partners such as the European Union (2.7%) or China (3%), according to the World Trade Organization . Now, a foreign company shipping goods to the U.S. will pay a weighted average tariff of 18.8%, according to a Goldman Sachs analysis, or higher by some other estimates. That would outstrip even outlier India (12%).\n\nRather than negotiate over trade relations, as postwar presidents have done in the past, Mr. Trump is going on the offensive to force change.\n\nMany nations view exports as a key part of their economic strategies. And it's tricky because trade barriers come in different forms. Tariffs are relatively straightforward. Nontariff trade barriers are not.\n\nTake Vietnam. It imposes less than a 15% tariff on foreign imports, including U.S. goods. But in a report released earlier this week , the Trump administration pointed to other barriers that Vietnam has imposed on American products, such as increased taxes on imported alcohol and bans on imports of certain toys, used auto parts, and encryption software. Those aren't tariffs, but they certainly discourage foreign goods from coming into Vietnam.\n\nOr consider China, which has rejected imports from certain U.S. pork processing plants because of detections of animal diseases. Those diseases regularly occur in China and pose no threat to humans, according to the report. Is that a reasonable health precaution - or a trade barrier? Such nontariff trade barriers often lie in the eye of the beholder.\n\nIn calculating the level of tariffs to impose, the administration says it is factoring in these nontariff barriers. Rather than identifying ground-level estimates of the barriers, the administration developed a formula based on existing bilateral trade deficits with each nation. The White House claims that Vietnam's trade barriers amount to a 90% tariff on U.S. goods, rather than nominal tariff levels below 15%. Therefore, it is imposing a reciprocal tariff of about half that level, or 46%. Some U.S. experts are questioning the calculations. Certainly, the nations themselves will dispute them in negotiations with the U.S. That's why trade wars can be so hard to stop.\n\nBecause they make economies less competitive. Suppose you have the choice to buy either a $20,000 Chinese electric vehicle or a $35,000 American EV. Which will help America the most? Most economists would pick the Chinese EV. Why? Because the more money Americans save, the more money they have to spend on U.S. goods that are more competitive. And that spending boost outweighs the bounce from protecting domestic factories and jobs, economists say.\n\nNow, factor in retaliation. Other nations, angered by the new American tariffs, will impose their own retaliatory tariffs on U.S. goods, reducing the sales of America's most internationally competitive companies.\n\nThus, trade wars shelter a nation's less competitive firms while hurting the sales of its more competitive ones. Inevitably, growth slows. And prices rise because consumers end up having to buy more expensive products like the American EV. That means at least a temporary boost to inflation.\n\nIn the real world, of course, things aren't so simple. There are geopolitical and even national security reasons for why the U.S. restricts high-tech exports to China and might want to slow imports of Chinese EVs. And those cars may be cheap because of government subsidies, an unfair trade practice.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber? Log in to hide ads .\n\nThe current escalation in U.S. tariffs, though, suggests that President Trump, perhaps influenced by unorthodox economists, is convinced that tariffs can boost a nation's growth rather than slow it in the long run.\n\nThat depends on the president. If he uses tariffs as a bargaining tool to tear down trade barriers, then economic growth can accelerate, and 200 years of economic theory will be vindicated. If he makes the tariffs permanent, then America will have embarked on a big and long-term experiment to prove that a fringe trade theory may be right after all.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Gen. Dan \"Razin'\" Caine, told the president he \"loved\" him and would \"kill for\" him, and then donned a red MAGA hat when they first met in Iraq in 2018.\n\nMr. Caine's close colleagues dispute that story - wearing a cap with a political message while in uniform during a deployment is a violation of military codes.\n\nHats aside, a military that's obedient to its civilian commander-in-chief is a cornerstone of U.S. democracy. Even the president's critics are quick to say that he has the right to choose his subordinates.\n\nYet the mass dismissal of the armed services' top echelons raises \"troubling questions about the administration's desire to politicize the military and to remove legal constraints on the President's power,\" five former secretaries of defense wrote in a letter to Congress last month. \"Those currently serving may grow cautious of speaking truth to power, or they could erode good order and discipline by taking political actions in uniform.\"\n\nThe defense secretaries' letter notes that Alexander Hamilton pressed military officers to insert themselves into domestic politics hoping that the Continental Army's grievances could help pressure states into supporting a stronger national government.\n\nGeorge Washington warned him against it: \"The Army is a dangerous instrument to play with,\" he said.\n\nConservatives who argue that President Joe Biden politicized the military by focusing on climate change and by advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion measures call these concerns, on the heels of Mr. Trump's firings, sour grapes.\n\nAs these latest Trump administration moves play out, they will be recorded in America's history books, already well stocked with tales of U.S. presidents who have let go of commanders for political reasons - or kept others at their political peril.\n\nThese were big news stories in their day, followed closely by those who worried, as now, that politicizing the military poses considerable risks to military morale, strategic readiness, and democratic safeguards.\n\nA Revolutionary War veteran back when the new republic was still fragile, Brig. Gen. James Wilkinson was \"renowned for never having won a battle or lost a court-martial,\" as historian Robert Leckie put it.\n\nWilkinson was also the colonial army's top officer, one of a number of generals who'd ascended the military ranks through family ties, wealth, and political savvy. \"His rise,\" Mr. Leckie writes, \"disgusted every decent officer in the service.\"\n\nWilkinson also almost helped America lose the West. When Aaron Burr was accused in 1807 of hatching a traitorous plot to carve out an independent nation from western states and the Louisiana Territory, it was discovered that he'd sought support from Wilkinson - later found to be on Spain's payroll as a secret agent.\n\nAt the same time as he was the army's senior officer, Wilkinson was also governor of Louisiana and, as such, arrested a number of people - and their lawyers - whom he thought could link him to Burr.\n\nWidely believed to be complicit in Burr's alleged plotting, Wilkinson escaped prosecution by throwing Burr under the bus in a letter to then-President Thomas Jefferson. For all this, he was court-martialed but later acquitted. Historians speculate that Wilkinson's political connections kept President James Madison from pursuing more serious treason charges against him.\n\nWilkinson went on to be one of the leading generals infamously defeated in Madison's failed U.S. invasion of Canada during the War of 1812, which, had it succeeded, could have permanently changed the shape of America. Wilkinson was court-martialed again for misconduct, but he was once more acquitted.\n\n\"In all our history,\" Theodore Roosevelt wrote, \"there has been no more despicable character.\"\n\nMore than a century later, Gen. Douglas MacArthur - counter to policies to protect civilian control of the military - publicly protested President Harry Truman's foreign policy plans: General MacArthur was, in short, convinced that China posed a significant strategic threat to America, while President Truman was more concerned about Russia's designs on Europe.\n\nAfter many patient warnings, President Truman relieved him of command and was promptly thrust into a fight for his political life. Republicans accused the president of being soft on communism. Sen. Joseph McCarthy called Mr. Truman - and all Democrats - traitors.\n\nUltimately, Mr. MacArthur was replaced by Lt. Gen. Matthew Ridgway, who later became the U.S. Army's top officer. That's when he clashed with President Dwight D. Eisenhower, whom he had replaced as supreme allied commander of Europe following their service in World War II.\n\nPresident Eisenhower believed nuclear weapons were a better investment than a large ground force. Shrinking the Army was necessary to keep the economy robust so America could make that investment, he said.\n\nMr. Ridgway argued publicly that the ability of nuclear weapons to wipe out the world meant that rational leaders were far more likely to use conventional forces in armed conflict. Reducing them would leave America vulnerable.\n\nMany generals agreed with Mr. Ridgway, and, tired of their dissent, President Eisenhower increasingly isolated himself from their advice. He allowed the general to finish out his two-year term, but he did not invite him back for another, effectively firing him.\n\nWhile the president's strategy played a role in winning the Cold War, an analysis from West Point's Modern War Institute argues that Mr. Ridgway was right: In the years to come, \"a gutted and largely demoralized Army would reveal itself incapable\" of winning the Vietnam War.\n\nOther fundamental disagreements about America's strategic direction have played out in the public spotlight, with military officers openly calling into question - and subverting - the decisions of civilian leaders.\n\nWhen President Jimmy Carter planned to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea, believing it would encourage South Korea to rely more on its own armed forces, the top commander in the region, Maj. Gen. John Singlaub, publicly questioned the president's decision.\n\nIt could lead to another North Korean invasion, he said. President Carter quickly relieved Mr. Singlaub of his post.\n\nA Silver Star recipient who had trained resistance fighters in German-occupied France, Mr. Singlaub was reassigned to another military job. He later publicly criticized President Carter again for, among other things, giving up control of the Panama Canal. He was then ordered to the Department of Defense, which announced his retirement the following day.\n\nLater, Mr. Singlaub became a major fundraiser for the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, who were fighting that Central American country's leftist government. He testified in 1987 congressional hearings on the Reagan administration's secret plan to sell arms to Iran, with proceeds diverted to the rebels.\n\nIt was an end-run around a congressional ban on aid to the Contras. Mr. Singlaub explained that his own visible role helped divert attention away from the program.\n\nConservative Sen. Barry Goldwater sent a note to CIA Director William Casey after Congress learned of the Nicaragua affair from a Wall Street Journal investigative article.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan \"has asked us to back his foreign policy,\" he wrote. \"Bill, how can we back his foreign policy when we don't know what the hell he is doing?\"\n\nThe investigation - which found that the president's national security adviser, Adm. John Poindexter, and his assistant Lt. Col. Oliver North had destroyed thousands of documents rather than hand them over - reaffirmed the essential role Congress plays in the oversight of the executive branch.\n\nHistorically, the removal of generals by their president has been for isolated instances of politicization, and usually because of public actions of the commander.\n\nIn recent history, Adm. William Fallon resigned as a top U.S. commander after an article portrayed him as opposing President George W. Bush's Iran policies.\n\nTwo years later, President Barack Obama relieved Gen. Stanley McChrystal of his command of U.S. forces in Afghanistan after he was quoted making disparaging comments about his civilian leaders, including then-Vice President Biden.\n\nFor this reason, President Trump's firing of six top military leaders upon taking office is concerning, says Richard Kohn, former chief historian of the Air Force and now professor emeritus at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.\n\nThe administration has pointed to Gen. George Marshall's 1940 \"plucking board\" as historical precedent, convened to cull older colonels and generals nearing retirement. General Marshall wanted to raise up officers more prepared for the rigors of the approaching world war.\n\nThe Trump administration has not given an official rationale for its firings. In a Truth Social post announcing that he was letting go Air Force Gen. CQ Brown Jr., the second Black man to serve as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Mr. Trump thanked him for his service, calling him a \"fine gentleman and an outstanding leader.\"\n\nBut the underlying reason for his dismissal, many experts have suggested, was General Brown's public comments about challenges of being a Black man in the U.S. armed forces. \"It's very clear that the Republican Party has become less supportive of the military for what they consider to be woke-ism,\" says Professor Kohn. \"And that itself is a major source of politicization.\"\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

That dynamic reached another chaotic height this past weekend as the Trump administration seeks to further its policy of mass deportations.\n\nOver a 24-hour period that featured arrests, deportations, lawsuits, and apparent trolling from a foreign leader, lawyers and judges scrambled to respond to the administration's efforts to remove immigrants it claims to be especially dangerous.\n\nWhat happened exactly is still unclear. But the events represent the new logistical - and constitutional - strains being placed on the United States' judges and courts.\n\nAs President Trump implements his agenda at lightning speed, a growing number of judges tell him to roll back those actions until lawsuits can be heard. So far, the injunctions are drawing mixed responses from the executive branch.\n\nIn two cases, court orders meant to temporarily block the White House deportations have, at best, not arrived in time. At worst, the court orders have been ignored. Judges in both cases are now working through the particulars, but legal experts say that either scenario has troubling implications.\n\nThe Trump administration \"has really taken to heart the motto of 'move fast and break things,'\" says Daniel Farber, a professor at the University of California, Berkeley law school.\n\nThis has led to some losses in court, he adds, but \"Even if they're eventually told to stop what they're doing, or to reverse what they're doing, just the fact that they've done it has an impact.\"\n\nAs President Trump's administration moves fast and breaks things, observers worry that the balance of powers could be among those things getting broken.\n\n\"Courts are not going to stop us,\" said Tom Homan, Mr. Trump's \"border czar,\" in a Fox News interview earlier this week that raised alarm bells. \"We're going to make this country safe again.\"\n\nPresident Trump then followed Mr. Homan's volley with a call on Tuesday for a judge who ruled against his administration to be impeached - the fourth judge to face impeachment threats after ruling against Trump policies. In a rare public rebuke to the president, U.S. Chief Justice John Roberts fired back: \"For more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision,\" he said in a statement.\n\nThe question of courts maintaining an administrative and legal status quo, while Trump administration actions are litigated, has arisen in many cases including those concerning a Lebanese work-visa holder, Venezuelan migrants, fired federal employees, and contractors owed payment for completed work.\n\nWhile preliminary rulings went against him this weekend, and while there are questions over whether federal officials complied, it's still possible that Mr. Trump ultimately prevails. But Mr. Homan's comments after a dramatic weekend suggest that judges need to scrutinize compliance carefully.\n\nOn March 15, the federal government deported over 200 migrants to El Salvador, including some Venezuelans whom the government claims are members of Tren de Aragua (TdA), a violent gang founded in 2014 in a Venezuelan prison.\n\nThe deportations were fast-tracked after President Trump invoked the Alien Enemies Act earlier that day. This 1798 law allows the president to unilaterally deport citizens of a country at war with the U.S., and Mr. Trump has claimed that TdA is \"conducting irregular warfare against\" the United States. A lawsuit challenging that claim quickly followed, brought by five alleged TdA gang members. But during a hearing that night on the case in Washington, two planes full of migrants left Texas and began flying south.\n\nLater that evening - after, it seems , Judge James Boasberg temporarily blocked the deportations and ordered the government to call back planes carrying them out - the two aircraft landed in El Salvador.\n\nThe next morning, Salvadoran president Nayib Bukele posted on social media a picture of a headline about Judge Boasberg's order. \"Oopsie,\" he wrote. \"Too late.\" By Sunday afternoon, President Bukele's office had released video clips believed to be images of migrants being escorted off a plane and taken to a prison where incarcerated people are reportedly subjected to torture and beatings.\n\nSimilar confusion broke out in Massachusetts last weekend when Dr. Rasha Alawieh, a Brown University assistant professor and kidney specialist living in the U.S. on a specialist worker visa, was denied entry into the country after a monthlong trip to her native Lebanon. U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents stopped her after finding materials \"sympathetic\" to Hezbollah on her phone, according to court documents filed by the government this week .\n\nIn the hours that followed, Judge Leo Sorokin issued an order that Dr. Alawieh was not to be moved without 48 hours' notice pending a review of her case. But the next day, she was put on a flight to Lebanon via Paris. Prosecutors said that CBP agents had not heard about the court order when they did so, according to court filings.\n\n\"At no time would [U.S. Customs and Border Protection] not take a court order seriously,\" a CBP official wrote in a sworn declaration.\n\nThe government response in the TdA case has been different. In a hearing in that case on Monday, the government argued that Judge Boasberg lost jurisdiction over the El Salvador flights once they left U.S. airspace.\n\n\"I think it's pretty clear that my equitable powers don't stop at the water's edge, at the airspace's edge,\" Judge Boasberg responded. \"Isn't the response to what you perceive as an unconstitutional or improper order to appeal it,\" he added, \"rather than going forward and saying, 'We'll do what we want'?\"\n\nConservatives argue that these fast-paced actions are a necessary response after four years of soft immigration enforcement under President Joe Biden.\n\n\"President Trump is using every tool he has to expedite the removal of people,\" says Dan Stein, president of the Federation for American Immigration Reform. \"Maybe he will be successful with this process; maybe he won't.\"\n\nBut fast-paced executive actions, as seen this past weekend, can risk at least the appearance of judicial orders being ignored. Now, compliance with court orders on immigration actions and others is something federal judges around the country are wading into.\n\nThese are complex, granular issues far removed from the important questions, such as whether Mr. Trump's invocation of the Alien Enemies Act is lawful. But legal experts say judicial review here is critical to the balance of powers underpinning U.S. democracy.\n\n\"An understanding that government agencies, government actors, will abide by federal court rulings [is] fundamental to our system of government,\" says Denise Gilman, co-director of the Immigration Clinic at the University of Texas at Austin School of Law.\n\nThe trend appears to be that the executive branch is straddling the line between obeying the courts and waiting for appeals or delaying making the ordered changes.\n\nIn two cases, for example, the Trump administration has been ordered to rehire probationary employees fired over the past two months. But court filings the government submitted on Monday revealed that of the roughly 24,500 employees terminated by the government, almost all have been rehired and then immediately placed on administrative leave.\n\nIn another case, Judge Amir Ali has ordered the government to make payments from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) for work already completed before administration officials paused all payments from the agency. Trump administration lawyers have said those payments have since been unfrozen. But they're now being reviewed case by case before being released.\n\nJudge Ali said earlier this month that he is working to ensure that the government complies with the payments order while \"ensuring that due regard is given to feasibility.\" In a status report last week, the organizations that brought the suit claimed they are still awaiting $228 million in payments for work completed before the initial USAID funding pause.\n\nThe government said it expects to finish processing the payments this week. Another status report is due today.\n\nThat same kind of legal standoff is ongoing under Judge Sorokin in Massachusetts and Judge Boasberg in Washington, D.C.\n\n\"All of this is sort of nitpicky procedural stuff,\" says Professor Farber. But if a judge wants to determine if the government \"deliberately disobeyed\" their order, he adds, \"the judge is going to have to deal with all those arguments.\"\n\nEditors's note: This story was updated to note that U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents, not Border Patrol agents, interacted with Dr. Rasha Alawieh of Brown University.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Former FBI Director Christopher Wray has called Chinese hacks the \"defining threat of our generation.\"\n\nForeign hackers interfering against the U.S. worries Democrats and Republicans alike. A string of Chinese hacks into government agencies, infrastructure systems, and telephone companies in recent years has raised alarm bells, including a disclosure in December 2024 that hackers with ties to the Chinese government broke into the U.S. Treasury Department's systems.\n\nCyberattacks increasingly threaten the public and private sectors alike - including vital U.S. infrastructure. The Trump administration is considering tougher action against nations that sponsor hacking.\n\nIn her Senate confirmation hearing, Department of Homeland Security head Kristi Noem called cyberattacks a \"rising threat\" that \"demands our utmost attention.\" Yet the Trump administration has taken early actions that undermine long-standing cybersecurity efforts, critics argue.\n\nIn the middle of all of this, President Donald Trump is trying to chart his course on cybersecurity policy, sometimes sending mixed messages about his intentions. With the growing focus on cybersecurity, here's a look at some of the issues government officials are looking to address.\n\nRisks are present in both the private and public sectors. One in 3 CEOs globally recently cited cyberespionage and loss of sensitive information as their top concern . Ransomware attacks, in which hackers block access to a computer system until its users pay a \"ransom,\" is a growing concern. These types of attacks rose worldwide by 74% in 2023, with the U.S. \"most heavily targeted,\" according to the former director of national intelligence under President Joe Biden.\n\nThe U.S. also faces a shortage of around 500,000 workers in cybersecurity, although some argue that advances in artificial intelligence could reduce the need for cybersecurity professionals.\n\nThen there are foreign actors. Last summer, according to a U.S. Department of Justice indictment, hackers employed by Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps were able to breach a presidential campaign (understood to be Mr. Trump's ), stealing confidential information. In October, U.S. officials said they disrupted a Russian cyberattack on Defense Department and State Department computers.\n\nBut China is outpacing both those countries , with U.S. officials saying it is responsible for more hacks globally than Russia, North Korea, and Iran combined. They say the Chinese government often operates through groups of contractors, sometimes called hackers for hire, who are paid to find vulnerabilities within U.S. data systems and infrastructure.\n\nTwo of the biggest names among these hackers for hire are Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon. (Microsoft assigned these names in order to keep track of the groups.)\n\nLast fall, reporting uncovered that Salt Typhoon had been carrying out a series of damaging cyberattacks since as early as 2022. The hackers targeted major telecommunications firms, the U.S. Treasury Department said. Among those were Verizon and AT&T.\n\nRichard Forno, a cybersecurity expert at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County, says these hacks probably don't present an immediate threat to the average person. But they give China an informational edge.\n\nTelecommunications and internet infrastructure \"underpins so much of our modern society,\" says Dr. Forno. \"So if you can penetrate and potentially disrupt that infrastructure, you can have all sorts of follow-on effects down the road.\"\n\nVolt Typhoon presents a different kind of threat. In 2023, this hacking group, which is also tied to the Chinese government, had penetrated infrastructure such as transportation, water, and energy systems across the U.S. Once they gained access, hackers implanted malware - malicious software - that can essentially lie dormant until China wants to activate it. In early 2024, the FBI announced it had removed malware from hundreds of home and office internet routers to disrupt the attack.\n\nBut the U.S. is still determining the scope of these attacks. Many security experts and public officials warn that China could use them as a tool in the event of a conflict - for example, if China invaded Taiwan and wanted to limit the U.S. reaction.\n\n\"China traditionally takes a very long, patient view of espionage and warfare,\" says Dr. Forno.\n\nThe Trump administration seems to be prioritizing an offensive approach to cybersecurity. National Security Adviser Mike Waltz has suggested imposing higher costs and harsher consequences on nations that carry out cyberattacks. Sean Plankey, the new head of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), said he expects \"more pointed measures at our adversaries.\"\n\nPresident Trump has also been reshaping digital security institutions within the federal government. Shortly after taking office, he dissolved the Cyber Safety Review Board, a Biden-created commission that had been investigating the Salt Typhoon hacks. He also oversaw more than 100 layoffs at CISA, including some employees who were tracking the efforts of Salt Typhoon and Volt Typhoon, according to media reports . (Some employees have reportedly been rehired and put on probationary leave .) However, Reuters has reported that in early March, the White House sent a memo directing federal agencies not to fire their cybersecurity teams.\n\nLast week, President Donald Trump fired Air Force Gen. Timothy Haugh , who headed the National Security Agency and the Pentagon's Cyber Command. No official reason has given. Laura Loomer, an activist on the right, thanked the president for getting rid of \"Biden holdovers\" in some prominent security positions.\n\nSome early actions of the Trump administration are raising red flags among cybersecurity analysts. Recently, senior officials, including Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth, drew bipartisan criticism for posting details of a pending U.S. military strike in group text messages on Signal, an encrypted commercial messaging app. The conversation was revealed after a journalist was accidentally added to the group.\n\nA National Security Council spokesperson confirmed the authenticity of the text chain. Mr. Hegseth has denied posting classified information. Yet officials used Signal even though the Department of Defense warned that the app has \"a vulnerability\" that Russian hackers are trying to exploit, NPR reported.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Whether the DOGE team is following security protocols is unclear. Violating protocols could increase risks of foreign actors leveraging mistakes for their own gain.\n\nFor instance, two federal employees filed a lawsuit accusing the federal Office of Personnel Management of using an unauthorized private server to send DOGE email blasts across the government. But OPM lawyers argued in a court filing that this email system doesn't pose a security risk because it operates \"entirely\" on government computers and doesn't use a nongovernment server.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

On Wednesday, which he calls \"Liberation Day,\" he's due to announce his reciprocal tariffs - taxing imported goods at levels that, the administration says, are equivalent to trade barriers that other nations impose on the U.S.\n\nPresident Donald Trump hopes to use reciprocal tariffs to boost national self-sufficiency while unleashing a jobs boom. What's less clear is whether they can work.\n\nHe says the strategy not only can work, but already is working.\n\n\"We're going to have growth in the auto industry like nobody has ever seen. Plants are opening up all over the place. Deals are being made,\" the president told a joint session of Congress last month. \"That's a combination of the election win and tariffs.\"\n\nBut if he has conveyed a vision, Mr. Trump has also sent mixed signals. What's still a mystery is whether he will use tariffs as a tool to extract concessions and investments or as a long-term solution in itself. Even less clear is whether they can work.\n\n\"Most economists would say this doesn't make sense in terms of promoting economic growth,\" says Jeffrey Schott, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. \"It will dampen economic growth even as it feeds inflation.\"\n\nThe president has acknowledged that his strategy may bring some near-term challenges, such as a possible recession. At the same time, it's possible that by shaking up long-standing patterns of global trade, Mr. Trump will prompt a jump in factory investment within the U.S. by multinational firms - and perhaps push other nations to reduce their trade surpluses (in which exports exceed imports).\n\nTo many economists, a trade surplus or deficit isn't inherently good or bad. But some acknowledge that America's long-standing trade deficit with the rest of the world reflects unhealthy imbalances in a range of major economies.\n\nIn pursuing his strategy, President Trump faces at least two challenges. One is timing. The other is automation.\n\nConsider timing first. Under his plan, the bad stuff happens up front. Effectively a tax on much economic activity, tariffs typically mean slower growth, higher prices, and higher inflation. Companies may try to absorb the higher costs of their imports. But some of those costs are bound to get passed on to consumers.\n\nTake autos. The president says he will impose 25% tariffs on imported cars starting Thursday and on auto parts no later than May 3. (Parts that qualify for preferential treatment under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement would be exempt for the moment.) The auto industries of the three nations are so intertwined, with some parts crossing borders multiple times, that untangling them will take time.\n\n\"It's going to be a huge hit and a huge mess,\" says Art Wheaton , director of labor studies at Cornell University's School of Industrial and Labor Relations. Analysts at Wedbush Securities estimate the cost of a typical new car will rise by $5,000 to $10,000 almost immediately. President Trump's tariffs will mean higher prices for many other goods, too, including imported food and anything using aluminum or steel.\n\nIf the 2024 election is any guide, voters hate higher prices. Such discontent may well rear its head in midterm elections next year. Republicans, who hold only a slight majority in both houses of Congress, are vulnerable.\n\nThe payoff from tariffs will be less immediate. Tariff revenues should swell federal coffers, and Mr. Trump has floated the idea of issuing a rebate to consumers. But he's also talked about using the money to bail out losers in the new tariff regime, such as farmers, reducing the federal deficit, and paying for his proposed tax cuts or replacing the income tax. Economists say tariff revenues won't come anywhere near to accomplishing even some of those goals.\n\nThe new manufacturing jobs, meanwhile, will happen long after President Trump's term ends. To locate a factory in the U.S., companies have to find a site, negotiate with state and local governments to buy it, get their construction approvals, and build the factory, all before manufacturing jobs appear. It's a process that takes years.\n\nThose jobs are the president's second hurdle. Will increasingly automated factories generate a boom of new manufacturing jobs ? Presumably, there will be more robot technicians. But experts are divided on whether there will be a big surge in jobs for less educated, less skilled workers, to whom Mr. Trump has promised help.\n\n\"The key is that you create a pipeline, a pathway for low skill to high skill,\" says Olaf Groth, a business and public policy professor at the University of California, Berkeley Haas School of Business and CEO of Cambrian Futures, an analysis and futurist firm for artificial intelligence and emerging tech. \"If we get that pathway right, then yes, we could be looking at less income inequality. But without that pathway, we're looking at more income inequality.\"\n\nSignals of sentiment suggest that Americans are skeptical. A Harvard CAPS/Harris poll released Monday found that the president's job performance approval rating dipped from 52% in February to 49% in March. Investors are grumpier, too. The stock market this week closed out its worst first quarter in three years. Ditto for consumers. The University of Michigan's sentiment index for March found that consumer expectations for the economy fell more than 30% since the election and that unemployment expectations were at their highest since 2009.\n\nHints of a slowdown are also creeping into the numbers. Consumer spending - a big prop to the U.S. economy - fell in January for the first time in 20 months before rebounding a bit the following month. Inflation remains stubbornly above the Federal Reserve's 2% target. Economists are revising downward their estimates of economic growth for the first quarter.\n\nThe president retains some advantages. Some big names have already committed to big investments in U.S. factories, including Apple, Japan-based SoftBank, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., Johnson & Johnson, and the United Arab Emirates. Job growth - another big prop to the economy - continues, although at a decelerating rate. The tax cuts Mr. Trump is proposing could go some way toward cooling consumer anger over rising prices. Those price hikes should be a one-time event, although it may not feel that way if companies try to ease the sticker shock by delaying price increases.\n\nIn a strange way, the nation's huge trade deficit also gives Mr. Trump negotiating leverage. Other countries need the U.S. more than the U.S. needs them. And America's large domestic market insulates it better from a downturn in exports than its more export-dependent trading partners: Mexico, Canada, China, Japan, and the European Union.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

If he keeps tariffs in place to fund his tax cuts or to try to protect U.S. industry, growth is likely to slow around the globe, including in the U.S.\n\nThe ambiguity emanating from the White House makes it hard to know who'll be leading America's trade policies: Trump the negotiator or Trump the protectionist.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

In reality, it is too soon to tell what lasting impact of his policies will have on the country.\n\nLoading...\n\nMarch 17, 2025, 10:00 a.m. ET\n\nIf there is one thing about politics that Americans can agree on, it's this: There's never been a U.S. president quite like Donald J. Trump.\n\nPresident Trump has already signed more executive orders than any president in the past 40 years issued in their first 100 days - in less than half the time. With the creation of the Department of Government Efficiency, he empowered Elon Musk, the world's richest man, to reshape the federal workforce. Taken together, many of the president's moves seem geared toward a fundamental shifting of the balance of power toward the executive branch, as the Monitor's Henry Gass and Linda Feldmann explore in the cover story featured in the March 17 issue of the Monitor Weekly.\n\nSo, what will this shake-up mean for the U.S. government long term?\n\nSome will tell you that it marks the start of a slide toward authoritarianism. But many of the 77 million Americans who voted for President Trump applaud his efforts, believing that this is exactly the jolt the government needs to rein in out-of-control spending.\n\nHenry and Linda have a different message: We simply don't yet know what the impact will be.\n\n\"We can't really get too ahead of ourselves\" by making assumptions about where this current disruption will lead, Henry says. \"It can be easy to sort of blow things out of proportion.\"\n\nAt the Monitor, \"Our constant edict is to project calm in our coverage. But it's not calm for calm's sake,\" says Linda, the Monitor's Washington bureau chief. It's because it's important to get the story right, she says. \"If we become agitated and fearful, and just sick with worry, then you lose your ability to think clearly.\"\n\nIt is true that the U.S. government is in a period of profound change that will undoubtedly impact the country for years to come. As citizens of a representative democracy, Americans need to be alert to those shifts. In their story, Henry and Linda draw from combined decades of experience covering the federal government and courts to show how the current political landscape fits into the long and complex history of American politics, dating back to the country's founding.\n\n\"From the perspective of the courts and the judiciary, it is still very early days. It's important to keep that in perspective,\" Henry says.\n\nWhile some cases have started to reach the U.S. Supreme Court, so far, that has all been on an emergency basis. That means the justices have only ruled on discrete procedural technicalities. They have not yet weighed in on the major questions about power and authority that the administration's actions are raising. That test is still to come.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

President Trump has been moving with lightning speed to carry out his agenda - signing a blizzard of executive orders and empowering Elon Musk's task force, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), to remake the federal bureaucracy, as it dismantles agencies and pushes out civil servants.\n\nAmerica's founders, wanting to prevent political factions, gave equal power to Congress, the courts, and the executive branch. President Donald Trump's actions are stressing that delicate balance.\n\nIn the process, President Trump is essentially doing an end run around Congress, which holds the \"power of the purse.\" But rather than trying to stop him, Republican lawmakers - who control both houses of Congress - are mostly urging him to keep going.\n\nMr. Trump is also rhetorically challenging the authority of the judicial branch. He has attacked judges as \"liberal activists\" and suggested that anything he does to \"save\" the country cannot be illegal - though he has also stated that he would abide by court rulings .\n\nTo Democrats and many scholars, the situation has all the markings of a constitutional crisis: The president is upending the United States' centuries-old balance of power as laid out by the Founding Fathers. Instead of three co-equal branches acting as a check on each other, power has become increasingly concentrated over the years in the White House - a trend that is now being supercharged under Mr. Trump in ways that, to critics, raise the specter of authoritarianism.\n\n\"The executive branch is expanding its powers beyond what any other administration has tried to do,\" says Shana Kushner Gadarian, a professor at the Maxwell School of Citizenship & Public Affairs at Syracuse University. \"That's the crisis we're in.\"\n\nTo justify their actions, Mr. Trump and his supporters argue it's the status quo that has broken to the point of being undemocratic. The federal bureaucracy had grown so large and Congress so gridlocked, they say, that it had become impossible for the government to do what the voters want.\n\n\"It does not match the will of the people,\" Mr. Musk, the world's wealthiest person, said during a recent informal press conference with Mr. Trump in the Oval Office last week. Voters, though, gave Mr. Trump a relatively narrow victory, with slightly less than half of the more than 155 million votes cast.\n\nThe bureaucracy, the tech executive said, had become an \"unelected, fourth, unconstitutional branch of government - which has, in a lot of ways, currently, more power than any elected representative.\"\n\nIn just one month, Mr. Trump - aided by Mr. Musk and his DOGE team - has dramatically cut foreign aid by almost entirely eliminating the U.S. Agency for International Development, begun dismantling the Department of Education, and raised alarm bells over the safety of taxpayer information at the Treasury Department and Internal Revenue Service as DOGE aides look for evidence of waste, fraud, and abuse.\n\nMost Republicans in Congress are complying as Mr. Trump usurps the power of the national legislature, as laid out in Article 1 of the Constitution. But some are quietly pushing back, particularly those in battleground districts who at times espouse centrist positions.\n\nTake GOP Rep. Don Bacon, who represents such a district in Nebraska. Though he supports the elimination of the watchdog Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, he says it must be done correctly.\n\n\"We have got to follow the law,\" Representative Bacon told CNN. \"If there are things we have to redirect, let's do it the constitutional way.\"\n\nStill, voices like Mr. Bacon's are few and far between; the vast majority of Republicans in Congress occupy safe GOP seats. If they face a threat, it's a primary challenge from the right if they are perceived as anti-Trump. And they know that the vast resources available to the Republican Party - including Mr. Musk's billions - could potentially support such a challenger.\n\nCompounding the issue is the fact that Republican control of both houses of Congress is exceedingly narrow, with members on both sides unwilling in most cases to break party ranks. This makes Mr. Trump inherently weak in his ability to pass the more controversial elements of his agenda through Congress. So he is focusing on executive actions - even though several have been challenged in court and could prove to be illegal.\n\nPartisan polarization, growing for decades, hinders Congress' ability to claw back its own power. \"Never Trump\" Republicans, including outspoken former Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, are now in the political wilderness. And the center has hollowed out, a reflection of the gerrymandering that has made most congressional districts safe for one or the other major party.\n\nThis scenario demonstrates why the Founding Fathers didn't mention political parties in the Constitution. They were concerned about factions. But human nature suggests that factions were inevitable, and the founders knew that, says Barbara Perry, a presidential historian at the University of Virginia's Miller Center.\n\n\"They hoped that they had figured out what [James] Madison called 'the extent and proper structure' of our country,\" Dr. Perry says. \"The structures were all these checks and balances.\"\n\nBut what they weren't counting on was lockstep partisanship, which translates today into a pro-Trump, pro-MAGA congressional majority that is likely to reinforce the president's agenda, at least until the 2026 midterm elections. But even some Republicans are distressed enough by the administration withholding congressionally approved funding that they are asking President Trump to release money meant for farmers and infrastructure projects, among other things.\n\nCongress ceding power to the president, and the president aggressively taking it, is not just a Republican phenomenon. It's been happening for decades. President Franklin D. Roosevelt, a Democrat who took office amid the Great Depression, signed hundreds of executive orders in his first year and, unlike President Trump so far, got Congress to pass major pieces of legislation that massively expanded the federal government.\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks in 2001, Republican President George W. Bush created the current-day homeland security structure, and aggressively used \"signing statements\" when he signed bills into law. Such statements, though not legally binding, provided interpretations of the law that pushed the envelope of executive power.\n\nWhen President Barack Obama's Democrats lost control of Congress in his first midterm elections, he used what he called a \"pen and phone\" strategy to enact his agenda: the signing of executive actions and phone calls to outside groups to put pressure on Congress to pass legislation.\n\nMore recently, President Joe Biden signed more than 40 executive orders in his first 100 days, a record for the post-FDR era. Many of those orders were efforts to undo what his predecessor, Mr. Trump, had done - creating a pingpong effect as administrations change hands and parties. Mr. Trump has now undone many of Mr. Biden's orders, signing more than 60 of his own so far .\n\nEfforts to reform or rein in the executive branch have waxed and waned over the years.\n\nPresident Ronald Reagan set up the Grace Commission, chaired by businessman J. Peter Grace, to eliminate waste, fraud, and abuse in the federal government. While most of its recommendations were never implemented, the commission is credited with conceptualizing future efforts to rein in the federal bureaucracy.\n\nPerhaps the most successful government restructuring was launched in 1993 by Vice President Al Gore. In its five years, the National Partnership for Reinventing Government eliminated more than 100 programs and 250,000 federal jobs, and consolidated more than 800 agencies. But unlike Mr. Trump's effort, the Gore initiative involved careful review of programs and expenditures before action was taken.\n\nBy all appearances, President Biden lacked interest in government reform. During his first two years in office, he launched only two reform initiatives , compared with 37 during President Bill Clinton's two terms and 31 during the Reagan presidency. As a result, President Biden may have helped pave the way for the current Trump-Musk effort. Public trust in democracy has been in near-steady decline since the 1980s. A recent uptick in Gallup polling , after the November election and before Mr. Trump's inauguration, reflects higher satisfaction among Republicans.\n\nMr. Musk has latched on to public unhappiness with government and turned it into a crusade. The DOGE team has been going into the data systems of various government agencies targeted for downsizing or outright elimination, alarming public-interest watchdogs.\n\nMr. Trump has repeatedly praised Mr. Musk's efforts, and made him a \"special government employee\" amid concerns that the multibillionaire was operating without any legal guidelines or oversight. One looming question centers on Mr. Musk's many corporate interests that have business with the federal government, and whether he is benefiting from DOGE's actions. When asked, he denies any conflict of interest.\n\nFor American governance writ large, the biggest test is yet to come. Legal challenges to many of Mr. Trump's actions are in court, and a key question is, What happens if the Supreme Court rules against him? Does he comply?\n\nOr will Mr. Trump follow the example of an earlier disrupter in chief, President Andrew Jackson, whose portrait hangs in the Oval Office? In 1832, President Jackson famously ignored a Supreme Court ruling on Native American rights, and challenged the high court to enforce its decision. It could not.\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

They've largely prioritized security over humanitarian concerns. His government paints unauthorized immigrants as national threats requiring a military response.\n\nThis early on, the impact on public safety and the economy remains to be seen. Yet the number of illegal southern border crossings have continued a downward trend. In the interior, fear and confusion in immigrant communities have taken root, keeping adults home from work and children home from school.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's first month featured significant change in U.S. immigration policy. The future of the transformation now rests partly with courts.\n\nMr. Trump is also broadening the scope of whom he could remove. Beyond talk of targeting \"the worst\" criminals, he's stripping legal protections from hundreds of thousands of immigrants previously shielded from deportation. In a national ad campaign, the Department of Homeland Security is telling unauthorized immigrants to leave - or, \"We will find you, and we will deport you,\" said Kristi Noem, the department's new secretary.\n\nThe president has proved that \"The crisis that we experienced over the past four years was completely unnecessary, that the border is controllable, that our laws are enforceable,\" says Ira Mehlman, media director at the Federation for American Immigration Reform. \"He seems to have kept an awful lot of his promises.\"\n\nMr. Trump signed 11 executive actions concerning immigration on his first day. And over his first month, more than 100 immigration policy developments have emerged, reports the Immigration Policy Tracking Project .\n\nThose actions and policies carry risk, says Lucas Guttentag, a Stanford law professor and Yale research scholar who created the tracking project. The administration is trying to \"squeeze every last ounce of justice and humanity out of the immigration system,\" he says, and doing so \"in ways that the courts have found and will find violates the law of the Constitution.\"\n\nSome orders were quickly implemented. Others may take time. Lawsuits brought by immigrant advocates may also stall plans, such as Mr. Trump's attempt to withhold birthright citizenship from children of certain immigrants.\n\nAs heads spin from law and policy changes so far, more are expected.\n\n\"We're seeing both immediate changes, but also the laying of the groundwork for future changes,\" says Colleen Putzel-Kavanaugh, associate policy analyst at the Migration Policy Institute. She's seeing a \"similar playbook return,\" compared to the first Trump term, but implemented faster.\n\nHere's a look at key developments to date.\n\n• National emergency declared at the southern border. Claiming the sovereignty of the United States is \"under attack\" with the entry of criminals and drugs, President Trump declared this emergency on Day 1. He directed the military to help obtain control of the border and suspended the entry of \"aliens involved in an invasion.\"\n\nMr. Trump took office with the number of Border Patrol encounters - or stops of those crossing illegally - lower than when he left in 2021. Illegal entries along the southern border have fallen since hitting a record high in December 2023.\n\nBorder Patrol encounters stood around 47,300 for the month of December. With the U.S. suspending entry, they plummeted in January to 29,100. That is the lowest since May 2020.\n\nImmigrant advocates have sued the government over access to asylum, which U.S. law says immigrants may seek even if they entered illegally.\n\n• Migrant appointments at ports of entry ended. The government stopped the use of an app called CBP One for migrants seeking lawful entry into the U.S. To deter illegal crossings, the Biden administration had encouraged migrants to set up initial appointments at official ports of entry through the app, after which they could be let in and apply for asylum.\n\nRepublicans had decried the app's use as a backdoor for otherwise unauthorized immigrants. Since 2023, over 900,000 people had been let in through the process, CBS News reports .\n\n• Limits to citizenship blocked by courts. The 14th Amendment has long been interpreted to guarantee U.S. citizenship to virtually all children born here, regardless of their immigration status. Mr. Trump signed an executive order on Day 1 seeking to bar birthright citizenship for children of unauthorized immigrants and those here temporarily. Four courts have so far blocked the order; the government is appealing two of those decisions. If a case challenging the executive order reaches the Supreme Court, it will have the final say .\n\n• Laken Riley Act signed into law. Signed by the president Jan. 29, the law mandates the federal detention of unauthorized immigrants charged with theft and violent crimes in the U.S. The act's namesake was a Georgia nursing student who was murdered by a Venezuelan man who authorities say had entered illegally and was cited for theft by shoplifting.\n\n• Temporary protections for immigrants revoked. The Trump administration has targeted immigrants who are here without permission. Now, it's expanding that group by ending temporary deportation relief for others.\n\nThat revocation includes ending temporary protected status for many Venezuelans, now set to expire in April. The government says extending their temporary stay in the U.S. is \"contrary to the national interest.\" He also moved to terminate a separate program, based on a permission to enter called parole, that let in over half a million immigrants. Both temporary statuses have, based on humanitarian grounds, allowed immigrants to live and work in the U.S.\n\n• Refugees barred. Refugees, who are fleeing identity-based persecution, are vetted and approved for protection in the U.S. before they arrive. Now Mr. Trump has suspended refugee resettlement indefinitely. (During his first term, he downsized the program, which the Biden White House then rebuilt .)\n\nThere's no single definition for \"sanctuary\" cities and states. But the term often implies that officials provide limited cooperation with the federal government on immigration enforcement.\n\nThe Department of Justice has said it will cut off funding to such cities and states, and has sued Illinois and Chicago over what it calls unconstitutional interference with federal powers. Another lawsuit against New York takes aim at a state law that allows unauthorized immigrants to obtain driver's licenses while limiting federal immigration agencies' access to driver information.\n\nThe government has publicized recent operations by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in cities like New York, Chicago, and Denver.\n\nICE is pursuing arrests of unauthorized immigrants in partnership with other federal agencies. Still, \"border czar\" Tom Homan has blamed media leaks for hampering plans. ICE initially published daily arrests, but stopped earlier this month.\n\nThe White House last week announced that ICE arrested 11,000 \"criminals\" in an 18-day period. According to a recent estimate , around 13.7 million unauthorized immigrants lived in the U.S. as of mid-2023.\n\nAgainst the targeted-criminal narrative, the number of immigrants detained by ICE without criminal histories has been rising since inauguration, reports researcher Austin Kocher.\n\nReligious groups and Denver Public Schools, meanwhile, have sued to block ICE enforcement in and around sensitive locations such as churches and schools, which is no longer discouraged by the government. Proponents of the agency say that arrests at such locations are rare, and rather the ability to pursue arrests near such sites makes operations more efficient.\n\n• Promised deportation campaign begins. Monthly data on deportations under the Trump administration is not yet available. Yet the government has paved the way for more fast-track deportations. A creation of the Clinton administration, \"expedited removal\" takes away immigrants' access to an immigration judge.\n\n• Military involved in deportation flights and detention. Beyond National Guard units stationed at the southern border, the military has also been tapped for costly deportation flights. Those have included military planes to Guatemala , India , and Panama , a country now accepting migrants from places where the U.S. can't easily send deportees. (Venezuela is also accepting its deported citizens back, reportedly with its own planes.)\n\nDeepen your worldview with Monitor Highlights.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

Through photos, the government has publicized the faces of immigrants sent to the detention site, claiming that many are members of the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua, which officials have linked to violent crimes across the U.S.\n\nFamily members of those sent to \"Gitmo,\" however, have refuted alleged Tren de Aragua ties, reports The Washington Post. It's unclear how ICE is determining such gang membership, though the agency has said indicators include tattoos. Immigrant advocates have sued the Trump administration over detainees' lack of access to counsel.\n\nAlready a subscriber?

      "text": "GOP megadonor Ken Langone is latest billionaire to blast Trump's tariffs\n\nThis was CNBC's live coverage on April 7, 2025 of how the White House, U.S. trade partners and employers responded to President Donald Trump's historic tariffs.\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nCNBC's reporters covered the tariffs and their effects, live on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.\n\nHome Depot co-founder Ken Langone is blasting Trump's tariffs, calling the 46% import duties on Vietnam \"bullshit\" and describing the 34% tariff rate on China as \"too aggressive, too soon.\"\n\n\"I don't understand the goddamn formula,\" the veteran Republican political campaign donor says in a new interview with The Financial Times .\n\n\"I believe [Trump's] been poorly advised by his advisers about this trade situation - and the formula they're applying,\" he adds.\n\nRead the whole interview here.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nBessent has been surprised by the \"impatience\" in the stock market since the tariff announcement, he told Fox Business. He sees the sweeping new import duties as the starting point for a negotiation which could last several months.\n\n\"Maybe almost 70\" countries have reached out to the White House about negotiating tariffs, Bessent said on Fox Business, including Japan, whose Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba spoke to Trump on Monday.\n\nBessent expects Japan to \"get priority\" in negotiations in exchange for having come to the table quickly.\n\n\"It's going to be a busy April, May, maybe into June,\" he said.\n\n-Jesse Pound\n\nCorrection: Bessent spoke on Fox Business. An earlier version misstated the network he appeared on.\n\nElon Musk's younger brother harshly criticized Trump's tariffs , calling them a \"structural, permanent tax on the American consumer.\"\n\nKimbal Musk , who is a Tesla board member, also said in a tweet that Trump appears to be the \"most high tax American President in generations.\"\n\n\"Even if he is successful in bringing jobs on shore through the tariff tax, prices will remain high and the tax on consumption will remain the form of higher prices because we are simply not as good at making things,\" Kimbal Musk wrote.\n\nTesla, in a recent letter to the U.S. Trade Representative, warned of the potential effect on its bottom line of retaliatory tariffs from countries affected by Trump's tariffs.\n\nElon Musk is the CEO of Tesla, as well as the de facto head of DOGE, the Trump administration's project to slash federal spending.\n\n-- Lora Kolodny\n\nApple shares continued to get hammered, losing 3.7% as concerns mounted that the company would take a major hit from President Trump's tariffs .\n\nMonday's selloff brings Apple's three-day rout to 19%, a downdraft that's wiped out $638 billion in market cap .\n\nAnalysts say that Apple is one of the most exposed companies to a trade war, partially due to its reliance on China for manufacturing its computers and accessories. Although Apple has production in India, Vietnam, and Thailand, those countries also face increased tariffs as part of Trump's sweeping plan.\n\nAnalysts say Apple will likely either need to raise prices or eat additional tariff costs when the new duties come into effect. UBS analysts estimated on Monday that Apple's highest-end iPhone could rise in price by about $350, or around 30%, from its current price of $1,199.\n\n- Kif Leswing\n\nTrump is rejecting the European Union's offer of \"zero-for-zero\" tariffs with the U.S. for industrial goods.\n\n\"No, it's not,\" Trump said in the Oval Office when asked if the deal, which European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen floated earlier Monday, was enough.\n\n\"They're screwing us on trade,\" Trump said, criticizing the EU and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO.\n\nTwo Republican senators, Mike Lee of Utah and Wisconsin's Ron Johnson, have encouraged Trump to take von der Leyen's deal.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nA warning against retaliation tops a list of five steps countries can take to reduce the burden on the United States from the dollar being the world's reserve currency, the head of the White House's Council of Economic Advisers said.\n\nCEA Chair Stephen Miran, speaking at a Hudson Institute event, said that the U.S. dollar and Treasury securities \"make possible the global trading and financial system which has supported the greatest era of prosperity mankind has ever known.\"\n\nBut that, and the U.S. security umbrella, \"are costly for us to provide,\" Miran said.\n\n\"The best outcome is one in which America continues to create global peace and prosperity and remain the reserve provider, and other countries not only participate in reaping the benefits, but they also participate in bearing the costs,\" he said.\n\nHere are the five options for burden sharing Miran suggests:\n\nIsrael Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his country will \"eliminate the trade deficit with the United States.\"\n\n\"We're going to also eliminate trade barriers, a variety of trade barriers, that have been put up unnecessarily,\" Netanyahu said in the Oval Office.\n\nTrump last week announced a 17% tariff on Israel , even after the Middle East ally said it would scrap its own tariffs on U.S. goods.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nThe White House is prepared to hold \"meaningful negotiations\" in the coming weeks with some of the more than 50 countries that have responded \"positively\" to Trump's tariffs, Bessent says in an X post.\n\nThe treasury secretary draws a contrast between these countries and China, which he claims has \"chosen to isolate itself by retaliating and doubling down on previous negative behavior.\"\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nU.S. oil prices fell about 2% on Monday, adding to last week's steep losses on fears President Donald Trump's global tariffs would push the U.S., and maybe the world, into a recession.\n\nU.S .crude oil fell $1.29, or 2.08%, to close at $60.70 per barrel, while Brent lost $1.37, or 2.09%, to settle at $64.21. The latest price action comes after U.S. crude and Brent closed down more than 10% last week.\n\nFutures tied to U.S. West Texas intermediate crude hit a session low of $58.95 per barrel, the lowest level since 2021. Global benchmark Brent fell to an intraday low of $62.51.\n\n- Spencer Kimball\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent and U.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer will negotiate with Japan on Trump's tariffs, Bessent says in a new X post.\n\n\"Japan remains among America's closest allies, and I look forward to our upcoming productive engagement regarding tariffs, non-tariff trade barriers, currency issues, and government subsidies,\" Bessent writes .\n\nThe Japanese government's \"outreach and measured approach\" are appreciated, he adds.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nPrices of cars and trucks are expected to rise as a result of Trump's tariffs, according to a new analysis from industry experts at Cox Automotive.\n\nThe firm expects the already implemented 25% tariffs on imported vehicles and upcoming 25% levies on auto parts will add thousands of dollars to the costs of imported and domestic vehicles.\n\n\"We expect to see declining discounting and then accelerated price increases as the tariffs are passed through and supply tightens, leading to price increases on all types of most new vehicles,\" Cox Automotive Chief Economist Jonathan Smoke said. \"Over the longer term, we expect production sales to fall, newly used prices to increase, and some models to be eliminated.\"\n\nWhile the tariffs do not directly impact used car sales, changes in new vehicle prices, production and demand affect the used car market, which is how the majority of Americans purchase a vehicle.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n- Michael Wayland and Michele Luhn\n\nThe White House canceled a press conference with Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\n\nThe event had been scheduled for 2:30 p.m. ET.\n\nA meeting between Trump and Netanyahu at 2 p.m. will proceed as planned, the White House said. Reporters will be admitted into the Oval Office for that event.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nBlackRock CEO Larry Fink says that most other chief executives he speaks with \"would say we are probably in a recession right now.\"\n\nFink also says that he could see stock markets falling by another 20%.\n\n\"One CEO specifically said the airline industry is a proverbial bird in a coal mine - canary in the coal mine - and I was told that the canary is sick already,\" Fink said during an event at the Economic Club of New York.\n\n- Jesse Pound and Dan Mangan\n\nTrump plans to veto a bipartisan bill that would give Congress a say on his tariffs if it lands on his desk.\n\nThe White House's Office of Management and Budget, in a statement, said it strongly opposes the bill because it would \"severely constrain\" Trump's power to \"respond to national emergencies and foreign threats.\"\n\nThe legislation, dubbed the Trade Review Act of 2025, would empower Congress to either approve Trump's new tariffs or let them expire. Sens. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, and Maria Cantwell, D-Wash., sponsored the bill.\n\nIf the act passes both chambers of Congress, Trump \"would veto the bill,\" OMB said.\n\nTrump previously vowed to veto a different bill that would effectively undo the tariffs he imposed on Canadian imports. The Senate approved that bill with the help of four Republican votes.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTrump ordered the proposed acquisition of U.S. Steel by Japan's Nippon Steel to undergo a new review after the deal was blocked by President Joe Biden .\n\nTrump directed the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States to review the acquisition again to assist \"in determining whether further action in this matter may be appropriate,\" according to a presidential action issued by the White House.\n\nU.S. Steel shares spiked about 9% in reaction to the decision.\n\n- Spencer Kimball\n\nRestaurant stocks fell in afternoon trading as investors worry that the Trump tariffs will weigh on consumer spending.\n\nInvestors pulled back across restaurant segments, from fast food to full-service dining.\n\nShares of Starbucks fell more than 3%, following a downgrade to neutral from Baird, citing near-term economic headwinds. The coffee chain, which is already attempting to turn around its U.S. business, has seen its shares sink nearly 20% since Trump unveiled the new tariffs.\n\n\"Explanations for the drawdown we heard included higher coffee costs from tariffs, anti-American sentiment, and recession risk,\" Bank of America Securities analyst Sara Senatore wrote in a research note on Saturday.\n\nRead the full story.\n\n- Amelia Lucas\n\nU.S. airlines are expected to cut their outlooks for the year when they report earnings starting this week, analysts say.\n\nThe industry is seeing cracks in demand for travel. And airline stocks have fallen as investor concerns have grown about Trump's tariff policies, among other things.\n\n\"The level of sell-off is worse than the reality right now, but it doesn't necessarily mean it won't be the reality six months from now,\" Raymond James analyst Savanthi Syth said.\n\nTD Cowen, in a note Friday wrote, \"We expect a world of slower growth, higher inflation, and a more isolationist U.S. to significantly disrupt the competitive environment for airlines.\"\n\n\"We are concerned that the new economic paradigm causes another structural leg down in corporate travel while the negative wealth effect further dampens consumption, especially by Baby Boomers,\" TD Cowen said.\n\n- Leslie Josephs and Michele Luhn\n\nA large majority of CEOs surveyed by CNBC - 69% - said they expect a recession on the heels of Trump's sweeping, market-rupturing tariff plans announced last week.\n\nAnd more than half of them said they expect that the downturn will come this year.\n\n\"This is the Trump recession,\" said one of the 22 CEOs who received the flash survey.\n\n\"Disappointingly stupid and illogical,\" another CEO said of the tariffs.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nWhite House trade advisor Peter Navarro said that countries would have to do more than just reduce their tariffs on U.S. imports to zero for the Trump administration to back off its trade policy.\n\n\"Let's take Vietnam. When they come to us and say 'we'll go to zero tariffs,' that means nothing to us because it's the nontariff cheating that matters,\" Navarro said on CNBC's \" Squawk Box .\"\n\nThose nontariff policies include a value-added tax and the routing of Chinese products through Vietnam, Navarro said.\n\nTrump said in a Truth Social post on Friday that To Lam, general secretary of the Communist Party of Vietnam, had offered to cut tariffs on U.S. products to zero. Later in the interview, Navarro described that offer as a \"small first start.\"\n\n- Jesse Pound\n\nTech stocks wobbled after Trump stood by his sweeping global tariff plans.\n\nApple shares have tumbled more than 5%, Tesla shares are down about 4% and Microsoft shares have slipped more than 1%. Shares of Google are mostly flat, but Amazon , Nvidia and Meta are all up around 1%.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks collectively shed more than $1.8 trillion in market value during a two-day market selloff last week. The Nasdaq Composite recorded its worst week since the onset of the pandemic and entered a bear market.\n\n--Ashley Capoot and Samantha Subin\n\nTrump is not concerned about the optics of him golfing over the weekend as stock markets fall on his tariff strategy, a White House official told NBC News.\n\nTrump's golf rounds in Florida are like \"going to a birthday party after a friend has had surgery,\" the official said.\n\n\"The economy will be fine,\" the official said.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nTrump is threatening to jack up tariffs on China by an additional 50% unless Beijing abandons its retaliatory duties on U.S. imports.\n\nTrump in a Truth Social post gave China until Tuesday to undo its 34% tariffs, imposed in response to the \"reciprocal\" duties unveiled at the White House last week.\n\nTrump also wrote that he will cancel all planned talks with China if they do not comply with his demand.\n\nChina's action came \"despite my warning\" that any country retaliating against the new U.S. tariffs \"will be immediately met with new and substantially higher Tariffs, over and above those initially set,\" Trump wrote.\n\n\"Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated! Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings, will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter!\"\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTwo Republican senators urged Trump to accept an offer by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen for zero percent tariffs on industrial goods imported from the U.S. in exchange for the same rate on imports from the EU.\n\n\"Let's take that deal,\" Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, said in a tweet replying to a video of von der Leyen's offer. \"Much to gain.\"\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., replied in a tweet, writing, \"Totally agree with @BasedMikeLee.\"\n\n\"At some point you have to take YES for an answer,\" Johnson wrote.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nCorrection: Ursula von der Leyen is president of the European Commission. An earlier version misstated her title.\n\nU.S. tariffs on China will total 104% if Trump's latest threat takes effect, a White House official confirmed to CNBC's Megan Cassella.\n\nTrump announced blanket 34% tariffs on Beijing last week, which come on top of existing 20% duties on Chinese imports.\n\nTrump's latest tariff action would slap an additional 50% tariff on Chinese goods, unless China drops its 34% retaliatory tariff on the U.S.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger and Megan Cassella\n\nBillionaire Richard Branson is warning that the U.S. \"will face ruin for years to come\" if the Trump administration does not immediately \"change course\" on its tariff policies.\n\n\"The US government can still turn things around, but it must act in the next few hours,\" the Virgin Group co-founder wrote on X.\n\n\"This is the moment to own up to a colossal mistake and change course. Otherwise, America will face ruin for years to come,\" he wrote.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nThe White House dismissed a wire headline that said Trump is considering pausing new tariffs for 90 days.\n\n\"Fake news,\" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNBC's Eamon Javers after a headline that cited Kevin Hassett, the director of the National Economic Council.\n\nTrump himself posted on social media a video of Fox Business host Maria Bartiromo saying, \"Rates are plummeting, oil prices are plummeting, deregulation is happening.\"\n\n\"President Trump is not going to bend,\" Bartiromo said in the video.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nTrump writes that it's \"not sustainable\" for the U.S. to \"lose $1.9 trillion on trade\" in a post just now on Truth Social.\n\nTrump's post includes a video of him talking to reporters, in which he also says that the U.S. can't lose money on trade \"and also spend a lot of money on NATO in order to protect European nations.\"\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nTesla shares are trading around 20% lower than they were when Lutnick urged people to \"Buy Tesla\" last month.\n\nLutnick touted Tesla, whose CEO is the Trump administration DOGE chief Elon Musk, in a March 19 interview on Fox News.\n\n\"It's unbelievable that this guy's stock is so cheap,\" Lutnick said. \"It'll never be this cheap again.\"\n\nAs it turns out, it would be.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nCanada filed a dispute with the the World Trade Organization concerning Trump's 25% tariffs on automobiles and automobile parts imported from Canada into the U.S.\n\nCanada requested WTO dispute consultations with the U.S. concerning the new levies, the global trade organization said. The WTO says the request for consultations formally initiates a dispute in the organization.\n\nConsultations will give the parties an opportunity to discuss the matter without proceeding further with litigation. After 60 days, if consultations have failed to resolve the dispute, the complainant may request adjudication by a panel, according to the WTO.\n\nCanada claims the measures are inconsistent with the U.S.' obligations under various provisions of the \"General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade\" of 1994.\n\n- Michael Wayland\n\nPeople who voted for Trump are more likely to own stock than those who voted for Kamala Harris in November's election - and they also tend to have more money tied up in the market.\n\nCNBC's All-American Economic Survey in December found that 51% of Trump voters have stock market investments, compared to 46% of Harris voters.\n\nAnd of those Trump voters, 53% had investments worth more than $50,000, while just 45% of Harris voters had that much money tied up in stock.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nTop White House trade advisor Peter Navarro is shrugging off Elon Musk's swipe at his qualifications, while suggesting there is daylight between the Tesla CEO's trade views and those of the Trump administration.\n\nNavarro told CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" that he has not spoken to Musk since he tweeted that Navarro \"ain't built s---.\"\n\nMusk appeared to delete that post.\n\nBut Musk kept up another post that said \"a PhD in Econ from Harvard is a bad thing,\" a shot at Navarro's alma mater.\n\n\"I'll probably see him today in the Oval. It's no big deal,\" Navarro told CNBC when asked about Musk's comments.\n\nNavarro praised Musk's work with DOGE on slashing government spending.\n\nHowever, he then took a swipe at the billionaire.\n\n\"When it comes to tariffs and trade,\" Navarro said, Musk \"is a car manufacturer - but he's not a car manufacturer, he's a car assembler.\"\n\nNavarro noted that parts of the Tesla cars assembled at its Texas plant are from overseas.\n\n\"What we want, and the difference in our thinking and Elon's on this, is that we want the tires made in Akron, we want the transmissions made in Indianapolis,\" he said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\n\"Countries from all over the World are talking to us,\" Trump wrote on Truth Social, and \"tough but fair parameters are being set.\"\n\nTrump spoke to Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba earlier in the day, and \"he is sending a top team to negotiate.\"\n\n\"They have treated the U.S. very poorly on Trade. They don't take our cars, but we take MILLIONS of theirs,\" Trump says in the post, adding, \"it all has to change, but especially with CHINA!!!\"\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nEurope will establish a new import surveillance task force, as it looks to diversify its trade portfolio in the wake of Trump's sweeping tariffs.\n\n\"Further diversifying our trade relations is very critical for us, because this broadens the market opportunities and is crucial for our companies,\" European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said at a press briefing.\n\n\"So we will focus like a laser beam on the 83% of global trade that is beyond the United States, vast opportunities, and this is why we're deepening our relations with our trading partners.\"\n\nVon der Leyen mentioned existing deals with Mexico and Switzerland, and potential deals with India, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nEurope stands ready to respond to Trump's aggressive tariff agenda with counter measures if necessary, she said, but the region still stands \"ready to negotiate\" with the U.S. if possible.\n\n- April Roach\n\nTop White House trade advisor Peter Navarro is pushing back on concerns that Trump's plan to restore U.S. manufacturing through tariffs will take years to bear fruit, if it works at all.\n\n\"Investment can made in auto parts factories that are still there, and it won't take long,\" Navarro said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\nHe then pointed to the first Trump administration securing protective equipment faster than expected at the start of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\n\"So don't tell me that America doesn't have the wherewithal to move things and we can do stuff,\" he said.\n\nA CNBC flash survey of CEOs contacted in the wake of Trump's sweeping tariff rollout last week was far less optimistic: 45% of respondents said that any reshoring would take minimum two years, and more likely three years or more.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon says Trump's tariffs will likely boost prices on both domestic and imported goods, weighing down a U.S. economy that had already been slowing.\n\nDimon addresses the tariff policy in his annual shareholder letter, which has become closely read.\n\n\"Whatever you think of the legitimate reasons for the newly announced tariffs - and, of course, there are some - or the long-term effect, good or bad, there are likely to be important short-term effects,\" Dimon writes.\n\n\"We are likely to see inflationary outcomes, not only on imported goods but on domestic prices, as input costs rise and demand increases on domestic products.\"\n\n\"Whether or not the menu of tariffs causes a recession remains in question, but it will slow down growth,\" he adds.\n\nDimon is the first CEO of a major Wall Street bank to publicly address Trump's sweeping tariff policy as global markets crash.\n\nHis remarks appear to backtrack from earlier comments he made in January, when Dimon said that people should \" get over \" tariff concerns because they were good for national security. At the time, tariff levels being discussed were far lower than what was unveiled last week.\n\n- Hugh Son\n\nElon Musk posted a video on X of Milton Friedman advocating for free trade, in one of the strongest examples yet of the billionaire SpaceX founder's break with Trump on tariffs.\n\nOver the weekend, Musk publicly criticized Trump's top trade advisor, Peter Navarro.\n\nHe also said said he hopes Europe and the U.S. can move \"to a zero-tariff situation, effectively creating a free-trade zone,\" during a virtual appearance at a meeting of Italy's far-right League party.\n\nMusk's comments were at odds with Trump's hostility towards the European Union, which Trump has targeted with a 20% tariff on exports.\n\nMusk is Trump's biggest campaign donor and the leader of DOGE, Trump's massive effort to slash the federal workforce.\n\nTrump recently told Cabinet members that Musk would be leaving his post at DOGE in the coming months.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nMarkets across the globe continue to crash for a third day as a result of Trump's tariffs.\n\nTaiwan:\n\nJapan:\n\nChina:\n\nKuwait:\n\nNorway:\n\n- Adam Jeffrey\n\nAckman is apologizing for accusing Lutnick of being \"indifferent\" to a stock market crash because he stands to profit from it.\n\n\"It was unfair of me to lash out at @howardlutnick,\" writes Ackman.\n\n\"I don't think he is pursuing his self interest. I am sure he is doing the best he can for the country while representing the President as Commerce Secretary. It is not an easy job and we don't know how the sausage was made.\"\n\nThe new post comes nine hours after Ackman slung the accusation at Lutnick and his investment banking firm, Cantor Fitzgerald.\n\n\"I just figured out why @howardlutnick is indifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing. He and Cantor are long bonds. He profits when our economy implodes,\" Ackman wrote Sunday night.\n\n\"It's a bad idea to pick a Secretary of Commerce whose firm is levered long fixed income. It's an irreconcilable conflict of interest.\"\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTrump is touting the steep drop in oil prices - driven by fears of reduced demand in the increasingly likely event of a recession - as a policy win.\n\n\"Oil prices are down, interest rates are down (the slow moving Fed should cut rates!), food prices are down, there is NO INFLATION, and the long time abused USA is bringing in Billions of Dollars a week from the abusing countries on Tariffs that are already in place,\" Trump writes in his latest Truth Social post .\n\n\"This is despite the fact that the biggest abuser of them all, China, whose markets are crashing, just raised its Tariffs by 34%, on top of its long term ridiculously high Tariffs (Plus!), not acknowledging my warning for abusing countries not to retaliate,\" he writes. \"They've made enough, for decades, taking advantage of the Good OL' USA!\"\n\nTrump also blames America's past leaders for \"allowing this\" to happen.\n\n- Christina Wilkie\n\nTrump has two significant public events on his schedule today.\n\n11:00 a.m. ET: Trump will host the World Series-winning Los Angeles Dodgers at the White House, according to his official schedule.\n\n2:30 p.m. ET: Netanyahu, one of Trump's closest allies, will participate in a joint press conference with the president at the White House.\n\nThe last time Netanyahu visited the White House was in February, as the U.S. worked to finalize the second phase of a cease fire deal in Gaza. It did not hold, however, and Israeli forces have since resumed ground operations in Gaza.\n\nCNBC's latest CEO survey finds that a majority of the CEOs polled say they now expect a recession before the end of the year. Of those, around half say that a recession, if it happens, will likely be moderate.\n\nOne in three of the CEOs say they expect that their companies will be forced to cut jobs in 2025 due to Trump's tariff policies.\n\n- CNBC Staff\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "Trump's tariffs risk a global trade war, as leaders plan next steps\n\nThis was CNBC's coverage of President Donald Trump's April 2, 2025, announcement of new tariffs targeting dozens of U.S. trade partners. Read the continuing coverage of tariffs and their global impact.\n\nWhat you need to know\n\nCNBC's reporters covered the tariffs and their effect, on air and online from our bureaus in Washington; London; Singapore; San Francisco; and Englewood Cliffs, New Jersey.\n\nThis live blog has closed. Read CNBC's latest coverage of President Donald Trump's tariffs and their global impact.\n\nThe latest U.S. tariffs could cost the Polish economy 0.4% of gross domestic product or roughly 10 billion zlotys ($2.64 billion), according to a preliminary estimate shared by Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk.\n\n\"A severe and unpleasant blow, because it comes from the closest ally, but we will survive it. Our friendship must also survive this test,\" he said in a Google-translated post on the X social media platform.\n\nAs a member of the European Union, Poland was hit with 20% of reciprocal levies under White House leader Donald Trump's latest set of levies disclosed on Wednesday, which have weighed on markets and dismayed the U.S.' trade counterparts.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund most recently assessed that the economy of Poland, which has historically maintained close relations with the U.S., would expand by 3.5% this year.\n\n- Ruxandra Iordache\n\nThailand's economic growth could be stunted to the tune of losing 1 percentage point because of the latest U.S. tariffs, Finance Minister Pichai Chunhavajira told reporters on Thursday, according to Reuters.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund most recently estimated that the gross domestic product of the country of 70 million people was due to expand by 2.9% this year.\n\nThailand was slapped with 36% in reciprocal duties, according to a chart shared by U.S. President Donald Trump on Wednesday.\n\nChunhavajira added that Bangkok will hike imports of U.S. goods and remove tariffs on certain U.S. products, among other steps taken to sustain exports. Thai exports to the U.S. amounted to $55.11 billion in 2024.\n\n- Ruxandra Iordache\n\nPharmaceutical companies breathed a sigh of relief Wednesday after U.S. President Donald Trump revealed that they would not be subject to reciprocal tariffs - but that reprieve could prove fleeting as the White House moves ahead with plans for the sector.\n\nThe Trump administration is considering launching a so-called 232 investigation into pharmaceuticals, among other industries, which could lead to import duties under the Trade Expansion Act, Bloomberg cited a senior administration official as saying on Wednesday.\n\nThe White House did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for confirmation.\n\n\"The pharmaceutical companies are going to come roaring back, they are coming roaring back, they are all coming back to our country because if they don't they got a big tax to pay. And if they do, I'll be very happy,\" Trump said during his \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement.\n\nRead the full story here .\n\n- Karen Gilchrist\n\nIndia's Department of Commerce is \"carefully examining the implications\" and opportunities resulting from President Trump's broad tariffs announced on Wednesday, it said on Thursday .\n\nThe department said that the additional U.S. duties on India come to 27%. A list of reciprocal tariffs shared by Trump on his Truth Social media platform outlined a 26% levy imposed on the world's fifth largest economy.\n\nFollowing on Indian Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi and Trump's February agreement to more than double the bilateral trade to $500 billion by 2030, \"discussions are ongoing between Indian and U.S. trade teams for the expeditious conclusion of a mutually beneficial, multi-sectoral Bilateral Trade Agreement,\" the Department of Commerce said.\n\n- Ruxandra Iordache\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump will \"buckle under pressure\" and alter his tariff policies if Europe bands together, acting German economy minister Robert Habeck said Thursday.\n\n\"That is what I see, that Donald Trump will buckle under pressure, that he corrects his announcements under pressure, but the logical consequence is that he then also needs to feel the pressure,\" he said during a press conference, according to a CNBC translation.\n\n\"And this pressure now needs to be unfolded, from Germany, from Europe in the alliance with other countries, and then we will see who is the stronger one in this arm wrestle,\" Habeck said.\n\nGermany is widely regarded as one of the countries likely to be most impacted by Trump's tariffs, given its heavy economic reliance on trade.\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n- Sophie Kiderlin\n\nU.S. tariff policies announced Wednesday would see U.S. gross domestic product take a 10% hit in the second quarter of 2025, High Frequency Economics Chief Economist Carl Weinberg said in a note Thursday, potentially pushing the world's largest economy into a recession after a predicted small contraction in the first quarter.\n\nWeinberg estimated that tariffs would take $741 billion out of U.S. household real incomes or corporate profits, or more if fully accounting for all tariffs on aluminum, steel and non-exempt trade with Canada and Mexico. His calculation of an average tariff rate on two-dozen countries of at least 30% is greater than expected, he said.\n\nThe U.S. economy will also be hit by price rises, Weinberg added, with the rate of an imported item such as softwood lumber higher by up to 25% - even if some of the inflationary impact is cushioned by downward pressure on the economy.\n\n- Jenni Reid\n\nGreek Finance Minister Kyriakos Pierrakakis said fresh U.S. tariffs represent a historic shift toward protectionism and a deviation from how the European Union sees economic and social progress.\n\n\"As a country, we are in favour of free trade,\" he said in a statement, reported by Reuters Thursday. \"We hope that this chapter will last as little as possible.\"\n\n- Holly Ellyatt\n\nSouth Africa seeks to negotiate a new \"bilateral and mutually beneficial trade agreement\" after being struck with 30% tariffs by the U.S. administration under Donald Trump's extensive levy campaign announced on Wednesday.\n\n\"The tariffs affirm the urgency to negotiate a new bilateral and mutually beneficial trade agreement with the U.S., as an essential step to secure long-term trade certainty,\" South Africa's presidency noted on Thursday , expressing \"concern\" over the newly imposed duties.\n\nThe African country has previously expressed willingness to meet with Washington to discuss the U.S. administration's separate 25% tariffs on automobile imports. South African vehicle exports to the U.S. top $2 billion, according to Reuters.\n\n- Ruxandra Iordache\n\nU.K. Prime Minister Keir Starmer told business leaders in Downing Street on Thursday that while President Donald Trump had a \"mandate\" and right to act in the interests of his country, the U.K. had a right to respond.\n\nStill, he called for \"cool heads\" as he said that Britain would \"move now to the next phase of our plan.\"\n\n\"Decisions we take in the coming days and weeks, will be guided only by our national interest. In the interest of our economy. In the interests of the businesses around this table,\" he said at a meeting in his official office in No. 10 Downing Street, London.\n\n\"Clearly, there will be an economic impact from the decisions the U.S. has taken both here and globally.  But I want to be crystal clear - we are prepared,\" he said.\n\nThe U.K. has \"a fair and balanced trade relationship with the U.S.\" he noted after the White House imposed a baseline 10% duty on U.K. imports to the United States, reflecting the trading status of the relationship.\n\nStarmer said talks on an \"economic prosperity deal\" would continue but said he would only strike a deal if it is in the national interest.\n\n\"Our intention remains to secure a deal but nothing is off the table\" he remarked, saying Britain had \"a range of levers at our disposal,\" without going in to further detail.\n\nRead more on the story here: UK escapes worst of Trump's tariff wrath with 10% levy but warns of 'threat' to global economy\n\n- Holly Ellyatt\n\nThe White House on Wednesday listed tariff rates for 180 countries that, in most cases, were roughly half of what the Trump administration claims each country has \"charged\" the U.S.\n\nIt didn't take long for market observers to try and reverse engineer the formula - to confusing results.\n\nMany observers said the U.S. appeared to have divided the trade deficit by imports from a given country to arrive at tariff rates for individual countries.\n\nSuch methodology does not necessarily align with the conventional approach to calculate tariffs and would imply the U.S. would have only looked at the trade deficit in goods and ignored trade in services.\n\nThe U.S. also appeared to have applied a 10% levy for regions where it is running a trade surplus.\n\nThe Office of the U.S. Trade Representative has since laid out its approach, including a formula, on its website that appeared somewhat similar to the online chatter, barring a few differences.\n\nRead the full story here .\n\n- Neelabh Chaturvedi, Asriel Chua\n\nItalian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni said the 20% tariff imposed on the European Union by the White House was \"wrong\" but said the bloc should try to avert a trade war.\n\n\"The tariffs are wrong and not in the interest of either party,\" Meloni said, Dow Jones reported Thursday. \"We will do everything we can to work on an agreement with the U.S., with the aim of averting a trade war that would inevitably weaken the West in favor of other global players,\" the premier reportedly added.\n\nOn Wednesday, she told business leaders involved in Italy's food and drinks industry that the EU may need to adopt \"appropriate responses\" to U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs while stressing that a trade war should be avoided, if possible.\n\nThe EU should \"work in every possible way to avert a trade war, which would not benefit anyone, neither the United States nor Europe,\" she said, Italian news agency ANSA reported .\n\n\"This obviously does not rule out having to contemplate appropriate responses to defend our production, if necessary,\" she noted.\n\nThe prime minister warned that Italian food and drink exports could be hit hard by tariffs, noting that \"Italian agri-food products are in demand all over the world, starting of course with Europe.\"\n\n\"It must be remembered that the United States is the second-largest destination market, with exports rising by 17% in 2024. The U.S. market is fundamental for us.\"\n\n- Holly Ellyatt\n\nEurope's Stoxx 600 index was 1.6% lower shortly after the market open early on Thursday, as traders assessed the scope and impact of U.S. tariffs.\n\nBanks on the index were down 3.2% at 8:10 a.m. U.K. time, while technology stocks fell 2.6%.\n\nA range of European companies expected to be hit by the measures declined sharply, with German retailers Puma and Adidas down 9% and 8.6%, respectively. Swedish automaker Volvo Cars was down 9%, and shipping giant Maersk - viewed as a barometer for global trade - shed 7.4%.\n\n- Jenni Reid\n\nU.K. Business Secretary Jonathan Reynolds said the country faces a \"threat\" to its open economy from any global fallout from Trump's new tariffs regime, which included a baseline 10% \"reciprocal\" tariff on British goods exported to the States.\n\nThe U.K. has escaped relatively unscathed compared to many other nations, facing the lowest trade tariff that President Trump announced Wednesday thanks to its largely balanced trade in goods with the States .\n\nTrade deficits that the U.S. runs with many trading partners were used in large part by the White House to calculate which level of tariff should be imposed on specific countries or territories.\n\nRecognizing the U.K. was in a better position than many countries, Reynolds nonetheless said Britain was vulnerable to turmoil in other parts of the world hit with higher tariffs, such as the EU which will see a 20% levy on its goods exports to the U.S.\n\n\"Anything that disrupts the global trading system is a threat to the U.K. because we are a much more globally orientated trading economy than some partners,\" Jonathan Reynolds told Times Radio on Thursday, according to Reuters\n\nHe said the government would continue work to strike a trade deal with the Trump administration and would hope to get tariffs reversed. He didn't rule out counter-measures \"if we need to.\"\n\n- Holly Ellyatt\n\nSpain is prepared to take action and protect its companies and consumers from the impact of sweeping tariffs freshly announced by U.S. President Donald Trump's administration, Spanish Economy Minister Carlos Cuerpo said Thursday.\n\nHe added that Madrid remains eager to negotiate with the White House, but criticized the new U.S. measures - which involve 20% tariffs against the European Union, to which Spain is a member - as \"unfair and unjustified,\" according to Reuters reporting.\n\n- Ruxandra Iordache\n\nThe French government slammed U.S. President Donald Trump on Thursday, with one official saying his slew of fresh tariffs reflected an \"imperialist posture\" toward the rest of the world.\n\nTrump is behaving as if he's \"master of the world,\" French government spokesperson Sophie Primas told RTL Radio, according to comments reported and translated by Reuters. Primas said the EU was likely to issue countermeasures initially in mid-April and then again in late April.\n\nTrump on Wednesday announced a blanket 20% tariff on all goods imported from the EU, purporting that the new tariff was roughly half of what the EU \"charged\" the United States.\n\nTrump said Wednesday that the U.S. would charge trading partners \"approximately half of what they are and have been charging us,\" noting \"so, the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal.\"\n\nThat halved figure includes \"the combined rate of all their tariffs, nonmonetary barriers and other forms of cheating,\" he said. The EU denies unfair trading practices with the U.S., though it has a long-standing trade surplus with the States. Trade deficits have been taken into account by the White House when calculating the \"reciprocal tariffs\" it would impose on other nations.\n\n- Holly Ellyatt\n\nNorway will try to negotiate with the U.S. regarding tariffs, Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre told public broadcaster NRK on Thursday.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that Norway would face a 15% duty on goods it exports to the States. The levy is lower than that placed on many other countries but Norway's leader said it could be very damaging for his country, \"which has a lot of exports and lives off exports.\"\n\n\"This is bad news, it is serious,\" Støre told NRK , adding that \"it will have consequences for many Norwegian companies and for jobs.\"\n\n\"If the opportunity to negotiate arises, we will definitely put our foot in the door and stand up for Norwegian interests,\" he added, in Google-translated comments.\n\n- Holly Ellyatt\n\nThe Monetary Authority of Singapore said it was ready to curb excessive volatility in the Singapore dollar, following the market turmoil after the reciprocal tariffs announcement from the U.S. In a statement, the MAS said it will also ensure that Singapore's foreign exchange and money markets continue to function in an orderly manner.\n\n\"MAS is closely monitoring developments and assessing the implications for the Singapore economy.\"\n\n- Lim Hui Jie\n\nMalaysian government said in a statement Thursday that it is not considering reciprocal tariffs after U.S. President Donald Trump unleashed sweeping levies.\n\nThe Ministry of Investment, Trade & Industry said it is actively engaging with U.S. policymakers to seek solutions that will \"uphold the spirit of free and fair trade.\"\n\nTrump set a baseline 10% tariff on all exporters to the U.S. starting April 5, which is set to be levied on Malaysian goods.\n\nThe Southeast Asian country recorded a trade surplus of $24.8 billion with the U.S. last year, the ministry said, attributing the deficit in part to U.S. firms operating in Malaysia.\n\n- Anniek Bao\n\nNorway will try to negotiate with the U.S. regarding tariffs, Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre told public broadcaster NRK on Thursday.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump announced on Wednesday that Norway would face a 15% duty on goods it exports to the States.

Within days, Trump reversed course and delayed the cancellation of the provision.\n\nGoods that qualify under the de minimis exemption will be subject to a duty of either 30% of their value, or $25 per item. That rate will increase to $50 per item on June 1, the White House said.\n\nThe U.S. Customs and Border Protection has said it processed more than 1.3 billion de minimis shipments in 2024, up from over 1 billion shipments in 2023.\n\nShares in PDD Holdings, parent company of the Chinese online marketplace Temu, dropped 8.45% in after-hours trading.\n\n- Annie Palmer\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney said Ottawa will unveil on Thursday a full set of \"countermeasures\" in response to U.S. President Donald Trump's sweeping new tariffs.\n\n\"We are gonna fight these tariffs with purpose and with force,\" he told reporters ahead of a cabinet meeting to discuss Canada's response.\n\nThe U.S. Senate just passed legislation that would terminate new tariffs on Canada, shortly after Trump unveiled a raft of duties on foreign goods against global major trade partners.\n\n- Anniek Bao\n\nSouth Korea's acting President Han Duck-soo on Thursday ordered emergency support measures for industries and businesses that will be impacted by Trump's sweeping tariffs, according to a statement from the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy .\n\nHan urged the ministry to closely analyze the details and impact of the U.S. \"reciprocal\" tariffs and actively negotiate with Washington to minimize the impact of tariffs.\n\nSeparately, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told reporters at a press conference that Trump's decision is \"not the act of a friend,\" while ruling out responding with counter-levies against the U.S.\n\n- Anniek Bao\n\nFour Senate Republicans joined every Democrat today to pass a resolution that would terminate Trump's Canada tariffs.\n\nThe measure, introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.), passed with a simple majority, 51-48.\n\nThe Republicans who crossed party lines to back it were Sens. Mitch McConnell (Ky.), Lisa Murkowski (Ak.), Susan Collins (Me.) and Rand Paul (Ky.)\n\nThe resolution would terminate the national emergency that Trump used as a legal rationale earlier this year for imposing tariffs on Canada.\n\nThe Republicans' votes were largely symbolic, given that the measure is dead on arrival in the GOP-majority House of Representatives.\n\nBut coming, as it did, just hours after Trump had unveiled a sweeping tariff plan, the vote was a bipartisan rebuke of the president's trade policy by the U.S. Senate.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nStock futures fell steeply after Trump's announcement today, reflecting what CNBC's Jim Cramer described as the potentially \"horrendous\" effects of Trump's new tariffs on equities markets.\n\nFutures tied to the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost 1,007 points, or 2.3%. S&P 500 futures dropped 3.4%. Nasdaq-100 futures lost 4.2%.\n\nShares of multinational companies tumbled in extended trading. Nike and Apple each dropped about 7%. Shares of big sellers of imported goods were among the hardest hit. Five Below lost 15%, Dollar Tree tumbled 11% and Gap plunged 8.5%. Tech shares dropped in an overall risk-off mood, with Nvidia off 4.5% and Tesla down 6%.\n\n- John Melloy and Pia Singh\n\nPresident Donald Trump and the White House laid out the U.S. reciprocal tariff rates that more than 180 countries and territories will face under his sweeping new trade policy.\n\nIn charts posted on social media, the White House shows the effective tariff rates they claim other countries impose on American goods, including by \"currency manipulation and trade barriers.\"\n\nAn adjacent column shows the new tariff rates the U.S. will impose on each country or territory, including the European Union. The reciprocal rates are not necessarily the only U.S. tariffs these countries will face.\n\nTrump held up the chart when he unveiled his tariff policy in the White House Rose Garden.\n\nSee the full list here.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nIn addition to the sweeping country-by-country tariffs announced today, Trump also imposed a 10% baseline tariff that effectively ensures a tariff on any country that is not among the more than 180 singled out.\n\n\"All articles imported into the customs territory of the United States shall be, consistent with law, subject to an additional ad valorem rate of duty of 10%,\" unless otherwise noted, the executive order signed this afternoon reads.\n\nTrump also reserves the right to raise this baseline rate \"should U.S. manufacturing capacity and output continue to worsen.\"\n\nRead the whole executive order here .\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nPharmaceutical products are among the goods that will not be subject to the reciprocal tariffs announced today, according to a White House fact sheet .\n\nBut Trump has not ruled out his plans to impose pharmaceutical-specific tariffs sometime soon.\n\nOther goods not subject to the reciprocal tariffs include copper, semiconductors, lumber, bullion, energy and certain minerals that are not available in the U.S., the fact sheet said. It also includes products already subject to Trump's recently announced tariffs, including steel, aluminum, autos and auto parts.\n\n- Annika Kim Constantino\n\nIowa Gov. Kim Reynolds says she is \"working directly with the administration to ease the short-term impact\" of the tariffs on her state, to \"keep our ag economy strong, and open the door to new export opportunities.\"\n\nReynolds is a Republican in a state that is especially sensitive to the sweeping tariffs Trump announced this afternoon.\n\n\"President Trump is using tariffs as leverage - to force our trading partners to the table and put America's farmers first,\" Reynolds said in a statement after Trump's announcement.\n\nReynolds also criticized the Biden administration, which she said \"consistently ignored the needs of Iowa farmers.\"\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nTrump is imposing a 54% total tariff rate on imports from China, effective April 9, a White House official said.\n\nChinese imports had already been subject to 20% tariffs. Another 34% in reciprocal tariffs is being put on top of that, the official said.\n\n- Dan Mangan and Eamon Javers\n\nTrump finished speaking after roughly 50 minutes and signed an executive order imposing his sweeping reciprocal tariff plan.\n\n\"It's going to be a day that hopefully you're going to look back in years to come and you're going to say, 'You know, he was right. This has turned out to be one of the most important days in the history of our country,'\" Trump said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nThe Trump administration announced Wednesday that Canada and Mexico will be exempt from the baseline 10% tariff rate, as well as reciprocal levies for specific countries for now.\n\nThe 10% tariff would only kick in when the original 25% duties Trump slapped on Canadian and Mexican imports are terminated or suspended. The 25% tariff was based on allegations that the neighboring countries were failing to stem the flow of drugs and crime into the U.S.\n\n- Yun Li\n\nExchange-traded funds tied to major U.S. stock indexes fell sharply in after-hours trading Wednesday after President Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on goods imported to the U.S.\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) tumbled 2.2% . The Invesco QQQ Trust , which tracks the Nasdaq-100, dropped 3%.\n\nThe White House unveiled a baseline tariff rate of 10% on all countries that goes into effect April 5. Higher duties will be charged against countries that levy higher rates on the U.S.\n\n\"We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us,\" Trump said in a press conference from the White House Rose Garden. \"So, the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal.\" - Fred Imbert, Pia Singh\n\nTrump showed off a big league chart outlining the reciprocal tariffs he is imposing on various countries.\n\nThe chart, featuring countries such as China, Vietnam, Japan, India and Switzerland, as well as the European Union, compares the tariffs and other trade costs Trump says those nations place on U.S. imports, with the reciprocal tariffs taking effect.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nTrump called out Australia, saying, \"they're wonderful people and wonderful everything, but they ban American beef.\" \"Yet, we imported $3 billion of Australian beef from them just last year alone. They won't take any of our beef.\"\n\n\"They don't want it because they don't want it to affect their farmers and you know what, I don't blame them, but we're doing the same thing, right now starting about midnight tonight.\"\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\n\"We will charge them approximately half of what they are and have been charging us,\" Trump said of his reciprocal tariff plan.\n\n\"So, the tariffs will be not a full reciprocal,\" he said.\n\nBut that halved figure includes \"the combined rate of all their tariffs, nonmonetary barriers and other forms of cheating,\" he said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTrump is promising what he calls \"the Golden Age of America,\" which he believes will see more jobs and domestic production ushering in a new age of domestic prosperity.\n\n\"We will supercharge our domestic industrial base, we will open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers,\" Trump said from the Rose Garden.\n\n\"And ultimately more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers. ... We're gonna come back very strongly.\"\n\n- Pia Singh\n\nTrump says \"jobs and factories will come roaring back\" and that the reciprocal tariffs will usher in a \"golden age\" for the country.\n\n\"We will supercharge our domestic industrial base, we will pry open foreign markets and break down foreign trade barriers and ultimately more production at home will mean stronger competition and lower prices for consumers,\" he said from the Rose Garden.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nTrump confirmed his administration will impose 25% tariffs on auto imports starting Thursday at 12:01 a.m.\n\nTrump, in his Rose Garden speech, said, \"None of our companies are allowed to go into other countries.\"\n\n\"That's why, effective at midnight, we will impose a 25% tariff on all foreign-made automobiles,\" he said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTrump took the podium in the Rose Garden to tout his new tariffs, calling it America's \"declaration of economic independence.\"\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nTrump said he is about to sign a \"historic executive order instituting reciprocal tariffs on countries throughout the world.\"\n\n\"Reciprocal. That means they do it to us and we do it to them. Very simple. Can't get any simpler than that,\" Trump said at the start of his remarks.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nMedia executives have been in ongoing conversations with advertisers who are seeking flexible terms , as they face uncertainty about how impending U.S. tariffs will affect their businesses, according to people close to the discussions.\n\nDuring tough economic times, companies often pull back on advertising and marketing spending. The scarcity of specifics on the new tariffs has fueled discussions between media companies and advertisers, the people said.\n\nIn most cases, brands are seeking more lenient agreements in which they could pivot quickly depending on how the tariffs shake out, they said.\n\nTariffs, coupled with inflation and unemployment, could tighten budgets beyond earlier expectations, said Kate Scott-Dawkins, global president of business intelligence of GroupM, WPP's media investment group.\n\nThe potential hit to the ad market shows the ripple effect of tariffs on companies that won't directly contend with heightened costs on products.\n\n- Lillian Rizzo\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent is attending Senate Republicans' weekly lunch today before Trump's expected tariff announcement.\n\nThe Treasury secretary's visit to Capitol Hill comes a day after he visited with House Republicans.\n\nThere, Rep. Kevin Hern, R-Okla., told CNBC that Bessent said the tariff rates being announced today would be the top rates, and will go down from here, not up.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nRep. Josh Gottheimer, D-N.J., is warning that Trump's tariffs are \"regressive\" and will hit \"people on things they buy every day.\"\n\n\"I don't think people are seeing this, including a lot of Republicans, as a day of liberation, but ... a day of higher costs and a day of chaos,\" Gottheimer told CNBC's \"The Exchange.\"\n\n\"Regardless where people are on the political spectrum, what they don't like is a lot of uncertainty,\" said Gottheimer, who is currently running for governor of New Jersey.\n\n\"I think people are hearing all this noise, they're seeing every day the news change and they just want some certainty,\" he added.\n\n\"They want less chaos in their lives.\"\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nMajor averages are trading modestly higher in the volatile session as investors await details about tariffs on key U.S. trading partners.\n\nThe S&P 500 last traded up 0.2% after swinging significantly between gains and losses.

Tim Kaine, D-Va., told reporters earlier that Sen. Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., indicated that he plans to back the resolution. At least three other Republican senators - Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, Susan Collins, of Maine, and Rand Paul, of Kentucky - have also signaled plans to support the measure.\n\nThe resolution is largely symbolic, because it still needs to move through the Republican-controlled House and would require Trump's signature to become law.\n\nNonetheless, Senate passage with the support of some Republicans - on the same day Trump unveils his tariff plan - would mark a rebuke to Trump's tariff policy.\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\nSen. Peter Welch, D-Vt., a member of the Senate Finance Committee, is slamming Trump's tariff policies, saying that his \"half-baked trade war will only raise prices for consumers.\"\n\n\"Trump's so-called 'liberation day' will throw the global economy into turmoil and leave Americans holding the bag,\" Welch says in a statement hours before the unveiling of so-called reciprocal tariffs at the White House.\n\n\"We should not impose sweeping tariffs on our allies and longtime partners in trade. America's close economic ties with our trading partners are based on trust,\" Welch says.\n\n\"These on-again, off-again tariffs are extremely destructive and totally unnecessary,\" he says. \"President Trump is sticking it to our farmers, our businesses, and everyday working people.\"\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTrump has made a final decision on how he wants to proceed with his sweeping reciprocal tariff plans, a White House official told CNBC's Megan Cassella.\n\nThe update marks an apparent end to the internal deliberations that were reportedly ongoing in the hours before the Wednesday afternoon announcement event.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger and Megan Cassella\n\nTrump will be joined in the Rose Garden by workers from industries that are likely to be affected by his reciprocal tariffs.\n\nThe guest list includes \"steel workers, autoworkers, oil and gas workers, steam fitters, truck drivers, and hardworking Americans from a variety of trades,\" a senior White House official told NBC News.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger and Peter Alexander\n\nTrump has said tariffs on pharmaceutical products imported into the U.S. were coming soon, but it is not clear if they will be announced at the White House event.\n\nThose potential tariffs would likely drive up U.S. drug prices for patients, because even if companies moved to produce those medications domestically, it would take years and cost more than producing medicines abroad, Leerink Partners analyst David Risinger said in a note last week.\n\nPredicting the potential impact of tariffs on pharmaceutical companies is difficult since they have vast and complex manufacturing networks with multiple steps, sometimes in different geographies, TD Cowen analyst Steve Scala said in a note.\n\nBut Scala said Eli Lilly , Bristol Myers Squibb and AbbVie appear better positioned than others to weather tariffs because they have more major manufacturing plants in the U.S. than internationally.\n\nThe majority of their sites responsible for producing the active ingredients in drugs are also in the U.S., he added.\n\nMeanwhile, Novartis and Roche \"look more at risk\" because they have few U.S. plants and a higher share of active ingredient sites that are international, Scala said.\n\n- Annika Kim Constantino\n\nSome tequila makers have been warning about how tariffs could hit their businesses , but Colorado-based Suerte Tequila said it won't raise prices to offset tariffs.\n\n\"Tequila margins are stronger than ever,\" said Laurence Spiewak, Suerte Tequila CEO.\n\nStill, the industry could see a hit with tariffs on Mexico.\n\nIn 2024, the U.S. imported $5.2 billion worth of tequila and $93 million worth of mezcal from Mexico, according to the Distilled Spirits Council of the U.S.\n\n- Brandon Gomez and Michele Luhn\n\nTrump is targeting Sen. Mitch McConnell and three other Republican senators in a critical Truth Social post , urging them to oppose a bill that would undo U.S. tariffs on Canada.\n\nMcConnell and Sen. Rand Paul, both of Kentucky; Sen. Susan Collins, of Maine, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski, of Alaska, \"will hopefully get on the Republican bandwagon, for a change,\" Trump writes.\n\nHe presses the senators to \"fight the Democrats wild and flagrant push to not penalize Canada for the sale, into our Country, of large amounts of Fentanyl, by Tariffing the value of this horrible and deadly drug in order to make it more costly to distribute and buy.\"\n\nIt is not immediately clear what Trump means by \"tariffing the value\" of fentanyl.\n\nTrump calls the Senate bill introduced by Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a \"ploy\" intended to \"show and expose the weakness of certain Republicans, namely these four.\"\n\nThe president also calls on Kentucky, Alaska and Maine voters to call these senators' offices.\n\n\"They have been extremely difficult to deal with and, unbelievably disloyal to hardworking Majority Leader John Thune, and the Republican Party itself,\" Trump adds.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nOntario Premier Doug Ford said he stands ready to remove retaliatory tariffs on U.S. products if Trump cancels heavy American import duties on Canadian goods.\n\n\"We're willing to take these tariffs off, like in the next minute, if he said he's taking their tariffs off,\" Ford told CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\nCanada has imposed 25% tariffs on more than $20 billion worth of U.S. goods in retaliation for the Trump administration's steel and aluminum duties .\n\nIn addition, Ottawa has slapped 25% counter-tariffs on $30 billion worth of U.S. goods, in response to Trump's imposition of broad-based tariffs on imports from Canada.\n\n- Yun Li\n\nTrump is hyping his reciprocal tariffs in a Truth Social post declaring the day of their unveiling \"LIBERATION DAY IN AMERICA!\"\n\nTrump commonly refers to his tariffs in historic terms, raising expectations and concerns about how severe the duties could be.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nSlovakia, the landlocked country east of Austria, could suffer the most from the new auto tariffs that Trump said will start to take effect Thursday.\n\n\"Germany's car industry is in the eye of the storm and by far most exposed in terms of value, with major players like Volkswagen , BMW , Mercedes , and Porsche likely getting hit by tariffs,\" economists Inga Fechner and Rico Luman of Dutch bank ING said in a recent research note.\n\n\"But Slovakia - home to several car plants - is most exposed in terms of total US export volume,\" they said.\n\nThe nation of 5.4 million people produces more cars per capita than any other country in the world. And the \"Detroit of Europe\" relies heavily on U.S. trade, with autos comprising a major chunk of its U.S. exports.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger and Sam Meredith\n\nThe U.S. stock market was poised to open lower Wednesday as Wall Street continues to struggle in the face of the looming tariff policies from the Trump administration.\n\nThe S&P 500 is now down 4.2% over the past month and is 8.4% below its record high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has dropped 7.4% over the past month and is 13.6% below its record high.\n\nUncertainty about tariffs is not the only reason the stock market has struggled, as some tech stocks that are thought to be relatively insulated from trade war concerns have also fallen.\n\nOther stock moves seem to have a more direct line to concerns about tariffs and their economic impact, such as the 12% decline in the past month for Stellantis .\n\nOn the other hand, gold and Treasury bonds have both been rallying in recent days, a sign that investors may be looking to reduce risk. Gold was trading near a record high Wednesday morning.\n\n- Jesse Pound\n\nThe scope of new tariffs has yet to be finalized by the White House, the Bloomberg news service reported.\n\n\"The White House has not reached a firm decision on their tariff plan,\" Bloomberg reported , citing people familiar with the plan.\n\nSeveral options are under consideration at the White House. One is a universal flat tariff rate applied to all trade partners, while another would tailor tariffs to each trade partner.\n\nA third option prepared by the U.S. Trade Representative's office would apply a flat rate to a select group of countries.\n\n- Dan Mangan\n\nDemocratic Sen. Peter Welch of Vermont said the tariff disagreements between Trump and Democrats go beyond typical party differences, calling it a \"very, very serious situation.\"\n\n\"We believe what President Trump is doing is, in many cases, lawless and really beyond any norms,\" he said on \"Squawk Box.\"\n\nWelch said Congress has tariff authority that can be traced back to the Constitution.\n\nTrump's actions are an \"overreach\" in service of a personal agenda, he said.\n\n\"There's a real abdication by Congress of its own authority,\" he said.\n\n- Laya Neelakandan\n\nThe U.S. Trade Representative's office has prepared a third option for tariffs, The Wall Street Journal reports.\n\nThis tariff structure would set a rate below 20% and apply it only to a small group of trade partners.\n\nThere are two other plans under consideration at the White House.\n\nRead more at The Wall Street Journal .\n\n- Erin Doherty\n\n- Christina Wilkie\n\nTrump's new tariffs will take effect \"immediately \" after he announces them in the Rose Garden, White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said Tuesday.\n\nThe timeline offered a morsel of clarity about the reciprocal tariff plan, which remains highly opaque just hours before it is set to be unveiled.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum spoke on the phone in advance of looming U.S. tariffs to reaffirm their \"strong trading and investment relationship,\" Carney's government in Ottawa said.\n\n\"With challenging times ahead,\" the two leaders \"emphasized the importance of safeguarding North American competitiveness while respecting the sovereignty of each nation,\" Ottawa said in a statement after Tuesday's call.\n\nCarney also laid out his \"plan to fight unjustified trade actions against Canada\" by the Trump administration.\n\nIn separate remarks to reporters Tuesday, Carney said Canada is prepared to retaliate against whatever actions the U.S. takes Wednesday.\n\n\"We have held back, but we will not disadvantage Canadian producers and Canadian workers relative to American workers,\" he said.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nTrump is about to drop a sweeping tariff policy on an economy that already seems to be showing cracks .\n\nSeveral top analysts have lowered economic growth projections in recent weeks and warned of persistent inflation, dragging the term stagflation back into the conversation.\n\nStrategists and fund managers have also recently raised the probability of a recession , a shift that stems in large part from concerns about the Trump administration's fiscal policies.\n\nThese fears coincide with a highly volatile stock market and souring sentiment from consumers and businesses alike.\n\n- Kevin Breuninger\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

More would bring in \"billions.\"\n\nThe White House said Monday that Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, never indicated Trump would consider a 90-day pause on his tariffs during an appearance on Fox News, and White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt told CNN reports citing this claim are \"fake news.\"\n\nDuring his interview , Hassett was asked whether Trump could call a \"90-day timeout\" on his tariffs, to which Hassett responded: \"I think the president will decide what the president is going to decide.\"\n\nHassett's quote appeared to be misinterpreted on X, where some users claimed Hassett confirmed Trump would consider a pause, leading to reports citing his statement.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq each briefly rose following the reports, including the S&P rising more than 6% over a 30-minute period, before markets fell again after the White House's rebuttal.\n\nGet Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text \"Alerts\" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here .\n\nA rebuttal from the White House follows several statements from Trump in recent days in defense of his tariffs imposed on U.S. trade partners. He backed the levies in a series of Truth Social posts Monday, writing he believed the tariffs would bring in \"tens of billions of dollars\" to the economy. In another post , Trump wrote the U.S. \"has a chance to do something that should have been done DECADES AGO,\" arguing Americans-whom Trump warned not to be \"weak\" or \"stupid\"-should be \"patient\" as \"GREATNESS will be the result.\" Trump touted sinking oil prices as a victory for his tariffs and called on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, though he falsely claimed there is \"NO INFLATION,\" as economists and policymakers have said inflation would worsen under his tariffs and inflation remains above the Fed's 2% goal. Other posts shared by Trump on Truth Social featured clips from Fox News as commentators and lawmakers supported his tariffs, including a video of host Maria Baritromo saying, \"Rates are plummeting, oil prices are plummeting, deregulation is happening,\" while adding, \"President Trump is not going to bend.\" Last week, Trump appeared to refer to the levies as an \"OPERATION\" that would enable the economy to be \"FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE,\" and while aboard Air Force One on Sunday, Trump said , \"Sometimes you have to take medicine to fix something.\"\n\n\"Some day people will realize that tariffs, for the [U.S.], are a very beautiful thing!\" Trump wrote on Truth Social on Sunday, adding \"massive financial deficits\" with China, the European Union and other trade partners would be \"cured\" with tariffs.\n\nSome billionaire backers of Trump have criticized or addressed economic issues that could arise as a result of Trump's tariffs. Pershing Square founder and Trump supporter Bill Ackman said about the tariffs on Sunday: \"We are heading for a self-induced, economic nuclear winter, and we should start hunkering down.\" Ackman said Monday he is \"frustated watching what I believe to be a major policy error occur,\" after Trump made \"huge economic progress that is now at risk\" because of tariffs. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon told shareholders Monday that while there are \"legitimate reasons\" for imposing tariffs, they will likely increase inflation and are \"causing many to consider a greater probability of a recession\" while potentially affecting \"America's long-term economic alliances.\" Hedge fund billionaire Daniel Loeb, who previously said he believed Trump's initial tariffs on Mexico and Canada wouldn't harm the stock market, said Monday a recent selloff is \"all in the head of 1 person\" who could \"change his mind at any time.\" Virgin Group founder Richard Branson warned in a series of social media posts the U.S. could \"face ruin for years to come\" unless Trump decides to \"change course\" on his tariff policies. Elon Musk, Tesla's CEO and a close Trump ally, has criticized Trump's top trade adviser and recently shared a video of economist Milton Friedman, who defended free trade and argued for the benefits of importing goods.\n\nDuring what Trump advertised as \"Liberation Day\" on Wednesday, he announced a baseline 10% tariff across most U.S. trade partners. Trump has argued tariffs would return and increase manufacturing in the U.S., a move that would punish countries for what he called unfair trade practices. Details about the tariffs were largely unknown before his announcement, as the White House said Trump and his advisers were \"perfecting\" rates hours earlier, Leavitt said. Trump previously floated a 20% universal tariff on all imported goods during his 2024 campaign, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said last month tariffs would target the 15% of countries that account for most of the trade with the U.S. Some market analysts have warned Trump's tariffs could increase prices for numerous products, including coffee, rice, chocolate, and electronics. The White House has argued tariffs would not impact consumer prices, however, citing a statement from former Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen last year. Yellen's quote, \"I don't believe that American consumers will see any meaningful increase in the prices that they face,\" appears to be shortened, as she later says tariffs were \"very carefully targeted\" at sectors already supported by the Biden administration.\n\nWill Trump Negotiate Tariffs?

More Rose Garden at the White House on April 2, 2025. A new lawsuit aims to end the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs by arguing the president's use of emergency powers is unlawful. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nA new lawsuit aims to end the Trump administration's sweeping tariffs by arguing the president's use of emergency powers is unlawful. When Donald Trump signed an order to impose sweeping tariffs on countries worldwide, he did not use traditional trade law. Instead, Trump claimed authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. However, no president has ever used that law to impose tariffs. If the new lawsuit or other legal actions succeed, the massive tariffs the Trump administration imposed on imports worldwide could largely disappear and provide relief for consumers, companies and investors.\n\nOn April 2, 2025, Donald Trump enacted tariff levels that guaranteed American consumers and companies would pay higher prices for many products and the intermediate goods used to make products. Investors anticipated the tariffs would harm company earnings and lead to slower growth in the United States and elsewhere.\n\n\"President Trump put up a wall between the U.S. economy and the rest of the world, and the market tanked. And then the market tanked again,\" reported the Wall Street Journal . \"The message from Wall Street's epic two-day rout, which destroyed $6.6 trillion in market value: There is nowhere to hide from Trump's steep tariffs on goods imported from nearly every corner of the planet.\"\n\nAmong the first countries to retaliate was China. The Chinese government announced higher tariffs on U.S. goods, including farm products. That will likely lead the Trump administration to address a political problem, as it did in 2020, by spending billions of dollars in taxpayer money to compensate American farmers through the Commodity Credit Corporation. Congress did not create the CCC for that purpose.\n\nWhen Donald Trump imposed tariffs on nearly every country, he signed an executive order using a novel authority : \"By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. . . I, DONALD J. TRUMP . . . find that underlying conditions, including a lack of reciprocity in our bilateral trade relationships, disparate tariff rates and non-tariff barriers, and U.S. trading partners' economic policies that suppress domestic wages and consumption, as indicated by large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits, constitute an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy of the United States.\"\n\nSection 1701 of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act states, \"Any authority granted to the President . . . may be exercised to deal with any unusual and extraordinary threat, which has its source in whole or substantial part outside the United States, to the national security, foreign policy, or economy of the United States, if the President declares a national emergency with respect to such threat.\"\n\nWhile the statute notes, \"The authorities granted to the President . . . may only be exercised to deal with an unusual and extraordinary threat with respect to which a national emergency has been declared for purposes of this chapter and may not be exercised for any other Purpose,\" it gives the president discretion to define \"a national emergency\" and \"an unusual and extraordinary threat.\"\n\nThe Trump administration used the IEEPA because it provides more unilateral authority to the president to impose tariffs than U.S. trade law permits.\n\nIn an aerial view, shipping containers are stacked on a dock at the Port of Oakland on December 9, ... More 2024, in Oakland, California. (Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images)\n\nOn April 3, 2025, the New Civil Liberties Alliance filed a complaint for injunctive and declaratory relief challenging the Trump administration's use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The lawsuit is on behalf of Simplified, a Pensacola-based company that imports goods from China and expects to pay higher tariffs because of the president's executive order.\n\n\"Presidents can impose tariffs only when Congress grants permission, which it has done in carefully drawn trade statutes,\" according to the complaint. The statutes limit the conditions and scope of the tariffs. \"President Trump is attempting to bypass these constraints by invoking the IEEPA. But in the IEEPA's almost 50-year history, no previous president has used it to impose tariffs. Which is not surprising, since the statute does not even mention tariffs, nor does it say anything else suggesting it authorizes presidents to tax American citizens.\"\n\nThe complaint provides four primary reasons why the president's recent tariff actions using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act are unlawful.\n\nFirst, \"[The] IEEPA does not authorize a president to impose tariffs. Basic tools of statutory construction dictate this conclusion.\" The complaint argues, \"Because the Executive Orders present a question of 'vast economic and political significance,' the major questions doctrine requires the President to show that the IEEPA 'clearly' authorizes him to impose tariffs. The President cannot make that showing.\"\n\nSecond, \"the China Executive Orders are ultra vires because the President has not-and cannot-meet the IEEPA requirement that he show the tariffs are 'necessary' to address the stated 'emergency' of illegal opioids.\"\n\nThird, \"if IEEPA permits the China Executive Orders, then this statute violates the nondelegation doctrine because it lacks an intelligible principle that constrains a president's authority. In that case, the IEEPA is unconstitutional because it delegates Congress's prerogative to tax and to regulate commerce with foreign nations.\"\n\nFourth, \"the resulting modifications made to the HTSUS [Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States] violate the Administrative Procedure Act because they are contrary to law.\"\n\nKathleen Claussen, a law professor at Georgetown University, said on the Trade Talks podcast , \"Courts may not be happy with the far reach of the emergency, that this is so broad. This is so vast. This is clearly not what Congress intended in passing the statutes on which the president is now relying.\" She notes that the IEEPA does not contain the word \"tariff.\" Claussen added, \"And so perhaps, this use of tariffs again, a court will think has gone too far. But again, by and large, so far what we've seen is a lot of deference from the courts on these sorts of matters.\"\n\nDonald B. Cameron, Jr., senior counsel in the international trade practice at Morris, Manning & Martin, believes the lawsuit has merit. \"It is saying that the administration concocted a reason to invoke the provision, and if this is lawful, then the Executive, not Congress, controls tariffs since the reason is transparently made up.\" He said the New Civil Liberties Alliance makes a good statutory argument as to why the statute does not, on its face, permit tariffs as a remedy. \"It will be interesting to see what the court will do, but this is a good complaint.\"\n\nTrade experts note Congress could wrestle back its authority over tariffs, even though few believe many Republicans would buck Donald Trump on an issue so central to his presidency. The complaint directly concerns tariffs on goods from China. If successful, the lawsuit or others could expand to address tariffs levied on goods from other countries using the International Emergency Economic Powers Act."

      "text": "Here's How Trump's Executive Orders Align With Project 2025-As Author Hails President's Agenda As 'Beyond My Wildest Dreams'\n\nPaul Dans, the former leader of hard-right policy agenda Project 2025 , cheered President Donald Trump's agenda as being \"beyond my wildest dreams\" in an interview with Politico , as the president's first months in office have featured a slew of executive orders that reflect proposals outlined in the policy blueprint, even as Trump has long tried to distance himself from it.\n\nPresident Donald Trump holds a copy of an executive order as he addresses a joint session of ... More Congress at the U.S. Capitol on March 04.\n\nProject 2025 includes a 900-page report proposing a total overhaul of the executive branch, which was crafted by the Heritage Foundation and other conservative groups in 2023 as a roadmap for the next conservative president-namely Trump-to follow.\n\nTrump has repeatedly denied having any involvement with Project 2025, after Democrats highlighted it as a key reason to vote against Trump in the election, and while there's no evidence he's explicitly following its proposals or has any plan to, many of the steps he's taken since his inauguration are in line with suggestions made in the policy blueprint.\n\nDEI: Trump has taken significant efforts to dismantle diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives throughout the government-and in the private sector-since taking office, signing multiple executive orders aimed at abolishing those programs, which mirrors Project 2025's calls for the next conservative president to \"eliminate every one of [the Biden administration's] wrongful and burdensome ideological projects,\" writing, \"Nondiscrimination and equality are the law; DEI is not.\"\n\nAmong the \"DEI\" policies Trump revoked is a 60-year old policy from 1965 that prohibited employment discrimination by government contractors and empowers the federal government to impose consequences for any discriminatory practices, which Project 2025 explicitly called to revoke, writing that abolishing the Lyndon B. Johnson-era executive order would mean contractors will \"be less subject to the changing political whims of a President that might impose significant new costs or burdens.\"\n\nBorder Security and Defense: Project 2025 is largely in line with Trump's broad moves to restrict immigration and tighten security on the southern border, with both the president and Project 2025 advocating increasing detention facilities for undocumented migrants, taking steps that would give local law enforcement more jurisdiction over identifying undocumented migrants, rescinding Biden-era immigration policies, restricting undocumented immigrants' abilities to receive public funds and restricting parole programs for migrants, among other moves.\n\nFederal Spending: The Trump administration's recent decision to broadly halt federal assistance , which it later walked back, echoes Project 2025's call for the president to \"use every possible tool to propose and impose fiscal discipline on the federal government,\" saying, \"Anything short of that would constitute abject failure\"-a passage written by Vought, whom Trump tapped to lead the Office of Management and Budget, which issued the funding pause memo.\n\nThe Trump administration and Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency have more broadly aimed to cut spending throughout the federal government beyond its outside assistance, after Project 2025 claimed, \"Unaccountable federal spending is the secret lifeblood of the Great Awokening,\" alleging federal funds are used for \"nearly every power center held by the Left.\"\n\nFederal Workforce: The Trump administration has made substantial job cuts throughout the federal workforce through buyouts and mass firings, after Project 2025 advocated for a dramatically reduced federal government, arguing, \"the surest way to put the federal government back to work for the American people is to reduce its size and scope back to something resembling the original constitutional intent.\"\n\nAs part of its proposals for the federal workforce, Project 2025 strongly advocates for replacing career civil servants with political appointees dedicated to the president's agenda, and Trump has taken multiple steps toward that goal already, including reimplementing a \" Schedule F \" order that makes it easier to fire career officials, imposing a hiring freeze for career civil servants and restricting collective bargaining agreements for unionized workers-all of which Project 2025 suggested.\n\nBlocking Biden Funds: Trump's move to block government agencies from spending funds appropriated through Biden-era infrastructure and inflation bills is reflected in Project 2025, which said those laws should be repealed and it \"support[s] the rescinding of all funds not already spent by these programs.\"\n\nEducation: Trump is reportedly planning to abolish the Department of Education, with newly-confirmed Secretary of Education Linda McMahon telling staff the agency is undertaking a \"historic final mission\"-though he couldn't get rid of it unilaterally without Congress-after Project 2025 proposed getting rid of the agency, arguing, \"The future of education freedom and reform in the states is bright and will shine brighter when regulations and red tape from Washington are eliminated.\"\n\nTrump has also signed executive orders restricting funding for K-12 schools that \"indoctrinate\" students based on \"gender ideology and discriminatory equity ideology,\" reflecting views espoused in Project 2025-though that proposal doesn't call for restricting funding-and an order for agencies to investigate how to implement policies that expand \"school choice,\" after Project 2025 called for the government to use federal funding to \"[empower] families to choose among a diverse set of education options.\"\n\nNOAA: One of Project 2025's proposals that gained widespread attention was that the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA-which handles weather monitoring, among other functions-should be dismantled and the National Weather Service should commercialize its weather forecasting, and while the Trump administration has not yet gone that far, it has reportedly fired hundreds of NOAA staffers and canceled leases at some weather forecasting centers, sparking fears that the cuts could affect preparedness and responses to future storms.\n\nClimate Change: Project 2025 proposed leaving the Paris Climate Agreement, which Trump did on his first day in office, and the president's broad proposals to roll back climate change policies is in line with Project 2025, which denounced the Biden administration's \"radical climate agenda\" and called for climate change efforts to be removed from governmental efforts like providing foreign aid and regulating agriculture.\n\nEnergy: Trump declared a \"national energy emergency\" and broadly took action against efforts on renewable energy, like the Biden administration''s pro-electric vehicle policies and federal wind energy projects -saying the U.S. should instead increase energy production through oil and gas drilling-after Project 2025 similarly claimed the U.S.' \"energy crisis is caused ... by extreme 'green' policies\" and said the next president \"must be committed to unleashing all of America's energy resources.\"\n\nTrump also created a \"National Energy Dominance Council\" in order to \"to make America energy dominant,\" after Project 2025 urged the next administration to \"prioritize energy and science dominance.\"\n\nAbortion: Though Trump has not taken broad steps to restrict abortion, as Project 2025 advocates, he did issue an executive order undoing Biden-era policies that weakened the Hyde Amendment, which prevents federal dollars from being used on abortion, as Project 2025 advocated for, and reinstated the \" Mexico City Policy \" that prohibits non-governmental organizations receiving federal funds from performing or promoting abortion.\n\nForeign Policy: Trump signed an executive order calling for the secretary of state to put the agency's operations \"in line with an America First foreign policy,\" echoing Project 2025's calls for the State Department to \"ensur[e] that the interests of American citizens are given priority,\" and signed another order threatening punishments if State officials don't \"faithfully implement the President's policy,\" after Project 2025 called for the next administration to eliminate the \"tug of war\" between the president and career officials and overhaul the agency \"into a lean and functional diplomatic machine that serves the President.\"\n\nTrump's executive order to sanction countries that refuse to go along with his hardline immigration policies-which led to a trade standoff with Colombia over whether the country would accept deported migrants-also reflects Project 2025, which says the executive branch should \"quickly and aggressively address recalcitrant countries' failure to accept deportees by imposing stiff sanctions until deportees are in fact accepted for return (not just promised to be taken).\"\n\nWorld Health Organization: Project 2025 denounced the World Health Organization before Trump signed an executive order withdrawing the U.S. from the public health institution, with Project 2025 authors claiming the WHO's \"manifest failure and corruption ... during the COVID-19 pandemic\" posed \"danger ... to U.S. citizens and interests,\" and the U.S. \"must be prepared to take appropriate steps in response\" to any international organizations that purportedly threaten its interests, \"up to and including withdrawal.\"\n\nGlobal Organizations: Project 2025 broadly said the next administration \"must end blind support for international organizations\" and \"seriously consider\" withdrawing from groups \"that no longer have value, quietly undermine U.S. interests or goals, or disproportionately rely on U.S. financial contributions to survive\"-foreshadowing Trump's executive order to remove the U.S. from the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC), stop providing funding to the U.N. Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) and review the U.S.'s involvement in the U.N. Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).\n\nTransgender Rights: Trump's moves against transgender rights include ordering the government to only recognize Americans' sex at birth, banning federal prisons from classifying inmates based on their gender identity, reinstating his ban on transgender Americans from serving in the military and restricting gender-affirming care for minors, after Project 2025 broadly called for gender ideology and identity to be removed from government policies and for the transgender military ban to be reinstated.\n\nTrump also signed an order rescinding federal funding from school programs that allow transgender women to participate in women's sports, after Project 2025 decried the federal government \"forc[ing] school districts to undermine girls' sports and parents' rights to satisfy transgender extremists.\"\n\nRefugees: Trump suspended refugee admissions in an executive order on his first day, after Project 2025 said the \"federal government's obligation to shift ... essential screening and vetting resources to the forged border crisis will necessitate an indefinite curtailment of the number of USRAP refugee admissions.\"\n\nSanctuary Cities: Trump signed multiple executive orders saying the government should try to block \"sanctuary cities\" or areas that offer greater protections to undocumented immigrants from receiving federal funding, after Project 2025 said Congress should \"set financial disincentives\" for areas that implement \"sanctuary\" policies.\n\nDeath Penalty: Trump directed his attorney general to pursue the death penalty where applicable-as in Project 2025, which says the federal government should \"enforce the death penalty where appropriate and applicable\"-and actually went even further than Project 2025, saying the death penalty should be imposed in crimes involving the murder of law enforcement officers and capital offenses committed by undocumented immigrants, \"regardless of other factors.\"\n\nSecurity Clearances: Trump signed an executive order giving security clearances to any individual designated by the White House counsel to receive one, rather than waiting for the full background check process to be completed, with Project 2025 also decrying the \"extraordinary delays\" caused by the clearance process.\n\nProject 2025 also backed up Trump's decision to revoke many former government officials' security clearances, saying the next president \"should immediately revoke the security clearances of any former ... senior intelligence officials who discuss their work in the press or on social media\" without prior authorization.\n\nFEMA: Project 2025 proposed the Federal Emergency Management Agency should be moved to the Department of the Interior and reformed-which Trump suggested he may do, saying he will sign an order to \"begin the process of fundamentally reforming and overhauling FEMA, or maybe getting rid of them,\" while his administration has also cut jobs at the disaster relief agency.\n\nThe policy proposal also supports Trump's suggestion he could refuse to give FEMA funds to areas that oppose him politically, with Project 2025 arguing FEMA grants should only go to areas that \"can show that their mission and actions support the broader homeland security mission\"-though Project 2025 specifies that wouldn't include disaster relief funding, while Trump has suggested he could also withhold those funds.\n\nMilitary Policies: Trump reinstated members of the military who were discharged for not complying with its COVID-19 vaccine mandate, as Project 2025 urged, and also signed an order ending DEI programs in the military, after Project 2025 called for the military to \"eliminate Marxist indoctrination and divisive critical race theory programs and abolish newly established diversity, equity, and inclusion offices and staff.\"\n\nFederal Regulations: Trump has signed executive orders imposing a cap on federal regulations and directing agencies to identify puportedly \"unlawful\" regulations, after Project 2025 broadly denounced the \"administrative state\" and advocated for \"reining in the regulatory state and ensuring that regulations achieve important benefits while imposing minimal burdens on Americans.\"\n\nIRS: The Internal Revenue Service is reportedly planning to slash half of its workforce, after already laying off approximately 7,000 workers in earlier job cuts, gutting an agency that Project 2025 referred to as \"a poorly managed, utterly unresponsive and increasingly politicized agency\" which requires \"meaningful reform.\"\n\nStudent Loans: Trump signed an order that seeks to limit the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program for public servants and has suggested he wants to abolish the Education Department and move the office that handles student loans to a different agency-echoing plans outlined in Project 2025, which calls for the Office of Student Aid to be moved to the Treasury Department and for the federal government to end all student loan forgiveness, criticizing the public service program for \"prioritiz[ing] government and public sector work over private sector employment.\"\n\nTransportation Security Administration: The Department of Homeland Security ended its collective bargaining agreement with unionized TSA workers-with the union now going to court in an effort to restore the agreement-after Project 2025 suggested the TSA should be privatized entirely or a new \"government corporation\" should be established to run TSA outside the scope of Homeland Security.\n\nDefense Production Act: Trump signed an executive order March 14 that revoked a number of Biden-era directives invoking the Defense Production Act-which expedites the manufacturing of various products-for infant formula and \"green energy\" technology like solar panels, after Project 2025 criticized overuse of the Defense Production Act and said it should only be invoked \"in the gravest circumstances.\"\n\nDans, the former president of Project 2025 who resigned before the election, praised the Trump administration's policy moves in an interview with Politico , saying what Trump is doing in office is \"actually way beyond my wildest dreams.\" \"What we had hoped would happen has happened,\" Dans told Politico when asked if he would have handled anything differently, given the controversy Project 2025 garnered. \"So I can't imagine how anything could end really any better.\"\n\nWhile many of his policies in office line up with priorities outlined in Project 2025, Trump has publicly disavowed Project 2025 and has not changed his stance since taking office. There's no indication he's actually following Project 2025's playbook now, as there's always been significant overlap between his personal policy agenda and what Project 2025 has proposed, though Reuters reported ahead of the inauguration that the Heritage Foundation was among the groups providing draft executive orders to Trump's transition team. Trump has not yet given any suggestion that he's planning on imposing some of Project 2025's more controversial sweeping measures, like abolishing the Department of Homeland Security, taking broad steps to restrict abortion or applying a baseline tax rate. Dans denied Trump was in any way working with Project 2025 or specifically following it in his interview with Politico, saying that while \"directionally\" Project 2025 and Trump's agenda \"have a lot in common ... so do great minds.\" Trump \"absolutely told the truth\" in distancing himself from Project 2025, Dans claimed, saying the policy project \"was done outside of President Trump.\"\n\nIn a statement to CNN, Trump spokesperson Harris Fields said Trump \"had nothing to do with Project 2025.\" \"In his first few days in office, President Trump has delivered on the promises that earned him a resounding mandate from the American people - securing the border, restoring common sense, driving down inflation, and unleashing American energy,\" Fields said.\n\nTrump's policies since taking office also have some significant differences from what Project 2025 outlines. Most notably, one of Trump's first acts in office was to pause the federal ban on TikTok while his administration tries to negotiate a way for parent company ByteDance to divest from it, while Project 2025 calls for banning the app. Trump's call for mass deportations of undocumented immigrants also goes beyond what's proposed in Project 2025, which calls for broad-scale immigration reforms and strengthened border security, but does not explicitly endorse widescale deportations. While Project 2025 proposes narrowing pathways to legal immigration and moving away from what it terms a \"system that favors extended family-based and luck-of-the-draw immigration,\" Project 2025 also does not call for ending birthright citizenship , as Trump has ordered. (His executive order abolishing birthright citizenship has been temporarily blocked in court .) Trump also is going further than Project 2025 on restricting foreign aid with his moves to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development-while Project 2025 only called for \"reforming\" USAID and \"scal[ing] back USAID's global footprint\"-and has spoke of getting rid of purported \"fraud\" in the Social Security Administration , which Project 2025 does not discuss. Various Trump proposals reflecting culture war issues, like making English the national language, eliminating the federal government's use of paper straws and signing an executive order dedicated to \"eradicating anti-Christian bias\" are also not reflected in Project 2025.\n\nMultiple high-level officials and nominees in Trump's second administration played a role in crafting Project 2025, including Federal Communications Commissioner Brendan Carr, senior counselor for trade and manufacturing Peter Navarro, Securities and Exchange Commission head Paul Atkins and Trump's \"border czar\" Tom Homan. Carr and Navarro each authored sections of Project 2025's policy blueprint, while Atkins and Homan are listed as contributors. Trump also nominated Aaron Szabo, a contributor to Project 2025's section on the Environmental Protection Agency, to serve as the Assistant Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation. Most notably, Trump nominated Vought to serve as the head of the Office of Management and Budget after Vought reportedly previously served as a key architect of Project 2025. He authored the policy proposal's chapter on the Executive Office of the President of the United States and reportedly spearheaded the project's playbook for Trump's first 180 days. Vought was confirmed by the Senate in a party line 53-47 vote Feb. 6, after Democrats spoke on the Senate floor overnight in protest of his confirmation. NBC News reports the Trump transition team also used a LinkedIn-style database of federal staffers that Project 2025 compiled to help recruit lower level administration staffers.\n\nOne of the central features of Project 2025's policy blueprint is a heavy influence on nuclear families and supporting the nuclear family, with a goal of boosting marriage and birth rates, such as through restrictions on abortion. Vice President JD Vance, a close ally of the Heritage Foundation who has long espoused similar views about promoting marriage and birth rates, called at the anti-abortion rights March for Life rally in January for there to be \"more babies in the United States of America,\" arguing, \"The benchmark of national success is not our GDP number or our stock market, but whether people feel that they can raise thriving and healthy families in our country.\" \"It is the task of our government to make it easier for young moms and dads to afford to have kids, to bring them into the world and to welcome them as the blessings that we know they are here at the March for Life,\" Vance said. Trump's Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy also issued guidance Thursday dedicated to \"advancing President Donald Trump's agenda to rescind woke policies\" and \"roll back burdensome and costly regulations.\" That guidance includes a provision saying the department should prioritize giving grants to \"communities with marriage and birth rates higher than the national average.\"\n\nProject 2025 proposes a broad overhaul of the executive branch aimed at making it more aligned with conservative ideologies, and giving the president more power. In addition to proposals that would get rid of climate change efforts, rescind LGBTQ rights-centered policies, replace career civil servants with political appointees and impose an \"America First\" foreign policy outlook-as Trump is now to some extent adopting-the policy blueprint also makes a number of other bold policy suggestions, such as abolishing numerous government agencies, banning pornography and overhauling the Federal Reserve, proposing to do so through such measures as returning to the gold standard or getting rid of the government's control over the U.S.' money entirely. Project 2025 also proposes imposing a baseline tax rate-of 15% for anyone under the Social Security wage base of approximately $168,000, or 30% for those earning more than that-and lowering the corporate tax rate to 18%. It suggests making significant cuts to Medicaid and imposing work requirements to receive benefits, as well as making the paid Medicare Advantage program, which is now an alternative to regular Medicare, the default option for patients, among numerous other moves.\n\nTrump's administration is still less than two months old, and it remains to be seen what steps he'll take going forward that could line up-or go against-Project 2025. Trump's Health Secretary nominee Robert F. Kennedy Jr. did not rule out at his confirmation hearing the possibility the Trump administration could revoke approvals for abortion drug mifepristone , as Project 2025 proposes, saying only that Trump \"has asked me to study the safety of mifepristone\" and \"Whatever [Trump] does, I will implement those policies.\" Trump previously told CBS News the abortion drug-which studies have overwhelmingly shown is broadly safe and effective-\"is going to be available,\" when asked before the election whether he would ban it, walking back his previous suggestion during an August press conference that he could be open to restricting it.\n\nWhile Project 2025 became best known for its 900-page policy blueprint, the project also included creating a playbook for Trump's first 180 days in office. Unlike the policy blueprint, that playbook was never made public, with Vought telling journalists from the Centre for Climate Reporting-who obtained secret footage of the Project 2025 architect by posing as potential donors-that it was by design. The 180-day playbook is \"very, very closely held,\" Vought said in the secret footage, and Micah Meadowcroft, a Vought aide also working on Project 2025, told the undercover journalists the group was intentionally keeping the playbook a secret. Those efforts included ensuring staffers knew the plans before Trump entered office, so that they wouldn't have to converse over government work emails that would be subject to public disclosure rules. It's still unknown what that playbook says and whether Trump is now implementing it in office.\n\nProject 2025 's policy blueprint was initially released in 2023, part of what the Heritage Foundation has said is a long tradition of the organization crafting policy proposals for incoming GOP presidents that dates back to Ronald Reagan. Though the agenda had already been out for months, it only started garnering widespread attention last summer, ahead of the election, as Democrats started pushing the 900-page document and its policies as a key reason to oppose Trump, causing Trump to publicly denounce the plan. Trump claimed on Truth Social in July he has \"nothing to do with [Project 2025],\" has \"no idea\" who's behind the plan and finds some of its ideas \"absolutely ridiculous and abysmal\"-even as Trump has long had significant ties to the Heritage Foundation and many of the document's contributors worked in Trump's first administration. The policy proposal continued to remain controversial within the Trump team through the election, with Trump's campaign manager Chris LaCivita calling the effort a \"pain in the ass\" for the Trump campaign and Trump transition head Howard Lutnick-now Trump's Commerce Secretary-publicly claiming he would blacklist people involved with Project 2025 from working in the second administration.\n\nOne Community.

      "text": "Not Making America Green: The Impact Of President Trump's Tariffs\n\nBy Heather Farmbrough\n\nBy Heather Farmbrough ,\n\nSenior Contributor.\n\nNot making America Green - President Donald Trump displays a signed executive order imposing tariffs ... More on imported goods\n\nIn just two days, President Trump's tariffs, presented as Making America Great Again, seem to have done exactly the reverse. Wednesday night's announcements in the White House Rose Garden wiped $5.4 tn off U.S. stocks.\n\nWith the Nasdaq Composite down more than 20 per cent from its mid-December peak, the index has fallen into potential bear market territory. Europe's Stoxx 600 lost 8.4 per cent on the week, and the UK's FTSE 100 fell 7 per cent. And as China hit back with its own charges, MSCI's Asia index fell 4.5 per cent.\n\nFor clean tech companies, trade wars are bad news, particularly when it comes to securing key parts and minerals for use in renewable energy and electric vehicles and supply chains become further disrupted.\n\nThat said, it's pretty uncharted territory for just about everyone after almost a century of free trade.\n\nTrump has already undermined many parts of the U.S. clean energy industry since taking office again, but now he risks derailing the country's sustainable energy transition as well.\n\nMIT Technology Review argues that Trump's tariffs will deliver a big blow to climate tech. This comes on top of uncertainty about U.S. policy towards renewable s with a lack of clarity around ongoing subsidies. The U.S. clean tech industry in particularly is likely to be badly hit with the cost of key components such as lithium ion batteries. The U.S. imported $4 billion worth of lithium-ion batteries from China during the first four months of last year.\n\n\"With US automakers struggling to compete, Chinese electric vehicle companies will likely gain a stronger position,\" said Dr Kyle Chan from Princeton University. \"The impact on China's electric vehicle industry in particular will be consequential, albeit less direct.\"\n\nChan adds, \"Chinese electric vehicle imports to the US, which were already minimal, will not be significantly affected by Trump's new tariffs.\"\n\nTrump's measures may also prove something of an own-goal by favouring other nations where subsidies and pro-clean energy policies are more oriented towards climate goals, such as some parts of the renewable energy sector within the EU and China.\n\nThe wind industry, already suffering under the Trump administration , is likely to face further setbacks. Wind turbines rely on components from around the world, even if they're usually assembled in the U.S.\n\nThe same is true for solar panels and batteries . Endri Lico, an analyst at Wood Mackenzie, told The New York Times that a 25% tariff on imports could raise the cost of building onshore wind turbines by 10% and renewable energy overall by 7% - and many of Trump's tariffs exceed that 25% threshold.\n\nHowever, there are also fears that China may redirect its exports towards more open EU markets. This risks the survival of clean-tech industries even though EU is trying to support and them.\n\nEileen Torres Morales from the Stockholm Environment Institute argues that the effects of Trump's tariffs on the global transition to green iron and steelmaking are still uncertain and it will take some time to see the impact, if any, such as increased steel prices in the short term.\n\nSteel tariffs have forced exporting countries to rapidly reconsider how to stay competitive in the US market. \"The tariffs might benefit steel producers in the US, but a likely outcome is that both public and private consumers within the US will face rising steel prices regardless of whether the steel is green or not,\" says Morales.\n\nAlthough the imposition of tariffs by the US may temporarily shift attention away from international competition and policies focused on heavy industry transition, this should not distract from progress in establishing a market for low-carbon products.\n\nPolicy instruments, such as the EU's emissions trading system (ETS) and Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism, designed to price carbon emissions created during production, should continue to be prioritised, Morales argues. Such tools can support the construction of a strong internal market for green steel,steering attention away from tariffs back to driving innovation in low-carbon technology and emissions reductions.\n\nNevertheless, most clean tech businesses require deep, long-term investment and the climate created by President Trump's tariffs is far from conducive to investment confidence. In Trump's first term of office, Donald Ducks became a popular bath toy. Perhaps it's time to replace those ducks with Black Swans."

      "text": "How To Lead Through Trump's Tariffs And Win\n\nBy Joe Moglia\n\nBy Joe Moglia ,\n\nContributor.\n\nTOPSHOT - US President Donald Trump holds a chart as he delivers remarks on reciprocal tariffs ... More during an event in the Rose Garden entitled \"Make America Wealthy Again\" at the White House in Washington, DC, on April 2, 2025. Trump geared up to unveil sweeping new \"Liberation Day\" tariffs in a move that threatens to ignite a devastating global trade war. Key US trading partners including the European Union and Britain said they were preparing their responses to Trump's escalation, as nervous markets fell in Europe and America. (Photo by Brendan SMIALOWSKI / AFP) (Photo by BRENDAN SMIALOWSKI/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe early verdict is in: President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs sent stocks tumbling last week, with the NASDAQ reaching bear market territory.\n\nChina said it was going to retaliate with its own 34% tariffs on American goods. The impact could be swift, sending prices surging.\n\nFor instance, the cost to manufacture an iPhone is expected to go up 54% for Apple, according to The Wall Street Journal . The BBC says shoes from companies like Nike and Adidas will likely go up 10-12% in price. Even coffee shops will be affected, with the price of a cup of joe going up as much as $2 . No industry is protected from the impact, and the risks are acute. Raising prices could drive away customers, but failing to raise prices will cut into profitability.\n\nExecutives at companies big and small are now faced with a series of choices:\n\nThe right course of action will differ between industries and companies. Here are three examples:\n\nFrom coffee chains to cell phones companies, everyone will face a version of these decisions.\n\nThere are very different paths for very different companies, and there's no one size fits all solution, especially when we're in a period of major uncertainty and volatility. It's entirely plausible that President Trump may change his mind in a few days and roll back some of the tariffs. Or he won't. But the CEOs of all these companies face the same challenge: They need to make decisions and lead their teams through this uncertainty, and the playbook remains the same in every case.\n\nIf there are any CEOs out there who weren't already thinking about tariffs, then they weren't doing their jobs. As soon as Trump was elected, leadership teams needed to get to work on game plans for how they were going to handle tariffs. This should not have come as a surprise - Trump had been talking about it the entire campaign. This is the equivalent of watching the tape in football; you've got to always be on the lookout for what the other team is going to do. No one should be setting up a meeting right now-or even last week-to try and figure out how they're going to handle tariffs. It should have already been decided.\n\nWhatever that game plan is-wait and see, begin reshoring, raise prices, whatever it is-it's now time to execute. That doesn't mean you should go forward blindly, though. Leaders need to always keep on top of the context they're operating in. If the plan is to wait and see, set a clear timeline for how long you're going to do that, and then what you'll do if the tariffs are still in place. If the plan is to start building up U.S. manufacturing capacity, be aware of your costs, and have a clear plan for whether you'll proceed if the tariffs get rolled back. If you're going to raise prices, that strategy needs to be worked out ahead of time, and you'll need to monitor changing conditions and price accordingly.\n\nTariffs are going to put a lot of focus on controlling costs. A lot of executives are going to be tempted to make cuts across the board. But blanket cuts-whether they're 5%, 10% or higher-are not the way to go. It's easy but doesn't make the company more effective or efficient, which is what really needs to happen. Don't cut muscle, cut fat.\n\nInstead, leaders need to carefully examine their operations and look for their worst performers. Struggling units, ailing brands, or pieces of the business that aren't aligned with the core strategy should be the focus of cuts. Imagine a car company: Instead of cutting across the business, focus on the weakest brands. That way, when you come out on the other side, the company will be stronger. You'll be ahead of competitors that made blanket cuts and lost top talent or growth areas as a result.\n\nGreat teams and leaders excel when things get hard. This is a real test. The companies that navigate this moment will have a huge advantage over those that struggle. Even though this is going to be hard for your entire time, it's important to keep focus on the future. Getting this right will pay-off in the long run, which means excuses cannot be tolerated.\n\nThe tariffs story is just beginning. It's going to be a test for the economy, the stock market, politicians, and consumers. The business leaders who were prepared coming into this and who have a clear game plan right now will be the ones who win in the end. The most important thing to remember is to do the hard work the right way."

More White House on April 2.\n\nTrump imposed tariffs on imports from nearly all foreign nations Wednesday, which has spurred fears of a recession and caused the stock market to take a nosedive, as the tariffs are projected to broadly increase prices for American consumers.\n\nLeavitt downplayed concerns in an interview with NewsNation, claiming there's \"not going to be any pain [from the tariffs] for American-owned companies and American workers\" and that Americans can \"expect price stability\" and \"to buy American\" as a result of the tariffs, also claiming \"they can expect their wages to go up.\"\n\nIn a separate interview with CNN, the press secretary deflected questions about the short-term pain Trump's tariffs will cause as a result of higher prices, saying only that the president is working \"every single day\" on easing Americans' economic pain and is taking a \"whole-of-government\" approach to the economy that includes tariffs, getting rid of regulations and cutting taxes.\n\nLeavitt's comments stand in sharp contrast to economic experts who have warned Trump's tariffs could have a dire impact on the U.S.' economy, with JPMorgan Chase's chief economist saying Thursday morning the president's policies will \"take the economy perilously close to slipping into recession.\"\n\nHer optimism also comes as Vice President JD Vance acknowledged to Fox News on Thursday that any expected economic benefits of Trump's tariffs won't be immediate, asking Americans to \"appreciate ... that we're not going to fix things overnight\" and saying, \"We're fighting as quickly as we can to fix what was left to us, but it's not going to happen immediately.\"\n\n\"To anyone on Wall Street this morning, I would say, 'Trust in President Trump,'\" Leavitt told CNN in response to the chaos in the markets Trump's tariffs have caused. The White House spokesperson said the president is \"doubling down on his proven economic formula from his first term,\" and claimed the markets aren't taking into account \"the massive revenue that these tariffs are going to bring into the United States.\"\n\nTrump reiterated his support for his tariffs Thursday morning, saying on Truth Social, \"THE OPERATION IS OVER\" and \"THE PATIENT LIVED, AND IS HEALING.\" \"THE PROGNOSIS IS THAT THE PATIENT WILL BE FAR STRONGER, BIGGER, BETTER, AND MORE RESILIENT THAN EVER BEFORE,\" Trump continued, adding, \"MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!!\"\n\nIn addition to Leavitt and Vance, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick also downplayed the tariffs Thursday morning, acknowledging to CBS News that while \"foreign goods may become a little more expensive ... domestic goods [will] not.\" \"So for the first time in your lives you're gonna actually think about the Americans who make the products,\" Lutnick argued.\n\nAccording to the White House, 10% tariffs will take effect on foreign imports at 12:01 a.m. EDT on Saturday morning, while higher tariff rates on many countries' goods will then take effect on April 9. Tariffs on imported cars and trucks took effect more immediately on Thursday, though automotive parts won't have tariffs levied until May 3. The tariffs will remain in effect \"until such a time as President Trump determines that the threat\" posed by another country's trade with the U.S. and taxes on U.S. goods is \"satisfied, resolved, or mitigated,\" the White House said.\n\nTrump announced his widespread reciprocal tariffs on foreign goods Wednesday in an event at the White House, as the president fulfilled a longtime campaign promise to levy tariffs on most imports. The tariffs affect nearly all countries-the tariff list even included uninhabited islands -save for countries that already face high sanctions like Russia and North Korea. Trump has also already imposed tariffs on Canada and Mexico and didn't have any additional taxes levied on them, though imports from China will now face 54% tariffs after Trump added an additional 34% tax on goods from the country on top of tariffs that were already in place. The president has pushed forward with his plan for tariffs even as they've been politically unpopular among Americans and widely decried by economists, who have long projected any widespread tariffs would raise the cost of goods and destabilize the economy. Major stock indexes recorded their biggest losses since 2020 on Thursday morning as the stock market plunged in response to the tariffs, with tech stocks like Apple and retail giants like Best Buy, Target and Nike all registering particularly large losses."

      "text": "Growing opposition from House conservatives threatens to derail Trump's agenda\n\nby Mychael Schnell and Emily Brooks 04/07/25 08:14 PM ET\n\nGrowing opposition among hard-line House conservatives to the Senate's framework for advancing President Trump's ambitious legislative agenda is threatening to make this week's vote one of the heaviest lifts yet for Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.).\n\nAt least 10 House Republicans have said they will vote \"no\" on the measure, and a handful of others have publicly criticized the resolution, creating an uphill battle for Johnson as he looks to muscle it through his razor-thin majority.\n\nJohnson is eyeing a Wednesday vote on the Senate-approved budget resolution , which would unlock the reconciliation process that Republicans are looking to use to pass tax cuts, border funding and energy policy. The Speaker is actively urging his ranks to fall in line, and the White House has begun making calls to House Republicans, a source told The Hill.\n\nBut a mounting swell of resistance among fiscal hawks who want commitments on large spending cuts upfront is putting that plan in jeopardy.\n\nUnderscoring the discontent, Rep. Andy Harris (R-Md.), the chair of the hard-line House Freedom Caucus who has sharply criticized the budget resolution, is advocating for the chamber to skip the vote altogether and move straight to crafting the details of the package - an unconventional move that would be a break from protocol. Asked about prospects of the bill passing, Harris said Monday: \"It doesn't need to. The committees can do their work without the budget resolution.\"\n\nThat idea, to be sure, has no chance of being picked up by House GOP leaders. Johnson told reporters \"we disagree on that\" when asked about the prospect. The view of House GOP leadership is that the House can stay in the driver's seat and secure major cuts if they pass the budget resolution and craft the details of the ultimate reconciliation legislation faster than the Senate.\n\nBut the sheer mention of the delay is signaling that conservatives have little appetite for moving forward with the measure this week. Johnson said he would be meeting with the Freedom Caucus to talk about the budget resolution later Monday evening.\n\nThe growing discontent within House Republican ranks is increasing the likelihood that Trump - who endorsed the measure and said \"We need to pass it IMMEDIATELY!\" - may have to step in personally, as he did to secure Johnson's reelection as Speaker and passage of the House budget resolution back in February.\n\nHe leaned into that lobby campaign on Monday, writing on Truth Social \"THE HOUSE MUST PASS THIS BUDGET RESOLUTION, AND QUICKLY.\"\n\n\"There is no better time than now to get this Deal DONE!\" he added.\n\nJohnson told reporters on Monday that the president has not yet gotten involved in the effort to ramp up support for the measure, but a White House official suggested that the president was ready to jump in as needed.\n\n\"President Trump has great relationships on Capitol Hill, and his team is regularly engaging with the House to urge the passage of the Senate Amendment to the House budget resolution in line with the American people's priorities,\" the White House official said.\n\nHouse GOP conference Chair Lisa McClain (Mich.), for her part, predicted that Trump's involvement would take shape soon.\n\n\"It is personal with the president. He cares very deeply about our country and the situation that we're in, and this is his vision on how to get it done,\" McClain said. \"So yes, I think he will personally get involved.\"\n\nThe first key test for Johnson and House GOP leadership will come on Tuesday, when the House Rules Committee - which includes two opponents of the framework, Reps. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and Ralph Norman (R-S.C.) - is expected to take up the budget resolution and dispatch it to the floor for a vote.\n\nThe committee opted to push consideration of the budget resolution from Monday - the day bills are typically examined by the panel - to Tuesday, signaling potential trouble for the resolution. Norman said he did not yet know how he plans to vote in committee, but he was clear in his opposition to the measure.\n\n\"Why are we abandoning?\" Norman asked. \"I mean, $4 billion versus $2 trillion? I don't get it; the math doesn't add up.\"\n\nOn the House floor, Johnson faces a towering math problem. In the razor-thin GOP majority, the Speaker can only afford to lose three Republican votes and clear the measure, assuming full Democratic opposition and complete attendance. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.) on Monday stressed to House Democrats that it was crucial to be present for the vote.\n\nThe opposition is not limited to hard-liners like those in the Freedom Caucus. Rep. Jodey Arrington (R-Texas), the chair of the House Budget Committee, went after the resolution over the weekend, calling it \"unserious and disappointing.\"\n\nJohnson, for his part, is remaining optimistic amid the growing opposition, encouraged by the fact that he still has time to get his members in line - 48 hours is an eternity in Washington - in addition to Trump's strong endorsement of the measure.\n\n\"It's going great,\" Johnson said when asked how he plans to get the measure over the finish line. \"We're doing what we do here every week and that's building consensus, and I need a little time. Everybody's just now getting in town so we'll have plenty of time to do it.\"\n\nMcClain also struck an optimistic tone.\n\n\"Do we have the votes as we sit right here today? No, I don't think that's a surprise to anybody. You can see,\" McClain said. \"But that's how we always start out, right?\"\n\nThe concerns among hard-line conservatives are twofold. First, those on the right flank are incensed that the budget resolution includes different spending cut minimums for each chamber. House committees are directed to find at least $1.5 trillion in cuts to federal spending, the same number laid out in the lower chamber's budget resolution, while Senate panels are directed to make at least $4 billion in slashes - an enormous discrepancy.\n\nJohnson has argued that, despite the differences, the House will still pursue significant spending cuts.\n\n\"Although the Senate chose to take a different approach on its instructions, the amended resolution in NO WAY prevents us from achieving our goals in the final reconciliation bill,\" he wrote in a letter to colleagues over the weekend.\n\nHard-liners, however, are not buying it, convinced that the final product will be more closely aligned with the Senate's instructions - a fact that moderates are gunning for amid worries over potential cuts to social safety net programs.\n\n\"I don't like it,\" Rep. Beth Van Duyne (R-Texas) said of the resolution, noting that she was considering voting against it. \"There's no emphasis on the budget decreases.\"\n\nRep. Rich McCormick (R-Ga.) also said he was \"undecided\" about the budget resolution, adding: \"I want to hear the minutia of it.\"\n\nSecond, hard-liners have hammered away at the Senate for utilizing a budgetary gimmick known as current policy baseline, which assumes that the extension of the 2017 Trump tax cuts will not add to the deficit - despite the Congressional Budget Office saying they could cost around $4 trillion.\n\nSenators have embraced the scoring tactic in their effort to permanently extend the 2017 tax cuts - a key request from the president - at which conservatives are rolling their eyes.\n\n\"From budget gimmicks to a pathetic $4B in spending cuts, the Senate's budget resolution is a non-starter,\" Rep. Andrew Clyde (R-Ga.) wrote on the social platform X over the weekend. \"We need to be serious about delivering on President Trump's America First agenda in a FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE manner. If this comes to the floor in its current form, I'm a NO.\""

A senior administration official confirmed the plans to NewsNation, The Hill's sister network.\n\nWashington City Paper first reported on the parade , noting it will stretch almost 4 miles from the Pentagon in Arlington, Va., to the White House.\n\nThe White House told Politico Monday night that no parade has been \"scheduled.\"\n\nAn Army official confirmed the parade's length to The Hill, and said that \"there are plans for a parade that will involve the Army,\" adding that nothing is yet solidified.\n\nThe official noted that the Army had planned to celebrate its 250th anniversary with a \"robust capability increase in what you would see in previous years.\" Planning began last year and the event has since expanded, with the number of units participating now increased.\n\nThe official also said Washington's local government has been involved in the planning, with engineers in both the Army and city doing \"route reconnaissance.\"\n\n\"The Army is very excited to celebrate its 250th anniversary with the entire county. Our intention is for Americans to be proud of their Army and also proud of their nation. It's too early to say yet whether or not we're having a parade but we're working with the White House as well as several government agencies to make the celebration a national level event,\" Army spokesperson Col. Dave Butler told The Hill.\n\nThanks for signing up!\n\nWatch for us in your inbox.\n\nSubscribe Now\n\nPresident Trump in his first term in 2018 ordered the Pentagon to plan a large military parade after he visited Paris and was inspired by a French Bastille Day event.\n\n\"We're going to have to try to top it,\" he reportedly told French President Emmanuel Macron.\n\nBut that event, set for Nov. 10, was canceled after defense officials quoted the price tag at $92 million and were slow to plan it, citing more pressing issues. The event also was heavily criticized both publicly and in private within the administration.\n\nSenate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin (Ill.) at the time called the military parade plans a \"fantastic waste of money to amuse the president.\"\n\nAnd Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), a staunch Trump backer, warned against treating the parade as a \"Soviet-style\" display of military might .\n\nWashington officials also complained that heavy military equipment such as tanks would damage the city's roads and cost the city millions of dollars for public safety.\n\nThe Defense Department could use its training budget to pay for flyovers and use vehicles from nearby bases, but the event would also require outside costs such as pay for Secret Service and police, and the renting and construction of stands and barriers.\n\nThe timeline for planning is also tight, given that June 14, Trump's birthday, is less than 10 weeks away.\n\nUpdated at 11:22 a.m. EDT on April 8."

Nonetheless, former Trump administration official Steve Bannon , who hosts a popular right-wing podcast, suggested in an interview with NewsNation this month that it's a real option on the table.\n\nTrump was asked directly about a third term in a phone interview with NBC News on Sunday morning.\n\n\"A lot of people want me to do it,\" Trump said. \"But, I mean, I basically tell them we have a long way to go, you know, it's very early in the administration.\"\n\nTrump went on to say that he likes \"working\" and that's he's \"not joking\" about a possible third term.\n\n\"But I'm not-it is far too early to think about it... There are methods which you could do it,\" he said.\n\nMost legal analysts say there is no constitutional path to a third term for a president. The 22nd Amendment reads: \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\"\n\nSome have suggested unconventional paths for Trump to get around the Constitution, as repeal of the amendment is believed to be all but impossible given current political dynamics. One idea floated by some is for Trump to be the vice-presidential nominee, and then whoever serves as president could step aside after winning.\n\nHowever, legal analysts believe even this would be constitutionally tenuous and would likely be blocked by the U.S. Supreme Court . Others have warned that Trump could just ignore the Constitution and simply remain in office, with no clear way to force him out.\n\nTrump, in an April 2024 interview with Time magazine, said he would not be in favor of changing the 22nd Amendment.\n\n\"I wouldn't be in favor of it at all. I intend to serve four years and do a great job. And I want to bring our country back. I want to put it back on the right track,\" he said.\n\nSenator John Curtis, a Utah Republican, to NBC News last Sunday when asked about a possible third Trump term: \"I wouldn't have supported a third term for [former President] George Washington ,\" he responded, laughing. \"That's a no, yeah.\"\n\nSteve Bannon to NewsNation earlier this month: \"I'm a firm believer that President Trump will run and win again in 2028, so I've already endorsed President Trump. A man like this comes along once every century, if we're lucky. We've got him now.\"\n\nFormer federal prosecutor Neama Rahmani told Newsweek on Thursday : \"Aside from the potential vice president loophole, there is no legal path for Trump to run for a third term. Politically, he doesn't have the votes to repeal the 22nd Amendment, either in Congress or the states.\"\n\nRepresentative Dan Goldman, a New York Democrat, previously told Newsweek in a January statement : \"By now, Donald Trump's pattern is predictable: 'joke' about something unconstitutional or authoritarian; normalize the 'joke'; allow sycophantic Republicans to adopt the 'joke' as a serious idea until it becomes MAGA orthodoxy.\"\n\nUpdate, 3/30/25 at 1:32 p.m. ET: This article was updated with additional information.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that is factual and fair\n\nWe value your input and encourage you to rate this article.\n\nJason Lemon is a Senior Politics Editor at Newsweek based in Brooklyn, New York.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Trump signaled Monday that he has no intention of backing down from his sweeping tariff plans, despite speculation that rising market volatility might prompt a pause. Speaking from the Oval Office, Trump dismissed the idea outright, even as he claimed multiple countries were eager to negotiate new trade agreements with the U.S.\n\nWhat to Know:\n\nThis live blog is now closed.\n\nTrump on Monday repeated his long-standing criticism of the European Union's trade practices, calling them unfair and one-sided.\n\n\"It's got to be fair and reciprocal. It's not fair,\" Trump said, pointing to limited U.S. car sales in Europe as an example. He claimed the U.S. trade deficit with the EU, roughly $350 billion, would \"disappear fast\" if Europe began purchasing more American energy.\n\n\"They're going to have to buy it from us. We can knock off $350 billion in one week,\" he said.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Monday that Israel will eliminate its trade deficit with the United States and swiftly remove its tariffs. Speaking alongside Trump after their Oval Office meeting, Netanyahu emphasized the importance of balanced trade.\n\n\"Free trade has to be fair trade,\" Netanyahu said, pledging that Israel would act \"quickly\" to drop its tariffs. In response, Trump said, \"That's very nice, thank you.\"\n\nThe remarks come amid heightened global trade tensions following new tariffs imposed by the Trump administration.\n\nTrump said today that he is \"not looking at\" a pause in tariffs.\n\nAn emerging grassroots campaign group is stepping up its plan for economic \"blackouts\" and boycotts against American retailers, with a rolling series of direct-action protests planned well into the summer. The group is currently calling on shoppers to boycott Walmart this week .\n\nFuture events will focus on hitting the profits being made by Walmart, General Mills, Amazon , Target , and McDonalds.\n\nWalmart told Newsweek, in part, \"Serving communities is at the heart of Walmart's purpose to help people save money and live better.\" Newsweek has also contacted the other four companies by email seeking comment.\n\nThe movement was initiated as a response to corporate rollbacks of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs-notably at companies like Target-and also in protest against President Trump's plans to cut the government workforce, NPR reported.\n\nThe events are being run by a group called People's Union USA , and founder John Schwarz has previously told Newsweek that the organization's \"mission\" is designed to force \"corporations to start paying their fair share of taxes so the American people can finally be relieved of the burden of federal income tax.\" Schwarz has also cited a number of other factors behind the movement , including a drive for equality, opposition to rising prices, and an attempt to help smaller local businesses.\n\nThe group emphasized broader goals: \"economic resistance, government accountability, and corporate reform.\" Founder John Schwarz said the campaign is not about Elon Musk or Trump, but about \"the system as a whole.\" The group advocates eliminating federal income tax, capping corporate profits, and \"promoting equality for all.\"\n\nRead the full story by Chloe Mayer on Newsweek.\n\nWall Street is edging closer to a bear market as growing concerns over President Trump's sweeping tariffs shake investor confidence. Analysts warn that added taxes on imported goods could severely impact global economic growth.\n\nA bear market is defined by a sustained drop of 20% or more from recent highs. The S&P 500 was down 1.2% on Monday afternoon and is now 18.4% below its February peak. The Dow Jones Industrial Average slipped 1.8%, while the Nasdaq, already in bear territory, dropped another 0.9%.\n\nSome analysts say the current downturn resembles the rapid 2020 bear market more than the slower decline of 2022.\n\nU.S. Trade Representative Jamieson Greer is set to testify before the Senate Finance Committee on Tuesday, revealing that nearly 50 countries have reached out to discuss the new tariffs imposed by President Donald Trump. In written testimony obtained by Reuters, Greer noted that countries like Argentina, Vietnam, and Israel have expressed intentions to reduce their tariffs and non-tariff barriers.\n\nGreer acknowledged that the U.S. trade deficit, which has persisted for over three decades, won't be solved immediately, but emphasized that these steps are a positive move towards addressing the issue.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has announced tariffs reaching up to 54 percent on Chinese imports, continuing his trade war with China from his first time in office. But this time, the stakes are different, and Beijing's response has caught Washington off guard.\n\nInstead of triggering panic in Beijing, Trump's announcement has been met with strategic calculation. Chinese officials didn't mirror the tariff escalation in kind. They went for precision. China strategically targeted $15 billion in U.S. agricultural exports, delivering a precise blow to Republican strongholds during peak planting season. The timing compounds the economic anxieties of already struggling farmers.\n\nIn this war of attrition, Beijing isn't just retaliating, it's evolving. Since the first iteration of Trump's trade war in 2018, China has restructured its import portfolio, welcoming Brazil and Russia. American agricultural products once made up 40 percent of China's market; that amount has fallen below 20 percent. Brazil and Russia are now supplying China's growing demand with fewer political strings attached.\n\nRead the full opinion piece by Geostrategic Analyst Imran Khalid on Newsweek.\n\nU.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio spoke with Pakistan's Deputy Prime Minister Ishaq Dar following Trump's decision to impose a 29% tariff on exports from Pakistan. The conversation, which took place on Monday, focused on bilateral relations, regional security, and economic cooperation.\n\nIn a statement released by Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Rubio emphasized that future relations between the U.S. and Pakistan would be centered around economic and trade cooperation. This dialogue comes amid significant economic tension, with Pakistan's stock market experiencing a sharp decline following the tariff announcement.\n\nThe European Commission unveiled a proposal on Monday for 25% counter-tariffs on a variety of U.S. goods, a direct response to Trump's tariffs on steel and aluminum.\n\nAccording to a document seen by Reuters , the tariffs will be implemented in two phases: some goods will be affected starting May 16, while others will face tariffs beginning December 1.\n\nNotably, bourbon, which had initially been considered for inclusion in the March proposal, has been removed from the final list.\n\nBeijing has sharply criticized Trump's tariffs, citing a 1987 speech by the late President Ronald Reagan as a warning about the dangers of escalating trade wars. The Chinese Embassy in the U.S. shared a video clip of Reagan's remarks on social media, highlighting his warning that high tariffs lead to retaliation, increased trade barriers, and economic harm.\n\nIn the video, Reagan, a Republican, stated, \"High tariffs inevitably lead to retaliation by foreign countries and the triggering of fierce trade wars.\" He went on to describe the devastating consequences of such wars: collapsing markets, business shutdowns, and widespread job losses. The embassy added that Reagan's decades-old words \"find new relevance in 2025,\" signaling China's concerns over the continued imposition of tariffs under Trump's administration.\n\nThe Trump administration has initiated a new wave of visa revocations targeting international students studying at American universities. Universities across the nation, including Harvard University, the University of Michigan, Stanford University, and UCLA, reported that several students had their visas revoked. It remains unclear if these actions are linked to anti-Israel sentiments or political activities on campuses.\n\nAt Harvard University, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) revoked the visas of three graduate students and two recent graduates. Similar incidents occurred at other universities, where visa revocations were discovered during routine record reviews, with many institutions not being directly informed by DHS.\n\nThe University of Michigan also saw four students affected by the visa cancellations, with one student already leaving the country. Secretary of State Marco Rubio commented on the situation, stating that visas are being revoked daily due to concerns over students' involvement in activist movements. Rubio emphasized the administration's stance on denying visas to students participating in such activities.\n\nThis development follows ongoing concerns about political movements on US campuses, with the Trump administration taking a cautious approach to student visas, particularly for those linked to organized protests or activism.\n\nThe U.S. is preparing to more than double duties on Canadian softwood lumber, raising tariffs to 34.45%, which will further pressure materials costs in the US housing market, Bloomberg reports. Currently, duties stand at 14.4%, but a memo from the Department of Commerce reveals a proposed increase of 20 percentage points, which would significantly affect lumber imports.\n\nThis comes before Trump potentially imposes additional tariffs on the sector. Trump has ordered a national security investigation into US lumber imports, claiming the U.S. does not need Canadian wood, though US homebuilders argue that more tariffs would only raise housing costs for Americans.\n\nThe dispute stems from the long-standing trade conflict between the US and Canada. The U.S claims Canadian sawmills benefit from subsidies due to low \"stumpage\" fee.s set by provincial governments. Canada, however, maintains that its stumpage system is market-driven, with timber sold through competitive auctions.\n\nLumber is a key industry in Canadian provinces like British Columbia and Quebec, where officials and industry leaders are voicing concerns that the new tariffs will harm local workers and increase housing costs for U.S consumers. In Quebec, companies are struggling to navigate both rising produ.ction costs and the looming trade barriers.\n\nDonald Trump's Monday post on Truth Social signaling a 50% tariff hike on Chinese imports could push the total cost of many goods well over double their original price, as layers of tariffs stack up.\n\nTrump initially imposed a 10% tariff, followed by another 10% linked to fentanyl concerns. Last week, he announced a 34% increase. The latest move appears to tack on an additional 50%.\n\nThat's on top of first-term tariffs of up to 25% that President Joe Biden later expanded-raising rates on Chinese electric vehicles to 100% and boosting tariffs on semiconductors and solar products to 50%.\n\nThe Trump administration on Monday urged the Supreme Court to block a federal judge's order requiring the return of a Maryland man who was deported to a notorious prison in El Salvador. In an emergency appeal, the Justice Department argued that U.S. District Judge Paula Xinis exceeded her authority when she directed the government to bring Kilmar Abrego Garcia back to the United States.\n\nAlthough the administration acknowledged that Abrego Garcia should not have been deported-citing an immigration judge's finding that he likely faced persecution by local gangs-it claimed he is no longer in U.S. custody and cannot be retrieved. Judge Xinis had given the government until just before midnight Tuesday to \"facilitate and effectuate\" his return.\n\nRead the full story by Gabe Whisnant on Newsweek.\n\nAs tariff battles and economic uncertainty continue to rattle markets, NerdWallet investing spokesperson Sam Taube is sharing practical advice for investors looking to stay focused and resilient.\n\nTaube told Newsweek that bear markets, though uncomfortable, are normal and often shorter than bull markets. Staying calm and avoiding panic selling can help investors benefit when markets rebound.\n\nHe also stresses the importance of maintaining a long-term perspective. \"Knee-jerk reactions to short-term drops can lock in losses,\" he notes, while a steady focus on long-term goals allows for recovery and growth.\n\nDiversification remains crucial, especially during downturns. Taube points to recession-resistant sectors like healthcare and the use of bond ladders as ways to build stability. International stocks can also help offset domestic risk.\n\nLastly, he encourages dollar-cost averaging-investing steadily over time-to help smooth out volatility and avoid the pitfalls of trying to time the market.\n\nTrump warned Monday that the U.S. will impose new 50% tariffs on China if it does not roll back its latest round of retaliatory measures. The warning, delivered in a Truth Social post, followed Beijing's announcement of a 34% tariff hike on U.S. goods.\n\nTrump accused China of \"long term trading abuses\" and said any country that retaliates against existing U.S. tariffs will face even higher penalties. He said the new tariffs would take effect April 9 if China does not reverse course by April 8.\n\nHe also threatened to end trade talks with Chinese officials and said negotiations with other countries would begin instead. The statement revived fears of a renewed global trade war and sent shockwaves through markets already rattled by rising protectionism.\n\nThe Trump administration has informed the World Food Program (WFP) and other partners that it is terminating some of the last remaining lifesaving humanitarian initiatives in the Middle East. A U.S. official and a U.N. official confirmed to The Associated Press that around 60 contracts were canceled in the past week, affecting major projects in Lebanon, Jordan, Syria, and other regions like Yemen, Somalia, Afghanistan, and Zimbabwe.\n\nThe terminations, directed by Jeremy Lewin from the Department of Government Efficiency, are part of ongoing efforts to dismantle the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). The cuts impact vital programs that provide food, medical care, water, and shelter to displaced individuals, contradicting previous administration promises to protect these crucial services. This decision is part of a broader push to reduce perceived wastefulness within USAID and other foreign assistance efforts. There has been no immediate response from the State Department regarding these terminations.\n\nRichard Branson shared his thoughts on leadership and the economic consequences of U.S. tariffs in a series of tweets on April 4.\n\nThe Virgin Group founder emphasized the importance of strong leadership, which includes taking risks but also quickly admitting mistakes and correcting them. Branson argued that the sweeping tariffs imposed by the U.S. government are heading the global economy in a dangerous direction, warning that they will negatively impact people worldwide.\n\n(1/4) Strong leadership means taking risks and trying things - but when it doesn't work, realising your mistake and correcting it. Quickly.\n\nCryptocurrencies, which had remained relatively stable during last week's market turmoil, have now followed the broader market in a sell-off. Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency, dipped below $75,000 on Monday morning before showing a slight recovery. This marks the lowest price for Bitcoin since just after the 2020 U.S. presidential election when its value surged.\n\nBitcoin's supporters often refer to it as \"digital gold,\" positioning it as a potential hedge against market volatility. However, cryptocurrency analyst Garrick Hileman pointed out that Bitcoin's price drop undermines that theory, as it continues to behave more like a volatile tech stock than a stable asset. Other major digital currencies, such as ether, XRP, and solana, experienced even larger declines during the same period.\n\nThis latest downturn has raised concerns about the true resilience of cryptocurrencies during financial instability.\n\nConcerns are rising about a \"Black Monday\" market crash over President Donald Trump 's tariff hikes and the resulting backlash from China.\n\nMajor stock indexes plunged in Asia on Monday after Wall Street experienced the worst two days since the pandemic last week, the S&P 500 down 6 percent by market close on Friday while the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged 5.5 percent. The Nasdaq composite dropped 5.82 percent.\n\nCNBC host and market analyst Jim Cramer on Saturday warned of a repeat of the devastating \"Black Monday\" collapse of October 19, 1987 , when the Dow Jones Industrial Average saw its worse single-day fall and plummeted 22.6 percent.\n\nRead the full story by Khaleda Rahman on Newsweek.\n\nU.S. stock markets reversed earlier losses and rose sharply after White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett revealed that President Trump might consider a 90-day suspension of tariffs on all countries except China.\n\nAs of 10:20 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up by 333.50 points (0.87%), reaching 38,614.49. The S&P 500 gained 79.99 points (1.69%), reaching 5,154.07, and the Nasdaq Composite climbed by 362.69 points (2.33%) to 15,950.47. Investors showed optimism, reacting favorably to the possibility of a pause in trade tensions.\n\nJapanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba voiced strong concerns over U.S. tariffs during a telephone call with President Donald Trump on Monday. Ishiba expressed fears that the tariffs could discourage investment from Japan, which has been the top foreign investor in the U.S. for the past five years.\n\nIshiba urged Trump to pursue a more mutually beneficial trade relationship and assured that Japan would continue to negotiate for a reconsideration of the measures. The two leaders agreed to form a team of representatives to handle further discussions.\n\nIshiba also called the situation a \"national crisis\" and said Japan would hold a ministerial task force meeting to address the issue. He emphasized the need for a counterproposal to reshape U.S.-Japan relations, although he ruled out retaliatory measures, believing they would only escalate the situation. The Japanese government, he added, would support industries affected by the tariffs, particularly small and medium-sized businesses.\n\nWhite House trade adviser Peter Navarro has dismissed Vietnam's recent offer to reduce its tariffs on American exports to 0%, calling it \"meaningless.\" The offer came after a \"productive\" call between Trump and Vietnam's General Secretary Tô Lâm. However, Navarro stressed that the focus should not be on tariffs alone, but on \"non-tariff cheating\" by foreign nations.\n\nThe U.S. is set to impose high \"reciprocal\" tariffs on several countries, including Vietnam, starting April 9. With a proposed 46% tariff rate, Vietnam, which was the sixth-largest source of U.S. imports last year, faces significant impact. The new tariffs could raise the cost of goods like electronics, apparel, and footwear that the U.S. imports heavily from the country.\n\nWhite House trade counselor Peter Navarro doubled down on the U.S.'s stance on foreign trade, insisting that countries remove the \"non-tariff barriers\" hindering American commerce. Navarro said these barriers, stating they \"suck our blood\" and demand removal.\n\nHe specifically called on the European Union to ease its value-added taxes and restrictions on American meat, which is produced with hormones or other chemicals.\n\nNavarro accused foreign countries of \"stealing from the American people\" and emphasized that simply lowering tariffs wouldn't suffice.\n\nPeter Navarro, White House trade counselor, spoke on CNBC Monday, revealing plans for soon-to-be-implemented tax cuts and additional benefits for American citizens, which include deregulation, lower energy prices, reduced interest rates, and a reshaping of the country's manufacturing sector. He said that these actions would help return manufacturing to the U.S. while boosting real wages and profits, predicting the market would eventually stabilize.\n\nNavarro also addressed recent criticisms from Elon Musk, who had voiced concerns over tariffs and Navarro's role in their implementation. Navarro countered by saying that Musk, who had questioned the tariffs, is \"not a car manufacturer but a car assembler,\" noting that Tesla's Texas plant relies on imported parts such as batteries and electronics.\n\nWall Street's main indexes opened sharply lower on Monday, with the S&P 500 on track to enter bear market territory. As of 9:31 a.m., the Dow had fallen 1,212.98 points, or 3.17%, to 37,101.88.\n\nThe S&P 500 lost 181.37 points, or 3.57%, dropping to 4,892.71, while the Nasdaq saw a steeper decline of 623.23 points, or 4.00%, settling at 14,964.56. The broad sell-off reflects growing concerns over the economy and the potential for further market instability.\n\nThe S&P 500 opened the trading day down more than 3%, signaling a potential entry into bear market territory.\n\nIf the losses continue, the index would be 20% or more below its recent peak, a key indicator of a bear market.\n\nGoldman Sachs has raised concerns about the long-term economic damage caused by recent tariff announcements, suggesting that a recession is increasingly likely, even if Trump alters his trade policies. The firm lowered its growth forecast, citing factors like tightened financial conditions, foreign consumer boycotts, and rising policy uncertainty that could severely limit capital spending.\n\nGoldman Sachs further noted that meeting prior economic expectations would now require a significant reduction in the tariffs set to take effect on April 9, warning that the economic outlook could worsen without this change.\n\nTrump shared another post on Truth Social this morning, urging people to not be \"weak\" or \"stupid,\" calling them \"panicans,\" which he says is a \"new party based on Weak and Stupid people.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson has struck a deal with Florida Representative Anna Paulina Luna over their standoff regarding proxy voting for new parents.\n\nIn a Sunday post on X, formerly Twitter , Luna said the pair reached an agreement to formalize a centuries-old procedure called \"live/dead pairing,\" which allows lawmakers to symbolically vote by proxy, with the vote canceled out by an opposing one.\n\nNewsweek has contacted Johnson's office for comment via email.\n\nProxy voting is largely opposed by MAGA and hard-line Republicans , including Johnson. The compromise with Luna could increase pressure on Johnson from MAGA figures, as he already faces a potential challenge to remain House speaker in the GOP's narrow majority in the lower chamber.\n\nRead the full story by Ewan Palmer on Newsweek.\n\nWall Street is set to begin the week with more substantial losses as worries grow that the U.S. tariffs imposed by Trump may result in a global economic slowdown.\n\nShares in both European and Asian markets experienced sharp declines, while U.S. futures also fell. The S&P 500 futures dropped 2.7% in premarket trading, with the index now down 17.4% from its February high. A drop of 20% or more from a recent peak would signify a bear market.\n\nOil prices saw another significant drop, briefly falling below $60 a barrel for the first time since 2021.\n\nFutures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq also declined, down 2.4% and 3%, respectively, reflecting widespread investor concerns about the impact of ongoing trade tensions.\n\nA federal appeals court in Washington, D.C. has ruled to reinstate members of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) and the Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) whom Trump had sought to remove, Politico reporter Kyle Cheney shared via X.\n\nThe court's decision was a 7-4 split, citing laws that protect these members from dismissal without cause.\n\nThe ruling could pave the way for the Supreme Court to take up the case, though further details are still to come.\n\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will meet U.S. President Donald Trump in Washington on Monday, becoming the first foreign leader to visit since Trump imposed sweeping tariffs on multiple countries.\n\nWhile Netanyahu's visit focuses on the new tariffs, it will also cover major geopolitical issues, including the war in Gaza, tensions with Iran, and Israel's relationship with Turkey. The outcome of the meeting could influence how other world leaders approach the U.S. tariffs.\n\nNetanyahu's office has indicated that discussions will center on the 17% tariff Israel faces, although it remains unclear if any resolution will be reached. In preparation for the visit, Israel announced last week that it would remove all tariffs on U.S. goods, including food and agricultural imports.\n\nExperts expect Trump to use the tariff issue as leverage, potentially pressing Netanyahu for concessions, including a pause in the Gaza conflict.\n\nGermany reported a significant rise in exports to the United States in February, marking an 8.5% increase compared to the previous month, reaching 14.2 billion euros ($15.6 billion). This surge came just ahead of U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement of sweeping tariffs, as Germany solidified its position as Europe's top economy and a leading exporter.\n\nThe U.S. became Germany's biggest trading partner last year, surpassing China for the first time in nearly a decade. Overall, German exports worldwide rose 1.8% in February to 131.6 billion euros.\n\nHowever, Dirk Jandura, head of Germany's exporters association BGA, cautioned that the increase was likely due to anticipatory effects, as U.S. firms stockpiled goods and German companies expedited shipments ahead of the tariffs.\n\nJandura also emphasized the need for Germany and the EU to quickly adapt to the changing global trade landscape and explore new opportunities with emerging markets. He suggested that Europe's response to the U.S. tariffs could position it as a reliable global partner.\n\nHong Kong Financial Secretary Paul Chan said Monday that recent market volatility does not require drastic action, even after the city's stock market fell 13.2% in a single day.\n\nChan said the market remains orderly, with strong trading activity on both sides, but warned that U.S. tariffs and global interest rate shifts will likely fuel more instability.\n\nHe criticized the U.S. tariffs as \"bullying and unreasonable,\" accusing them of harming global supply chains and slowing economic recovery.\n\nChan also reaffirmed Hong Kong's status as a free port with distinct policies from mainland China.\n\nA Latvian official said Monday the European Union may seek negotiations with the U.S. on energy security and military trade in response to a new 20% tariff on EU exports.\n\nArtjom Uršulskis, parliamentary secretary at Latvia's foreign ministry, said finding common ground is more productive than escalating tensions.\n\n\"Trade wars are never favorable for everyone,\" he told reporters ahead of an EU trade ministers meeting.\n\nUršulskis also pushed back on suggestions the EU should target U.S. services, saying the bloc should avoid \"new wars and new battlefields.\"\n\nJPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said the U.S. economy is \"facing considerable turbulence,\" citing tariffs, inflation concerns, and high market valuations.\n\nIn his annual letter to shareholders , Dimon cautioned that recent tariffs could fuel inflation and increase the risk of a recession. Despite recent market declines, he said stock prices remain elevated.\n\n\"Markets still seem to be pricing assets with the assumption that we will continue to have a fairly soft landing,\" he wrote. \"I am not so sure.\"\n\nChina has issued a sharp rebuke of new U.S. tariffs, accusing Washington of \"unilateralism, protectionism and economic bullying\" in a growing trade confrontation that has drawn in major companies such as Tesla and GE Healthcare .\n\nPutting \"America First\" over international rules harms the stability of global production and the supply chain and seriously impacts the world's economic recovery, China's Foreign Affairs spokesperson Lin Jian told reporters.\n\nChinese officials criticized the administration of President Donald Trump after it imposed a sweeping 34 percent tariff on Chinese goods, escalating from previous rounds of tariffs announced earlier this year.\n\nBeijing has responded with its own 34 percent tariff on American exports and has moved to restrict key imports such as sorghum and poultry while tightening export controls on critical rare earth elements. At the same time, China filed a formal complaint with the World Trade Organization, signaling the dispute could extend into international legal channels.\n\nRead the full article by Newsweek's staff.\n\nTrump defended his trade policies in a Truth Social post, saying that tariffs are bringing in \"Billions of Dollars a week\" and insisting there is \"NO INFLATION\" despite growing economic concerns.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nAmanda M.

Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nPresident Donald Trump has said he will have his annual physical examination at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on Friday.\n\n\"I have never felt better, but nevertheless, these things must be done,\" Trump said in a post on Truth Social.\n\nSitting presidents normally attend the hospital in Maryland for their annual physical, with the results later released by the White House physician.\n\nTrump, 78, often claimed that his physical and mental prowess was better than Joe Biden 's, 82, during the 2024 presidential campaign.\n\nTrump will be 82 by the end of his second term, and will overtake Biden as the oldest sitting U.S. president in history.\n\nThe physical examination is designed to ensure that the president is medically fit to serve and to maintain public confidence. Not all details of the results are disclosed.\n\nThe examination can include blood tests and screening for diseases like cancer and diabetes, as well as checking vital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate.\n\nTrump may undergo cognitive assessments like the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), which is used to detect cognitive impairment or signs of decline.\n\nMoCA can involve being asked to repeat five words immediately, and then asked to repeat them again after some time has passed; identifying animals; and drawing the hands on a clock to indicate a certain time.\n\nTrump requested that he undergo the MoCA during a physical he took in 2018 during his first term, according to Texas Representative Ronny Jackson, who formerly served as Trump's doctor while he was in office.\n\nThe results of Trump's last physical test while in office were released in June 2020 during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDr. Sean Conley, the president's physician, said at the time that Trump \"remains healthy\" and that there had been \"no interval change to the president's medical history.\" The examinations were carried out between November 2019 and April 2020.\n\nTrump has released limited information about his health during his presidential campaigns. There were no official medical records released after the president received minor injuries to his ear following the assassination attempt against him when a gunman opened fire at a campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, last July.\n\nIn November 2023, Trump shared a letter from physician Bruce Aronwald who said he had conducted several \"comprehensive\" examinations on Trump, with the most recent being in September 2023.\n\nAronwald said Trump's \"overall health is excellent\" and that the president had reduced his weight through an \"improved diet and continued physical activity.\"\n\nIn December 2015, Dr. Harold Bornstein, Trump's personal physician, wrote a letter saying that he would be the \"healthiest individual ever elected to the presidency.\" Bornstein told CNN in 2018 that the doctor's note he penned had been dictated to him by Trump.\n\nPresident Trump wrote on Truth Social: \"I am pleased to report that my long scheduled Annual Physical Examination will be done at Walter Reed Army Medical Center on Friday of this week. I have never felt better, but nevertheless, these things must be done!\"\n\nTrump's personal physician Bruce Aronwald wrote in a November, 2023 letter: \"I am pleased to report that President Trump's overall health is excellent. His physical exams were well within the normal range and his cognitive exams were exceptional. In addition, his most recent extensive laboratory analysis remains well within normal limits and was even more favorable than prior testing in some of the most significant parameters, most likely secondary to weight reduction. Cardiovascular studies are all normal and cancer screening tests are all negative. President Trump has reduced his weight through an improved diet and continued daily physical activity, while maintaining a rigorous schedule.\"\n\nHe added: \"It is my opinion that President Trump is currently in excellent health, and with his continued interest in preventative health monitoring and maintenance, he will continue to enjoy a healthy active lifestyle for years to come.\"\n\nThe White House is expected to release some of the results of Trump's physical, although the date remains unknown.\n\nShane Croucher is a Breaking News Editor based in London, UK.

Originally from Bogotá, Colombia, his focus is reporting on politics, current affairs and trending news. He has covered current affairs, healthcare, pop culture, and sports. Jesus joined Newsweek's U.S. bureau in 2024, and has previously worked for The Financial Times and served as an international reporter and newsletter editor for El Espectador in Colombia. He graduated with an M.A. in Journalism and Digital Innovation from New York University. Languages: English, Spanish.

Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nWhen Claudia Sheinbaum took office as Mexico's first female president last October, her historic rise drew global attention-and quiet skepticism. A scientist by training and a reserved technocrat by reputation, Sheinbaum was seen as cautious and untested in the arena of high-stakes diplomacy.\n\nShe assumed office just one month before the U.S. presidential election, at the height of a turbulent campaign season when signs were starting to point ward Donald Trump defeating Kamala Harris . Amid swirling speculation, Sheinbaum remained composed. She sidestepped reporters' headline-chasing questions and, when Trump ultimately won, became o ne of the first world leaders to offer congratulations .\n\nStill, doubts lingered-particularly over her ability to manage what is arguably one of the world's most complex bilateral relationships. But while many global leaders are still figuring out how to deal with a second Trump presidency , Sheinbaum is already executing a plan.\n\nAnd it's working.\n\nLast week, as Trump unveiled a new 10 percent global baseline tariff and harsher \"reciprocal tariffs\" on most trading partners , Mexico stood out as a notable exception. Thanks to months of groundwork by Sheinbaum and her economic team, Mexico emerged with preferential treatment-confounding skeptics and earning grudging respect from the famously unpredictable U.S. president.\n\n\"There are no additional tariffs on Mexico, and that is good for the country,\" Sheinbaum said during a press conference last Thursday. She attributed the exemption to \"the good relationship we have constructed with the U.S. government, based on collaboration but with respect.\"\n\nThat relationship didn't materialize overnight. In the first two months of Trump's term, Mexico faced threats of auto and steel tariffs-twice. Each time, the White House held back , partly due to continued negotiations led by Sheinbaum's team and her personal, measured diplomatic tone.\n\nThe calm Sheinbaum projects is no accident. Behind the scenes, she has orchestrated a highly disciplined diplomatic strategy to keep Mexico out of Trump's crosshairs-a stark contrast to the more confrontational approaches taken by other U.S. trade partners and neighbors like Canada.\n\n\"President Sheinbaum wisely set out some parameters to manage the always complex U.S.-Mexico relationship,\" said Michael Shifter, senior fellow and former president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a think tank focused on international affairs in the Western Hemisphere.\n\n\"She expressed willingness to cooperate with the U.S. on immigration and fentanyl while insisting that Mexico would not waver in defending its national sovereignty. Unlike Trump, who is erratic and unpredictable, Sheinbaum is disciplined and focused.\"\n\nOne of the more revealing moments came during a 45-minute phone call between Sheinbaum and Trump on February 3.\n\nSpeaking in English-a surprise to Trump, who was said to have found interpreter-assisted talks with her predecessor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, tedious and overly long-Sheinbaum proposed deploying 10,000 troops to the border to help curb fentanyl trafficking . The proposal resonated with her counterpart, who paused planned tariff hikes and reportedly told her, \"You're tough,\" according to The New York Times .\n\nHer balancing act is also paying off politically at home. \"Her strong posture has been a political boon, stirring nationalist sentiment,\" Shifter noted. \"Her approval level is higher than for any Mexican president in the last 30 years.\"\n\nDomestic polling shows her approval rating ranging between 63 and 85 percent, buoyed by a public perception that she is standing up to Trump without needlessly provoking him. At the high end, those numbers make Sheinbaum the most popular democratically-elected leader in the world, surpassing Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi 's 75 percent approval.\n\n\"She's gaining strength from these tensions,\" said Javier Rosiles Salas, a Mexican political analyst and professor at the Universidad de la Ciénega del Estado de Michoacán. \"In Mexico, Trump is generally seen as an enemy of the country, and Sheinbaum has positioned herself as a defender of national sovereignty.\"\n\nRosiles Salas added that, unlike in Canada-where Trump's tariffs deepened partisan divides-Sheinbaum's approach has unified much of Mexico's political class. \"Even opposition governors are backing her, if reluctantly,\" he said. \"The narrative of standing up to Trump resonates well.\"\n\nWhile China, Canada, and the European Union scrambled to retaliate or denounce the new tariffs, Sheinbaum stayed the course. \"We will announce a comprehensive program, not a tit-for-tat on tariffs,\" she told reporters on April 2, the day before Trump's \"Liberation Day\" announcement that sent global markets into a tailspin. Her government followed with an 18-point economic plan focused on strengthening national production and boosting domestic content in key sectors such as autos, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals.\n\n\"She has indicated a very open and frank relationship with President Trump and his team while presenting a clear interest in Mexico's interests,\" said Earl Wayne, former U.S. ambassador to Mexico during the Obama administration. \"She seems to have a good sense of the depth and range of these interests.\"\n\nHer deputy economy secretary, Luis Rosendo Gutierrez, put it more bluntly: \"The instruction of President Claudia Sheinbaum was to work closely and cool-headed with the United States government, looking for fair and preferential treatment.\"\n\nThe results followed. Unlike many U.S. allies, Mexico was granted key exemptions from the \"reciprocal\" tariffs. USMCA-compliant exports were spared entirely, while some sectors-like non-compliant auto parts and steel-remain under 25 percent duties. The most aggressive penalties were avoided.\n\nThat strategy has extended beyond trade. When Trump signed an executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico the \"Gulf of America\"-a symbolic move heavy with nationalist overtones-Sheinbaum resisted the urge to wade in. According to one aide, she dryly quipped in private that perhaps parts of the U.S. that once belonged to Mexico should be renamed \"Mexican America.\" But the remark went no further.\n\nMartha Bárcena Coqui, the former Mexican ambassador to the U.S., said Sheinbaum understands how much is at stake. \"She's been doing well in maintaining a continuous dialogue with the Trump administration on the many issues that make this relationship so complex,\" Bárcena told CNN .\n\nHowever, the risks of this fragile relationship breaking down are very real.\n\n\"There is a long way to go in the Sheinbaum-Trump relationship,\" Shifter, of the Inter-American Dialogue, warned. \"No matter what Sheinbaum does to accommodate Trump-whether it's putting Mexican troops on the border or taking in deportees-it never seems to be enough.\"\n\nAlthough the 62-year-old president appears strong now, it's unclear whether her political support would hold if Mexico's economy were to suffer due to renewed U.S. tensions. That could include retaliatory tariffs or a breakdown in joint migration enforcement.\n\n\"If there's an economic crisis in Mexico and people lose their jobs, they'll look for work wherever they can find it,\" Bárcena said. \"Mexico can't legally stop them from heading to the border. That would undermine all the joint efforts between Mexico and the U.S. to reduce migration.\"\n\nRosiles Salas, the Mexican political analyst, echoed that concern and warned the greatest danger may not be economic-but security-related . \"If the Mexican government fails to adequately contain criminal groups, it could lead the U.S. to take harsher measures,\" he said. \"This could very well be the breaking point of the 'friendly' relationship.\"\n\nFor now, Sheinbaum continues to walk the tightrope with a level of precision that would make other world leaders envious. While global heads of state brace themselves for Trump's next move, Mexico's president has already shown that clarity, patience and calm might just be the best way to navigate the storm.\n\n\"There are many areas where better mutual understanding is needed,\" said Wayne, the former U.S. ambassador. \"Sheinbaum seems to have a good sense of the depth and range of these interests.\"\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nJesus is a Newsweek reporter based in New York.

      "text": "What a Third Donald Trump Term Could Look Like\n\nEwan Palmer is a Newsweek News Reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on US politics, and Florida news. He joined Newsweek in February 2018 after spending several years working at the International Business Times U.K., where he predominantly reported on crime, politics and current affairs. Prior to this, he worked as a freelance copywriter after graduating from the University of Sunderland in 2010. Languages: English. Email: e.palmer@newsweek.com.\n\nBased on facts, either observed and verified firsthand by the reporter, or reported and verified from knowledgeable sources.\n\nNewsweek AI is in beta. Translations may contain inaccuracies-please refer to the original content.\n\n🎙️ Voice is AI-generated. Inconsistencies may occur.\n\nThe previously undebatable topic on whether President Donald Trump can seek a third term in office is gaining increasing prevalence, mainly due to the Republican himself.\n\nTrump has long suggested he might consider running in the 2028 election, despite the Constitution stating no person can be elected to office more than twice. These past comments from Trump have often appeared to be in jest, or just an excuse to excite his loyal fan base during public speaking.\n\nHowever, Trump has ramped up the rhetoric, telling NBC 's Kristen Welker in late March he was \"not joking\" about considering a third term in office, adding there are \"methods which you could do it.\"\n\nWhile only a few months into Trump's second term, a number of experts and political commentators have told Newsweek the possible implications of Trump being in the White House in 2029 and beyond.\n\nThe reactions have ranged from suggesting it would cause the end of American Democracy all together to outright rejecting the possibility.\n\nJeremiah Chin, an assistant professor at the University of Washington School of Law who specializes in constitutional law\n\n\"A Trump third term would look unlike any version of the United States under the Constitution as we know it. A third term would require an extraordinary change in constitutional law and societal circumstances to create a situation in which all powers of government are suddenly vested in one person creating a form of dictatorship unlike anything seen in United States history. Were he to impose a third term in direct contradiction to the Constitution, particularly the long-standing history and traditions of the executive branch and codified in the 22nd Amendment, Trump would likely be emboldened to push any agenda he deems fit, and likely attempt to suppress the opposition, protest, or even pure speech that would inevitably arise.\n\n\"It is hard to understate that such an unprecedented seizure of federal power would likely be legally disastrous for public dissent and demonstrations, given the President's extensive rhetoric demonizing opposition.\"\n\nPhilip Klinkner, Hamilton College professor of government\n\n\"If Trump somehow manages to stay in office beyond the end of his second term in 2029, then we will need to close the book on American democracy. It will show that there are no longer any laws, practices, or institutions that can contain him.\n\n\"And if Trump can stay in office past 2029, then we might as well declare him 'President for Life,' similar to the title given to several African dictators.\"\n\nPhil Chen, assistant professor of political science at the University of Denver\n\n\"My first thought is that a third term would require the U.S. to be in one of two scenarios. Either the economy is doing well and the public is not particularly unhappy with the other cuts and changes made to the federal government, which allows Republicans to install President Trump into a third term using a questionably legal but still marginally democratic process, such as electing a stand-in president and vice president, winning the House of Representatives, electing Trump as speaker, then having the president and vice president resign and using the order of succession to have Trump become president.\n\n\"Under this scenario, you still have a nominal/theoretical majority of the country that is voting in reasonably fair and free elections for the continuation of these policies. In this case, I think you likely see a continuation of the current economic policies and domestic/foreign policy strategies, but perhaps not an escalation of any of the threats. I think you'd likely see protests and court cases, but in order for this scenario to play out, it would have to be well-known to voters long before the election, so the protests would be ongoing and the fight would likely occur largely in the courts after the scenario plays out.\n\n\"If we see this scenario, I think we would still see protests being allowed against Trump, but the punishments for those who are not U.S. citizens would be severe and the threat of punishment would likely quiet some of the protests. I think we'd see continuing harsh immigration policies, isolationist foreign policy, and domestic policies that address similar concerns we see now around DEI, gender equity, university funding, etc.\n\n\"The second scenario is more frightening from a democratic health perspective, because it would involve some type of successful attempt to circumvent the will of the voters and a refusal to peacefully transfer power. I don't know what this looks like, whether it is a military coup, a captured and threatened institution like the Secret Service or FBI preventing an inauguration, or the enacting of martial law and the cancellation of the 2028 election. I don't know what the specifics of this scenario would look like, but it is frightening and likely spells the end of American democracy for the foreseeable future. In this scenario, I think you would see large-scale protests as well as crippling economic sanctions from other democracies. It's the type of action that would fundamentally change the nature of America and, while I think it is unlikely, I no longer think it is impossible.\"\n\nT.J. McCormack, Republican communications specialist\n\n\"Trump going for a path to a third term-even talking about finding a potential path-will fuel the fire for all the leftist conspiracy theorists who have been predicting this for months. Just in terms of timing, there is no need to do it now. If President Trump and his team believe they are in the process of making America greater, healthier and stronger then why not let all those results come in and maybe Americans will beg him to find a way to stay?\"\n\nGary Rose, a professor of political science at Sacred Heart University\n\n\"Although Trump's approval numbers as of right now are higher than they were during his first term, it is very likely that by the end of his current term there will be 'Trump fatigue' as there so often is with two-term presidents. The vast majority of the American people in contemporary times, with the exception of a small percentage of hard core MAGA voters, would not be in favor of a third-term presidency, regardless of who it is, or regardless of what has been accomplished. The country's political culture prevents this. Moreover, Trump will be in his early 80s at that point. People need to understand that Trump enjoys making controversial statements that rattle the press and his opponents; that's his style. I seriously doubt that he has intentions to run again.\n\n\"That said, should this actually occur and Trump [is] elected again, a third Trump presidency would still be subject to the system of checks and balances that James Madison and other Founders put in place. The fact that a president serves a third term, or even a fourth term, does not somehow negate the constitutional framework all presidents must operate under. That has already been proven with Franklin D. Roosevelt. The Constitution itself mitigates the dark scenarios his opponents are advancing involving a Trump third term.\"\n\nNicole Brenecki, l egal analyst and political commentator\n\n\"If Trump indeed finds a way to bypass the Constitution and secures a third term, the most logical assumption would be that he will tailor his strategies and actions to the specific issues we are facing as a country at that time. Trump now claims that some of his current policies, particularly those pertaining to the economy and foreign policy, will take time to have a meaningful effect. If that is the case, the third term would allow him to build upon those policies.\n\n\"Realistically speaking, however, we have no guarantee that the myriad of executive orders he is currently issuing will have any long-lasting impact and, as such, it is virtually impossible to predict what his third term would look like.\"\n\nJay Oliver, political commentator and LI News Radio host\n\n\"Trump running for a third term not only goes against the Constitution, but more importantly, could go against 'father time.'\n\n\"Would we be pondering the Joe Biden aspect of the latter years of 82-86. It's possible, but who is to really know? Cognitively speaking, it could be a disaster. Common sense thinking would be not even to bring up such nonsense at this point, we're not even at the 100-day mark of his second term. Let's not have an egomaniacal look at this point. Best would be to help try to solve the world's problems and set the stage for the next president to carry on accordingly.\"\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nNewsweek is committed to journalism that's factual and fair.\n\nHold us accountable and submit your rating of this article on the meter.\n\nEwan Palmer is a Newsweek News Reporter based in London, U.K. His focus is reporting on US politics, and Florida news.

      "text": "Trump and Biden: The National Debt\n\nThe national debt is on course to reach a record share of the economy under the next presidential administration, due in part to policies approved by Presidents Trump and Biden during their time in office, including executive actions and legislation passed by Congress.\n\nWhile it is important to understand the fiscal impact of the promises candidates make on the campaign trail - particularly because they reflect the candidates' own policy preferences and are not impacted by unexpected external events or the actions of Congress - the fact that both leading candidates have served as President also allows for a comparison of their actual fiscal records. This analysis focuses on the estimated ten-year debt impact of policies approved by Presidents Trump and Biden around the time of enactment. 1 In this analysis, we find:\n\nIn companion analyses, we will show:\n\nNote: bipartisan indicates legislation passed with votes from both political parties in either chamber of Congress. *Includes $23 billion of executive actions in the form of student debt payment pauses.\n\nDuring his four-year term in office, President Trump approved $8.4 trillion of new ten-year borrowing above prior law, or $4.8 trillion when excluding the bipartisan COVID relief bills and COVID-related executive actions. Looking at all legislation and executive actions with meaningful fiscal impact, the full amount of approved ten-year borrowing includes $8.8 trillion of deficit-increasing laws and actions offset by $443 billion of deficit-reducing actions. 2\n\nThese estimates are based on scores of legislation and executive actions rather than retrospective estimates. Scores are generally made on a conventional basis, though the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) is scored dynamically. The actual debt impact of the policies was likely somewhat higher than these scores. In particular, the TCJA likely reduced revenue more than projected and saved less from repealing the individual health care mandate penalty, 3 while the Employee Retention Credit was likely far more expensive than originally estimated.\n\nSources: CRFB estimates based on CBO and OMB projections.\n\nThe major actions approved by President Trump (and ten-year impact with interest) include:\n\nOver his first three years and five months in office, President Biden has approved $4.3 trillion of new ten-year borrowing, or $2.2 trillion when excluding the American Rescue Plan Act. This includes $6.2 trillion of deficit-increasing legislation and actions, offset by $1.9 trillion of legislation and actions scored as reducing the deficit.\n\nThese estimates are based on scores of legislation and executive actions rather than retrospective estimates and do not include preliminary rules, unexecuted \"side deals,\" or actions ruled illegal by the Supreme Court. Updated scores and in-process actions would increase the total. For example, an updated estimate would likely wipe away the $252 billion of scored savings from the Inflation Reduction Act, 4 the informal FRA side deals would reduce its savings by about $500 billion , and the new student debt cancellation plan could cost $250 to $750 billion .\n\nSources: CRFB estimates based on CBO and OMB projections.\n\nThe major actions approved by President Biden so far (and ten-year impact with interest) include:\n\nThe next presidential term will present significant fiscal challenges. While past performance is not necessarily indicative of future actions, it is helpful to examine the fiscal performance from each President's time in office for clues as to how they plan to confront these challenges or how high of a priority fiscal responsibility will be on their agendas.\n\nBoth candidates approved substantial amounts of new borrowing in their first term. President Trump approved $8.4 trillion in borrowing over a decade, while President Biden has approved $4.3 trillion so far in his first three years and five months in office. Of course, accountability also rests with Congress as a co-equal branch of government, which passed legislation constituting the majority of the fiscal impact under both presidents.\n\nSome of this borrowing was clearly justified, particularly in the early parts of the COVID-19 pandemic when joblessness was rising rapidly and large parts of the economy were effectively shut down. However, funding classified as COVID relief explains less than half of the borrowing authorized by either President, and arguably, a meaningful portion of this COVID relief was either extraneous, excessive, poorly targeted, or otherwise unnecessary. 5\n\nIn supplemental analyses, we will compare a number of other aspects of the candidates' fiscal records.\n\nDuring the next presidential term, the national debt is projected to reach a record share of the economy, interest costs are slated to surge, the debt limit will re-emerge, discretionary spending caps and major tax cuts are scheduled to expire, and major trust funds will be hurtling toward insolvency.\n\nAdding trillions more to the national debt will only worsen these challenges, just as both Presidents Trump and Biden did during their terms along with lawmakers in Congress. The country would be better served if the candidates put forward and stuck to plans to reduce the national debt, secure the trust funds, and put the budget on a sustainable long-term path.\n\nThis analysis estimates the additional borrowing approved by Presidents Trump and Biden through tax and spending changes passed by Congress or contained in executive actions from their administrations. It does not estimate the amount of debt that accumulated over their terms, which partially reflects actions taken prior to their time in office and does not account for the fiscal impact of the actions approved by the President but incurred outside of his four-year term. We will publish changes in debt during their terms in a supplemental analysis.\n\nOur analysis incorporates all major pieces of legislation and executive actions - those with more than $10 billion of ten-year budget impact - approved by Presidents Trump and Biden. Estimates rely on ten-year budget scores, as under standard convention. In order to rely on official scores wherever possible, however, all estimates are based on the ten-year budget window at the time of enactment - meaning different policies cover different time frames and thus are not purely additive or comparable.\n\nIn general, estimates rely on official estimates from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT) presented prospectively. When such scores are not available or not comprehensive, we may use estimates from the Office of Management and Budget, the regulatory agencies, or our own estimates.\n\nEstimates are not updated to incorporate data and results made available well after implementation; no legislation signed by either President Trump or President Biden has been re-estimated in full to incorporate observed costs or effects, and partial updates would bias the overall numbers. However, possible differences between initial scores and actual costs, including from the TCJA, the IRA, and COVID relief, are discussed throughout this paper.\n\nEstimates incorporate impact on interest costs, which we calculate using the most recent CBO debt service tool at the time of enactment, unless interest impact is included in the estimate. Estimates are generally based on conventional scoring, but in the case of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, we incorporate macroeconomic impacts as estimated by CBO shortly after enactment.\n\nAll estimates are in nominal dollars at the time of approval, which means deficit impact from earlier budget windows generally represent a larger share of GDP per dollar due to higher price levels and output over time.\n\nFinally, the estimates are based on the policies as written and do not try to correct for arbitrary cliffs, side agreements, or other budget gimmicks that may create a misleading picture of the intended fiscal impact of the policy.\n\n1 Our estimates compare ten-year estimates of each action before implementation, generally using prospective scores of policies and adding them together despite being over different windows. Although this is not a perfect apples-to-apples comparison for a variety of reasons, it allows us to rely on official numbers and continue to compare over time. See the methodology section for a more detailed explanation.\n\n2 Many pieces of legislation with fiscal impact include tax and spending changes that both add to and reduce projected deficits. The $8.8 trillion figure is based on the net deficit impact of deficit-increasing bills, rather than the gross deficit increases within those bills. For example, the $1.9 trillion impact of the TCJA represents the combination of tax cuts, base broadening, lower spending as a result of repealing the individual mandate penalty, interest, and dynamic effects on revenue and spending.\n\n3 The larger deficit impact from the TCJA is due to a combination of a larger nominal tax base, lower health savings from individual mandate repeal, the unexpected use of a SALT cap workaround, reduced revenue collection from the limit on pass-through losses, higher revenue loss related to bonus depreciation, and other factors.\n\n4 Due to higher prices and output, greater demand for subsidized activities, and laxer-than-expected regulations, the IRA's energy provisions are now expected to have a fiscal impact of $660 billion - about two-thirds more than the original estimate of roughly $400 billion. This excludes the effects of the Administration's vehicle emissions rule, which we've scored separately. At the same time, revenue collection under the IRA is also likely to be higher in light of higher-than-projected nominal corporate profits , greater expected voluntary tax compliance , and less-than-expected responsiveness to the buyback tax. Overall, we believe a re-estimate of the IRA would be roughly budget neutral. The emissions rule approved by President Biden would increase deficits by about $170 billion - mainly by further increasing the fiscal impact of the IRA tax credits - and is included in our tally of his executive actions.\n\n5 In a previous analysis, we estimated that $500 to 650 billion of COVID relief was extraneous - unrelated to the pandemic or subsequent economic fallout - including $300 to $335 billion enacted under President Trump and $200 to $315 billion under President Biden. These prior estimates are not perfectly comparable to estimates in this paper but give a sense of scale. In additional analyses, we estimated that the American Rescue plan likely significantly overshot the output gap it was aiming to close while providing excessive relief to a number of sectors. There were also excesses and lack of targeting in earlier COVID relief packages, including as it related to stimulus checks , the additional $600 of weekly unemployment benefits , and the Paycheck Protection Program."

      "text": "Trump Advisors Struggle To Defend, or Even Explain, His Tariff Strategy\n\nTariffs\n\nJoe Lancaster | 4.7.2025 12:45 PM\n\nPresident Donald Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs went into effect over the weekend, imposing a 10 percent tax on imports from nearly every nation on the planet. (Additional higher tariffs on a subset of countries will go into effect Wednesday.) The U.S. stock market then plunged , seeing its worst week since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic and the worst two-day drop in history, with the market losing $6.6 trillion in value. Asian markets similarly saw precipitous declines when they opened this week.\n\nAs Trump's advisors took to the Sunday morning talk shows to defend their boss' plan, one thing became clear: There was no plan.\n\n\"Are these tariffs permanent? Or are they a negotiating tactic?\" Kristen Welker asked Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent on Meet the Press. \"Some administration officials have said they're permanent. President Trump himself has said he's open to negotiating.\"\n\nBessent hedged that this would be Trump's decision, but he added that the president had \"created maximum leverage for himself, and more than 50 countries have approached the administration\" about renegotiating.\n\nKevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, agreed. He told ABC, \"I got a report from the [Office of the U.S. Trade Representative] last night that more than 50 countries have reached out to the president to begin a negotiation.\"\n\nBut that wasn't the message every advisor was offering.\n\n\"This is not a negotiation,\" White House trade advisor Peter Navarro told Fox News. \"This is a national emergency based on a trade deficit that's gotten out of control because of cheating.\"\n\n\"There is no postponing\" the tariffs, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick told CBS. \"They are definitely going to stay in place for days and weeks.\" When asked about the other advisors' claims that 50 countries had offered to negotiate, Lutnick replied, \"The tariffs are coming. He announced it, and he wasn't kidding.\"\n\nIf Trump's advisors aren't sure what the policy is, that may be because Trump himself hasn't kept his story straight. On Thursday, Trump told reporters that the new trade barriers \"give us great power to negotiate.\" The following morning, on the other hand, he posted on Truth Social that \"MY POLICIES WILL NEVER CHANGE.\" And on Monday, after China retaliated with new tariffs against us, the president responded that \"all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us will be terminated\" and \"negotiations with other countries...will begin taking place immediately.\"\n\nWhen he announced the tariffs last week, Trump said they were necessary to correct a trade imbalance between the U.S. and the rest of the world that he sees as predatory. \"For decades, our country has been looted, pillaged, raped, and plundered by nations near and far, both friend and foe alike,\" he said at the time. \"Now it's our turn to prosper.\"\n\n\"Large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits have led to the hollowing out of our manufacturing base,\" the White House claimed in a fact sheet released to coincide with the announcement. \"These tariffs will remain in effect until such a time as President Trump determines that the threat posed by the trade deficit and underlying nonreciprocal treatment is satisfied, resolved, or mitigated.\"\n\nThis wasn't the argument offered in an earlier order , where Trump placed a tariff on Canada and Mexico \"to combat the extraordinary threat to U.S. national security, including our public health posed by unchecked drug trafficking.\" Trump himself added, \"This Tariff will remain in effect until such time as Drugs, in particular Fentanyl, and all Illegal Aliens stop this Invasion of our Country!\"\n\nAnd last week, Navarro said Trump's tariffs would \"raise about $600 billion a year, about $6 trillion over a 10-year period\"-which would certainly imply that he expects them to be in place that long.\n\nSo tariffs are a negotiating tactic, or they're a punishment to use until countries act the way we want, or they're a permanent policy for generating revenue. Got it?\n\nTrump has always been inconsistent on tariffs, presenting them both as a short-term negotiating maneuver and as a long-term source of government revenue. And he remains convinced , despite all evidence to the contrary, that trade deficits mean America is getting \"ripped off.\"\n\nOver the weekend, Trump advisors also struggled to defend the financial havoc their boss' policies had wrought.\n\nKristen Welker asked Bessent if the market disruption, including more than $6 trillion in lost wealth, was \"part of the plan.\"\n\n\"What I've been very impressed with is the market infrastructure, that we had record volume on Friday and everything is working very smoothly,\" Bessent replied. \"So, the American people, they can be very-take great comfort in that.\" (Indeed, Friday did see trade volume at an all-time high-\"indicative of a market in complete panic, with trading volumes going haywire,\" in the words of Sherwood News .)\n\n\"Trillions of dollars of factories are going to be built in America,\" Lutnick said. \"The army of millions and millions of human beings screwing in little screws to make iPhones, that kind of thing is going to come to America.\"\n\nThat's also unlikely: As The New York Times reported in 2019 , during Trump's first term and amid an earlier trade war with China, Apple already tried to shift some of its production to the U.S. but \"struggled to find enough screws\" to meet its demand. \"In China, Apple relied on factories that can produce vast quantities of custom screws on short notice....Apple has found that no country-and certainly not the United States-can match China's combination of scale, skills, infrastructure and cost.\"\n\nAs Trump's advisors would struggle to defend these tariffs, one thing is clear: The confusion comes from the very top.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "President Trump's New Tariffs Are Unconstitutional\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nNondelegation\n\nSteven Calabresi | 4.5.2025 4:35 PM\n\nI have agreed with President Trump on most policy questions, and I defended him ardently against the despicable campaign of lawfare waged against him by former President Biden and by the Left more generally. I greatly admire the President and believe strongly that the President has the power to remove all federal officers and employees who do not either work for Congress or for the Article III federal courts. I will defend in amicus briefs his power to fire FTC commissioners, NLRB commissioners, Inspectors General, and civil service personnel.\n\nI must, however, respectfully disagree with President Trump's imposition of sweeping tariffs, which are huge tax increases, this week because I think he lacks the statutory and constitutional authority to raise tariffs in the way and to the degree he has done. Under Article I, Section 8, Clause 3, it is Congress that has the power to regulate commerce with foreign nations and not the President, and under Article I, Section 8, Clause 1, it is Congress and not the President that has the power to impose duties, imposts, and excises-better known as taxes.\n\nThe American Revolution was fought over the principle that there should be \"no taxation without representation.\" While the President does represent the American people, Congress represents them as well. The Constitution gives Congress and not the President the critical voice in the imposition of taxes on the importation of goods.\n\nWhile Congress has delegated substantial discretion to the President to raise tariffs when there are emergencies, which Congress may do under U.S. v. Curtiss-Wright Export Corporation , 299 U.S. 304 (1936), the tariffs, which President Trump has imposed, especially this week, raise \"the major question\" of whether tariffs on this scale ought to be imposed as: (1) a big source of the federal government's revenue (partly replacing for this purpose the income tax), or (2) in response to currency manipulation or (3) in response to the inclusion in the price of foreign goods of value added taxes or (4) to deal with the types of emergencies, which President Trump's new tariffs are said to be imposed to address. The supposed emergencies of currency manipulation or the burying of value added taxes in the price of foreign goods, which President Trump has pointed to, have existed for many decades-yet during that time no such tariffs were announced or thought to be necessary. Congress has never addressed these \"major questions,\" and until and unless Congress approves of such taxes/tariffs, the President lacks the power to impose them.\n\nCongress has frequently delegated to the President the power to impose reciprocal tariffs when another nation restricts American exports unfairly. It has never delegated to the President the power to answer the major public policy question as to whether our system of taxation should finance the government to a greater degree through tariffs than through income taxes, which are far less of a burden on the middle class and the poor than are tariffs. Moreover, Congress has long been aware of the phenomenon of currency manipulation and the burying of value added taxes in the price of foreign goods, yet it has never delegated to the President the power to impose tariffs to counter those phenomena.\n\nThe foreign affairs emergencies where Congress has delegated power to impose tariffs, or sanctions, are those like Russia's invasion of Ukraine, or Iran's effort to develop nuclear missiles. Congress has known of the \"emergency\" of the erosion of America's manufacturing base for decades, and yet Congress has ratified many free trade deals with Canada, Mexico, Central America, and South Korea. It is simply implausible as a matter of statutory construction for President Trump to interpret the word \"emergency\" in federal law as encompassing the erosion of our manufacturing base-just as it was implausible for President Biden to interpret the term pollutant as including carbon dioxide in his attempt to use his presidential power to enact national climate change rules.\n\nIn recent years, the Supreme Court has on several occasions, and particularly during President Biden's Administration, struck down executive branch and presidential action based on vague statutory authority addressing \"major questions\" that only Congress has the power to address. The \"major questions doctrine\" is a commonsense approach to statutory interpretation, not a canon of statutory construction. The Roberts Court has only formulated the \"major questions doctrine\" in recent years, and it has not yet applied it in the context of foreign affairs, but there is no inherent reason why the doctrine ought not to apply in that context where Congress's core powers to tax and to regulate foreign commerce are implicated. In my opinion, no President has the legal authority to raise tariffs in the way, and on the scale, in which President Trump has done.\n\nThe \"major questions doctrine\" was deployed by the Roberts Court to stop President Biden from doing an end run around Congress by: (1) imposing unilaterally hugely expensive climate change rules without congressional approval; (2) requiring all workplaces to make their employees get Covid shots without specific congressional approval; (3) declaring a nationwide moratorium on the eviction of renters by property owners because of Covid without getting congressional approval; and (4) excusing billions of dollars in unpaid student loan debt without getting congressional approval. These Supreme Court decisions striking down unilateral White House lawmaking were correct, and they are based on a correct earlier precedent that the Food and Drug Administration cannot regulate cigarette use on the ground that nicotine is a drug.\n\nThese decisions all reflect the commonsense idea that there are some matters that are just so important that Congress must decide them. There is a reason why Article I, which addresses congressional power, is so much longer than is Article II, which addresses presidential power. The Framers thought and wanted for all of the truly big policy choices to be made by Congress subject to a presidential veto.\n\nWhile it is true that presidents have broad emergency powers, especially in time of war, there are nonetheless limits even to that power, as President Truman found out when the Supreme Court held that he could not on his own nationalize the steel industry to avert a strike during the Korean War. Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. v. Sawyer , 343 U.S. 579 (1952). Justice Robert Jackson in that case wrote that the President's powers to deal with foreign powers emergencies are at their weakest when Congress has delegated to the President a power in one context, but not in another. Here, Congress has delegated to the President the power to impose sanctions on Russia and Iran for real foreign policy reasons, but it has not delegated the power to impose tariffs because of the erosion of our manufacturing base. The grant of power in the one instance makes quite telling the lack of a grant of power in this instance. Notwithstanding my agreement with President Trump on many matters, the tariffs/taxes he just announced are in my opinion unlawful.\n\nThe New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA) has just filed a federal lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of President Trump's new tariffs, Emily Ley Paper, Inc v. Trump (N.D. Fla.), on behalf of plaintiffs who import goods from China and are directly harmed by the unlawful tariff/taxes. The District Court should enter an immediate nationwide injunction suspending the Trump tariffs, and the Supreme Court should hold those tariffs/taxes to be unconstitutional as soon as possible.\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Trump's Longtime Obsession With Trade Deficits Suggests His Tariffs Won't End Soon\n\nTariffs\n\nJacob Sullum | 4.4.2025 5:35 PM\n\nThe \"reciprocal\" tariffs that President Donald Trump announced this week are based on a flagrant fallacy : the idea that there is something inherently suspicious about trade deficits. Unlike many of the positions that Trump has adopted as a politician, this one seems heartfelt and long predates his presidential campaigns. His comments on the subject during the last four decades reflect an unshakable belief that international trade is \"fair\" only when the dollar value of imports from any given country happens to match the dollar value of U.S. exports to that country.\n\nTrump's long history of economic illiteracy suggests he is determined to pursue this trade war, which features import taxes that are much steeper and far broader than the ones he imposed during his first term, no matter how much pain it inflicts on American consumers and businesses. If there is any cause for hope on that score, it is Trump's similarly long-standing eagerness to look like a winner by making shrewd deals. The tension between those two instincts explains why Trump contradicts himself by presenting his tariffs as both a short-term bargaining tactic and a long-term strategy for raising revenue and boosting the U.S. economy.\n\nWhen Trump published his first book, The Art of the Deal , in 1987, he saw Japan as America's main economic nemesis. \"For decades now,\" he complained, \"they have become wealthier in large measure by screwing the United States with a self-serving trade policy that our political leaders have never been able to fully understand or counteract.\" Although China has replaced Japan as the primary threat, Trump still believes that other countries \"become wealthier\" by \"screwing the United States,\" the grievance at the heart of his new tariffs.\n\n\"I believe very strongly in tariffs,\" Trump said in a TV interview two years later, urging a 15 percent to 20 percent tax on imports from Japan. Trump also cited West Germany, Saudi Arabia, and South Korea as countries with unfair trade practices. \"America is being ripped off,\" he said. \"We're a debtor nation, and we have to tax, we have to tariff, we have to protect this country.\"\n\nEleven years later in The America We Deserve , Trump explained the logic underlying that conviction. \"You only have to look at our trade deficit to see that we are being taken to the cleaners by our trading partners,\" he wrote. \"We've fallen into the habit of mistaking the easy availability of cheap, sweatshop-produced product for solid and sustainable economic stability. America has been ripped off by virtually every country we do business with.\"\n\nVoluntary economic exchanges, whether or not they cross borders, manifestly benefit both parties; otherwise, they would not happen. But as Trump sees it, trade is a zero-sum game in which the rules are rigged against the United States.\n\nAlthough Trump presented trade deficits as conclusive evidence of chicanery in The America We Deserve , he did not offer tariffs as a solution. The word does not even appear in the book-a striking omission given his 1989 comments and his subsequent enthusiasm for taxing imports. Trump would later describe himself as \"Tariff Man\" and declare that \"tariffs are the greatest thing ever invented.\" But in his 2000 book, Trump said the best way to reduce \"our trade deficit\" was \"tougher negotiations, not protectionist walls around America.\"\n\nThose negotiations, Trump said, would aim to eliminate trade barriers erected by foreign governments. \"We need to ensure that foreign markets in Japan and France and Germany and Saudi Arabia are as open to our products as our country is to theirs,\" he wrote. \"Our long-term interests require that we cut better deals with our world trading partners....We need to renegotiate fair trade agreements.\"\n\nAs Trump saw it, this was his forté as a consummate dealmaker. \"I would put the right people in charge of negotiation and would get involved myself,\" he said. \"If President Trump does the negotiating, we'll get a better deal for American workers and their families, and our economy will not be as vulnerable to global pressures as it is today. Watch our trade deficit dwindle.\"\n\nIf he were president, Trump said, \"I would take personal charge of negotiations with the Japanese, the French, the Germans, and the Saudis. Our trading partners would have to sit across the table from Donald Trump, and I guarantee you the rip-off of the United States would end.\"\n\nTrump did mention tariffs in his 2011 book Time to Get Tough . \"Either China plays by the rules or we slap tariffs on Chinese goods,\" he wrote. \"End of story.\" As evidence that China was not playing by the rules, he cited its trade surplus, which to his mind meant \"they are laughing at us.\"\n\nTrump complained about \"China's currency manipulation and other unfair trade practices,\" including inadequate protection for intellectual property. But his beef was not limited to specific policies. \"Right now, we are running a massive $300 billion trade deficit with China,\" he said. \"That means every year China is making almost $300 billion off the United States.\" Since Trump refused to acknowledge the value that Americans got in exchange for that money, he saw that situation as intolerable.\n\nTo back up that view, Trump cited Peter Navarro, a longtime proponent of \"economic nationalism\" who would later become his main trade adviser. \"Peter Navarro points out that our trade deficit is costing us roughly 1 percent of GDP growth each year, which is a loss of almost 1 million jobs annually,\" Trump wrote. Even in the absence of identifiable \"unfair trade practices,\" in other words, a gap between exports and imports is economically damaging.\n\n\"I'm for free and fair trade,\" Trump wrote. \"Open markets are the ideal, but if one guy is cheating the whole time, how is that free trade?...Free trade requires having fair rules that apply to everyone....Unfair trade is not free trade.\" But Trump's definition of fairness always came back to trade balances. As long as Chinese exports to the United States exceeded U.S. exports to China, he thought, China clearly was not playing fair. Or as Trump put it when he imposed tariffs on Chinese goods during his first term, \"our trade imbalance is just not acceptable.\"\n\nThe belief that trade deficits must reflect \"cheating\" is the explicit premise of the calculations underlying Trump's \"reciprocal\" tariffs. In setting those rates, a White House official told the New York Post this week, the administration assumed that \"the trade deficit that we have with any given country is the sum of all unfair trade practices, the sum of all cheating.\"\n\nTrump's 2015 campaign book Great Again (originally titled Crippled America ) featured more in the same vein. \"Our trade deficit has been a dangerous drag on our economy,\" he averred. \"We've seen the Chinese taking tremendous advantage of our trade policies.\" He said America needed \"a fair balance of trade,\" which required \"better trade agreements.\"\n\nDuring his first term, Trump was still claiming to favor free trade in theory even while rejecting it in practice. \"I believe strongly in free trade, but it also has to be fair trade,\" he said in his first address to Congress. \"It's been a long time since we had fair trade.\" That much was obvious, he thought, given that \"our trade deficit in goods with the world last year was nearly $800 billion.\"\n\nIn America, Trump told the U.N. General Assembly in 2017, \"we seek stronger ties of business and trade with all nations of good will, but this trade must be fair and it must be reciprocal.\" He hit the same theme in a 2018 speech to the World Economic Forum: \"We cannot have free and open trade if some countries exploit the system at the expense of others. We support free trade, but it needs to be fair and reciprocal.\" He added that \"the United States is prepared to negotiate mutually beneficial, bilateral trade agreements with all countries.\" Speaking to the Veterans of Foreign Wars later that year, Trump clarified that he wanted \"fair trade deals, not stupid trade deals.\"\n\nWhat does Trump mean by \"fair trade\"? In Great Again , he described Israel as \"our best ally\" and \"a fair-trading partner.\" The Israeli government recently made its trade policy even fairer by eliminating all of its remaining tariffs on imports from the United States. But none of that stopped Trump from announcing a 17 percent tariff on all Israeli imports this week. As with his other \"reciprocal\" tariffs, the rate is based on the size of Israel's trade surplus with the United States. So according to Trump, trade can be \"unfair\" even when it's fair.\n\nIn pursuit of \"fair trade\" during his first term, Trump imposed various tariffs, withdrew from the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and renegotiated the North American Free Trade Agreement (now the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement). How did that work out? The overall U.S. trade deficit (including services as well as goods) rose from $503 billion in 2016 to $626 billion during his last year in office. So even measured by the standard that Trump prefers, his trade policies were a failure, leaving aside the costs they imposed on American businesses and consumers.\n\nUnfazed by that record, Trump is going bigger-a lot bigger. While Trump's first-term import taxes \"roughly doubled the [average] tariff rate, to around 3 percent,\" University of Michigan economist Justin Wolfers notes , \"Trump's latest round pushes our current rate to around 15 times its 2016 level\"-\"higher than the infamous Smoot-Hawley tariffs,\" which aggravated the Great Depression.\n\nFor Americans concerned about the impact this new, much bigger trade war will have on their household budgets and investments , the question is which Trump will prevail: the one who sees tariffs as a boon to the economy and a reliable source of easy revenue or the one who sees them as a bargaining tool that can be used to extract concessions from other countries, such as the elimination of trade barriers or assistance in border control and the war on drugs . Does Trump want to strike a deal, or is he determined to see this through in the hope that tariffs will ultimately boost domestic production and manufacturing jobs?\n\n\"I think we're going to wait and see how this plays out,\" Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said when asked whether the new tariffs will be permanent. Conservative journalist Tim Carney thought that was telling: \"This is key. The tariffs cannot cultivate domestic manufacturing, because they were made to be contingent, temporary, negotiable-because for our Quid Pro Quo President, everything is always on the table.\"\n\nStill, given Trump's obsession with trade deficits, it is hard to imagine what sort of deal would satisfy him. If trade is \"fair and reciprocal\" only when imports equal exports, there is not much that a country like Israel can do to address Trump's grievance, short of blocking mutually beneficial trade. But if Trump is willing to declare victory without achieving his avowed goals (as he did during his first term), this trade war could end sooner than his rhetoric suggests. We have to hope that Trump's vanity prevails over his principles.\n\n[This post has been updated with Trump's 1989 comments on tariffs.]\n\nStart your day with Reason .

Tuccille | 4.7.2025 7:00 AM\n\nPresident Donald Trump's justifications for tariffs keep shifting-one moment they're to cut the flow of illegal drugs and immigrants , the next, they're to bolster American businesses and jobs . But the argument that seems to resonate most with the public is that they will result in a stronger and more competitive U.S. economy. Economists aren't convinced , to put it mildly. The fact is that American government is often the biggest impediment to the workers and employers that politicians claim to be helping.\n\n\"Large and persistent annual U.S. goods trade deficits have led to the hollowing out of our manufacturing base [and] resulted in a lack of incentive to increase advanced domestic manufacturing capacity,\" Trump argued in an April 2 executive order imposing stiff tariffs on most of the planet. \"President Trump is working to level the playing field for American businesses and workers by confronting the unfair tariff disparities and non-tariff barriers imposed by other countries.\"\n\nYou are reading The Rattler from J.D. Tuccille and Reason . Get more of J.D.'s commentary on government overreach and threats to everyday liberty.\n\nΔ\n\nBut what if the most insurmountable barriers for domestic businesses and the jobs they create come not from foreign governments but from homegrown regulators trying to mold the economy into their preferred form? In fact, entrepreneurs and executives at established firms complain bitterly about the costs of pleasing elected officials and government employees who create red tape instead of prosperity.\n\n\"Considering all federal regulations, all sectors of the U.S. economy and all firm sizes, federal regulations cost an estimated $12,800 per employee per year in 2022 (in 2023 dollars). Small firms with fewer than 50 employees incur regulatory costs of $14,700 per employee per year - 20% greater than the cost per employee in large firms ($12,200),\" according to a 2023 study commissioned by the National Association of Manufacturers (NAM) as a continuation of earlier work by the authors for the U.S. Small Business Administration's Office of Advocacy.\n\nThat's bad enough. But if you're concerned about domestic manufacturing, you should know that the situation is even tougher for companies that make things: \"The regulatory cost disadvantage confronting small firms is amplified greatly in the manufacturing sector, with small manufacturing firms bearing more than double the cost of large manufacturing firms, or $50,100 versus $24,800 per employee.\"\n\nFor all firms, economic regulations were the most burdensome-followed by environmental regulations, then tax compliance, and occupational safety and health and homeland security (OSHHS) rules. For firms with fewer than 50 employees, environmental regulations had the greatest costs.\n\nIn the manufacturing sector, environmental rules imposed the greatest expense for firms of all sizes (over 80 percent of the total for firms with fewer than 50 employees), followed by economic rules, OSHHS, and then tax compliance.\n\n\"Federal and state requirements establish mandates for every element of the manufacturing process: the employees, machinery, methods, inputs and waste,\" according to a separate 2017 NAM report.\n\nAmerican companies are strangling in red tape imposed by American government. Unsurprisingly, small businesses in particular say that heavy regulation is a killer.\n\n\"The latest Small Business Index survey finds that 51% of small businesses say navigating regulatory compliance requirements is negatively impacting their growth,\" the U.S. Chamber of Commerce revealed in December 2024. \"Almost as many (47%) say their business spends too much time fulfilling regulatory compliance requirements.\"\n\nThe percentage of small businesses saying they spend too much time on regulatory compliance rises to 51 percent of manufacturers-and 57 percent for professional services.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn't a new barrier to creating and growing successful companies. In 2018, Gallup found that among small businesses, \"more owners mention issues relating to government policies and regulations (24%) than any other\" challenge.\n\nIn 2011, \"small-business owners in the United States are most likely to say complying with government regulations (22%) is the most important problem facing them today,\" also according to Gallup.\n\nGiven governments' tendency to intrude ever more deeply into human life and to find new justifications for bureaucrats' salaries, it should be no surprise that regulatory costs rise year after year.\n\n\"Our research shows that regulatory compliance costs of US businesses have grown by about 1 percent each year from 2002 to 2014 in real terms,\" Francesco Trebbi, Miao Ben Zhang, and Michael Simkovic wrote in a 2024 Cato Institute research brief.\n\nOne percent per year in growing compliance costs may not sound like a lot, but that compounds over time into an increasingly more oppressive tangle of red tape that firms must deal with. That hampers large firms, frustrates mid-size ones, and keeps many small businesses from ever getting off the ground.\n\nBefore starting a trade war with the rest of the planet, the Trump administration should strongly consider getting the U.S. government out of the way of American businesses so they can build, innovate, employ, and compete with the foreign firms that so worry U.S. politicians.\n\nThere are encouraging signs the Trump administration is friendly to that goal. The first Trump administration left office after \"adding a net total of $40.4 billion in regulatory costs,\" which was less than 10 percent of the net burden imposed by the previous Obama administration, according to the American Action Forum. \"When removing independent agencies, the Trump Administration actually achieved net regulatory savings of nearly $1 billion over its term.\"\n\nThat is, Trump at least slowed the regulatory state and may have slightly reduced its burden.\n\nLast month, with Trump back in office, the Treasury Department dropped enforcement of burdensome \"beneficial ownership\" reporting rules that were causing confusion and concern for small businesses.\n\n\"NFIB has been steadfast since the beginning that this onerous requirement is a massive intrusion into small businesses' privacy and creates an unprecedented new government database on Americans,\" responded National Federation of Independent Business President Brad Close. \"We agree with President Trump that requirements from the Corporate Transparency Act are 'outrageous and invasive.'\"\n\nFor his second term, President Trump has signaled that deregulation is priority. A January 31 executive order requires that \"for each new regulation issued, at least 10 prior regulations be identified for elimination\" as part of an effort \"to significantly reduce the private expenditures required to comply with Federal regulations.\"\n\nDeregulation is where the Trump administration should focus its efforts, not tariffs. Once freed of regulatory deadweight, Americans will be in a much better position to compete with the world.\n\nThe Rattler is a weekly newsletter from J.D. Tuccille.

      "text": "Pardoning Corporations (Apropos President Trump's Pardon of BitMEX)\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nPardons\n\nEugene Volokh | 4.2.2025 1:45 PM\n\nThe Hill (Kimberly Wehle) reported yesterday:\n\nOn Friday, Trump issued full and unconditional pardons to four individuals and a related cryptocurrency exchange, BitMEX.\n\nBitMEX solicits and takes orders for trades in derivatives tied to the value of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin. Last summer, BitMEX entered a guilty plea in a Manhattan federal court for violating the Bank Secrecy Act for having operated without a legitimate anti-money laundering program. Prior to August 2020, customers could register to trade with BitMEX anonymously, providing only verified email addresses.\n\nAs it happens, there's a forthcoming Comment by Brandon Stras in the University of Chicago Law Review on \"Pardoning Corporations.\" The Abstract:\n\nThough the Pardon Clause could be interpreted to include or exclude corporate offenses, overlooked history suggests the broader interpretation is the more plausible one. The Clause codified a power that had existed for centuries in England. And corporations were often pardoned at common law-including the Massachusetts Bay Company. This tradition lasted for hundreds of years, and it is the backdrop against which the Framers drafted the Pardon Clause. Even following the Founding, people continued to understand that the pardon power stretched to corporations. Since that time, however, institutional memory has faded.\n\nThe President could condition forgiveness on corporate compliance programs or on donations to his political campaign. He could offer pardons to foreign companies to sweeten relations with other countries. He could effectively abolish corporate criminal liability during his terms, at least at the federal level, even for prosecutions initiated by independent agencies. He could pardon his own companies to protect them from prosecution. Or he might even pardon companies that bribed him. Given the sweeping pardon power in Article II, all these decisions fall within the President's discretion. He does not even need to wait for a company to apply.\n\nSome of these consequences are startling, but Congress can limit the pardon power's effects in two ways. First, Congress can refuse to appropriate refunds of pardoned fines. At the time of writing, Congress has not appropriated such refunds for individuals or companies. That decision denies people reprieve from the most common, and often most consequential, punishments imposed on companies. Second, Congress can repeal statutes that impose corporate criminal liability and replace them with unpardonable civil infractions, depriving the President of offenses to pardon.\n\nSome state constitutions might also include a power to pardon companies. Though this account is more tentative, some attorneys could be more effective advocates if they encouraged their corporate clients to apply for pardons. Federal juries convict around 100 companies per year; states impose the rest of the corporate criminal liability. In most states, there is little authority one way or the other, which creates opportunities for good lawyering. This is important because, even if the President never pardons a company again, some state governments might consider doing so. Alaska's Governor already did, and that pardon is unlikely to be alone forever.\n\nHere's a bit about the pre-Revolutionary history of pardons of corporations in England and the American Colonies:\n\nThe story begins in 1461. As King Edward IV prepared to take the throne, he believed that his predecessors were illegitimate. Still, few had the appetite to govern as if their reigns did not happen. So Parliament ratified previous executive acts. Included were pardons to \"to any Body or Persons Corporate .\" Going forward, such pardons had \"Force\" as if \"granted by any King in this Realm lawfully reigning.\" Parliament would write general pardons with similar language for the next two hundred years.\n\nGeneral pardons were an important political tool. They pardoned anyone, or anything, that could have committed a list of crimes. With general pardons, kings could \"present themselves as merciful despite an increasingly severe set of laws.\" The broader public understood general pardons as tokens of goodwill from the Crown and \"elements of festivity\" during celebratory times. And \"the political and religious elite\" extracted general pardons as a reward \"for various forms of cooperation\" with the King.\n\nTake King Charles II, who had to secure support of the \"governing elite\" after Oliver Cromwell's reign and the English Civil War. Charles II promised that, if he became King, he would offer a general pardon.  As King, he kept that promise, and Parliament enacted the Oblivion Act of 1660. The Oblivion Act made the King's pardon \"good and effectual in the law\" to all his subjects and \"Bodyes Corporate .\" It excluded no \"Bodyes in any manner of wise corporated,\" listing \"Citties Burroughs Shires Ridings Hundreds Lathes Rapes Wappentakes Townes Villages Hamlets and Tythings.\" Notice the general terms. If any of the entities had committed offenses, they were pardoned.\n\nCities might feel like an odd fit for the modern pardon power. Today, juries vote to convict companies of crimes, yet \"would never dream of punishing a city.\" At the time, though, there was no legal distinction between municipalities and for-profit companies. Both were corporations. Some of that came down to process. All corporations were born the same ways. They might have pursued different goals, but the law treated them similarly. \"In the eye of the law a corporation was a corporation-that was all there was to it.\"\n\nAmerica inherited corporate law from the English. Even at the Founding, for-profit companies were rare. Corporate law was still \"mostly a matter of municipalities, charities, and churches.\" These entities are the best analogies available. Given that the Founding generation would not have distinguished municipalities from for-profit companies, pardons of the former clarify whether that generation would have accepted pardons of the latter....\n\nBack to the reign of King Charles II. The next relevant event was twenty years later in his reign. The King was less popular than he had previously been. To consolidate control, he threatened to seize municipal corporations from their officials. His \"aim was to control the personnel and therefore the government of the borough and city corporations.\" With a grip on local government, he could rig \"the election of Members of Parliament\" and direct national policy.\n\nLondon was the most important city to control. And it had defied the King's orders by illegally taxing a market that was supposed to be free and circulating seditious petitions. Though city officials committed the crimes, the Crown saw an opportunity and issued a writ to seize the city itself.\n\nMost cities would have buckled under the threat. \"Out of over 240 boroughs and other corporations\" threatened with seizure \"between 1680 and October 1688, only London defended its case up to final judgement.\" So began The City of London Case .\n\nAt trial, London argued that the case had \"no defendant\" because a corporation could not \"sue and be sued.\" Nor could a city be punished. The city asked, \"will the political body be suspended by its neck?\" Or must the citizens \"hang up the Common Seal?\" London instructed the court to prosecute city citizens, who were potentially \"liable in their several private capabilities.\" ...\n\nThe court inferred from the Oblivion Act of 1660 that cities could commit crimes. If \"bodies politic\" can \"be pardoned,\" they must be able to commit crimes. Exhibit A was \"the general article of pardon,\" the Oblivion Act of 1660, under which \"corporations\" had been \"pardoned all crimes and offenses.\" That pardon would be pointless if cities had not already committed offenses. This opinion is the first time a court acknowledged the pardon of a corporation. It shows that English courts accepted that use of the pardon power as part of their law.\n\nLondon took the opinion at its word and requested clemency. The King conditionally pardoned London: either permit the Crown to veto some of London's elected officials, or lose the charter. Under this deal, the King could effectively control the city without taking its charter. After debate, London's government ultimately refused the to accept the pardon. With the King's conditions refused, London lost its charter. In short order, \"the majority of the boroughs and cities in England and Wales hastily capitulated and were induced to surrender theirs.\" London's experience confirmed that the King could, in fact, pardon corporations. It was no longer a hypothetical listed in acts of Parliament. ...\n\nBack in North America, the Massachusetts Bay Company had its own problems. In the 1630s, the Crown sued the company for \"[il]legally transferr[ing]\" its government to the people inhabiting the colony. The lawsuit ended with a \"default judgment ordering the charter to be 'Seized into the King's hands.'\" But the colony never handed over its charter. Massachusetts evaded enforcement long enough for the Oblivion Act of 1660 to pardon its crimes, along with all other corporations.\n\nTo make that fact clear, Parliament reaffirmed one year later that \"no Charter of any Corporation\" could be seized for \"any act or thing done\" before Parliament's first day. Not only were corporations forgiven, but the King also could not seize them for their offenses. Based on these laws, the colony believed it had been pardoned. So Massachusetts asked the King whether he had intended to forgive it, and King Charles II \"responded affirmatively, asking in return only that the company stop hanging Quakers.\" ...\n\nNot much later, American treatises noted that the pardon power applies to corporations. Joseph K. Angell and Samuel Ames wrote that the King could \"pardon the default\" of a \"corporation.\" Theirs was \"the first American legal treatise dedicated to corporate law\" and \"the standard work on corporate law\" when it was published. And Joel Prentiss Bishop wrote that \"a county,\" even though it is not \"deemed a private person\" like \"a private corporation,\" can have penalties \"divested by the executive pardon\" in an \"influential\" criminal law treatise, taking it for granted that a private corporation could be pardoned....\n\nAnd here's more on the one post-Revolutionary pardon the author uncovered:\n\nWhitewater [Engineering Company] convicted in Alaska for the criminally negligent homicide of Gary Stone. Then it applied for a pardon, and state politicians got the ball rolling. One politician wrote to Governor Murkowski that the criminal penalties were \"excessive\" for \"a tragic accident\" and \"[i]f ever compassion and common sense should prevail, this is such a case.  Another warned that the conviction sends a \"chilling message\" to companies across the state.  Neither told the Governor that the company owed the state around $250,000.\n\nThe Governor pardoned Whitewater with just four days remaining in his term. Though the pardon was unpopular, no one challenged its constitutionality. Everyone seemed to think Alaska law empowered the Governor to make this kind of decision. ...\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "Can A Federal Court Issue Mandamus Against The President?\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nJosh Blackman | 4.7.2025 5:22 PM\n\nToday, the En Banc D.C. Circuit vacated the panel ruling finding that President Trump's removal of NLRB members was lawful. Judges Henderson, Katsas, Rao, and Walker dissented from the en banc order.\n\nJudge Rao's dissent, which was joined by the three other dissenters, argues forcefully that the federal courts lack an equitable cause of action to order the reinstatement of the NLRB members. Judge Katsas made these points in his Bessent dissent.\n\nJudge Rao further responds to Judge Millett's panel opinion, which argued that the court could grant a writ of mandamus against the President. Judge Rao concludes that mandamus wold not be proper against the President:\n\nJudge Millett argued in dissent that mandamus could issue against the President because he \"violated a non-discretionary statutory duty by firing Harris and Wilcox without relevant justification.\" See Harris, 2025 WL 980278, at *45 (Millett, J., dissenting). It is extremely doubtful that mandamus could issue against the President. While this court has at times claimed authority to issue writs of mandamus against the President, I am aware of no case in which we have taken this extraordinary step. To the contrary, we have repeatedly declined to issue the writ \"in order to show the utmost respect to the office of the Presidency and to avoid ... any clash between the judicial and executive branches of the Government.\" Nat'l Treasury Emps. Union v. Nixon, 492 F.2d 587, 616 (D.C. Cir. 1974); see also Nat'l Wildlife Fed'n v. United States, 626 F.2d 917, 928 (D.C. Cir. 1980) (declining to issue mandamus against the President). . . .\n\nFurthermore, it is difficult to see how mandamus to reinstate officers removed by the President could ever be appropriate. \"Although the remedy by mandamus is at law, its allowance is controlled by equitable principles, and it may be refused for reasons comparable to those\" governing a court of equity. United States ex rel. Greathouse v. Dern, 289 U.S. 352, 359 (1933) (cleaned up). For this court to order the performance of executive acts vested exclusively in the President would \"at best create[] an unseemly appearance of constitutional tension and at worst risk[] a violation of the constitutional separation of powers.\" Swan, 100 F.3d at 978; see also Johnson, 71 U.S. at 499 (rebuffing the idea of ordering the President to perform executive acts as \"an absurd and excessive extravagance\") (cleaned up). These constitutional concerns render mandamus-an extraordinary writ-wholly inappropriate in these removal cases.\n\nIf only William Marbury had asked the federal trial court in the District Court for mandamus against President Jefferson! I'm sure that would have gone over well.\n\nJudge Rao has to be correct on this point. Moreover, under Mississippi v. Johnson , I don't think the Court could issue any type of injunction against the President concerning reinstatement. The D.C. Circuit seems to rely on the \"fiction\" that an injunction could run against other officers in the executive branch. But this fiction simply doesn't work.\n\nI remain concerned that the Supreme Court will punt on the merits question and simply hold that the district court's remedy was improper. That would leave open the legal question about whether the removals were valid. That may seem like a way to duck the question, but it would create even more chaos down the road. Stop kicking the can down the road.\n\nJudge Henderson's pithy dissent argues that the Supreme Court should decide this issue sooner rather than later:\n\nWe do the parties (especially a functioning executive branch) no favors by unnecessarily delaying Supreme Court review of this significant and surprisingly controversial aspect of Article II authority. Only the Supreme Court can decide the dispute and, in my opinion, the sooner, the better.\n\nI agree. The Court has a rendezvous with Humphrey .\n\nStart your day with Reason .

      "text": "President Trump Targets Humphrey's Executor Directly\n\nMostly law professors | Sometimes contrarian | Often libertarian | Always independent\n\nAppointments Clause\n\nJonathan H. Adler | 3.19.2025 2:47 PM\n\nThe New York Times reports that President Trump has acted to remove two Democratic commissioners from the Federal Trade Commission.\n\nPresident Trump fired the two Democratic members of the Federal Trade Commission on Tuesday, a rejection of the corporate regulator's traditional independence that may clear the way for the administration's agenda.\n\nThe White House told the Democrats, Rebecca Kelly Slaughter and Alvaro Bedoya, that the president was terminating their roles, according to statements from the pair. The F.T.C., which enforces consumer protection and antitrust laws, typically has five members, with the president's party holding three seats and the opposing party two. . . .\n\n\"I am writing to inform you that you have been removed from the Federal Trade Commission, effective immediately,\" said a letter sent to one of the commissioners, which was reviewed by The New York Times. \"Your continued service on the F.T.C. is inconsistent with my administration's priorities.\"\n\nThis action , even more than the removal of National Labor Relations Board Chair Gwynne Wilcox , targets Humphrey's Executor v. United States as that case concerned the constitutionality of limits on the removal of FTC commissioners. As least one of the removed FTC commissioners has stated his plans to sue.\n\nThe removals leave the FTC with two sitting commissioners. Assuming that the President's action is upheld (either by overturning Humphrey's or distinguishing on the grounds that the FTC today exercises more core executive power than it did in the 1930s), this will free up the FTC to act in line with the President's policy priorities.\n\nWith four commissioners, the FTC was potentially deadlocked and was unlikely to reverse Biden Administration policies or adopt new initiatives and measures ought by Chair Andrew Ferguson. With only two commissioners of the same party, however, that is no longer a problem. Commissioner Holyoak is likely to agree with Chair Ferguson on most issues.\n\nBut can the FTC act with only two commissioners? Is that a quorum? Apparently it is under existing FTC regulations. 16 CFR § 24.14 provides :\n\n(b) A majority of the members of the Commission in office and not recused from participating in a matter (by virtue of 18 U.S.C. 208 or otherwise) constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business in that matter.\n\n[Note: As originally posted, I had accidentally cited and quoted the SEC's quorum regulation instead of the FTC's regulation.

      "text": "Donald Trump, Franklin Roosevelt and the Allure of Permanent Power\n\nWhy the president's talk about a third term should be treated as a credible threat.\n\nAudio versions are only available to subscribers of The Dispatch. Join Today ! to listen to this post.\n\n\"You know, FDR. 16 years. Almost 16 years. He was four-term. I don't know, are we going to be considered three-term or two-term? You tell me.\"\n\n- Then-candidate Donald Trump speaking to the National Rifle Association, May 2024.\n\nFour years ago at about this moment, in the still-early days of his administration, Joe Biden was taking a fateful ego trip.\n\nThe historian Jon Meacham, an occasional adviser and speechwriter to Biden, had organized a late-March gathering at the White House of other popular historians of a Democratic bent, including Doris Kearns Goodwin, Michael Beschloss, Michael Eric Dyson, Annette Gordon-Reed, and Walter Isaacson.\n\nThe money quote from Biden, as reported by Axios :  \"I'm no FDR, but ... \"\n\nBut nothing. Biden, like the president he served, Barack Obama, was being tempted with the seeming possibility of being the new Franklin Roosevelt , the most important and influential Democrat in the past century and a half. Obama managed a signature policy initiative and a solid reelection to a second term, but he didn't get close to the father of the New Deal.\n\nBiden, though, would get pushed out his own bid for a second term by his fellow Democrats. He would leave office with a job-approval rating in the 30s and blamed by both parties for the sorry state of affairs that led to the return of Donald Trump, which at the time of Biden's session with the scribes in March 2021 would have been unimaginable to most-like hearing in 1933 that Herbert Hoover would win in 1936.\n\nThe 46th president was obviously enamored with the idea of  \" transforming the country in important ways in a short time \"-playing with ideas like abolishing the Senate filibuster and packing the Supreme Court-as well as the idea, Heaven help us, that he was \"cool.\" Even cooler than Obama .\n\nBiden and Obama were hardly the first Democratic presidents to be tempted or tortured by the comparison to Roosevelt. While Bill Clinton was always more interested in the Kennedy mystique- a young president, generational change , and sex, lots of sex-and Jimmy Carter was decidedly humble in his ambitions, Lyndon Johnson carried FDR's legacy around like a monkey on his back. Everything Johnson did in his Great Society misadventure was haunted by comparisons to the New Deal .\n\nWhat none of Roosevelt's would-be imitators among his Democratic heirs ever seriously considered, though, was making a run at the one thing that sets FDR apart from every other president: defying George Washington's example and serving more than two terms.\n\nThe shorthand from your high school history class was probably that with war already raging in Europe in 1940, Roosevelt was drafted to run for an unprecedented third term. But the \"draft\" was, of course, a campaign orchestrated by the incumbent and his team. They dumped the sitting vice president, John Nance Garner, who disapproved of the idea as monarchical, and replaced him with Henry Wallace, a kook who as the secretary of agriculture had become a favorite of the hardline progressives.\n\nBut the real swindle happened at the 1940 convention when a statement from Roosevelt was read from the dais. His message to the delegates was that he \"never had, and has not today, any desire or purpose to continue in the office of president\" and that \"all of the delegates in this convention are free to vote for any candidate.\" Which was, of course, hogwash. After stoking rumors and speculation that he would run, Roosevelt seemed to be pulling the rug out from under his supporters. And then, on cue, a crew in the basement of the convention hall in employ of Roosevelt's ally, Chicago Mayor Ed Kelly, cranked up a loudspeaker to fill the hall with piped-in chants of, \"We want Roosevelt. \"\n\nA dirty trick if ever there was one. But if you're an FDR admirer, you might call it a little old-fashioned rascality in service of keeping the world safe for democracy. If Roosevelt had not rigged the convention, would the Allies have even won the war? Maybe you think that it was a moment in history so perilous and Roosevelt a man so remarkable that Washington's example had to be pushed aside for the sake of the nation.\n\nIf you did, you'd sound a lot like Trump's message guru, Steve Bannon. \"I'm a firm believer that President Trump will run and win again in 2028, so I've already endorsed President Trump,\" he said in a recent interview . \"A man like this comes along once every century, if we're lucky. We've got him now.\"\n\nWell, now.\n\nBut what about the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution? In 1951, Democrats made the tacit admission that Roosevelt had stayed too long, and a number of them joined with Republicans to put a hard cap on presidential terms.\n\nThe Amendment says : \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice, and no person who has held the office of President, or acted as President, for more than two years of a term to which some other person was elected President shall be elected to the office of the President more than once.\"\n\nTrump's allies were talking about changing that before he had finished the first week of his second term. \"People are already talking about changing the 22nd Amendment so he can serve a third term,\" Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick offered in January. \"If this pace and success keep up for 4 years, and there is no reason it won't, most Americans really won't want him to leave.\" The same week, the first proposal to change the Constitution in Trump's favor landed in Congress.\n\nLike the Roosevelt men down in the basement with the microphones in 1940, team Trump is busy engineering a groundswell.\n\nThere is a rhetorical conveyor belt on which Trump's ideas, or as Vice President J.D. Vance might say , \"desires,\" are carried out of the shadows of impossibility and into the broad daylight of inevitability. It starts as trolling or a joke, then becomes a bargaining position in service of a real policy issue-the old \"seriously but not literally\" rope-a-dope-and then the last furlong is carried by an incredulous surprise that anyone would be shocked that he's doing exactly what he's been saying all along. From irony to strategy to reality. Greenland is a gag . Greenland is actually about highlighting European security weaknesses . Greenland is deadly serious .\n\nSo it has gone with the idea of a third Trump term.\n\nThe \"joke\" part started as far back as 2020, when Trump told attendees at a campaign rally: \"We are going to win four more years. And then after that, we'll go for another four years.\" Watch how he plays to the crowd, teasing his supporters with the idea of infinite MAGA.\n\nBy the 2024 race, the third term had become a pretty standard part of the Trump schtick. He would tease his supporters and torment his foes with the idea , but then dismiss it as a joke. \"I don't know anything about [the 22nd Amendment]. I mean, you're telling me now that somebody's looking to terminate. I wouldn't be in favor of it. I wouldn't be in favor of a challenge. Not for me. I wouldn't be in favor of it at all,\" Trump told Time in April of 2024 . \"I intend to serve four years and do a great job. And I want to bring our country back. I want to put it back on the right track.\"\n\nAs soon as the election was won, though, Trump was back to dangling, telling House Republicans \" who took it as a joke \" in November: \"I suspect I won't be running again unless you say, 'He's so good we've got to figure something else out.'\" Ha ha?\n\nAs soon as he was back in power, Trump kept pushing the idea, but again, as explicit trolling. \"It will be the greatest honor of my life to serve not once, but twice-or three times or four times,\" Trump said at his post-inauguration rally in Las Vegas in January . \"Headlines for the fake news! No, it will be to serve twice. For the next four years, I will not rest.\"\n\nHe's kidding, and if you think otherwise you're part of the lamestream media.\n\nAnd yet, he persisted. The idea then moved into the essential gaslighting phase, with trying it out on House Republicans again at the same time the amendment resolution was being introduced. \"I think I'm not allowed to run again. ... Am I allowed to run again?\" He even got into specifics, talking about his available campaign funds for another run, then looked at House Speaker Mike Johnson and said , \"Mike, I better not get you involved in that.\"\n\nBecause it would be bad for Johnson or because Trump would need Johnson's help later in getting around the term limit or that Johnson, full of rectitude, might object? Who knows, but if you don't get the hilarious joke about how much fun it is to troll the media and own the libs, you're just being a snowflake, right?\n\nThen we got to the bargaining part, as Trump used the idea of another run as a deflection to a question about whether he would endorse Vance as his successor. Trump, don't you see, is just keeping his options open.\n\nThe president trotted it out twice more soon after, where else but at the National Prayer Breakfast and a Black History Month celebration ? And as Trump pushed the idea, his normie defenders dismissed the anxieties about Trump running again, changing the Constitution, or looking for some legal loophole as preposterous.\n\nRight up until this week, when Trump told NBC News , \"No, no, I'm not joking,\" about the third term. \"There are methods which you could do it, as you know.\"\n\nUlp.\n\nThe press did the same thing with Trump's stubborn refusal to say that he would accept the results of an election he lost. It was a troll. It was a negotiating position. It was an attempted coup. This time, as the conveyor belt started lurching under our feet, most in the media went along for the ride on the third-term talk.\n\nNow, we know that Trump isn't going to be able to amend the Constitution to get a shot at FDR's title as the longest-serving president. He probably couldn't get two-thirds of Senate Republicans for that, let alone the Senate as a whole.\n\nAnd it may be, contra Trump's claim to NBC that he has \"the highest poll numbers of any Republican for the last 100 years,\" that all the talk will come to naught if his popularity continues on its present downward trajectory.  A bad midterm, a recession, more scandals could all render Trump's desires as moot. Plus, he's the oldest person ever elected to the presidency, so maybe he won't even be physically able to run again ( not that it stopped Roosevelt in 1944 ).\n\nBut we ought to at least stick with taking Trump literally and seriously for now. What crisis might befall us that could cause enough panic and instability that people would start talking about the need to keep Trump in power? What legal or extralegal maneuvers might his lieutenants use to make it possible? We know that if Trump had Vance in 2021 instead of Mike Pence as vice president, the effort to steal a second term might have succeeded, or at least thrown the country into a constitutional crisis and the kind of negotiated settlement that resolved the election of 1876 .\n\nAgain, it's not likely. The most likely scenario still has to be that Trump will be a true lame duck after the midterms and finds his power substantially diminished in divided government. But a third term is worth treating as a credible threat. And if it goes nowhere, you know what they'll say: Lighten up, snowflake. He was just kidding.\n\nChris Stirewalt is a contributing writer for The Dispatch, the politics editor for The Hill and NewsNation, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, co-host of the Ink Stained Wretches podcast, and author of Broken News, a book on media and politics.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "Senate Stammers Toward Reining In Trump's Tariffs\n\nBut most Republicans seem to be in his corner.\n\nAudio versions are only available to subscribers of The Dispatch. Join Today ! to listen to this post.\n\nPresident Donald Trump's announcement of tariffs on countries across the globe Wednesday shocked the stock market and roiled Republican senators on Capitol Hill. The duties on imports from practically every nation were a departure from decades of conservative economic orthodoxy, not to mention an unprecedented use of tariff authority by the executive branch.\n\nStill, don't expect too much opposition from congressional Republicans. Though they are wary of the initial effects of the announcement and the impact on business leaders and consumers in their home states, they don't seem to have much of a plan to oppose the sweeping import duties.\n\nTheir first chance to show opposition to the tariffs came hours after the president announced them Wednesday afternoon. Sen. Tim Kaine, a Virginia Democrat, forced a vote on his resolution to repeal an emergency declaration Trump used to impose tariffs on Canada. The president justified his tariffs on our neighbor to the north by pointing to fentanyl coming across the border. Though it did not apply to Wednesday's announcement, the Senate resolution was a first gauge of how uneasy Republicans senators were with Trump's tariff agenda more broadly.\n\nThe measure passed with only four Republicans-Sens. Lisa Murkowski, Susan Collins, Mitch McConnell, and Rand Paul-voting in favor. \"Tariffs are a terrible mistake,\" Paul said in a floor speech Wednesday. \"They don't work. They will lead to higher prices. They are a tax, and they have historically been bad for our economy.\"\n\nHowever, it is unlikely House Republican leadership will take it up.\n\nBut another, stronger sign of GOP wariness emerged Thursday. Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa teamed up with Democratic Sen. Maria Cantwell of Washington on a bill that would require the president to give 48 hours notice to Congress ahead of his imposition of tariffs, and those tariffs would expire after 60 days unless Congress approves them. The bill, called the Trade Review Act of 2025, was an amendment to a section of the Trade Act of 1974 , which granted the president fast-track authority to negotiate trade deals that Congress can either approve or vote down.\n\nThe Constitution gives Congress the authority to levy tariffs, but the legislative branch has gradually delegated that power to the president since the middle of the 20th century through several successive pieces of legislation, including the 1974 Trade Act. Some Republicans senators who spoke to The Dispatch showed a measure of support for clawing back control over trade-but only in the abstract.\n\n\"I think it's time to revisit that, but I don't want to do it in a politically charged environment,\" Sen. Mike Rounds of South Dakota told The Dispatch . \"But I absolutely agree this was set up by the Founding Fathers to be Congress' role, and I think we're way past the point of what the Founding Fathers ever wanted to have happen.\" Asked about the bill from Grassley and Cantwell, he said he had not read it but that he would \"take a hard look at it.\"\n\nSen. Jerry Moran of Kansas also expressed openness to taking back power over trade, but he did not give specifics. \"I'm always for Congress exerting more authority, including on the issue of trade and tariffs.\"\n\nElsewhere, though, other Republican senators have backed the Grassley-Cantwell bill or pushed back on Trump's tariffs. Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina told Punchbowl News that he would likely support the bill but added that his approval was more about regaining legislative authority than taking power from Trump.\n\nSen. Ted Cruz of Texas openly expressed disagreement with the tariffs Thursday on Fox Business.\n\n\"I think it is a mistake to assume that we will have high tariffs in perpetuity. I don't think that would be good economic policy. I am not a fan of tariffs,\" he told host Larry Kudlow. He added that it would be a \"great outcome\" if Trump's announcement leads other countries to lower their tariff rates, with the United States following in turn. A \"bad outcome\" would be if those other countries also raise their tariff rates, he said.\n\nEven with significant Republican support in the Senate for Grassley's bill, it may not get far. GOP leadership in both chambers has offered no opposition to Trump's sweeping actions so far. It is unclear whether Senate Majority Leader John Thune, who said Thursday he was in a \"wait and see\" mode about the announced tariffs, will call a vote on the bill. Speaker of the House Mike Johnson went so far as to include language in the rule for the stopgap spending measure Congress passed last month that stops a member from bringing to the floor a resolution halting Trump's emergency declaration used to impose tariffs on Mexico and Canada.\n\nIn fact, some senators are happy to let the Trump administration take the lead on trade.\n\n\"Given that President Trump has the tool kit and the expertise of someone as capable as Jamieson Greer, who's the trade representative, I would want Jamieson at the tip of the spear, just like I've seen him before,\" Sen. Bill Hagerty of Tennessee told The Dispatch . Hagerty referenced his work with the first Trump administration when he served as ambassador to Japan and Greer was chief of staff to then-U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer.\n\nAt the same time, there are voices ascendant in the GOP who share Trump's fondness for and belief in tariffs. Sen. Josh Hawley of Missouri said Congress should exert more of its authority on tariffs \"only if we're going to raise them further.\"\n\n\"I'd love to raise China's tariff rate further,\" he said, referring to the 54 percent rate Chinese goods entering the U.S. are now subject to. \"I'd tariff the heck out of them. It ought to be 100 percent, if you want my view. It should be, like, impossible to import anything made by the Uyghurs or anything else in China, basically, particularly anything in EV or solar-related, energy-related.\"\n\nA century ago, Republicans were especially supportive of higher tariffs. The namesakes of the Smoot-Hawley Tariff of 1930 , which hiked up tariffs on foreign imports, were Sen. Reed Smoot and Rep. Willis Hawley, both Republicans. Republican President Herbert Hoover then signed it into law. Republicans then became much less enamoured of higher import duties in the decades following World War II, especially under the presidency of Ronald Reagan.\n\nThe Hawley of the 21st century attributed Republicans' more recent friendliness toward tariffs to pressure from voters.\n\n\"In states like mine, they've always wanted protections on our industries,\" he said. \"So, I think Trump represents a, in some sense, return to the norm, and certainly a return to the norm for the Republican Party, historically. But it is a big break with the '90s-era, neo-globalist, neoliberal Republican Party.\"\n\nIn Ohio, freshman Sen. Bernie Moreno defeated incumbent Sherrod Brown in November thanks to a working-class shift toward the GOP under Trump. He had choice words for Republicans who had been skeptical of tariffs in the past.\n\n\"Just the Republicans that gutted our middle class [opposed them],\" he told The Dispatch . \"Just those Republicans, not me.\"\n\nCharles Hilu is a reporter for The Dispatch based in Virginia.

      "text": "Supreme Court Ruling Shows Guns Not a Priority Under Trump 2.0\n\nThe high court upheld a Biden-era ban on 'ghost guns.'\n\nAudio versions are only available to subscribers of The Dispatch. Join Today ! to listen to this post.\n\nAt a speech to National Rifle Association members in February 2024, Donald Trump promised he'd almost immediately roll back all of the gun rules implemented over the previous four years if elected.\n\n\"Every single Biden attack on gun owners and manufacturers will be terminated my very first week back in office,\" Trump told the crowd to cheers .\n\nBut Trump's first week in office came and went without any action on guns . And while he has taken a few steps to undo parts of Biden-era gun policy since then, he has yet to take significant action on any rules imposed by the Bureau of Alcohol, Firearms, Tobacco, and Explosives (ATF) under Biden.\n\nAmong the four rules Biden implemented was the ATF's ban on \"ghost gun\" kits-unserialized, unfinished gun parts sold alongside tools for self-assembly. Gun-rights activists argue the ghost gun rule gives the ATF too much power to determine what is and isn't a gun. They say it infringes on Americans' right to build their own firearms for personal use.\n\nAnd now, the Supreme Court has upheld that ban. In a 7-2 ruling on March 26, the justices found there were at least some ways to enforce the ATF rule against ghost gun sales that are consistent with underlying federal law. They concluded that was enough to give the ban a green light.\n\n\"Yes, perhaps a half hour of work is required before anyone can fire a shot,\" Justice Neil Gorsuch wrote for the majority in Bondi v. VanDerStok . \"But even as sold, the kit comes with all necessary components, and its intended function as instrument of combat is obvious. Really, the kit's name says it all: 'Buy Build Shoot.'\"\n\nThat the Trump administration decided not to intervene demonstrates how it views the issue as a low priority. It's not that nothing could be done, even though the Supreme Court heard oral arguments for the case back in October, before the presidential election. The administration could have asked the Supreme Court to moot the case. It also could have submitted its own ATF rule change before going to the Supreme Court, which would have upped the odds of success.\n\nBut it didn't do any of that, which fits with how it has approached gun policy to this point.\n\nPresident Trump didn't mention gun policy once in his marathon speech to Congress in early March. It was left out of the White House's literal priority list . He didn't issue any gun executive orders in his Day 1 blitz , and the one he has issued since is a plan to make a plan .\n\nThis mirrors the campaign where he left guns out of his record-long RNC acceptance speech and deleted gun policy promises from the party platform .\n\nStill, there has been good news for gun-rights activists.\n\nThe Trump administration eliminated the White House Office of Gun Violence Prevention, which had been created by former President Biden. It deleted the 2024 surgeon general proclamation calling for new gun restrictions. And it reopened sales of military surplus firearms, like the collectible M1 Garand and 1911 pistol, through the Civilian Marksmanship Program.\n\nIt also issued a new rule that looks to establish a new process for restoring gun rights to at least some former convicts. And it announced a civil rights investigation into Los Angeles County 's long processing times and high fees for concealed carry permits.\n\nPerhaps most prominently, the Trump administration fired the ATF's chief counsel a few weeks back and recently hired Robert Leider, a Second Amendment scholar and gun-rights advocate, to replace her. In December, Leider-who is also a law professor at George Mason University- advocated for using the ATF's powers to enact pro-gun reforms . In addition to undoing other rules that haven't yet been considered by the Supreme Court, the ATF could still try to reverse or limit much of what's in the ghost gun rule.\n\nThere's reason to think the Trump administration could eventually follow through on much of what the gun-rights activists want, even if it's not one of their top priorities. Of course, that also means they're likely to lose out whenever their wants conflict with something higher up the list.\n\nThe risk of Trump turning on gun-rights activists remains as well. But that's mostly confined to what he might do in the aftermath of a major mass shooting. He endorsed red-flag laws after the 2018 school shooting in Parkland , Florida, and reportedly considered backing an assault weapons ban in the wake of the El Paso Walmart shooting . He also went through with a ban on bump stocks-which help semiautomatic rifles fire more rapidly-in the wake of the 2017 mass shooting in Las Vegas, but the Supreme Court struck that down last year, with Trump's own Supreme Court appointees joining the majority .\n\nIn the meantime, it's likely gun rights advocates' priorities will take a back seat to everything else the administration is trying to do. That will probably still result in some movement they'll be happy with. But, as the Supreme Court ruling in Bondi v. VanDerStok demonstrates, it may not always end that way.\n\nStephen Gutowski is the founder of The Reload, which focuses on sober, serious firearms reporting and analysis.\n\nYour membership includes the ability to share articles\n                with friends.

      "text": "Fact-Checking Trump's Joint Session of Congress Address\n\nThe president made false claims about polling, government spending, and inflation.\n\nPresident Donald Trump delivered one of his first major speeches of his second administration Tuesday night, addressing a joint session of Congress. The president spoke for 100 minutes , touting his early action on immigration, renaming the Gulf of Mexico, increasing energy production, and other moves. He also made false or misleading claims on several topics.\n\nTrump said early in his address that \"for the first time in modern history, more Americans believe that our country is headed in the right direction than the wrong direction. In fact,\" he added, \"it's an astonishing record: 27-point swing, the most ever.\"\n\nAccording to Real Clear Politics , which averages right direction/wrong track polls, more Americans say the country is on the wrong track than going in the right direction, with a current gap of 9 percentage points. The polls have not shown right-direction sentiments exceeding the number of wrong-track responses since at least January 2009, when RCP started its polling average on the topic. In the entire month of February, only one pollster-Rasmussen Reports- published results showing more Americans saying the U.S. was heading in the right direction than on the wrong track, 48 percent to 47 percent. And Rasmussen's most recent survey, from February 23-27, shows some regression, with only 45 percent saying the country is heading in the right direction compared with 50 percent saying it's on the wrong track. The only 2025 poll included in RCP 's average to show at least 50 percent of respondents selecting \"right direction\" was from Emerson College-in a January 27-28 survey-which showed 52 percent saying the U.S. is headed in the right direction.\n\nTrump's claim about a \"27-point swing\" is correct to the extent that the gap on November 8, 2024-right after the election-was 36.5 percent according to RCP and stands at 9 percent today, though he did not provide a timeframe in his speech. It is a substantial swing, but far from a record. Biden saw a 33.9 percent swing in the RCP average from the time Trump's first presidential term expired to the beginning of March 2021. Even before that, former President Barack Obama saw a bigger swing in his first few months as president. From January 26, 2009-six days after Obama's inauguration and the first day RCP began tracking its right direction/wrong track polling averages-to March 2009, survey respondents swung 26.9 percent toward \"right direction.\"\n\nTrump touted his decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement by claiming it was costing U.S. taxpayers \"trillions of dollars.\" \"I withdrew from the unfair Paris climate accord,\" he said, \"which was costing us trillions of dollars that other countries were not paying.\"\n\nBut the climate agreement has not \"cost\" us trillions of dollars-or anywhere near that amount. Per the text of the Paris Agreement, which the U.S. first signed in April 2016, developed countries \"should continue to take the lead in mobilizing climate finance from a wide variety of sources, instruments and channels, noting the significant role of public funds.\" According to a White House fact sheet put out by the Biden administration, the U.S. spent more than $11 billion in \"international climate financing\" in 2024, up from $1.5 billion annually in 2021.\n\nFormer President Barack Obama in November 2014 pledged to contribute $3 billion annually to the Green Climate Fund, which the Paris Agreement also funds. But by the time Obama left the White House, only $1 billion had made its way to the Green Climate Fund through two separate $500 million payments in 2016 and 2017 . The second payment was issued only days before Trump's first inauguration. Similarly, Biden-who had the U.S. rejoin the Paris Agreement in January 2021-contributed an additional $1 billion to the Green Climate Fund between April and December 2023. These transactions are publicly listed on USAspending.gov, the federal government's online resource for federal spending.\n\nWhen asked for the source of Trump's \"trillions\" figure, a White House spokesman shared with The Dispatch Fact Check an April 2016 report from the conservative Heritage Foundation examining the economic impact the Paris Agreement would have on the U.S. \"Economists have estimated that, by 2035, the Paris Accords would have cost 'nearly 400,000 jobs, a total income loss of more than $20,000 for a family of four, and an aggregate GDP loss of over $2.5 trillion,\" the White House spokesman said, quoting the Heritage report. However, GDP is a measurement of all final goods and services produced in a region. Decreases in GDP are not expenses paid by federal taxpayers, and Heritage's time frame for GDP losses is 10 years into the future.\n\nTrump also claimed that he \"terminated\" the Green New Deal, which he referred to as the \"green new scam,\" and that he \"ended the last administration's insane electric vehicle mandate.\" Trump previously pledged to end both programs in his inaugural address. However, as The Dispatch Fact Check noted at the time , neither of those programs currently exist.\n\nThe only problem is that two policies he promised to repeal-the Green New Deal and an electric vehicle mandate-were never implemented in the first place. While Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York introduced a Green New Deal bill in 2019 -prior to the Biden presidency-it never even made it out of committee.\n\nNor has the federal government imposed an electric vehicle mandate, per se. However, the Biden-led Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in March announced new rules regulating emissions from new cars made between 2027 and 2032. While not requiring consumers and car manufacturers to produce or buy electric vehicles, the Biden administration \"establishe[d] new, more stringent vehicle emissions standards for criteria pollutant and greenhouse gas emissions\" for new cars made after 2027, with the hope that those emission regulations would increase the market share of electric and hybrid vehicles in the automobile industry.\n\nOn his first day back in the White House, Trump issued an executive order \"to eliminate the 'electric vehicle (EV) mandate' and promote true consumer choice.\"\n\nWhile Biden's regulations on gas-powered vehicle emissions-and any other \" government-imposed market distortions \" that encourage American consumers to pursue electric alternatives-might be scrapped under Trump's executive order, there was no \"electric vehicle mandate\" under the Biden administration.\n\nTrump also took a victory lap for ending diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. \"We've ended the tyranny of so-called diversity, equity and inclusion policies all across the entire federal government,\" he said. \"And indeed the private sector and our military.\"\n\nA White House spokesman clarified to The Dispatch Fact Check that Trump was referring to private companies that, on their own initiative, changed their DEI policies after Trump targeted DEI practices in the federal government. \"After President Trump announced his end of DEI in the federal government,\" he said, \"private companies followed suit.\" The spokesman listed Disney, Institutional Shareholder Services, Goldman Sachs, Wells Fargo, Victoria's Secret, State Street, Warner Bros. Discovery, Paramount, Bank of America, BlackRock, Citigroup, Pepsi, Morgan Stanley, Deloitte, Google, Accenture, Amazon, and Target as companies that have scaled back or eliminated their DEI policies since Trump took office. Other companies, including Apple, Microsoft, Ben & Jerry's, Costco, and Delta Air Lines, have stated that they are committed to continuing their diversity efforts.\n\nTrump issued executive orders during his first week in office to end DEI programs in the federal government and the U.S. military . In a separate executive order issued that same week, he claimed that DEI practices violated the nondiscrimination clause of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. That executive order did not order a shutdown of DEI practices in the private sector. The president has no more authority to eliminate DEI programs in the private sector than he has to decree an end to \"casual Friday\" for private companies. But Trump did push private companies to end DEI programs on their own accord and directed federal officials to investigate companies' DEI programs that may violate federal civil rights law.\n\nThe order requires that the attorney general and other federal officials draw up a report of \"recommendations for enforcing Federal civil-rights laws and taking other appropriate measures to encourage the private sector to end illegal discrimination and preferences, including DEI.\" And the order stipulates that \"each agency shall identify up to nine potential civil compliance investigations of publicly traded corporations, large non-profit corporations or associations, foundations with assets of 500 million dollars or more, State and local bar and medical associations, and institutions of higher education with endowments over 1 billion dollars.\" Trump's executive order also expects the report to include further suggestions \"to encourage\" private businesses to end DEI practices, litigation that it could bring to court against companies continuing so-called illegal DEI practices, and \"potential regulatory action.\"\n\nOn February 5, Attorney General Pam Bondi followed up on Trump's executive order in a memo to the Justice Department. \"To fulfill the Nation's promise of equality for all Americans,\" she wrote, \"the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division will investigate, eliminate, and penalize illegal DEI and DEIA [diversity, equity, inclusion, and accessibility] preferences, mandates, policies, programs, and activities in the private sector and in educational institutions that receive federal funds.\" Bondi, in a footnote, listed some exceptions to this protocol. She added, \"It does not prohibit educational, cultural, or historical observances-such as Black History Month, International Holocaust Remembrance Day, or similar events-that celebrate diversity, recognize historical contributions, and promote awareness without engaging in exclusion or discrimination.\"\n\nTrump claimed inflation under the Biden administration wasn't just bad-it was record-breaking. \"We suffered the worst inflation in 48 years,\" Trump said. \"But perhaps even in the history of our country-they're not sure.\"\n\nThe U.S. did experience high inflation during Biden's stint as president, but it was not as historically significant as Trump claims. Month-to-month inflation -as calculated by percentage change in the consumer price index (CPI), which measures price changes for a basket of goods and services-hit a high of 9.1 percent in June 2021. Inflation remained at or above 6 percent for 17 consecutive months between October 2021 and February 2023.\n\nThat's not a 48-year record. Inflation sat above 9.1 percent from January 1979 to November 1981, with a high of 14.8 percent in March 1980. But that wasn't an all-time record either. Since the Bureau of Labor Statistics began tracking CPI data in 1913, the highest single-month inflation came  in June 1920 at 23.7 percent.*\n\nTrump championed his tariff agenda by claiming that it would usher in \"trillions of dollars\" in federal revenue. \"We will take in trillions and trillions of dollars and create jobs like we have never seen before,\" Trump said.\n\nThis is highly unlikely. According to Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED) records for custom duties tax receipts , the U.S. government collected $86.4 billion from tariffs in the final quarter of 2024. The highest amount of tariff revenue recorded was in the second quarter of 2022, at nearly $109 billion. Prior to the first Trump administration, tariff revenue had not exceeded $45 billion.\n\nFederal revenue estimates from Trump's recently imposed tariffs on Canada, China, and Mexico still leave Trump short of his lofty goal. Erica York, vice president of federal tax policy at the Tax Foundation, estimated this week that Trump's tariffs on those three nations will reap only $142 billion this year. Plus, Trump announced Thursday he was pausing some of the recently announced tariffs on Canada and Mexico.\n\nHow does the Trump administration intend to increase tariff revenue into the trillions? \"A new 'External Revenue Service' will collect tariff income, which the Tax Foundation estimates could generate between $2.7 and $4.5 trillion in customs duty revenues,\" a White House spokesman told The Dispatch Fact Check , sharing a different November 2024 report from the Tax Foundation's York. While she did publish those estimates, York noted them with two critical qualifiers: Those figures neither factor in \"how the taxes would shrink the US economy\" nor account for \"income and payroll tax offsets.\"\n\nHowever, it's possible that tariff hikes could cause revenues to decrease. When the price of a good increases, fewer consumers will purchase the product, bringing in less revenue. \"Tax revenue generally rises with the rate until its costs get so onerous that the taxed activity declines and revenue begins to fall,\" Dispatch contributor Scott Lincicome wrote this summer. \"Economists disagree about the exact 'revenue-maximizing' tax rate and about the taxes' growth effects, but they all agree that the Laffer Curve exists-including for tariffs.\"\n\nIn fact, the same Tax Foundation report shared by the White House spokesman defending Trump's claim actually rejects the premise that Trump's tariffs will boost federal revenue. \"Those same tariffs would cause enough economic damage, especially if met with any foreign retaliation, to offset the entire economic benefit of making the individual provisions permanent,\" York wrote. \"In other words, attempting to 'pay for' making the individual provisions permanent by imposing universal baseline tariffs would cause a net reduction in tax revenues and economic output, while simultaneously increasing the tax burden on lower- and middle-income taxpayers.\"\n\nTrump, in defending his tariffs placed on agriculture goods imported to the U.S., claimed that those imported goods undergo no safety inspections. \"They are uninspected, they may be very dirty and disgusting when they come in, and they pour in and they hurt our American farmers.\"\n\nImported food items \" are subject to \" health and safety inspections by Food and Drug Administration (FDA) officials when they first enter the country. \"FDA may detain shipments of products offered for import if the shipments are found not to be in compliance with U.S. requirements.\" Nor are those imported goods subject to a less-rigid inspection. The FDA adds, \"Both imported and domestically-produced foods must meet the same legal requirements in the United States.\" Moreover, importers bringing food goods into the U.S. must first send \"prior notice\" of the items to the FDA, unless all the food is for personal consumption.\n\nBut there are credible concerns that some imported food might be slipping through the cracks of federal inspectors. According to a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report published in January, the FDA fails to meet its target number of inspections for imported food items. The FDA Food Modernization Act of 2011 set a target of 19,200 foreign food safety inspections annually, but the GAO report shows that the FDA averaged a mere 917 inspections annually between 2019 and 2023. FDA officials interviewed by GAO investigators said they failed to even come close to its target because the agency is understaffed.\n\nIn his speech, Trump again pushed to reacquire the Panama Canal. \"It was built at tremendous cost of American blood and treasure,\" he said. \"38,000 workers died building the Panama Canal. They died of malaria, they died of snakebites and mosquitoes.\"\n\nAs the Dispatch Fact Check previously reported, Trump's 38,000 figure is an exaggeration of estimated worker fatalities during the canal's construction.\n\n38,000 workers did not die while America constructed the Panama Canal. According to the Panama Canal Authority's website, \"5,609 lives were lost from disease and accidents during the American construction era,\" per archived hospital records. When including estimates of worker deaths during the failed French construction of the canal, the combined death toll reaches about 25,000. \"However, the true number will never be known, since the French only recorded the deaths that occurred in hospital,\" the Panama Canal Authority added.\n\nA White House spokesman referred The Dispatch Fact Check to an August 2021 article in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention journal, Emerging Infectious Diseases , from its senior managing editor Byron Breedlove \"During the effort to build the canal in the 1880s, more than 22,000 workers from France died, many from malaria and yellow fever, before the etiologies of those tropical diseases were understood,\" Breedlove wrote. \"Records indicate that during the period of US construction, more than 55,000 people were employed and an estimated 5,600 died of injury and disease.\" However, the White House spokesman also pointed to an April 2018 article in The Conversation from then-Yale doctoral candidate Caroline Lieffers, who wrote that \"many historians think the real toll was several times higher\" than the official total of 5,609.\n\nMoreover, it appears Trump's \"38,000\" figure also includes worker fatalities from construction of the Panama Canal Railway. \"In addition to the Canal, the United States was also responsible for the construction of the Panama Railroad,\" a White House spokesman told The Dispatch Fact Check . \"The Canal-which was later built parallel to the Railroad-benefited from the construction, which cleared dense forests and terrain and made the Canal feasible.\" He added, though without citing a primary source, \"Roughly 12,000 workers died during construction of the Panama Railroad.\"\n\nTrump falsely claimed that Panama violated a treaty with the U.S. by giving control of the canal to China. \"It [the canal] was given away by the Carter administration for $1,\" he said. \"But that agreement has been violated very severely. We didn't give it to China,\" Trump added, \"we gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back.\"\n\nBut the U.S.-Panama Treaty was not a business transaction where the canal was sold, but was an agreement to allow Panama to operate the canal in exchange for indefinite access to its waterway. As The Dispatch Fact Check previously reported,\n\nFormer President Jimmy Carter agreed in 1977 to return the canal to Panamanian jurisdiction in phases that ended with Panama taking full control of the canal in 1999. In return, Panama guaranteed the U.S. and all other nations neutral access to the canal. As outlined in the U.S.-Panama treaty, the canal \"shall remain secure and open to peaceful transit by the vessels of all nations on terms of entire equality, so that there will be no discrimination against any nation, or its citizens or subjects, concerning the conditions or charges of transit, or for any other reason.\"\n\nWhen asked how to clarify how Panama violated the treaty, a White House spokesman told The Dispatch Fact Check , \"The Torrijos-Carter treaties mobilized the process of granting the Panamanians 'free control' of the canal so long as Panama signed a treaty guaranteeing the permanent neutrality of the canal. ... Panama gave control of the ports at the Canal's Atlantic and Pacific outlets to Hong-Kong based Hutchison Ports Holdings,\" the White House spokesman said, \"voiding the neutrality clause by favoring China.\" But, as The Dispatch Fact Check also previously reported , that is not a violation of the U.S.-Panama treaties.\n\nPanama also continues to operate the canal-not China. When Panama obtained full control of the canal at the turn of the 21st-century, the country awarded a contract to a subsidiary of the Hong Kong-based company Hutchinson-Whampoa-later renamed CK Hutchinson Holdings following a merger with another Hong Kong-based company-to operate two shipping ports located on both ends of the canal, essentially privatizing the ports that were formerly government-run. The company has no jurisdiction or control over the canal itself, as that authority is vested with a Panamanian government agency, the Panama Canal Authority.\n\nTrump attempted to draw a contrast between European and American financial support for Ukraine's defense against Russian invasion. \"Europe has sadly spent more money buying Russian oil and gas than they've spent on defending Ukraine, by far,\" he said. \"Think of that,\" he added. \"They've spent more buying Russian oil and gas than they have defending.\"\n\nBut Europe has actually spent more money on Ukraine's defense than on Russian oil and gas purchases, not less. A report last month from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA)-a environmental research think-tank based in Helsinki, Finland-found that European imports of Russian fossil fuels in 2024 totaled 21.9 billion euros, or about $23.6 billion. The Ukraine Support Tracker -a project of the German-based research think tank, the Kiel Institute-shows that European nations and institutions gave a combined 43.4 billion euros, or $46.9 billion, to the Ukrainian government in 2024.\n\nTrump then claimed that the U.S. paid $350 billion for Ukraine's defense since 2022, while asserting that Europe has contributed only $100 billion.\"We've spent perhaps $350 billion, like taking candy from a baby,\" he said. \"And they've [Europe] spent $100 billion. What a difference that is,\" Trump added. \"Biden has authorized more money in this fight than Europe has spent by billions and billions of dollars.\"\n\nTrump exaggerates the amount of funding the U.S. has allocated for Ukraine's defense while understating Europe's contributions. Since Russia's invasion, Congress has authorized Ukraine defense aid on five separate occasions totaling $174.2 billion . However, that authorized funding does not instantly mail cash to Ukraine as soon as the bill's ink dries, but first needs to be allocated toward specific projects. Some of those funds , instead of being sent directly to Ukraine, is spent in the U.S. to resupply U.S. weapon stockpiles, given to humanitarian aid institutions helping Ukraine, and other uncompleted contracts serving Ukraine's defense. The Ukrainian Support Tracker shows a total of 114.2 billion euros , or $123.2 billion, allocated to the Ukrainian government by the U.S. between January 2022 and December 2024.\n\nNor has American support for Ukraine totaled anywhere near $350 billion. Even calculating in debt-servicing expenses-costs incurred from having to borrow additional money, which the Cato Institute's Romina Boccia and Dominik Lett estimated in April 2024 would come out to $66 billion by 2034 -would still only bring the combined total to just over $240 billion.*\n\nFurther, Biden did not authorize these payments to Ukraine unilaterally. All five packages were passed by Congress, and votes did not follow strict party lines. For example, the Additional Ukraine Supplemental Appropriations Act of 2022 , the second bill passed granting Ukraine financial aid, gained the support of 39 of the GOP's 50 senators and 149 GOP House members . The most recent bill passed that secured funding for Ukraine, in April 2024, received the support of 101 of the GOP House caucus' 218 members. In the Senate, 31 of 49 Senate Republicans supported the aid.\n\n\"$8 million for making mice transgender,\" Trump said. He emphasized, \"this is real.\"\n\nIt's not real. Taxpayer dollars have not been used to \"make mice transgender,\" though funds have been used to study the effects of hormone therapy on mice in an effort to understand long-term implications for humans. Further, some of the research involving the hormone-injected mice was not focused on questions of gender identity.\n\nOn Wednesday, the White House put out a statement refuting a CNN fact check article that initially categorized Trump's transgender mice claim as \"false.\" (CNN has since updated its rating to \"needs context.\") The White House in its statement listed six separate National Institute of Health (NIH) grants for the purpose of \"perform[ing] transgender experiments on mice.\"\n\nHowever, as Reason 's Joe Lancaster noted , \"a quick glance at the list shows Trump's claim is still not accurate: Indeed, the top bullet point lists $455,000 in grants 'to test the effects of gender-affirming hormone therapy on HIV vaccine-induced immune responses.'\" Ultimately, Lancaster noted that the funding went to research for HIV vaccine development, and had no direct relation to studies of gender-transition care. \"They would use the grant money to study 'the immunological responsiveness of transgender people, a population at considerably higher risk for HIV and other STIs [sexually transmitted infections].'\"\n\nHere's a brief description of the research conducted with the five other NIH grants:\n\n$2,500,000 for \"Reproductive Consequences of Steroid Hormone Administration\": This study developed mice with \"defects in ovarian architecture and ... altered folliculogenesis\" to research the long-term effects of testosterone hormone therapy on transgender men (individuals born female who identify as male), specifically their reproductive system. Researchers were creating mutations within mouse models that would \"mimic\" hormone treatment for transgender individuals.\n\n$299,940 for \"Gender-Affirming Testosterone Therapy on Breast Cancer Risk and Treatment Outcomes\": This study researches breast cancer risk and treatment for transgender men, and involves mouse models that have their ages \"accelerate by a factor of 70\" to invoke \"hormone regulation of breast development.\"\n\n$735,113 for \"Microbiome mediated effects of gender affirming hormone therapy in mice\": This study researched the effect of hormone therapy on skeletal maturation. Some mice were given cross-sex hormone therapy to examine the effect on skeletal development.\n\n$1,200,000 for \"Androgen effects on the reproductive neuroendocrine axis\": This study directly examined transgender individuals and the effects of hormone therapy on their reproductive health. However, the study also involved studying transgenic mice -not the same things as transgender mice. While those transgenic mice were tested with hormone treatment too, transgenic mice are \"mice that have had DNA from another source put into their DNA,\" per the National Cancer Institute , not mice that have changed genders. \"The new DNA becomes part of every cell and tissue of the mouse,\" it added. \"These mice are used in the laboratory to study diseases.\"\n\n$3,100,000 for \"Gonadal hormones as mediators of sex and gender influences in asthma\": This study researches the question of why asthma diagnoses in women exceed those in men. It involves research conducted on mice that are exposed to hormone treatments, which aims to show possible differences between \"asthma outcomes\" between men and women. Its research does not directly relate to questions of viability or effectiveness of gender transition care.\n\nTrump's speech on Tuesday was not the first time he claimed federal taxpayers were footing the bill for \"$59 million for illegal alien hotel rooms in New York City.\" He made the same claim from the Oval Office in February. \"The DOGE team just discovered that FEMA sent $59M LAST WEEK to luxury hotels in New York City to house illegal migrants,\" he tweeted on February 10. \"That money is meant for American disaster relief and instead is being spent on high end hotels for illegals!\"\n\nBut, as The Dispatch 's Grayson Logue reported on February 17 , that's not entirely true.\n\nMusk alleged that the hotels were running a \" racket ,\" charging the city double their normal prices with 100 percent occupancy. Over the last few years, there have been multiple examples of the city paying hotels on similar terms as officials dealt with the migrant influx-although a report from the comptroller found that the city had paid an average daily hotel rate of $156 in fiscal year 2024.\n\n...\n\nRegardless of how sound or unsound the city's hotel contracting choices have been, federal dollars have not footed anywhere near the full bill for hotel rates. [The Shelter and Services Program (SSP)] has extensive rules governing the type and quantity of eligible expenses that cities and nonprofits can receive funds for, including a stipulation that the reimbursement rate for hotel stays \"cannot exceed $12.50 per noncitizen migrant per day.\"\n\nNonetheless, four FEMA employees including the agency's chief financial officer, Mary Comans, were fired over the payment although the administration did not detail how their actions violated FEMA policies aside from saying the personnel acted insubordinately. A Department of Homeland Security (DHS) spokeswoman said the employees had \"circumvented leadership and unilaterally made this payment.\"\n\nWhile New York City did receive $59 million in federal money to provide support for noncitizen migrants, not all of that amount was spent on hotel rooms, as a Dispatch Fact Check previously covered . Meanwhile, the Shelter and Services Program is administered by FEMA but receives funding from the budget of a different federal agency, Customs and Border Protection. Federal taxpayer dollars spent under this SSP migrant housing program were not taken from the bank account of FEMA or the pockets of natural disaster victims.\n\nIn announcing what he characterized as irresponsible federal spending uncovered by the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, Trump accused Stacey Abrams, a former Democratic state representative of Georgia who twice ran for governor in the state and lost both races, of receiving taxpayer funds. \"$1.9 billion to recently created decarbonization of homes committee, headed up-and we know she's involved - just at the last moment, the money was passed over by a woman named Stacey Abrams,\" Trump said.\n\nAbrams is linked to a nonprofit organization, Power Forward Communities, that received a $2 billion grant authorized through the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 that the group said was to \"affordably decarbonize American homes.\" While Abrams is not listed as having any direct involvement with Power Forward Communities, she is listed as a \"senior advisor\" to Rewiring America, a separate nonprofit organization. Rewiring America was one of five distinct nonprofits to launch Power Forward Communities in October 2023, mere months before it received the $2 billion grant in August 2024.\n\nAs The Dispatch Fact Check previously reported ,\n\nThe rumors began after the Trump administration's new Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) administrator, former New York GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin, announced on February 13 that the federal agency found \"billions of taxpayer dollars\" in climate grants held in a bank account formed by former President Joe Biden's White House administration. That funding, authorized from the Inflation Reduction Act, awarded a total of $20 billion to eight nonprofit organizations for investments in a slew of clean energy initiatives, including $2 billion to Power Forward Communities, a group linked to Abrams.\n\n...\n\nPower Forward Communities stated in a press release announcing the grant that \"Rewiring America will orchestrate financing, financial assistance, and technical assistance to homeowners in specific markets, and will offer nationwide planning tools and resources, including cost savings and carbon emissions abatement projections to support household electrification at the single-family level.\"\n\nThere have been legitimate issues raised regarding the Biden administration's funding of Power Toward Communities. As the Washington Free Beacon reported last week , Power Forward Communities had reported a total of $100 for both its \"total revenue\" and \"net assets\" in its 2023 tax return . GuideStar, a website that tracks public information for nonprofit organizations, notes that the Internal Revenue Service granted tax-exempt status to Power Forward Communities only in 2024. But claims that Abrams personally received $2 billion in government funding are false.\n\nIf you have a claim you would like to see us fact check, please send us an email at factcheck@thedispatch.com .

Join Today ! to listen to this post.\n\nHappy Monday! After a busy weekend of games-including Auburn's memorable victory over Michigan State to advance to the Final Four-Chestbrockwell1967 and J.

Who will take home the inaugural championship: Tesi, Meeko, Gus, or Molly? Cast your vote for today!\n\nIn a December 2018 Twitter thread criticizing China for its unfair trade practices, President Donald Trump declared himself \"a Tariff Man.\" But back then, the conventional wisdom was that this sort of tough talk was all bark and no bite. Trump implemented a series of tariffs during his first term, but the duties represented a significantly pared-back version of the trade war he had initially envisioned.\n\nNow, as the president promises to enact sweeping tariffs on a range of U.S. trade partners this week, gone are any assurances that Trump's threats are mostly bluster. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump announced plans to impose 25 percent duties on foreign cars and car parts, effective April 3 at 12:01 a.m. ET. He has also vowed to correct trade imbalances through so-called reciprocal tariffs on goods from multiple countries, dubbing April 2 \"Liberation Day,\" when Americans will be freed from the yoke of purportedly abusive foreign trade practices.\n\nFacing fewer political obstacles, armed with a more energized and ideologically aligned administration, and unconcerned with re-election (recent third-term talk notwithstanding), Trump's dream of revitalizing American manufacturing may be getting its first crash test (pun intended). And early indicators are not looking good, as American firms brace for the economic pain of Trump's levies and retaliatory measures from international trading partners.\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 1.7 percent on Friday, its largest percentage decrease since March 10. The S&P 500 fell almost 2 percent, while the Nasdaq composite slid 2.7 percent. But neither the battered stock market nor souring consumer sentiment appears likely to knock Trump off course. Asked by NBC News' Kristen Welker on Sunday whether he's concerned about foreign automakers jacking up their prices in response to the duties, the president responded : \"I couldn't care less if they raise prices, because people are going to start buying American-made cars.\"\n\nBut foreign manufacturers aren't the only victims of the auto tariffs, which level a tax on imported car parts in addition to cars themselves. With very few exceptions, \"I don't really think that there's any car made in the United States that doesn't have at least some parts that come either from Mexico, Canada, Brazil, or South Korea,\" Peter Simon, an economics professor at Northeastern University, told TMD .\n\nNor is there a clean distinction between which parts are \"American\" and which are not. Linamar, a Canadian firm that makes transmission modules for cars sold in the U.S., is a case in point : Steel scraps are sent from Canada to Pennsylvania-and then Ohio-to be made into a \"hub,\" which then travels to Ontario, where it's combined with a gear-shifting component made in Illinois. The product is then housed in an aluminum module made in Canada and later put into a transmission in a factory in the Midwest. It then crosses the border twice more, once to be inserted into a car in a Canadian dealership and then again to be sold in the United States.\n\nThe auto industry is full of such examples, with Audi and Mercedes-Benz plants in the Southeast deeply integrated with Mexican supply chains and the Detroit automotive industry enmeshed with Canada. \"[Trump's tariff] is a measure that completely undermines the integration of the region's production chains, chains that have been formed over 30 years,\" Rogelio Garza, the president of Mexico's auto-industry trade association, said Thursday.\n\nAmerican automakers, on the other hand, have approached the duties with cautious optimism. \"U.S. Automakers are committed to President Trump's vision of increasing automotive production and jobs in the U.S.,\" said Matt Blunt , the former Missouri governor who now serves as president of the American Automakers Policy Council, a trade association that represents Ford, General Motors, and Stellantis. But \"it is critical that tariffs are implemented in a way that avoids raising prices for consumers and that preserves the competitiveness of the integrated North American automotive sector,\" he cautioned.\n\nFor automakers, the unpredictability of Trump's tariffs is arguably as disruptive as the tariffs themselves. Earlier this month, for example, the president announced a last-minute temporary exemption for cars and parts that comply with the terms of the U.S.-Mexico-Canada (USCMA) trade agreement, a move applauded by American companies. The current executive order also leaves considerable wiggle room on that front, declaring that USMCA-compliant parts would remain exempt until the Secretary of Commerce creates a process for taxing their \"non-U.S. content.\"\n\nNo one is sure how long that process will take, nor what \"non-U.S. content\" precisely means. And in the business world, uncertainty breeds hesitancy, meaning companies are pulling back from making investments. A survey of chief financial officers conducted by Duke University and the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, released Wednesday , found that nearly a quarter of firms surveyed planned to cut back on hiring and investment in 2025 due to the administration's trade policy. \"Nobody is going to be willing to enter into a long-term agreement with another company or country, given the volatility of his daily decisions,\" Simon said.\n\nTrump has often left open the possibility that tariffs are simply a negotiating tool. \"Maybe I'll give them a little reduction in tariffs or something to get it done,\" he said on Wednesday , in reference to his administration's attempts to convince China to sell ByteDance, TikTok's parent company. He also initially delayed some tariffs on Mexican and Canadian goods in February, citing border security concessions made by the countries.\n\nUncertainty abounds, though, as an even wider array of tariffs stands to be implemented on \"Liberation Day.\" Trump has threatened \"sectoral tariffs\" on products like computer chips, lumber, and copper, and also frequently promises \"reciprocal tariffs\" on every foreign country that taxes U.S. exports. But what exactly those will look like remains deeply unclear.\n\nThe befuddled reportedly count many of Trump's allies among their ranks: \"No one knows what the f**k is going on,\" a \"White House ally\" told Politico last week . Trump has been coy about the exact contours of his policies, telling reporters last week that his tariffs could be \"somewhat conservative\" and neglecting to inform the public on which of the already-imposed tariffs on Mexico and Canada (originally declared in February and eventually delayed until April 2) will actually go into effect. A White House official said last week that reciprocal tariffs were \"TBD.\"\n\nMany countries are already preparing for the worst. European Union diplomats, for example, are reportedly expecting a flat, double-digit tariff on all goods to be implemented on April 2-on top of already-existing tariffs on steel and oil. Others are at least trying to project confidence: \"We've been through this three times; this would be the third,\" Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum said Wednesday . And others are spitting mad: New Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney declared Canada's old relationship with the U.S. \"over\" on Friday, promising retaliatory tariffs that would hit the U.S. with \"maximum impact.\"\n\nThe EU has already announced that, if Trump's trade war continues, the bloc will implement coordinated punitive tariffs targeting the American economy. Canada also has a plan to target industries in relatively Republican states, such as Harley-Davidson in Wisconsin or bourbon in Kentucky.\n\nWhile you can never rule out a last-minute deal when it comes to Trump, the president and his allies appear fully committed to some kind of trade war, expecting significant gain to come of all the pain. On Saturday, Vice President J.D. Vance lashed out at a right-wing commentator who criticized Trump's trade policy on X, describing the conservative movement's embrace of free trade as \"brain-dead liberalism pretending to be conservatism.\" The \"United States absorbs much of the producer surplus of the world,\" Vance argued, producing a system that left the U.S. economy vulnerable to economic shocks.\n\nAutoworkers' unions also cheered Trump's moves. \"We are heartened by the significant measures they have announced today,\" the United Autoworkers said in a statement on Wednesday, \"and we urge the administration to take similar action to protect and reshore the heavy truck sector.\"\n\nBut economists are more skeptical of the Trump administration's ability to deliver on its promises. \"Every president, the last 10 of them, promised to bring back manufacturing, and none of them were able to do it, with good reason,\" Simon argued. The hypothetical benefits that would come from a mass reshoring of manufacturing are already being superseded by very real losses. As the auto industry prepares for more expensive input prices, it has scaled back expectations of production. Already, American steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs has laid off 1,200 workers in Minnesota and Michigan. The company has voiced support for tariffs as a way to undercut foreign competition, but its share price dropped nearly 10 percent over the past week.\n\nIf the stock market's and economists' gloomy predictions are correct, consumers will soon be feeling the pain. Will anything, or anyone, make the president back off? His fellow Republicans seem disinclined to do so, even though Trump is issuing tariffs based on powers delegated to him by Congress, which it could revoke at will.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump said that the U.S.'s new tariff regime was here to stay. \"Absolutely, they're permanent,\" he said . Maybe the uncertainty won't last so long, after all.\n\nNew York Times : Trump Says He's 'Not Joking' About Seeking a Third Term in Defiance of Constitution\n\nPresident Trump did not rule out seeking a third term in office on Sunday, telling NBC News that he was \"not joking\" about the possibility and suggesting there were \"methods\" to circumvent the two-term limit laid out in the Constitution.\n\n...\n\nOn Sunday, after the release of the interview, the White House reiterated Mr. Trump's point that he was focused on his current term, and added that it was \"far too early to think about\" the idea.\n\n\"Americans overwhelmingly approve and support President Trump and his America First policies,\" Steven Cheung, the White House communications director, said in a statement.\n\nNew York Times : California Governor Newsom Says the Democratic Brand Is 'Toxic'\n\nPeople : RFK Jr. Mercilessly Fat Shames West Virginia Governor at Live Joint Appearance\n\nHealth and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. appeared in West Virginia on Friday, March 28, to discuss the state's health initiatives-but also made a few rude remarks at Governor Patrick Morrisey's expense.\n\n...\n\n\"I said to Governor Morrisey the first time I saw him, I said, 'You look like you ate Governor Morrisey,'\" Kennedy recalled. \"There was a lot of talk about getting healthy again, and I'm very happy that he's invited me to be his personal trainer,\" he said before the crowd laughed.\n\nThe first new Mumford & Sons album since 2018 was released on Friday-and it was worth the wait.

      "text": "How Trump's Civil Rights Agenda Uses the Democrats' Playbook\n\nFederal funding threats can change policies even without a court ruling.\n\nAudio versions are only available to subscribers of The Dispatch. Join Today ! to listen to this post.\n\nPresident Trump's supporters and detractors alike would agree that the first few weeks of his second term have featured his administration's aggressive assertion of executive power. The new administration has, without waiting for Congress, dismantled the U.S. Agency for International Development , largely neutered the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau , turned immigration enforcement around , sought significant personnel reductions across virtually all federal agencies, and fired or replaced numerous senior officials-such as inspectors general and the head of the Office of Special Counsel -who are at least nominally entitled to some limits on their removal.\n\nFor many in the conservative legal movement, the Trump administration moves are significant because they tee up, for judicial resolution, important aspects of \" unitary executive \" theory. The quick and dirty explanation of the theory is that, constitutionally, all executive powers granted in Article II of the Constitution flow through one person-the president-and, because any authority granted to executive officials other than the president is a delegation of those powers, limits on presidential ability to control any executive branch official, up to and including removal, are unconstitutional.\n\nThere are counterarguments to be made, and most likely the Supreme Court will draw some kind of lines. I doubt that all civil service protections for lower-level employees and government employee union contracts will be voided by the court under unitary executive theory, but I wouldn't be optimistic were I an inspector general or other Senate-confirmed executive branch employee looking to keep my job. But these legal questions (and related executive power questions of impoundment ) are already making their way through the federal courts , threatening to slow down or delay, at least temporarily, the Trump train with respect to expanded executive authority. The administration may well prevail in the Supreme Court on many of its \"unitary executive\"-based arguments, but that will take time.\n\nEnter civil rights enforcement, wherein the scope and breadth of current laws create a much more powerful tool for executive action than many realize, and on topics that go well beyond voting rights or traditional intentional racial discrimination cases.\n\nThe reality is that America's civil rights laws and federal enforcement mechanisms provide an established and well-defined path to quickly implement policy goals without the need for new legislation or any constitutional challenges to existing law. Robust executive action in this realm can drive changes in behavior of major institutions-higher education, corporate America, and state and local government-immediately, even if key questions surrounding the legal theories undergirding the actions are unresolved. Early indications are that the Trump administration is poised to use every ounce of its authority in this regard.\n\nMost Republican administrations have focused on reining in perceived excesses of Democratic predecessors when it comes to civil rights. Republicans have, for example, been skeptical of the overuse of \"disparate impact\" cases that rely on statistical disparities in outcome rather than evidence of intentional discrimination when it comes to employment law (such as claims of \"gender-based discrimination\" over physical fitness standards for police and fire departments) .  They have also generally been more reluctant than Democrats to intervene on state and local law enforcement in the name of civil rights (in this case usually related to excessive force or other race-neutral constitutional violations), owing both to deference to principles of federalism and substantive \"law and order\" politics. Thus, typical criticisms of Republican civil rights enforcers are that they are \"turning out the lights\" or not being as active as they should be.\n\nBut look for a Trump civil rights agenda to be more ambitious and, rather than merely limiting the use of tools that have been sharpened by Democratic predecessors, to use the same tools to achieve different ends.\n\nThe administration's termination of $400 million in federal aid to Columbia University over its failure to sufficiently combat antisemitism (and thus in violation of its Title VI obligation not to engage in religious and/or national origin discrimination) provides an example of this approach. Recipients of federal grants are bound by civil rights laws, particularly Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. So-called \"spending statutes\" (like Title VI and Title IX) are a powerful tool for withholding federal funds in response to discrimination, as the administration defines it. And a Trump administration will define \"discrimination\" quite differently than Democratic administrations typically do. Do DEI programs (even those unrelated to specific hiring or admissions criteria) \"discriminate\" against whites and males? There are certainly arguments to be made, depending on the specifics. Do disciplinary proceedings for sexual harassment or assault that don't allow cross-examination of complainants, don't adequately define charges, or use a single administrator to both investigate and determine discipline discriminate against males? There are non-frivolous arguments in favor of each of these propositions. Should the Trump administration aggressively threaten to withhold funds based on finding that these practices are discriminatory, its civil rights footprint could be larger, rather than smaller, than its predecessor.\n\nPast experience shows that aggressive enforcement of funding statutes can force change well beyond a targeted institution to truly transform a class of institutions and even society as a whole. Take Title IX of the Civil Rights Act, which requires nondiscrimination between the sexes in higher education. Today, most people assume Title IX requires equal spending on both male and female intercollegiate athletics. It doesn't (at least explicitly). But for years of Democratic administrations, anything other than rough numerical parity in athletic scholarships resulted in threats to federal funding, Title IX investigations from the Department of Education, legal fees, and public relations headaches. Eventually, colleges got the message and cut many men's sports (such as wrestling) that impeded the ability to reach numerical parity. What was once a contested interpretation of a generalized nondiscrimination statute became de facto the law , based largely on the aggressive use of a funding statute to drive change.\n\nSimilarly, the liability from tolerating a \"hostile environment\" is a large part of the genesis of the various forms of diversity or sensitivity training that are ubiquitous in all workplaces today. Institutions know that not discriminating is not enough-they must sufficiently educate or police everyone within their institutions to be able to defend against a claim that they tolerate actions that create a hostile environment. There is generally no independent legal requirement to have these mandatory trainings-but institutions, as with colleges and Title IX, learned the lesson.\n\nUnlike private lawsuits alleging discrimination, federal funding threats can change policies even without a court ruling. Yes, there are some administrative and legal hurdles an institution can raise trying to preserve its federal funds (and it is unclear to me that all the appropriate \"i's\" were dotted and \"t's crossed\" with respect to Title VI in the Columbia case, for example), but no institution that receives large amounts of federal funds wants that funding jeopardized while it litigates the question, further antagonizing the source of the funding. Indeed Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania have already implemented hiring freezes based on the Trump administration's actions against Columbia, understanding at least some risk of similar actions being taken against them in the future. No doubt they are reviewing their policies to seek to avoid at least direct conflicts with the civil rights interpretations espoused by the Trump administration. And Columbia's case hasn't even begun to be litigated.\n\nThere are other ways a Trump administration civil rights agenda can push its policy preferences via these powerful funding statutes. In the wake of Students for Fair Admissions v. Harvard , colleges that persist in resisting the dismantling of now-illegal racial consideration in admissions can have federal funds threatened, Columbia style. It will be interesting to see how schools who argued in SFFA that minority representation would plummet absent legalized discrimination for the sake of diversity explain to a Trump DOJ or Department of Education Office of Civil Rights why their statistical profiles haven't changed if they are indeed \"race neutral\" as the Supreme Court now requires. Smart university general counsels are already thinking of how they will defend their admissions processes, and are making changes to policies or practices likely to raise the hackles of a Trump administration investigation.\n\nAs has already happened in the Title IX space (where Trump has repealed Biden era guidance on gender identity and the adjudication of sexual assault claims and implemented its own ), universities must now calculate that violating the basic due process rights of male students in disciplinary proceedings may threaten their federal funds and balance that obligation against their obligation to protect female students from sexual assault. This risk of losing hundreds of millions of dollars annually in federal funding will induce more change in university policies than the scores of successful lawsuits brought by male students discharged under the Biden era guidance against the universities that discharged them.\n\nOne can easily see theTrump administration moving their enforcement beyond universities to corporate federal contractors, who are also bound by nondiscrimination provisions as federal funds recipients. The collective corporate moonwalk on DEI initiatives may be partly the result of \"vibe shifts,\" but it is also due to fear of a claim-either brought by the federal government or supported by it-that a particular program violates nondiscrimination principles. No one wants to be the subject of federal interest when it comes to civil rights enforcement.\n\nMany conservatives will indulge in a certain amount of schadenfreude as this massive federal civil rights apparatus shifts its focus to nontraditional areas that have arguably been underenforced-religious discrimination, discrimination against whites or Asians, sex-based discrimination against men. And there is a certain symmetry to watching the Trump administration \"flip the script\" on many of its left-wing opponents.\n\nBut for those who were hoping for any limits to be placed on federal civil rights authority or for a return to a more restrained view of the role of federal civil rights enforcement, they will be sorely disappointed.\n\nIt is now clear that both parties agree that the federal civil rights laws are legitimate tools to advance all kinds of political and policy goals that go well beyond traditional intentional discrimination-the only disagreement is what those goals are. When it comes to civil rights enforcement in the Trump era, don't expect a slowdown. Prepare for whiplash.\n\nBob Driscoll is a lawyer in Washington, D.C.; a partner in the compliance, investigations, and government enforcement team at Dickinson Wright, PLLC; and a former deputy assistant attorney general for the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice.

      "text": "Conrad Black: Trump's Tariff Policy Is in Part a Containment Strategy to Deal With the China Threat\n\nSoviet leader Joseph Stalin, U.S. President Franklin Roosevelt, and British Prime Minister Winston Churchill all promised that they would swiftly evacuate the liberated countries of Western Europe, except for Germany, and hold in all of them completely democratic all-party elections. The Western allies scrupulously observed this commitment, including in Italy and France, even though the communist parties in those countries gained over 20 percent of the vote. The Soviet Union violated its promises, however, and no such elections were held until the communist bloc and international communism itself disintegrated 45 years after the end of World War II.\n\nIn these circumstances, it is natural that the United States, having designed and conducted a successful containment strategy against the Soviet Union, is now applying a modified containment strategy to deal with the challenge posed by China.\n\nAfter World War II, many former Western European colonies were vulnerable to communism for its promise of equality for all and its perceived lack of racial bias, but the American strategy was to incentivize these countries to keep their distance from the USSR, and give them generous access to sell cheap goods in the American market. So desirable was the United States as a place to invest and so overwhelmingly economically powerful was it, that the money that thus departed America soon returned as investment in that country, but not in amounts that undermined U.S. control of its own economy.\n\nThe only credible threat that China could pose to American (and Western) pre-eminence in the world would be if it could somehow make an arrangement with Russia to ship tens of millions of its surplus people to Siberia to exploit its resources in exchange for a royalty paid to the Kremlin. Russia is not a serious threat to Western Europe but it could, if it was so rebuffed and humiliated by the West, conceivably become so rancorous that it was prepared to suppress the imperishable pride of Holy Mother Russia in a comfortable subordinate relationship with China.\n\nThis is why the Trump administration has recognized that in addition to assuring that Russia does not succeed in undoing the largest single element of the Western victory in the Cold War by re-absorbing Ukraine, it must seek to revive a relationship with Russia, a country with which the United States no longer has any fundamental disagreement. And in assembling a containment strategy against China, the principal desirable associated countries are Japan, India, Russia, and in the second echelon, Vietnam, South Korea, Australia, Indonesia, and the Philippines. This is essentially why the United States has not assessed any new tariffs on Russia, because it is in the latter stages of negotiating a comprehensive resolution of outstanding issues with that country.\n\nIn these circumstances, there is no reason whatever for the United States to be running a trade deficit. And as long as President Trump is sincere about renegotiating more equal arrangements and no longer carrying on the broad back of America a raft of regimes that are perfectly competent to fend for themselves in an alliance where everyone pulls their weight and pays their way for a refreshing change, everything will be worked out quite quickly and satisfactorily."

The Japanese company had pledged more than $2.7 billion in investments, including major upgrades at steel plants in Pennsylvania and Indiana.\n\nTrump's order makes clear that the new CFIUS review must include input from national security and trade officials, as well as a full opportunity for the companies to address concerns.\n\nThe memorandum states that the review will be \"confidential\" and in accordance with standard CFIUS procedures. Each participating agency must submit its position and reasoning in the final recommendation.\n\nTrump's action comes amid renewed emphasis on reviving U.S. manufacturing and strengthening industrial supply chains. The president has linked these efforts to his broader tariff strategy and reshoring agenda.\n\nThe original acquisition proposal drew bipartisan opposition from lawmakers and union groups concerned about foreign ownership. However, regional leaders in steel-producing areas such as Pennsylvania and Indiana have supported the deal, citing the risk of job losses without fresh capital.\n\nThe Epoch Times reached out to Nippon Steel for comment but did not receive a response by publication time."

      "text": "Appeals Court Rules Against Trump Admin, Fired Board Members to be Reinstated\n\nThe Trump administration must reinstate two board members who were fired, under a U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit ruling released on April 7.\n\nJudges in the majority cited Supreme Court precedent that has established that certain board members have protection against firing without cause.\n\nThat includes a 1935 ruling known as Humphrey's Executor, in which justices said that Congress could curtail the president's power to remove members of the Federal Trade Commission unless there was just cause, such as neglect of duty.\n\nIn several more recent rulings concluding that laws imposing restrictions on removing the single heads of agencies that exercise executive powers are unconstitutional, justices specified that they were not disturbing the precedent pertaining to members of adjudicatory boards.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has repeatedly told the courts of appeals to follow extant Supreme Court precedent unless and until that Court itself changes it or overturns it,\" the majority of the District of Columbia court said on April 7.\n\n\"If a precedent of the Supreme Court 'has direct application in a case,' lower courts 'should follow the case which directly controls,' leaving to the Supreme Court 'the prerogative of overruling its own decisions,'\" it added, citing previous rulings that outlined the principle.\n\nWhite House officials fired Wilcox in January and Harris in February, communicating in brief emails that they were acting on behalf of President Donald Trump.\n\nThe email to Wilcox quoted Trump's statement that, in his judgment, the National Labor Relations Board is not currently \"fulfilling its responsibility to the American people.\" The president said he was replacing Wilcox and another member in order to ensure that his administration's aims and purposes are carried out effectively, citing decisions that he said exceeded federal law, including their support for an employment rule that courts later invalidated.\n\nThe email to Harris did not list a reason for the termination.\n\nBoth fired members sued, leading to rulings in their favor that required reinstatement.\n\nThe full court on April 7 not only vacated the stays on the lower court orders, but also denied the government's emergency motions for stays pending appeal, which would have held in abeyance the court's order until the Supreme Court acts.\n\n\"The Supreme Court's repeated and recent statements that Humphrey's Executor and Wiener remain precedential require denying the government's emergency motions for a stay pending appeal,\" the majority said.\n\nThe majority consisted of Circuit Judges Sri Srinivasan, Patricia A. Millett, Robert L Wilkins, J. Michelle Childs, Florence Y. Pan, and Bradley N. Garcia.\n\nFour judges dissented.\n\n\"We do the parties (especially a functioning executive branch) no favors by unnecessarily delaying Supreme Court review of this significant and surprisingly controversial aspect of Article II authority,\" Circuit Judge Karen LeCraft Henderson wrote in a dissent. \"Only the Supreme Court can decide the dispute and, in my opinion, the sooner, the better.\"\n\nCircuit Judge Neomi Rao wrote separately that recent Supreme Court decisions have \"substantially eroded\" Humphrey's Executor and the 1958 Weiner ruling.\n\n\"While statutes provide for-cause removal protections for Harris and Wilcox, these restrictions are likely unconstitutional because they interfere with the President's authority to remove principal officers who execute the law,\" she said.\n\nHarrison Fields, a White House spokesman, told The Epoch Times via email, \"The Constitution gives President Trump the power to remove personnel who exercise his executive authority.\"\n\nHe said the administration plans to appeal the decision."

First, if I can mention tariffs, it's a subject of some interest today. I can tell you that I said to the president a very simple thing. We will eliminate the trade deficit with the United States. We intend to do it very quickly. We think it's the right thing to do. And we're going to also eliminate trade barriers, a variety of trade barriers that have been put up unnecessarily,\" Netanyahu said.\n\n\"And I think Israel can serve as a model for many countries who ought to do the same. I recognize the position of the United States. It says, you know, we allow other countries to put tariffs on us, but we don't put tariffs on them. And, you know, I'm a free trade champion, and free trade has to be fair trade. And I think that's basically the position that you've put forward, Mr. President.

Pritzker, Josh Shapiro, Jared Polis, Tim Walz and Kathy Hochul are among the growing list of Democratic governors speaking out against Trump's tariffs - and, in some cases, working to blunt the impact on their local economies.\n\n\"Democrats should focus on out-of-control homelessness, crime, regulations, and unaffordability in blue states instead of trying their hand at international dealmaking,\" White House spokesman Kush Desai said in a statement to Fox News Digital.\n\nNewsom, considered a potential 2028 presidential contender, announced plans to seek \"strategic\" international partnerships to exclude California from the retaliatory tariffs imposed on the U.S. by countries caught in the crosshairs of Trump's tariffs.\n\n\"I'm pursuing trading relationships with our global partners to combat the pain of Trump's tariffs and exclude California-made products from retaliation.

Beijing retaliated after Trump announced 34% tariffs against China on top of the 20% already imposed against the country earlier this year.\n\n\"The U.S. side's threat to escalate tariffs against China is a mistake on top of a mistake, once again exposing the American side's blackmailing nature,\" China's commerce ministry said.\n\n\"If the U.S. insists on having its way, China will fight to the end,\" it added.\n\nChinese manufacturers are warning about the impact on profits, looking into new overseas plants and haggling with customers over prices in response to the tariffs.\n\nThe Chinese people \"do not provoke trouble, nor are we afraid of it,\" Lin Jian, a spokesperson for China's foreign ministry, said at a press conference, adding that \"the Chinese people's legitimate right to development must not be deprived.\"\n\nThis is an excerpt from an article by Fox Business' Landon Mion\n\nSymbol Price Change %Change TSLA $233.29 -6.14 -2.56\n\nTesla shares have declined over 50% since December when they reach record highs.\n\nElon Musk, touted as the wealthiest person in the world, lost an estimated $4.4 billion on April 7 after ( NASDAQ:TSLA ) took extended stock loses bringing his fortune to $297.8 billion, according to Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nMusk said he hopes for a \"zero-tariff\" system between the U.S. and Europe that would effectively create \"a free-trade zone.\"\n\nUS Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent says that he and trade representative Jamieson Greer have been tasked by President Donald Trump to open negotiations and to implement the president's vision for the \" New Golden Age of Global Trade .\"\n\n\"Former National Economic Council chief economist Joe LaVorgna discussed on \"Making Money\" the chance for a recession in 2025, saying \"Wall Street has been bracing for slower growth, lower earnings and a whole lot of both things, including maybe a recession.\"\n\nTrump's recent actions have been associated with major financial market selloff and increased the risk of a recession.\n\nCountries around the globe are retaliating and there seems to be confusion about whether the tariffs are going to remain in place or if there will be negotiations if other countries are willing to come to an agreement and reduce their own barriers.\n\nOn \"Special Report,\" Fox News senior congressional correspondent Aishah Hasnie explains how there is a clash between Republican lawmakers in both chambers over President Donald Trump's tariffs and budget bill.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson , R-La., believes if you can get in the president's space, you will understand that his strategy is playing out, however many members of Congress are becoming anxious.\n\nRep.

The bill is identical to a bipartisan effort in the Senate that's gaining Republican support.\n\nHowever, Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyo., says Trump is fully within his authority and he appreciates what the president is doing on tariffs.\n\nValuetainment founder Patrick Bet-David weighs in on President Trump \"resetting\" global trade with his tariffs saying he's \"just happy the fact that he's up coming through on the promises that he made.\"\n\nBet-David also pointed out that this is something the president has been speaking about for over 37 years.\n\n\"Since 1988, when he was on Oprah Winfrey, he talked about the fact that America wasn't negotiating properly on our behalf. On tax payers, on us citizens. They weren't doing a good job at it. He's been saying this for a long time,\" said Bet-David. \"It's been 37 years and when he campaigned, he specifically set his favorite word as tariff.\"\n\nHe also pointed out that in 1996, Nancy Pelosi talked about the fact that it was unfair for China to charge us 35% on tariffs, \"while we're only charging 2%.\"\n\nBet-David said Pelosi made sense, unfortunately they couldn't execute.\n\n\"I have a feeling they're [China] soon going to be knocking on the door saying, let's figure out a deal here. But I don't know how long that's going to take,\" said Bet-David.\n\nLive Coverage begins here\n\nQuotes displayed in real-time or delayed by at least 15 minutes. Market data provided by Factset .

The president's \"declaration of economic independence\" will raise U.S. tariffs to the highest level in more than a century and amount to the largest tax increase on the American people since 1968 .\n\nHere's what has happened since the president shocked the world on Wednesday afternoon:\n\nMore than $6 trillion was wiped from U.S. equities on Thursday and Friday in the largest two-day loss in shareholder value on record.\n\nWall Street economists have slashed their growth forecasts and say the chances of a recession have increased significantly. \"There Will Be Blood,\" warned JPMorgan's head of economic research, as he raised the chances of a global recession from 40 percent to 60 percent.\n\nBeijing responded to \"Liberation Day\" by imposing a 34 percent tariff on all U.S. imports.\n\nTrump's 10 percent \"baseline\" tariff on all imports came into effect Saturday , and country-specific tariffs are set to start Wednesday. On Sunday, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said they would not be delayed .\n\nMore than 50 countries have contacted President Trump's team to start tariff negotiations, according to Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council.\n\nAs of Sunday night, stock futures indicated another brutal day ahead on Wall Street on Monday.\n\nToday in the pages of The Free Press , two leading historians put the tariffs-and the tumult they have triggered-in context. And they draw very different conclusions.\n\nUp first, Free Press columnist Niall Ferguson .\n\nYou probably understand the recent chaos one of two ways, writes Niall.\n\n\"Either a committed protectionist is trying to Make America Great Again by killing 'globalism,' ending 'forever wars,' and bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States.\" Or \"an unhinged demagogue is crashing both the world economy and the liberal international order, mainly to the benefit of authoritarian regimes.\"\n\nBut Niall says that what's really happening is something different-something far, far, bigger. He argues we are witnessing nothing less than the unraveling of Pax Americana .\n\n\"The American empire that came into existence after the failed autarky and isolationism of the 1930s is being broken up after 80 years. Despite Trump's imperial impulses-wanting to annex Greenland, calling for Canada to become the 51st state-he is engaged right now in a kind of wild decolonization project.\"\n\nRead Niall Ferguson on \" Trump's Tariffs and the End of American Empire .\"\n\nFellow historian Victor Davis Hanson sees things rather differently.\n\nWriting in The Free Press today, Victor explains why he thinks the panic of the last few days will come to be remembered as a hysterical overreaction. There's a logic to Trump's tariffs, he argues. And it's one that too many previous administrations have ignored.\n\nSo what is the thinking behind Trump's trade war? Why has it incurred such invective? And why is he prepared to take a political risk to fix trade imbalances in a way that no prior Republican dared?\n\nVictor argues that what the president is doing is no less than trying to end a 50-year injustice directed at the U.S.-and help the most overlooked Americans. This is a must-read if you want to understand the steelman case for what the president is doing.\n\nRead Victor Davis Hanson on \" Donald Trump's Just Trade War .\"\n\nYou might think that steelworkers would be over the moon about Trump's tariff package, but as Ethan Dodd reports, this politically important, pro-Trump constituency is surprisingly ambivalent. As Richard Tikey, the vice president of USW Local 1557, tells Ethan, \"They're jacking up the price. So with interest rates higher, inflation's high, where does the working man make out with that?\"\n\nRead \" What Do American Steelworkers Think About Trump's Tariffs? \"\n\nFor another perspective on what Trump's tariffs will mean for the U.S. economy, Free Press reporter Olivia Reingold went to Manhattan's Garment District. She spoke to small business owners in the import-dependent apparel industry, and let's just say they're not exactly feeling liberated. \"It's scary, it's scary-you don't want to get a panic attack,\" said Raj Arora, an Indian immigrant who runs Bazar Fabrics. \"The best thing is to take it easy. I cannot think about it 24/7.\"\n\nRead \" Garment District Owners: Trump's Tariffs 'Going to Be a Killer' . \"\n\nRead Kat Rosenfield on a much-hyped, deeply pessimistic new Hulu show.\n\nPaid subscribers can now join livestream chats with our reporters, subjects, and columnists to get our take on the biggest stories of the day.\n\nLast week, we hosted two conversations: Bari spoke to our new columnist Tyler Cowen on what \"Liberation Day\" means for the American consumer and the world. And Frannie Block met with the father of a young boy who was smeared as a hate criminal in a 2022 case that turned out to be a cry for help . Both conversations were recorded, so paid subscribers can enjoy every minute.\n\nIf you're not one already, now is the time to upgrade (you can do so by clicking right here !) to watch the following:\n\nBari Weiss and Tyler Cowen on Tariffs, AI, China, and More\n\nFrannie Block Discusses How a Town Turned a Child's 'Cry for Help' Into a Hate Crime\n\nElon Musk said Saturday he hopes for a \"zero tariff situation\" between the United States and Europe, in an apparent break with Donald Trump. On X, Musk made some less-than-flattering comments about Trump trade adviser and arch-protectionist Peter Navarro. On Sunday, Navarro said that Musk \"doesn't understand\" how other countries cheat the U.S. on trade, but insisted there was no rift between Musk and the administration.\n\nIs the #Resistance back? Protesters rallied against the Trump administration across the country Saturday. Organizers said that at least 1,300 \"Hands Off\" rallies were planned by more than 150 groups in all 50 states, and that they wanted the focus to be on pocketbook issues.\n\nIn a sign that God has a sense of humor, Trump's dismantling of the global economic order has coincided with the departure of one of the most vocal cheerleaders of globalization-and bogeyman to the populist right-World Economic Forum founder Klaus Schwab. The Davos circus master announced on Thursday that he'd \"start the process\" of stepping down as chair of the group's board of trustees.\n\nOn Sunday, newly minted health secretary RFK Jr., who has been blamed by some for the surge in vaccine skepticism in America, went to the funeral of an 8-year-old girl who died of measles. The child, who was unvaccinated and reportedly had no underlying conditions, died at a Lubbock, Texas, hospital on Thursday, and is the second confirmed case of a person in the U.S. succumbing to the disease in a decade. Nearly 500 cases have been reported since the outbreak in West Texas in January, with cases spreading to Oklahoma and New Mexico. \"My intention was to come down here quietly to console the families and to be with the community in their moment of grief,\" Kennedy posted on X of his visit, adding that \"the most effective way to prevent the spread of measles is the MMR vaccine.\" In the past, RFK Jr. has hinted that the MMR shot may have led to a rise in autism, based on one widely debunked study . The CDC, under Kennedy, has started expanding its research into possible links between autism and vaccines.\n\nHas the mystery at the heart of Signalgate been solved? Ever since Jeffrey Goldberg published his extraordinary account of being a fly on the wall in a groupchat as the nation's top security officials coordinated an air strike on Yemen two weeks ago, it's been unclear how exactly National Security Adviser Mike Waltz wound up adding the editor of The Atlantic to the conversation. The latest theory, courtesy of The Guardian , is that Goldberg's number was inadvertently saved under the name of National Security Council spokesman Brian Hughes. The White House claims the confusion happened because Waltz's iPhone automatically and erroneously suggested he \"update\" Hughes' number. In other words, don't blame Waltz. Blame Siri.\n\nIn the Oval Office on Thursday, far-right 9/11 truther Laura Loomer reportedly provided Donald Trump with a list of White House national security figures she believed were disloyal to the president. By the end of the day, six National Security Council officials were out of a job. Trump later called Loomer a \"great patriot\" and denied the firings had anything to do with the meeting.\n\nAlex Ovechkin surpassed Wayne Gretzky to become the greatest scorer in NHL history on Sunday. Gretzky was in attendance to witness the record-setting 895th goal scored by the Washington Capitals veteran in a game against the New York Islanders. \"I was really happy for him. I felt like I scored the goal,\" Gretzky said . In other sports news, the University of Connecticut women's basketball team won its 12th national championship with an easy 82-59 victory over the University of South Carolina. It was UConn's 16th Final Four appearance in the last 17 years-but \"only\" its first championship since 2016.\n\nCORRECTION: A previous version of this digest stated that \"Dying for Sex\" appears on Netflix when, in fact, it is a Hulu show. The Free Press regrets the error.\n\nWhen President Nixon courted cheap manufacturing in China, we had a disaster. We closed factories in the  Midwest and the South, throwing millions of US citizens out of work and onto unemployment.\n\nAt the time, I thought this was especially shortsighted. China subsidized manufacturing in China and US companies lapped this up.\n\nDid China play fair? No! They flooded our country with shoddy goods.\n\nWe are now reaping the other half of the equation. We need to bring jobs back to the USA. We can do it!\n\nAt least China can't steal our technology unless we let it. Keep  the industrial spies out of our universities and let's make our country bigger and better.\n\nIt is an existential battle between Main Street and the Masters of Beltway and Brussels.  And, the latter always win.\n\nFP authors fail to see we lost for the time being our imbecile Potus, and the Beltway foreign \"salvation\" policy of missle-ing a new handful of countries every year with death, destruction, peace corps volunteers, buying up all the media and parachuting in a thousand Hunter Bidens to suck the survivors dry (not necessarily in that order)..\n\nThe last Biden year to finance above, the US had debt to GNP nearly double South Africa (Yes, South Africa) according to Trading Economics.   The dead beat borrowers will be back in control soon.  The authors need to forget the hysteria.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "The latest rumor , when I started drafting this column, was that President Trump will suspend the tariffs for a 90-day period, with the exception of those on China. Markets started going back up again.\n\nBut \"the very latest information\" doesn't stay current for long these days. The new report -but don't count on it-is that the 90-day pause is not real after all. That revision came out before this draft was finished. And markets again whipsawed.\n\nThe Trump administration has created a new monster-one of unpredictability and erratic behavior. We simply cannot predict with any degree of accuracy what will happen next. By the time you are reading this article, there will probably be some newer report about the tariffs or threat of tariffs, and then another report after that.\n\nEven if the White House winds up instituting a pause on the proposed tariffs-or ultimately adopts much better economic policies-this seesawing may plunge the American and perhaps also the global economy into recession.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "It's Monday, March 31. This is The Front Page , your daily window into the world of The Free Press -and our take on the world at large. Coming up: A hate crime hoax. A Canadian's ICE ordeal. Trump threatens to bomb Iran. And more.\n\nBut first: Donald Trump and the rule of law.\n\nYesterday, President Trump said, \"I'm not joking\" about trying to serve a third term, telling NBC news via telephone \"there are methods which you could do it.\" When NBC's Kristen Welker asked Trump if one potential avenue to a third term was having Vice President J.D. Vance run for the top job and \"then pass the baton to you,\" the president said, \"Well, that's one. But there are others too.\" He didn't elaborate about what those methods might be.\n\nThe Twenty-Second Amendment says \"No person shall be elected to the office of the President more than twice.\"\n\nFrom talking of a third term, to the administration using immigration law to crack down on campus unrest, to DOGE dismantling congressionally created agencies like USAID, the Trump administration has made a habit of testing the boundaries of, and in some cases disregarding, the rule of law.\n\nConsider another example:\n\nToday in The Free Press , Yale constitutional law professor Jed Rubenfeld looks at Trump's legally shaky war against Big Law. Over the past month, the White House has issued five executive orders targeting white-shoe law firms that employed or otherwise associated with anti-Trump lawyers, revoking security clearances held by their employees, ordering \"reviews\" and possible terminations of government contracts with their clients, prohibiting their lawyers from \"engaging\" with government employees and perhaps even from entering federal buildings , which of course includes courthouses.\n\nThe sins of one firm include engaging in \"partisan representations to achieve political ends,\" litigating in favor of affirmative action, doing pro bono work for illegal immigrants, and employing Robert Mueller, among other constitutionally protected activities.\n\n\"Trump is sending a message,\" writes Rubenfeld. \"Don't tell me about due process and the First Amendment, not after Democrats for years threw due process out the window, systematically suppressed speech online, and sought to bankrupt and lock up the leading Republican presidential candidate through unconstitutional prosecutions.\"\n\nBut two wrongs don't make a right, and Rubenfeld worries about the consequences: \"a spiral into ever-increasing unconstitutionality, first by one administration, then the next.\"\n\nRead: \" Jed Rubenfeld: Donald Trump's War on Big Law .\"\n\n\"My Two Weeks in ICE Detention Hell\"\n\nEarlier this month, Jasmine Mooney, a Canadian worker at an American health and business brand, walked into an immigration office in San Diego to renew her work visa, something she had done with little difficulty one year earlier. This time, however, because of a previous discrepancy involving her company's letterhead, she was shackled and held in an ICE detention center for two weeks despite her offer to return to Canada voluntarily at her own expense. If a friend hadn't connected her with a sympathetic journalist who reported on her plight, she might still be there.\n\nToday in The Free Press , Jasmine tells her chilling story, exposing the bureaucratic nightmare that is ICE detention, and the pernicious profit motives that prop it up.\n\nRead: \" 'I Applied for a Work Visa-and Was Thrown in Prison for Weeks' . \"\n\nHe Protested Hamas. They Killed Him for It.\n\nLast week, the largest Palestinian protests against Hamas since October 7, 2023, erupted all over the Gaza Strip. For three straight days, thousands of courageous Gazans took to the streets-from Beit Lahia and Jabalia in the north to Deir al-Balah and the Nuseirat refugee camp in the center, and even in the Hamas stronghold of Khan Younis-openly defying the terrorist group they blame for the brutal 18-month-long war.\n\nIn partnership with the Center for Peace Communications, The Free Press obtained exclusive footage from across the Gaza Strip and spoke to the participants. (Since we published the video on Friday , one of the protests' leaders, 22-year old Odai Saadi, was tragically tortured and killed by Hamas.) Watch the video here:\n\nPennsylvania Mom Wins Lawsuit over School's DEI Records\n\nIn 2020, Ann Trethewey, a Pennsylvania mom who raised three kids in suburban Philadelphia, learned that her local school district was phasing in a new curriculum focusing on DEI and \"trauma-based learning.\" Concerned, Ann filed a \"Right to Know\" request-a local version of the Freedom of Information Act-to find out exactly what DEI materials the school was using. The school district responded by saying its DEI training materials were \"trade secrets,\" and refused to hand them over. So she sued. Now, after two years, she's finally won a ruling in Pennsylvania's Commonwealth Court.\n\nToday in The Free Press, reporter Frannie Block sits down with Ann to discuss the case, how Trump's win changed the tide, and why, even after last month's ruling, Trethewey still doesn't have the documents she asked for.\n\nRead: \" Mom Who Sued School for DEI Records Told They're 'a Trade Secret' \"\n\nHow One Town Turned a Child's \"Cry For Help\" Into a Hate Crime\n\nSpeaking of Frannie Block , on Saturday we published her explosive piece about Mike Klotz, whose family was driven out of their hometown in Evanston, Illinois, after his son was falsely accused of helping perpetrate a supposed hate crime-which was actually a child's cry for help. Many of you were as shocked by this story as we were and wanted to learn more. Now you can.\n\nTomorrow, exclusively for paid subscribers of The Free Press , Frannie will sit down with Klotz for a livestream about his family's ordeal.\n\nCome to our website on Tuesday, April 1, at 5 p.m. ET to watch the conversation. If you aren't a paid subscriber, that's easily remedied: Click the button below to sign up.\n\nIn an NBC interview yesterday, Trump threatened to bomb Iran if it doesn't make a deal with the United States over its nuclear program. Tehran rejected direct negotiations with Trump last week. \"If they don't make a deal, there will be bombing,\" Trump said. \"It will be bombing the likes of which they have never seen before.\" The president also said he was \"very angry\" and \"pissed off\" at Vladimir Putin for attacking Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelenky's credibility, and threatened a 50 percent tariff on countries buying Russian oil if Russia did not agree to a ceasefire in Ukraine.\n\nOn Friday, a 7.7 magnitude earthquake hit near Mandalay, the second-largest city in civil war-stricken Myanmar, killing more than 1,600 people and leaving countless others buried underneath the rubble. The same earthquake killed 18 people in nearby Thailand. Foreign aid from China, India, Russia, and other nations has been dispatched, but amid the dismantling of USAID , so far the United States has sent nothing-despite a promise from the U.S. embassy in Yangon to provide up to $2 million in aid. On Friday, USAID staffers, who were preparing a response to the earthquake, received an agency-wide email announcing the administration's plans to lay off all but 15 legally required positions.\n\nFor the next several days severe storms are predicted to ravage the country from Texas to the East Coast, putting millions at risk for tornadoes, hail, flash flooding, and destructive winds across two dozen states.\n\nMultiple Republicans, including Oklahoma senator James Lankford and Mississippi senator Roger Wicker, have joined Democrats in calling for an investigation into last week's Signal fiasco, in which National Security Adviser Mike Waltz added Atlantic editor in chief Jeffrey Goldberg to a group chat where top officials discussed plans to bomb Houthi rebels in Yemen.\n\nYesterday, Wisconsin's attorney general Josh Kaul asked the state's top court to block Elon Musk from giving away $1 million checks to two voters at his town hall later in the day-which Musk is holding to rally support behind a conservative candidate for Wisconsin's Supreme Court. The Supreme Court rejected the AG's request . The AG argued that Musk is using his money to persuade people to vote in the Supreme Court election-in violation of state law. Two lower courts also declined to intervene.\n\nThe Final Four is set and there isn't a Cinderella team in the bunch. In fact, all four teams are the number-one seeds. Why? Because the big teams from the powerful leagues like the SEC, the ACC, and the Big 12 all have consortia that see to it that their players make money from their name, image, and likeness, something the Supreme Court allowed in 2021 . Indeed, good players from smaller schools are increasingly transferring to schools like, well, Auburn, Florida, Duke, and Houston, the Final Four teams. Consider: Cooper Flagg, Duke's top player, has $4.8 million in NIL deals, according to On3 . Houston star L.J. Cryer transferred from Texas and now has $769,000 worth of NIL deals. Walter Clayton Jr.'s NIL money is undisclosed-but he did turn down $6.9 million to stay with the team. And while Auburn star Johni Broome's NIL fees are also unknown, he has deals with Thayers Skin Care, Freddy's Steakburgers, and C4 Energy, among other companies. So he's also likely doing just fine. As for those Cinderella teams who once made the NCAA men's basketball tournament so exciting, the glass slipper just doesn't fit anymore.\n\nYep, the same way I hate Hitler, Stalin, Putin, and all despots and wannabes. I might remind you that Hitler was much admired for making Germany great again before he destroyed it.\n\nSo Trump is angry at Russia and Iran. Maybe they can curry favor with hundreds of cherry trees like the Japanese before bombing Pearl Harbor and shaking us out of the original \"America First\" movement and into WWII. Trump is already jailing and deporting dissidents. He is building up our military. Is war in the future? Watch for the gift of a Trojan Horse from Russia, Iran, North Korea, or China.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "Liberation Day has come and gone, and sorry to say, I do not feel any freer. At least on the surface, Donald Trump's announcement, made yesterday in the Rose Garden, goes well beyond the more pessimistic expectations.\n\nCATO scholar Scott Lincicome summed up the executive order best:\n\nTrump's reciprocal tariffs:\n\n1) Impose hundreds of billions of dollars in new taxes on Americans without public/congressional input\n\n2) Are based on secret calculations that have little, if any, connection to actual foreign trade barriers\n\n3) Ignore all U.S. tariff/nontariff barriers, which in some cases are quite high\n\n4) Are justified by a \"national emergency\" that reflects a total misunderstanding of how trade deficits work\n\n5) Disregard U.S. trade agreement commitments, including ones made by Trump himself\n\n6) Will make us all poorer, and likely do real and lasting harm to the U.S. economy (including in manufacturing)\n\n7) Embolden our adversaries around the world.\n\nAnd those are just the ones off the top of my head.\n\nMarkets responded accordingly , with the Canadian currency hit especially hard and S&P futures sinking immediately .\n\nWith President Trump one never quite knows what one is going to get, so any assessment needs to be provisional. But that is a big part of the broader problem-high and persistent uncertainty about the basic rules of the game.\n\nLike a game show host, Trump announced a series of tariff rates on many of America's major trading partners.\n\nHow did he come up with the rates?\n\nNo posts"

This lead in party affiliation not only propelled him to the White House last November. It also continues to buoy his job approval ratings despite voter concerns over inflation and the economy.\n\nRepublicans and Republican-leaning voters outnumber Democratic-aligned ones, 45 percent to 41 percent, according to the most recent NBC News poll . The GOP hasn't held such an edge in more than three decades.\n\nHow did this happen? The answer lies in two trends: a gradual but steady strengthening in the GOP brand since 2018, and a dramatic plunge in Democratic affiliation since 2020.\n\nNo posts"
