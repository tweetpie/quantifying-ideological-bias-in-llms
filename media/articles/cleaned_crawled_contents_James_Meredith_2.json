      "text": "'Paid in blood': How the loss of Supreme Court legitimacy can lead to political violence\n\nAmericans are gearing up to celebrate the Fourth of July, and their thoughts are most likely on how many hot dogs to buy for the cookout and whether a family member needs to go stake out a good spot to watch the parade and fireworks.\n\nWhile the holiday is focused on revelry, July Fourth actually commemorates a solemn moment in the country's history, when it declared independence from the colonial power Great Britain . The institutions of government imagined by the founders and their successors over the following decades - among them the presidency, Congress, the departments of State and Treasury, the Supreme Court - have retained their authority and legitimacy for more than 200 years, weathering challenges from wars both internal and abroad and massive economic, political and social upheaval.\n\nBut now, the Supreme Court, in the wake of a series of highly controversial rulings and ethical questions about some justices, is experiencing historically low public standing . And that has prompted a national conversation about the court's legitimacy. It's even drawn rare public comment from three sitting Supreme Court justices .\n\nWhat's referred to by experts as the problem of \"judicial legitimacy\" may seem abstract, but the court's faltering public support is about more than popularity.\n\nEroding legitimacy means that government officials and ordinary people become increasingly unlikely to accept public policies with which they disagree. And Americans need only look to the relatively recent past to understand the stakes of the court's growing legitimacy problem.\n\nThe Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education shined a light on many white Americans' tenuous loyalty to the authority of the federal judiciary.\n\nIn Brown, the court unanimously held that racial segregation in public education violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment . The justices were abundantly aware that their decision would evoke strong emotions. So Chief Justice Earl Warren worked tirelessly to ensure that the court issued a unanimous, short and readable opinion designed to calm the anticipated popular opposition .\n\nWarren's efforts were in vain. Rather than recognizing the court's authoritative interpretation of the Constitution, many white Americans participated in an extended, violent campaign of resistance to the desegregation ruling.\n\nThe integration of the University of Mississippi in 1962 provides a pointed example of this resistance.\n\nThe Supreme Court had backed a lower federal court that ordered the university to admit James Meredith , a Black Air Force veteran. But Mississippi Gov. Ross Barnett led a wide-ranging effort to stop Meredith from enrolling at Ole Miss, including deploying state and local police to prevent Meredith from entering campus.\n\nOn Sunday, Sept. 30, 1962 , Meredith nevertheless arrived on the university's campus, guarded by dozens of federal marshals, to register and begin classes the next day. A crowd of 2,000 to 3,000 people gathered on campus and broke into a riot. Meredith and the marshals were attacked with Molotov cocktails and gunfire. The marshals fired tear gas in return.\n\nIn response, President John F. Kennedy invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807 and ordered the U.S. Army onto campus to restore order and protect Meredith. Overnight, thousands of troops arrived, battling rioters.\n\nThe violence finally ended after 15 hours, leaving two civilians dead - both killed by rioters - and dozens of wounded marshals and soldiers in addition to hundreds of injuries among the insurgent mob.\n\nThe next day, Oct. 1, Meredith enrolled in the university and attended his first class, but thousands of troops remained in Mississippi for months afterward to preserve order.\n\nWhat some call \"the Battle of Oxford \" was fueled by white racism and segregation, but it played out against the backdrop of weak judicial legitimacy. Federal courts did not command enough respect among state officials or ordinary white Mississippians to protect the constitutional rights of Black Mississippians. Neither Gov. Barnett nor the thousands of Oxford rioters were willing to follow the court order for Meredith to enroll at the university.\n\nIn the end, the Constitution and the federal courts prevailed only because Kennedy backed them with the Army. But the cost of weak judicial legitimacy was paid in blood.\n\nIn contrast, when people believe in the legitimacy of their governing institutions, they are more likely to accept, respect and abide by the rules the government - including the courts - ask them to live under, even when the stakes are high and the consequences are far-reaching.\n\nFor example, two decades ago, the Supreme Court resolved a disputed presidential election in Bush v. Gore , centered on the counting of ballots in Florida. This time, the court was deeply divided along ideological lines, and its long, complicated and fragmented opinion was based on questionable legal reasoning .\n\nBut in 2000, the court enjoyed more robust legitimacy among the public than it does today. As a consequence, Florida officials ceased recounting disputed ballots. Vice President Al Gore conceded the election to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, specifically accepting the Supreme Court's pivotal ruling .\n\nNo Democratic senator challenged the validity of Florida's disputed Electoral College votes for Bush. Congress certified the Electoral College's vote , and Bush was inaugurated .\n\nDemocrats were surely disappointed, and some protested . But the court was viewed as sufficiently legitimate to produce enough acceptance by enough people to ensure a peaceful transition of power. There was no violent riot; there was no open resistance.\n\nIndeed, on the very night that Gore conceded, the chants of his supporters gathered outside tacitly accepted the outcome: \" Gore in four! \" - as if to say, \"We'll get you next time, because we believe there will be a next time.\"\n\nBut what happens when institutions fail to retain citizens' loyalty?\n\nThe Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection showcased the consequences of broken legitimacy. The rioters who stormed the Capitol had lost faith in systems that undergird American democracy: counting presidential votes in the states, tallying Electoral College ballots and settling disputes over election law in the courts .\n\nThe men and women who stormed the Capitol may have believed their country was being stolen, even if such beliefs were baseless. So, they rebelled in the face of a result they didn't like.\n\nThe threat of further unrest is real. Polls show the 2024 presidential election between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will be a close call , and it is likely that election results in several states will be challenged in federal courts. Some of these claims may raise good-faith questions about the administration of elections, while others advance more spurious claims intended to undermine faith in the election's outcome.\n\nIn the end, Americans' faith in the timely resolution of those cases and their peaceful acceptance of the presidential election's result will hinge on whether the losing candidate's supporters accept the legitimacy of the Supreme Court and the judiciary more broadly.\n\nNothing is certain in politics, but the specter of constitutional crisis looms over the United States. It's dangerously unclear whether the Supreme Court retains enough legitimacy to ensure acceptance of decisions addressing the upcoming election among those who find themselves on the losing side. If it doesn't, the court's abstract legitimacy problem could once again lead to violence and insurrection.\n\nThis story is an updated version of a story that was originally published on Oct. 31, 2022.\n\nMatthew Hall , Professor of Constitutional Studies, Political Science and Law, University of Notre Dame and Joseph Daniel Ura , Professor of Political Science and Chair of the Department of Political Science, Clemson University\n\nThis article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

      "text": "Why It Was So Easy For Rachel Dolezal to Slip Into Black Skin\n\nSo let's talk about Rachel Dolezal. You may already know the basics of Dolezal's case: she's the 37-year-old head of the NAACP chapter in Spokane, Washington; a professor of Africana studies at Eastern Washington University; and-here's where it gets kinda bananas-a white woman who has been passing as a black woman for years.\n\nWe know this not because of any misstep Dolezal made-she was essentially flawless in executing her ruse-but because her biological parents, from whom she's been estranged for years, decided to go on television and announce it. Dolezal, as it turns out, isn't actually African American at all, but German, Czech and Swedish, with a hint of Native American in there somewhere. In other words, the Rachel Dolezal story is a lot like Black Like Me , brought to actual 2015 life.\n\nThe whole thing might be a non-story if our long and twisted history of passing, which has roots that can be traced back to our country's very foundation, weren't understood to operate in only one direction. Some very fair black people, as a refuge from racism and persecution, have passed for a long time. Theophilus John McKee lived as a white man for four decades before his blackness was uncovered in 1948. This discovery may have helped kill him, considering he died of heart failure around five months after word got out. Writer Anatole Broyard only revealed his years of passing to his children on his deathbed. James Meredith had to have the National Guard protect him when he integrated Ole Miss in 1962, but the joke was on those dumb racists: Harry S. Murphy (who briefly passed for white and enrolled in the school from 1945-'46) had already attended the college undetected.\n\nBut Dolezal confounds our understanding of how passing is supposed to work. How many white people, given anonymity, would take the opportunity to become black? For the most part, even peddlers of the most bullshit \"post-racial\" and \"colorblind\" philosophies would opt to remain white, if they answered honestly. White privilege is a precious commodity.\n\nWhich is why Dolezal fascinates us. She flipped the script, and instead was committed to being black, going to great pains to make it so. This is a woman who attended Howard University, a historically black college, on full scholarship to earn her MFA. (Though new reports suggest she hadn't yet begun passing during her time there.) Her art, if her blog offers any insight into her larger body of work, is almost singularly focused on representations of blackness and messages of anti-racism.\n\nI don't doubt that Dolezal loved her black ex-husband (you would have to love someone to forgive them for writing you this love song ), but their marriage definitely fit neatly with the rest of the package. She adopted her African-American brothers, who had originally been adopted by her parents, and began calling them her sons. She kept up her tan unfailingly. And as Kara Brown noted at Jezebel , she must've spent a small fortune making her hair into a flawless version of every natural hairstyle known to black womanhood.\n\nAnd it worked, at least for a few years. Dolezal, like Black Like Me 's John Howard Griffin, couldn't change her blue eyes, but it actually didn't matter. She presented as a convincing fair-skinned African-American woman because there are plenty of bonafide black Americans who look like Dolezal. Our nation's legacy of slave rape, of hidden miscegenation that produced babies who looked an awful lot like the master, of secret relationships that ended with black men strung from trees-you know, the things so many of us like to pretend never happened just because we have a black president-all of these things have yielded African Americans of every hue and skin tone. Dolezal knew that racism requires whiteness be fragile, rendering anything that deviates even slightly from white-that falls under the one drop rule -non-white. Turning black was easy, a skin she could slip into, because the signage of blackness is so easily acquired. White supremacy couldn't maintain itself without exclusivity. A deep tan and a perm (and on a few occasions, locs and braids) was enough to get herself pitched out of the most elite club.\n\nDolezal has spent the last few years performing blackness, a role to which she was welcomed by unknowing members of the black community. (If black privilege or even reverse racism were real, entry would have eluded her.) Ask anyone who believes in respectability politics-the absurd idea that if (mostly) black people would just do the work of being whiter, racism would disappear-if that magic trick would work for the majority of African Americans.\n\nOr better yet, ask any black millionaire if racism has ceased to exist. You cannot \"whiten up\" because real whiteness is only for white people in this country. A key part of our history of passing for white is that it could get you killed; it was a very high-risk, high-yield investment. Playing at being white, gaming the system to take advantage of privilege that was meant to be off limits to you, was tremendously dangerous. To make extra certain that no people with even one drop of black blood were able to access that privilege, a number of states passed laws narrowing the definition of whiteness, including the Virginia Racial Integrity Act in 1924. The effects of those laws are still with us today. I am a \"light-skinned\" black woman and I guarantee you, were I to suddenly declare myself white tomorrow, an awful lot of (white) people would have serious problems with the idea, and possibly consider me insane.\n\nWhich is why this notion of transracialism, a made-up term that's surfaced in the wake of Dolezal's story, is so ridiculous. Social media is currently full of attempts to equate Dolezal's situation with that of Caitlyn Jenner. Conservatives, who never bought into this whole \"trans\" thing anyway, have wondered aloud (mostly to be provocative) why, if Caitlyn Jenner is a woman, Rachel Dolezal can't be black. But Caitlyn Jenner didn't just become a woman; as a trans person, she has been a woman for as long as she can remember. She's finally taken the step of having her exterior self correlate with who she always knew she was inside. Rachel Dolezal, until some number of years ago, was white: a person who identified as white, with a strong appreciation for blackness and black culture. But you cannot translate a love of a culture into a completely revamped identity. To pretend that one can merely snap her fingers and become black is silly.\n\nNot to mention audacious. And a sign of privilege itself. How ballsy is it not only to pretend to be black, but to wield it as part of what makes you ideal to head up your local NAACP? (For the record, the NAACP is an interracial organization; Dolezal could have held the position without the whole performance.) There's been a lot of writing on cultural appropriation and cooptation over the last few years, but Dolezal's story is a version of both that sounds so outlandish on its face it would be funny if the whole thing weren't so troubling. You cannot just make someone else's oppression your own because you are a passionate ally (that's actually doing the ally thing all wrong).\n\nPart of what led to the investigation of Dolezal's background were her repeated claims of racial har assment over the years. I would never, ever wish that anyone be subjected to racism, but I will say that I deeply and sincerely hope Dolezal didn't make up those claims to bolster her claims to black authenticity. That would do a tremendous disservice to us all, especially those of us who live with the real, unchosen-and often disbelieved-consequences of racism.\n\nI believe Rachel Dolezal started off as a white woman who had a deep and real interest in African-American arts and culture, in social justice, in being a principled adherent to the tenets of civil rights. And then something went off the rails. I cannot speak to the ruptures that seem to have occurred alongside her decision to \"become black\"-her refusal to speak to her family, and her continued insistence that she wants nothing to with them. For all any of us know, they could be wonderful parents who have done nothing wrong, or monsters with a daughter who made a terribly misguided attempt to escape her past. I do not know Dolezal's mental state, and I'm pretty sure the publications I've seen speculating about it should probably just stop it right there.\n\nBut what we can say is that Dolezal's advocacy for black people and black culture didn't have to be done from within black skin. And the assumption that it could be so easily forged, that she could speak to the experience of life as a black person (and here I mean literally; Dolezal often lectured on this stuff as if it were taken from her own background) without ever actually having had it, is offensive. And ironically, able to do less good. The sad reality of race in this country is that many white people tend to listen to and believe other white people more on matters of race and anti-racism than they do people of color. Rachel Dolezal would actually be a more effective voice against racism in her own white, privileged skin.\n\nI'm not sure what Rachel Dolezal's next steps are, but hopefully, they involve becoming herself again, and sharing the ideals she seems to believe in, which so many people could benefit from learning about. Only this time, as her real, authentic self."

      "text": "Will the Obama Generation Merge With the Protest Culture of MLK or Strike Its Own Path?\n\nSomehow, a man with three names has been reduced to four words. Say Martin Luther King Jr., and the phrase \"I Have a Dream\" comes to mind -- as if that sums up his life or his relevance to the events swirling around Washington this week with the inauguration of Barack Obama, a man who many mistake as King's spiritual son.\n\nAs the nation marks King's birthday, and he is elevated to the pantheon of officially sanctioned heroes, many forget that he was a man who led a movement, who never sought office, and whose contribution was as a teacher of moral laws and an activist in righteous struggles. We mark his birthday only because so many fought for its recognition.\n\nThe movement that King led is, in fact, still alive and met -- as a shell of its former self -- in New York last week at a summit organized by the Rev. Jesse Jackson, one of King's disciples. There, the economy -- and how its collapse is impacting  the people King gave his life for, like the striking sanitation workers of Memphis, Tenn. -- was center stage .\n\nThat movement is battling to redefine its program at a time when activists have moved from the streets to digital platforms, from  face to face to Facebook, from tumult to Twitter, from agitation in the streets to deal making in the suites.\n\nJackson, of course knows about this divide and tried to cross it boldly in 1984 and 1988 in two historic residential campaigns that shook up the Democratic Party. He won primaries and the party rule changes that permitted the proportional allocation of primary votes that gave Obama a string of victories.\n\nJust as Obama reached into organizer Cesar Chavez's tool kit for the phrase \"Si  Se Puede! (Yes We Can!),\" Jackson's living legacy is a largely unacknowledged building block in the chain of history that has taken us to this point. His tears at the victory rally in Chicago were connected to a history that our media often buries.\n\nI spoke to Jackson for a film  I am making with Videovision's Anant Singh about the Obama campaign. I asked him about what was going through his mind on that joyous night in Grant Park, where, back in 1968, many heads were broken by the police.\n\n\" Really, it was two things,\"  he told me.  \"It was the draw of the moment. In my mind's eye, I saw martyrs whose caskets I walked behind and friends with whom I worked, who are somewhere in poverty or dead.  Children in villages of Kenya, Haiti, who could not afford a television, or somewhere around some radio, hoping that there'd be this great redemptive, transformative  breakthrough.\n\n\"So it was the draw of that moment, and most of the people I knew who live down in Alabama or Mississippi who made this moment happen couldn't afford to be there. And I felt them.  And it was also a journey, the journey to get  us there. \"\n\nMemories flooded in and he  spoke with almost a stream of consciousness:\n\n\" I was jailed trying to use  a public library, along with seven of my classmates. ... We couldn't  take a picture in the state capitol, but dogs could. ... Many of us  killed for the right to vote. ... James Meredith shot. ... Two Jews  were killed because they were seen as meddling in Mississippi politics. ... Rev. James Reeve, Jimmy Lee Jackson, these people, these mostly nameless, faceless martyrs, they made the big part of it possible. And often, those who make the big part possible are not invited to the party. They can't afford to come to the party.\n\n\" And I wept again for them, because I wanted them to be there, and I thought that if Doctor came, Chavez maybe just be there for a moment in time, and  I just kept thinking about Martin Luther King, just like ... if they were just there for a  moment in time, my whole life would have been fulfilled.  So I was thinking about the joy and the journey.  That kind of took me to a level of ecstasy and joy. \"\n\nThis was not a history referenced  by most commentators covering the Obama campaign.\n\nThere is a complicated tension between civil rights leaders and President-elect Obama. Their difference is more about how change can made -- will it all come from the inside through an inherently conservative, compromised and bureaucratic political process, or does there need to be pressure  from the outside at the grassroots, or \"street heat\" as one of the reverend's supporters  put it?\n\nIs the movement model fashioned by King and civil rights organization calling for activism still needed, or is it passé? Is there still a need and role for the Rev. Jacksons?\n\nWith Obama mounting a charm offensive to neutralize enemies and seduce opponents on the right, it seems that he is running away from progressive supporters. After he met with hard-right commentators last week, Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of The  Nation , the first publication to endorse Jackson years back, asked why  progressive supporters were being ignored.\n\nObama came out of the Saul  Alinsky tradition of community organizing. While Alinsky's most famous  book was called Reveille For Radicals , by the time I met and worked with him in a real organizing school in 1965, he had become a reformer and pragmatist, quiet on the Vietnam War, solicitous of liberal Democrats and hostile to student movements.\n\nJesse Jackson remains an organizer in the big-tent movement tradition. He was preaching Rainbow Coalition for decades before Obama made the idea jell politically.\n\nPUSH, an acronym for People United to Save Humanity, is firmly pro-peace and economic justice and was founded by Jackson. Obama has so far been eloquent at tapping movement rhetoric, but he seems distant, even dismissive, of movement culture. Many of his most devoted backers want to know if he is married to promoting change or just shucking and jiving. Will he remain an advocate for transforming the system or become a prisoner of power? Will he turn his back on King's  commitment to nonviolence, or has he already?\n\nCan the Obama generation and the King-Jackson culture -- one with an outside-in strategy, the other inside-out -- merge, or are they inherently in conflict? Will Obama give his predecessors the props they deserve? Can the fight for change that Jackson and Obama embrace work on many levels?  If Obama can reconcile with Republicans, why not with the long marchers of the Rainbow?\n\nThese are questions that will  soon be tested in a new administration that starts this week."

      "text": "Political experts break down the Supreme Court's crisis of legitimacy\n\nEroding legitimacy means that government officials and ordinary people become increasingly unlikely to accept public policies with which they disagree. And Americans need only look to the relatively recent past to understand the stakes of the court's growing legitimacy problem.\n\nThe Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v. Board of Education shined a light on many white Americans' tenuous loyalty to the authority of the federal judiciary.\n\nIn Brown, the court unanimously held that racial segregation in public education violates the equal protection clause of the 14th Amendment . The justices were abundantly aware that their decision would evoke strong emotions. So Chief Justice Earl Warren worked tirelessly to ensure that the court issued a unanimous, short and readable opinion designed to calm the anticipated popular opposition .\n\nWarren's efforts were in vain. Rather than recognizing the court's authoritative interpretation of the Constitution, many white Americans participated in an extended, violent campaign of resistance to the desegregation ruling.\n\nThe integration of the University of Mississippi in 1962 provides a pointed example of this resistance.\n\nThe Supreme Court had backed a lower federal court that ordered the university to admit James Meredith , a Black Air Force veteran. But Mississippi Gov. Ross Barnett led a wide-ranging effort to stop Meredith from enrolling at Ole Miss, including deploying state and local police to prevent Meredith from entering campus.\n\nOn Sunday, Sept. 30, 1962 , Meredith nevertheless arrived on the university's campus, guarded by dozens of federal marshals, to register and begin classes the next day. A crowd of 2,000 to 3,000 people gathered on campus and broke into a riot. Meredith and the marshals were attacked with Molotov cocktails and gunfire. The marshals fired tear gas in return.\n\nIn response, President John F. Kennedy invoked the Insurrection Act of 1807 and ordered the U.S. Army onto campus to restore order and protect Meredith. Overnight, thousands of troops arrived, battling rioters.\n\nThe violence finally ended after 15 hours, leaving two civilians dead - both killed by rioters - and dozens of wounded marshals and soldiers in addition to hundreds of injuries among the insurgent mob.\n\nThe next day, Oct. 1, Meredith enrolled in the university and attended his first class, but thousands of troops remained in Mississippi for months afterward to preserve order.\n\nWhat some call \"the Battle of Oxford \" was fueled by white racism and segregation, but it played out against the backdrop of weak judicial legitimacy. Federal courts did not command enough respect among state officials or ordinary white Mississippians to protect the constitutional rights of Black Mississippians. Neither Gov. Barnett nor the thousands of Oxford rioters were willing to follow the court order for Meredith to enroll at the university.\n\nIn the end, the Constitution and the federal courts prevailed only because Kennedy backed them with the Army. But the cost of weak judicial legitimacy was paid in blood.\n\nIn contrast, when people believe in the legitimacy of their governing institutions, they are more likely to accept, respect and abide by the rules the government - including the courts - ask them to live under, even when the stakes are high and the consequences are far-reaching.\n\nFor example, two decades ago, the Supreme Court resolved a disputed presidential election in Bush v. Gore , centered on the counting of ballots in Florida. This time, the court was deeply divided along ideological lines, and its long, complicated and fragmented opinion was based on questionable legal reasoning .\n\nBut in 2000, the court enjoyed more robust legitimacy among the public than it does today. As a consequence, Florida officials ceased recounting disputed ballots. Vice President Al Gore conceded the election to Texas Gov. George W. Bush, specifically accepting the Supreme Court's pivotal ruling .\n\nNo Democratic senator challenged the validity of Florida's disputed Electoral College votes for Bush.

      "text": "'Paid in blood': How the loss of Supreme Court legitimacy can lead to political violence\n\nAmericans are gearing up to celebrate the Fourth of July, and their thoughts are most likely on how many hot dogs to buy for the cookout and whether a family member needs to go stake out a good spot to watch the parade and fireworks.\n\nWhile the holiday is focused on revelry, July Fourth actually commemorates a solemn moment in the country's history, when it declared independence from the colonial power Great Britain . The institutions of government imagined by the founders and their successors over the following decades - among them the presidency, Congress, the departments of State and Treasury, the Supreme Court - have retained their authority and legitimacy for more than 200 years, weathering challenges from wars both internal and abroad and massive economic, political and social upheaval.\n\nBut now, the Supreme Court, in the wake of a series of highly controversial rulings and ethical questions about some justices, is experiencing historically low public standing . And that has prompted a national conversation about the court's legitimacy. It's even drawn rare public comment from three sitting Supreme Court justices .\n\nWhat's referred to by experts as the problem of \"judicial legitimacy\" may seem abstract, but the court's faltering public support is about more than popularity.\n\nEroding legitimacy means that government officials and ordinary people become increasingly unlikely to accept public policies with which they disagree. And Americans need only look to the relatively recent past to understand the stakes of the court's growing legitimacy problem.\n\nThe Supreme Court's 1954 decision in Brown v.

So, they rebelled in the face of a result they didn't like.\n\nThe threat of further unrest is real. Polls show the 2024 presidential election between President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump will be a close call , and it is likely that election results in several states will be challenged in federal courts. Some of these claims may raise good-faith questions about the administration of elections, while others advance more spurious claims intended to undermine faith in the election's outcome.\n\nIn the end, Americans' faith in the timely resolution of those cases and their peaceful acceptance of the presidential election's result will hinge on whether the losing candidate's supporters accept the legitimacy of the Supreme Court and the judiciary more broadly.\n\nNothing is certain in politics, but the specter of constitutional crisis looms over the United States.

      "text": "Building Organizations or Creating Movements? How Two Theories on Change Can Work Together\n\nAlthough Saul Alinsky, the founding father of modern community organizing in the United States, passed away in 1972, he is still invoked by the right as a dangerous harbinger of looming insurrection. And although his landmark book, \"Rules for Radicals,\" is now nearly 45 years old, the principles that emerged from Alinsky's work have influenced every generation of community organizers that has come since.\n\nThe most lasting of Alinsky's prescriptions are not his well-known tactical guidelines - \"ridicule is man's most potent weapon\" or \"power is not only what you have, but what the enemy thinks you have.\" Rather, they are embedded in a set of organizational practices and predispositions, a defined approach to building power at the level of local communities. Hang around social movements for a while and you will no doubt be exposed to the laws of Chicago-style community organizing: \"Don't talk ideology, just issues. No electoral politics. Build organizations, not movements ... Focus on neighborhoods and on concrete, winnable goals.\"\n\nVeteran labor writer David Moberg recently offered this list when reflecting on the work of National People's Action, or NPA, one of today's leading coalitions of community-based groups. Given that NPA's dynamic executive director, George Goehl, was trained by Shel Trapp - a prominent Alinsky disciple - it is no surprise that traditional community organizing principles are still reflected in the bottom-up, door-to-door methodologies of NPA affiliates in 14 states.\n\nAt the same time, under Goehl's leadership, National People's Action is also doing many things differently. His coalition is now embracing a big-picture vision (talking about cooperative ownership of business and public control of finance), and it is making forays into electoral politics (forming a lobbying arm to do legislative advocacy and possibly even to run candidates). In pushing beyond Alinsky's traditional rules, Goehl is motivated not only to win concrete reforms within the existing political system but to develop, Moberg writes, the \"vision, strategy, and full arsenal of political weapons needed to roll back decades of corporate conservative victories and to create a more democratic economy and government.\"\n\nGoehl's ambition is not unique. Other community organizers who experienced the Occupy movement were impressed by the massive momentum for change it created - even if much of its force proved fleeting. Efforts such as the 99% Spring and Occupy Our Homes were steps by community-based groups toward integrating their traditional organizing models with the social movement energy that had blossomed in Zuccotti Park and beyond.\n\nThe desire to re-examine maxims such as \"build organizations, not movements\" is an exciting development - one that opens the door to interaction between those focused on building long-term \"people's organizations,\" as Alinsky called them, and those exploring the dynamics of strategic nonviolence and disruptive mass mobilization.\n\nIt is also one that Alinsky himself may well have supported.\n\nLooking back at the origins of many foundational principles associated with the Alinskyite organizing tradition, it becomes clear that some were not as deeply rooted in the founder's thinking as others - and that he might have pressed for reconsideration of certain commandments that have grown hallowed since the 1960s. These discrepancies raise an intriguing question: If Alinsky were alive today, would he be breaking his own rules?\n\n* * *\n\nIn recent years, Saul Alinsky has become known for of his connections to prominent figures inside Washington, D.C. In the 1980s, Barack Obama cut his political teeth as an organizer in an Alinskyite community organization, an initiative on the South Side of Chicago known as the Developing Communities Project. Hillary Clinton's undergraduate thesis at Wellesley College was entitled, \"There is Only the Fight: An Analysis of the Alinsky Model.\" Because of these links, Glenn Beck featured Alinsky prominently on his maps of leftist conspiracy in America, and Newt Gingrich regularly used the organizer as a foil on the campaign trail in 2012.\n\nThere is some irony to these beltway associations, given that Alinsky built his reputation as an anti-establishment radical working squarely outside the domain of electoral politics. A Chicago native and son of Russian-Jewish immigrants, Alinsky got his start organizing in the 1930s, inspired by CIO and United Mine Workers leader John L. Lewis. In spite of mentoring from Lewis, Alinsky was convinced that the labor movement had grown lethargic and that American democracy needed \"people's organizations\" based outside the workplace - citizens' groups with roots in local communities.\n\nIn his first attempt to create such a group he founded the Back-of-the-Yards Neighborhood Council, an effort to organize the ethnically diverse workers who lived behind the meatpacking plants featured in Upton Sinclair's muckraking 1906 novel, \"The Jungle.\" To fight the slum conditions facing this community, Alinsky packed the offices of bureaucrats with hundreds of residents and routed marches past the homes of local officials. \"Many confrontations and several months later,\" author Mary Beth Rogers writes, \"Back of the Yards claimed credit for new police patrols, street repairs, regular garbage collection, and lunch programs for 1,400 children.\"\n\nBy 1940, with the help of funding from wealthy liberal Marshall Field III, Alinsky had created a nonprofit known as the Industrial Areas Foundation, or IAF, tasked with spurring organization in other urban neighborhoods. In the 1950s, Alinsky and Fred Ross worked through the IAF-supported Community Service Organization to improve living conditions for Mexican-Americans in California; there, Ross recruited a young organizer in San Jose named Cesar Chavez and another in Fresno named Dolores Huerta. (Only after years of training did Chavez and Huerta leave to form what would become the United Farm Workers.)\n\nAmong Alinsky's other prominent campaigns, he would work in the 1960s with black residents in Chicago's Woodlawn neighborhood to fight exploitative landlords and to challenge school overcrowding, and he would help community members in Rochester, N.Y., compel the Eastman Kodak Company to create a hiring program for African American workers.\n\nAlinsky taught through stories, usually exaggerated, always entertaining. In 1971 writer Nat Hentoff stated, \"At 62, Saul is the youngest man I've met in years.\" Playboy interviewer Eric Norden agreed. \"There is a tremendous vitality about Alinsky, a raw, combative ebullience, and a consuming curiosity about everything and everyone around him,\" Norden wrote. \"Add to this a mordant wit, a monumental ego coupled with an ability to laugh at himself and the world in general, and you begin to get the measure of the man.\"\n\nAlinsky's first book, \" Reveille for Radicals\" became a bestseller when published in 1946; it blasted liberal-minded charity efforts and called for an indigenous American radicalism based in citizen action. \" Rules for Radicals: A Pragmatic Primer for Realistic Radicals\" came in 1971, near the end of Alinsky's life, and remains popular. It was recently circulated by Republican Dick Armey's organization FreedomWorks to Tea Party members curious about the book's methods, even if they are opposed to its goals. Its first chapter begins: \"What follows is for those who want to change the world from what it is to what they believe it should be. 'The Prince' was written by Machiavelli for the Haves on how to hold power. 'Rules for Radicals' is written for the Have-Nots on how to take it away.\"\n\nFrank Bardacke, author of a sweeping history of the United Farm Workers, recounts how Alinsky's principles for building power solidified into an identifiable organizing tradition: \"With Saul as the fountainhead, community organizing has become a codified discipline, with core theoretical propositions, recognized heresies, disciples, fallen neophytes, and splits.\" He quotes Heather Booth, founder of the Midwest Academy, an Alinskyite training center for organizers, who calls Alinsky \"our Sigmund Freud.\"\n\n\"What Booth means is that both Freud and Alinsky founded schools of thought,\" Bardacke explains, \"but there is another, deeper link: the role of training and lineage. Just as psychoanalysts trace their pedigree back to the grand master (they were either analyzed by Freud or by someone who was analyzed by Freud, or by someone who was analyzed by someone who...), so Alinskyite and neo-Alinskyite organizers trace their training back to Alinsky himself.\"\n\nAlinsky's influence today is felt not just in the IAF or Goehl's NPA - whose member groups range from Community Voices Heard in New York, to POWER in Los Angeles, to Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement. It is also present in networks such as PICO, DART, USAction/Citizen Action, the Gamaliel Foundation, and the former branches of ACORN. Collectively these organizations claim several million members, and the tradition has spread internationally as well, with organizing trainings taking place in Europe, South Africa and the Philippines. Each of the networks, writes sociologist David Walls, is \"indebted, in greater or lesser degree, to Alinsky and his early organizing programs in Chicago through IAF.\"\n\n* * *\n\nThe principle of \"no electoral politics\" took hold in the Alinskyite tradition based on the idea that community organizations should be pragmatic, nonpartisan, and ideologically diverse - that they should put pressure on all politicians, not express loyalty to any. Historian Thomas Sugrue writes that Alinsky \"never had much patience for elected officials: Change would not come from top-down leadership, but rather from pressure from below. In his view, politicians took the path of least resistance.\" Alinsky himself was not anti-state - as sociologist P. David Finks writes, for him \"the problem was not so much getting government off our backs as getting it off its rear end\" - but the focus of his efforts was outside the electoral arena. The IAF's lingering pride in its \"independent, nonpartisan\" status reflects its desire to recruit members from across the political spectrum in any given community, not merely to engage the usual suspects of progressive activism.\n\nThis \"nonpartisan\" avoidance of ideology also relates to perhaps the most interesting precept in the Alinskyite tradition: the one which distances community organizing from mass mobilizations. As Rutgers sociology professor and former ACORN organizer Arlene Stein wrote in 1986, \"community organizers today tend generally to shun the term movement , preferring to see themselves engaged in building organization .\"\n\nWhy would someone promoting social change see themselves as wary of movements? There are several reasons, and the way in which the terms \"movement\" and \"organization\" are understood connect to some defining aspects of the Alinskyite model.\n\nEd Chambers, Alinsky's successor as IAF director, expresses an aversion to movements as a part of his long-term commitment to community members. As he writes in his book \"Roots for Radicals,\" \"We play to win. That's one of the distinctive features of the IAF: We don't lead everyday, ordinary people into public failures, and we're not building movements. Movements go in and out of existence. As good as they are, you can't sustain them. Everyday people need incremental success over months and sometimes years.\"\n\nAlinsky, too, saw a danger in expecting quick upheavals. He argued, \"Effective organization is thwarted by the desire for instant and dramatic change. ... To build a powerful organization takes time. It is tedious, but that's the way the game is played - if you want to play and not just yell, 'Kill the umpire.'\" Before entering a neighborhood, Alinsky planned for a sustained commitment. He would not hire an organizer unless he had raised enough money to pay for two or more years of the staffer's salary.\n\nBeyond setting expectations for timeframe, a dedication to \"organizations not movements\" is reflected in several other Alinskyite norms. These include the tradition's connection to churches and other established institutions, its selection of bottom-up demands rather than high-profile national issues, and its attitude toward volunteers and freelance activists.\n\nAlinsky believed in identifying local centers of power - particularly churches - and using them as bases for community groups. The modern IAF continues to follow this principle, serving as a model of \"faith-based\" organizing.\n\nInstead of picking a galvanizing, morally loaded, and possibly divisive national issue to organize around - as would a mass movement - Alinsky advocated action around narrow local demands. Mark Warren's \"Dry Bones Rattling,\" a study of the IAF, explains: \"As opposed to mobilizing around a set or predetermined issues, the IAF brings residents together first to discuss the needs of their community and to find a common ground for action.\" Practicing what is sometimes called \"stop sign organizing,\" those working in this vein look for concrete, winnable projects - such as demanding that city officials place a stop sign at a dangerous intersection. The idea is that small victories build local capabilities, give participants a sense of their power, and spur more ambitious action.\n\nThey also meet some of the immediate needs of the community - far preferable, in Alinsky's view, to social movements' far-off calls for freedom and justice. Throughout his career, Alinsky spoke the language of self-interest. He looked to build democratic power among community members seeking to improve the conditions of their own lives. He was suspicious of volunteer activists who were motivated by abstract values or ideology, people drawn to high-profile moral crusades. That movements were full of such people did not sit well with the Alinskyites. As Chambers writes: \"Activists and movement types are mobilizers and entertainers, not democratic organizers. Their script is their persona and their cause. They tend to be overinterested in themselves. Their understanding of politicalness is superficial or media-driven. They lack disinterestedness.\"\n\nMoreover, Chambers contends, movement activists' expectations for change are far too short-term: \"Their time frame is immediate. 'What do we want?' 'Freedom.' 'When do we want it?' 'Now!' 'No justice, no peace,'\" he explains dismissively. \"Movement activists appeal to youth, frustrated idealists, and cynical ideologues, ignoring the 80 percent of moderates who comprise the world as it is. ... Organizing is generational, not here today, gone tomorrow.\"\n\nChambers's view may seem harsh, but it is not atypical of those drawn to community organizing. As Stein explains, \"[T]he revival of Alinsky-style organizations in the 1970s and 1980s often defined itself against the social movements of the previous decade - especially the civil rights, women's, and student antiwar movements - which it tended to view as promoting collective identity formation over the achievement of strategic goals.\"\n\nPatient base-building, long-term strategy, incremental local wins. These ingredients would contribute to a lasting and influential organizing model. They would also, in the turbulent 1960s, put Alinsky at the center of an activist culture clash.\n\n* * *\n\nAt the same time that Alinsky became a popular speaker on 1960s campuses, his vision of organizing put him at odds with many of the era's leading activists - both its student militants and its more high-profile leaders, such as Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1965 and 1966, tensions between \"organization\" and \"movement\" surfaced when King and his Southern Christian Leadership Council came to Chicago, Alinsky's home turf, to mount their first Northern civil rights drive.\n\nDuring the campaign, Nicholas von Hoffman, a close Alinsky lieutenant, had a chance encounter with King in Memphis, Tenn., in the hospital where activist James Meredith had been taken after being shot while marching in support of black voter registration. Von Hoffman gave King his advice about Chicago: \"I told him I thought it could succeed if he was prepared for trench warfare, which would demand tight, tough organization to take on the Daley operation,\" von Hoffman writes. \"I added it could not be done in less than two years.\"\n\nVon Hoffman was not convinced that King was listening. He knew that the SCLC - coming off of mobilizations in Birmingham and Selma - had grown accustomed to much shorter campaigns, sometimes lasting just months. Nor was he impressed by King's decision to move his family into an apartment in one of Chicago's poorest neighborhoods, which von Hoffman dismissed as a \"dramatic gesture\" of little utility. \"Organizing is akin to stringing beads to make a necklace,\" von Hoffman argued. \"It demands patience, persistence, and some kind of design. King's campaign in Chicago was short on beads and bereft of design.\"\n\nAlinsky and von Hoffman regarded the SCLC leader as a \"one-trick pony\" who relied too heavily on media-seeking marches, and they held his team in low regard. As von Hoffman contended, King and the outsiders he brought into Chicago \"were, as far as I could tell, a hodgepodge of young white idealists, college kids, and summer soldiers, most of whom had no knowledge of the people they were supposed to recruit. In the South the youthful white idealists were useful civil rights cannon fodder; in Chicago they were dead weight.\"\n\nVon Hoffman noted the contrast with his tradition. \"It was the antithesis of an Alinsky operation where outside volunteers were generally shooed away not only because they got in the way but also because they didn't have any skin in the game,\" he noted. \"Laudable as it is to volunteer to help other people wrestle with their problems, effective organizations are built with people who have direct and personal interest in their success.\"\n\nThis type of analysis reflected Alinsky's broader critique of civil rights organizing. In a 1965 interview he argued, \"The Achilles' Heel of the civil rights movement is the fact that it has not developed into a stable, disciplined, mass-based power organization.\" He believed the movement's victories owed much to uncontrollable world-historical forces, to \"the incredibly stupid blunders of the status quo in the South and elsewhere,\" and to the contributions of church institutions.\n\nHe added, with King as his unnamed subject: \"Periodic mass euphoria around a charismatic leader is not an organization. It's just the initial stage of agitation.\"\n\nFor Alinsky, stressing the importance of strong organization was also a matter of bridging a generation gap. Those yelling \"kill the umpire,\" in his view, were the members of the New Left. Alinsky felt that people his age were partially responsible for the youths' ignorance. In writing \"Rules for Radicals,\" he sought to communicate with 1960s activists whom he saw as suffering from a lack of mentoring - the result of a missing generation of organizers. \"Few of us survived the Joe McCarthy holocaust of the 1950s,\" Alinsky wrote, \"and of those there were even fewer whose understanding and insights had developed beyond the dialectical materialism of orthodox Marxism. My fellow radicals who were supposed to pass on the torch of experience and insights to a new generation just were not there.\"\n\nAs a consequence, young leftists were too easily seduced by quick fixes, Alinsky believed. In an afterward to a 1969 reissue of his first book, \"Reveille for Radicals,\" he wrote, \"The approach of so much of the present generation is so fractured with 'confrontations' and crises as ends in themselves that their activities are not actions but a discharge of energy which, like a fireworks spectacle, briefly lights up the skies and then vanishes into the void.\"\n\nThe creation of an alternative methodology - what Stein describes as \"a highly structured organizing model specifying step-by-step guidelines for creating neighborhood organizations\" - was an understandable response, and one that has shown great strengths. But, in recent decades, we may have seen its limitations as well.\n\nThe question is whether too close an adherence to a hardened model has created missed opportunities - chances to integrate structure-based organization and momentum-driven movements, and to harness the power of both.\n\n* * *\n\nIt turns out that many of the rules of the Alinskyite tradition come less from the founder himself and more from his successors' subsequent codification of his ideas.\n\nAfter Alinsky's death, IAF leaders Ed Chambers, Richard Harmon, and Ernesto Cortes sat down to assess the factors that contributed to the failure of earlier organizing drives. As author Mary Beth Rogers writes, they identified several \"patterns that created instability, ineffectiveness, and eventual dissolution.\" Among them: \"Movements that depended on charismatic leaders fell apart in the absence of the leader;\" \"organizations formed around a single issue died when the issue lost its potency;\" and \"organizations that played to the public spotlight confused their desire for media attention with their strategy for change.\"\n\nClearly, the IAF heavyweights were critical of the social movements of the New Left. But, more surprisingly, their assessment also indicted Alinsky's own work.\n\nWhile the founding father had planted seeds for organizations throughout the country, only a handful survived for longer than three years. As IAF organizer Michael Gecan writes in his book \" Going Public,\" \"Alinsky was extraordinarily effective as a tactician, writer, speaker and gadfly. He was the first theorist and exponent of citizen organizing in urban communities.\" But, \"While Alinsky had many gifts and strengths ... he did not create organizations that endured.\"\n\nThis challenge would be left to his successors, in particular Ed Chambers. \"That was Chambers's critical contribution to the world of citizens organizing and to America as a whole,\" Gecan writes. \"He had a talent for teaching people how to organize power that lasted.\" Chambers' systemization of the Alinsky model would involve formalizing processes for recruiting and grooming organizers, relying less on large foundations for funding, improving working conditions to reduce burn-out, and strengthening ties to faith-based groups. Other networks of community organizations would further the model by bringing local groups into national coalitions and creating their own training programs to refine and spread the rules of grassroots power-building.\n\nIn many respects, these were necessary changes. Yet they may have come at the cost of some of Alinsky's original creativity. In their focus on building for the long term and creating strong organizational structures, subsequent community organizing leaders have grown less sensitive than their tradition's founder to the potential of exceptional moments of mass mobilization.\n\nIn truth, Alinsky was far less rigid than the \"rules\" attributed to him might suggest. Nicholas von Hoffman, in a memoir about his time with Alinsky, describes his former mentor as \"one of the least dogmatic and most flexible of men. Alinsky believed that liberty was to be redefined and rewon by every generation according to its circumstances and the demands of the time.\" For his part, Alinsky liked to tell a story, possibly apocryphal, of sitting in on a university exam designed for students of community organization. \"Three of the questions were on the philosophy and motivations of Saul Alinsky,\" he claimed. \"I answered two of them incorrectly!\"\n\nThis flexibility affected his view of elections. Alinsky's biographer, Sanford Horwitt, notes that the organizer had plans to run a candidate for Congress in a 1966 election on Chicago's South Side, and he sent staffers from Woodlawn to serve on the campaign staff of an anti-machine challenger. Horwitt quotes von Hoffman, who says, \"A lot of people, especially those who turned 'community organizing' into a kind of religion, now take it as gospel from Saul Alinsky ... that one never gets directly involved in electoral politics. Well, he never thought that.\"\n\nMore importantly, Alinsky's take on mass mobilization was not one-dimensional. One of the most interesting moments in his career came when he attempted to integrate the energy of a social movement with the work of one of his community organizations.\n\nWhile organizing in the Woodlawn neighborhood in early 1961, von Hoffman got a call from a civil rights activist taking part in the Freedom Rides, a protest designed to challenge segregated interstate busing in the South. The riders were violently attacked in Alabama - one of their buses was burned in Anniston, and they were beaten by a mob in Montgomery. Having just been released from a New Orleans hospital, the activist and some of his fellow participants contacted von Hoffman to express interest in making their first public appearance in Chicago.\n\nVon Hoffman was initially hesitant - wary that the event would not advance local organizing and mindful of previous civil rights rallies in Chicago that drew only a handful of picketers. Yet he arranged for a talk to be held in a large gymnasium in St. Cyril's Church. As Horwitt writes, \"On a Friday night, two hours before the program was to start, the gym was empty and von Hoffman was nervous - his initial fears seemed about to be confirmed. An hour later, an elderly couple arrived, and then, to von Hoffman's total amazement, so many people turned up that there was no room left in the gym, in the foyer, or on the stairs.\"\n\nVon Hoffman arranged for loudspeakers to broadcast the talk to the hundreds of people in the streets outside the venue. Later, he left the event reeling. Far more people had come than his group could have possibility mobilized through its organizational structures, and the issue had generated a profound energy in the community. He woke up Alinsky with a middle-of-the-night phone call and explained what happened. Von Hoffman said, \"I think that we should toss out everything we are doing organizationally and work on the premise that this is the moment of the whirlwind, that we are no longer organizing but guiding a social movement.\"\n\nTo his surprise, Alinsky responded by saying, \"You're right. Get on it tomorrow.\"\n\nThe Woodlawn organization subsequently held its own version of the Freedom Rides - a bus caravan to register black voters. The event, Horwitt recounts, produced \"the largest single voter-registration ever at City Hall,\" startled the city's power-brokers, generated much greater publicity than Woodlawn's typical actions, and set the stage for further civil rights activism by the group. In criticizing Martin Luther King several years later, Alinsky was not trying to write off the civil right movement as a whole. A devotee of headline-grabbing direct action, he recognized its accomplishment. And yet he sought to present its leaders with the challenge of institutionalization - a question which King himself grappled with in his later years and which is vital in thinking about how organizing models might be integrated.\n\n* * *\n\nAlinsky understood something important when he embraced \"the moment of the whirlwind.\" He saw that using mass mobilization to produce spikes in social unrest is a process that follows a different set of rules than conventional organizing. Many of its principles - embracing demands with wide symbolic resonance, channeling energy and participation from a broader public, articulating self-interest in moral and visionary terms - are the opposite of the principles that drive local community organizing. And yet Alinsky was willing to experiment with their possibilities.\n\nFormer ACORN organizer Stein argues that such openness became a rarity among Alinsky's disciples. The Alinskyite organizations of recent decades, she writes, \"often fail to grasp the possibilities of mobilization when they occur.\" Because of this, they have unduly limited themselves. \"The great social movements of American history - labor, populist, civil rights, women's (to name some of the most important ones),\" Stein argues, \"captured the interest and imagination of vast numbers of people by offering them material benefits as well as the experience of communal solidarity in an individualistic American culture. In placing 'organization' ahead of 'movement,' ACORN and groups like it\" miss this. They discount modes of organizing that tap the transformative possibility of going beyond the most local, concrete or winnable demands.\n\nWhether it is the global justice protests of 1999 and 2000, the massive immigrant rights marches of 2006, or the rapid spread of Occupy Wall Street across the country in 2011, veteran organizers are often caught off guard by movement outbreaks. As a result, they have few ideas for how to guide and amplify these efforts - or how to harness the energy of peak moments in order to propel their ongoing organizing.\n\nFortunately, in the wake of Occupy, an increasing number of people are interested in precisely this challenge. Those now seeking ways to combine structure- and momentum-based organizing models have much fertile terrain to explore. This will mean opening dialogue between the worlds of \"resource mobilization\" and \"disruptive power\"; and it will involve allowing those immersed in labor and community organizing cultures to compare their methods with the insights into mass mobilization that come out of traditions of strategic nonviolence and civil resistance.\n\nIn pursuing this work, they can take inspiration from a master of radical pragmatism. For while the split between organizations and movements is real, the true spirit of Alinsky is in breaking the rule that keeps them divided."

      "text": "Donald Trump, Black Lives Matter and the Death of Respectability Politics\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Donald Trump told Chuck Todd in an August appearance on \"Meet the Press\" that \" political correctness is just absolutely killing us as a country.\" Just days earlier Trump harangued Fox News' Megyn Kelly after she challenged his misogynistic remarks about Carly Fiorina. \"I don't frankly have time for total political correctness ,\" Trump said, \"and to be honest with you, this country doesn't have time either.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Trump has routinely voiced his disgust with the tactics of Black Lives Matter activists. \"I think they're trouble,\" he said in a September interview in which he also accused the movement of promoting \"hate,\" adding, \"I think it's a disgrace that they're getting away with it.\" And in November, he suggested that a number of his white supporters in Birmingham, Alabama, acted appropriately at an official campaign rally when they \"shoved, tackled, punched, and kicked\" a Black Lives Matter protester who disrupted his speech. \"Maybe he should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing,\" Trump said.\n\nBut isn't Trump's approbation itself a form of political correctness, that is, a primer - a hidden curriculum, if you will - on how to do politics correctly? \"Correctly\" here refers to neat, tidy and respectable forms of political engagement that comport with white, middle-class values, values that espouse behavioral propriety, \"acceptable\" social presentation, and slow and steady change through the so-called \"neutral\" modality of law.\n\nWe argue that Donald Trump's critique of political correctness is representative of collective white rage over the most recent destabilization of Black respectability politics at the hands of the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nContrary to the claims of corporate media, political correctness isn't a progressive project insisting upon sensitivity for traditionally marginalized communities - it's a conservative strategy that sets and polices the parameters of acceptable racial redress. And this conservative form of racial redress has a name. It's called respectability politics. Conservative critiques of political correctness should be interpreted as thinly veiled white rage over the knockout punch to Black respectability politics dealt by the Black Lives Matter movement.\n\nIn practice, political correctness is less about encouraging sensitive and accommodating perspectives toward racially aggrieved communities and more about establishing and governing the acceptable boundaries of \"doing politics.\" Conservatives prove time and again that there's only one way to do politics correctly: through deference to authority, formal legal redress and facile appeals to universal reason (which is often simply a proxy for an unmarked white, cisgendered, heteronormative, Christian, pro-capital, male perspective).\n\nSo what is the politically correct way to be political? Vote in the morning, write your congressperson in the afternoon, and march hand-in-hand in the evening while nonviolently singing \"We Shall Overcome.\" And you'd better wear a suit and tie.\n\nThe irony here is that while modern conservatives lament the destabilization of respectability politics at the hands of Black Lives Matter, conservatives lamented the ascendency of respectability politics in the middle of the last century. (We'd like to acknowledge that the origins of such politics date back much further.)\n\nThe truth is that the \"respectable\" activism of the modern civil rights movement provoked the white supremacist bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham, which left four Black girls dead, the assassination of Medgar Evers and Martin Luther King Jr. and the murder of four Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) workers in Philadelphia, Mississippi, not to mention the police dogs and fire hoses in Birmingham.\n\nThe integration of Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, required federal troops to protect the safety of nine Black students who wanted nothing more than to integrate the school, and white students at the University of Mississippi nearly burned down their campus rather than share it with James Meredith, the university's first Black student. Hardly the tolerance and open-mindedness that conservatives today claim to offer in exchange for more \"respectable\" dialogue.\n\nThat was just in the South, you say? Hardly. King and his Southern Christian Leadership Council spent much of 1966 in Chicago. During an October 1966 march through the city's West Side, a rock thrown by an angry white onlooker struck King in the head. Upon leaving Chicago, King lamented, \"The people of Mississippi ought to come to Chicago to learn how to hate.\"\n\nMoreover, the current geographical breakdown of the Electoral College owes much of its origins to white opposition to the respectability politics conservatives now supposedly miss. President Lyndon B. Johnson's signature on the Civil Rights Act of 1964 \"lost the South for a generation,\" as the Southern states, solidly Democratic for most of the 20th century, voted for the Republican, Barry Goldwater, who opposed the Civil Rights Act, in the 1964 presidential election.\n\nReviewing such a history is critical for understanding how conservatives routinely meet Black efforts at social emancipation: They move the target. Acceptable racial redress is always already a small, sharp moving object. The \"respectable\" politics conservatives abhorred in the past have become the \"acceptable\" standard upon which they attack Black Lives Matter supporters today.\n\nThe real objection from conservatives is not the form Black protest takes, but the deep critique of white supremacy it offers. White supremacy's preservation is premised on its constant transformation to meet the exigencies of any given social moment. So, when people of color today refuse to toe the white line of traditional establishment politics, conservatives pivot to critiques of political correctness, a scarcely hidden acknowledgement that they have lost the battle for the moral legitimacy of respectability politics.\n\nZach Stafford recently wrote in the Guardian that \"wearing a tie doesn't rectify the fact that Black people are incarcerated at six times that rate of white people ... and saying #AllLivesMatters doesn't take the bullet out of the literally countless Black bodies shot dead by police officers ... No one's life should rest on 'yes, sir' or 'thank you.' Ever.\"\n\nHe's right. Universal claims to humanity belie the legal and extralegal ways in which Black life is devalued.\n\nThe insidiousness of respectability politics is that it repositions Black dissent on white supremacy's terms. It says: prove that you can comport yourself in a way worthy of white respect and maybe, just maybe, we'll allow you access to this country, to this society, and, yes, to this world. Respectability politics, at best, assumes that Black life and Black worth are probationary.\n\nThe way Donald Trump has chosen to deal with questions of political correctness and the Black Lives Matter movement demonstrates that they're intimately linked. Trump's pivot over the last few months to critiquing political correctness suggests that he understands that conservatives have lost the ability to legitimize respectability politics.\n\nWhen racial justice comes to the United States in 2015, it won't be wearing a tie and singing \"We Shall Overcome.\" It'll be kicking in the doors of respectability politics, challenging the forms of acceptable political engagement and asserting in no uncertain terms that Black life isn't probationary or sanctified by whiteness. Black Lives Matter has been clear: If Black life can't stand on its own two feet than neither can this country. Trump, among others, should take note."

      "text": "Army erases WWII vet Medgar Evers from Arlington National Cemetery website\n\nWorld War II veteran Medgar Evers, whom President Trump called \"a great American hero,\" has been erased from the Arlington National Cemetery website, which featured a section honoring Black Americans who fought in the nation's wars.\n\nThe U.S. Army purged the section that had lauded the late Army sergeant and civil rights leader, who was assassinated by a white supremacist in Jackson in 1963. The decision to erase Evers came after an executive order by Trump to eliminate all Diversity, Equality and Inclusion programs.\n\nFormer Mississippi Supreme Court Justice Reuben Anderson, who gave Trump a 2017 tour of the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, said he can't imagine the president would want Evers removed. \"That's got to be a mistake,\" he said. \"That involves a great American who served in the military and was one of the most courageous Americans of all time.\"\n\nThe White House could not be reached for comment.\n\nEvers is far from the only war veteran whose name has been struck from the website. So was Army Maj. Gen. Charles Calvin Rogers, who was awarded the Medal of Honor in the Vietnam War.\n\n\"He got shot three times in Vietnam and survived,\" said U.S. Rep. Bennie Thompson. \"History has not been kind to minorities, whether women, people of color or religious groups. Part of what we do in the greatest democracy known to man is to correct the record.\"\n\nThe Mississippi Democrat said if the Trump administration truly cared about veterans, it wouldn't have fired 80,000 people from the Department of Veterans' Affairs. \"You think it's hard to get a medical appointment now?\" he asked. \"You take 80,000 out of that system, and it's not going to work.\"\n\nIn 2013, Arlington National Cemetery held a service honoring Evers and his family on the 50th anniversary of his assassination, where Evers drew praise from Republicans and Democrats.\n\nMississippi's entire congressional delegation pushed for Evers to posthumously receive a Presidential Medal of Freedom, which his family accepted last year.\n\nPresident Donald Trump gets a tour of the newly-opened Mississippi Civil Rights Museum in Jackson on Saturday. Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson, left, joins the president on the tour.\n\nPresident Trump came to Mississippi for the opening of the Civil Rights Museum in 2017 and spent much of his time praising Evers.\n\n\"He fought in Normandy in the Second World War,\" Trump said , \"and when he came back home to Mississippi, he kept fighting for the same rights and freedom that he had defended in the war. Mr. Evers became a civil rights leader in his community.\n\n\"He helped fellow African Americans register to vote, organized boycotts, and investigated grave injustices against very innocent people. For his courageous leadership in the Civil Rights movement, Mr. Evers was assassinated by a member of the KKK in the driveway of his own home.\"\n\nTrump recalled how \"Sgt. Evers was laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery with full military honors. In Arlington, he lies beside men and women of all races, backgrounds, and walks of life who have served and sacrificed for our country. Their headstones do not mark the color of their skin, but immortalize the courage of their deeds.\n\n\"Their memories are carved in stone as American heroes. That is what Medgar Evers was. He was a great American hero. That is what the others honored in this museum were: true American heroes.\"\n\nHe called Evers an inspiration for everyone. \"We want our country to be a place where every child, from every background, can grow up free from fear, innocent of hatred, and surrounded by love, opportunity, and hope,\" he said. \"Today, we pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past and dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom, equality, justice, and peace.\"\n\nEach summer, Civil War historian Kevin M. Levin takes teachers to visit the grave of Medgar Evers. \"It's impossible to talk about his accomplishments in the field of civil rights without mentioning his service in World War II,\" he said. \"There's a straight line from his service to trying to expand voting rights and desegregate the University of Mississippi law school.\"\n\nIt's impossible to understand the sacrifices of his service in the civil rights movement without understanding the sacrifices of his service in the Army, he said. \"Any attempt to minimize this history is being incredibly dishonest.\"\n\nThis article first appeared on Mississippi Today and is republished here under a Creative Commons license.\n\nThree University of Mississippi students have been suspended from their fraternity house and face possible investigation by the Department of Justice after posing with guns in front of a bullet-riddled sign honoring slain civil rights icon Emmett Till.\n\nOne of the students posted a photo to his private Instagram account in March showing the trio in front of a roadside plaque commemorating the site where Till's body was recovered from the Tallahatchie River. The 14-year-old black youth was tortured and murdered in August 1955. An all-white, all-male jury acquitted two white men accused of the slaying.\n\nThe photo, which was obtained by the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting and ProPublica, shows an Ole Miss student named Ben LeClere holding a shotgun while standing in front of the bullet-pocked sign. His Kappa Alpha fraternity brother, John Lowe, squats below the sign. A third fraternity member stands on the other side with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. The photo appears to have been taken at night, the scene illuminated by lights from a vehicle.\n\nLeClere posted the picture on Lowe's birthday on March 1 with the message \"one of Memphis's finest and the worst influence I've ever met.\"\n\nNeither LeClere nor Lowe responded to repeated attempts to contact them.\n\nIt is not clear whether the fraternity students shot the sign or are simply posing before it. The sign is part of a memorial effort by the Emmett Till Memorial Commission , a Mississippi civil rights group, and has been repeatedly vandalized, most recently in August 2018 . Till's death helped propel the modern civil rights movement in America.\n\nFive days after LeClere posted the photo, a person who saw it filed a bias report to the university's Office of Student Conduct. The complaint pointed out there may have been a fourth person present, who took the picture.\n\n\"The photo is on Instagram with hundreds of 'likes,' and no one said a thing,\" said the complaint, a copy of which was reviewed by the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting and ProPublica. \"I cannot tell Ole Miss what to do, I just thought it should be brought to your attention.\"\n\nThe photo was removed from LeClere's Instagram account after the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting and ProPublica began contacting fraternity members and friends. It had received 274 likes.\n\nKappa Alpha suspended the trio on Wednesday, after the news organizations provided a copy of the photo to fraternity officials at Ole Miss. The fraternity, which honors Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee as its \"spiritual founder\" on its website , has a history of racial controversy, including an incident in which students wore blackface at a Kappa Alpha sponsored Halloween party at the University of Virginia in 2002.\n\n\"The photo is inappropriate, insensitive and unacceptable. It does not represent our chapter,\" Taylor Anderson, president of Ole Miss' Kappa Alpha Order, wrote in an email. \"We have and will continue to be in communication with our national organization and the University.\"\n\nAfter viewing the photo, U.S. Attorney Chad Lamar of the Northern District of Mississippi in Oxford said the information has been referred to the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division for further investigation.\n\n\"We will be working with them closely,\" he said Thursday.\n\nUniversity officials called the photo \"offensive and hurtful.\"\n\nUniversity spokesman Rod Guajardo acknowledged that an Ole Miss official had received a copy of the Instagram picture in March. The university referred the matter to the university police department, which in turn gave it to the FBI.\n\nGuajardo said the FBI told police it would not further investigate the incident because the photo did not pose a specific threat.\n\nGuajardo said that while the university considered the picture \"offensive,\" the image did not present a violation of the university's code of conduct. He noted the incident depicted in the photo occurred off campus and was not part of a university-affiliated event.\n\n\"We stand ready to assist the fraternity with educational opportunities for those members and the chapter,\" Guajardo said.\n\nHe said the university will continue to build programs to engage students in \"deliberate, honest and candid conversations while making clear that we unequivocally reject attitudes that do not respect the dignity of each individual in our community.\"\n\nSince the first sign was erected in 2008, it has been the object of repeated animosity.\n\nVandals threw the first sign in the river. The second sign was blasted with 317 bullets or shotgun pellets before the Emmett Till Memorial Commission officials removed it. The third sign, featured in the Instagram photo, was damaged by 10 bullet holes before officials took it down last week. A fourth sign, designed to better withstand attacks, is expected to be installed soon.\n\nNews of the suspensions and referral to the Justice Department came as Till's cousin, Deborah Watts, co-founder of the Emmett Till Legacy Foundation, was already planning a moment of silence Thursday to honor her cousin with a gathering of supporters and friends dressed in black and white in \"a silent yet powerful protest against racism, hatred and violence.\" Thursday is Till's birthday. Had he lived, he would have been 78 years old.\n\nThis is not the first time Ole Miss fraternity students have been caught up in an incident involving an icon from the civil rights movement.\n\nIn 2014, three students from the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity house placed a noose around the neck of a statue on campus of James Meredith, the first known black student to attend Ole Miss. They also placed a Georgia flag of the past that contains the Confederate battle emblem.\n\nAccording to federal prosecutors, the freshmen students hatched the plan during a drinking fest at the house, where one student disparaged African Americans, saying this act would create a sensation: \"It's James Meredith. People will go crazy.\"\n\nOne pleaded guilty and received six months in prison for using a threat of force to intimidate African American students and employees because of their race or color. Another student also pleaded guilty. He received probation and community service after he cooperated with the FBI. A third man wasn't charged.\n\nAll three students withdrew from Ole Miss, and the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity's national headquarters shuttered its chapter on the Ole Miss campus after its own investigation, blaming the closing on behavior that included \"hazing, underage drinking, alcohol abuse and failure to comply with the university and fraternity's codes of conduct.\"\n\nShirley L. Smith and Debbie Skipper of the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting and Thalia Beaty, Benjamin Hardy and Claire Perlman of ProPublica contributed to this report.\n\nJerry Mitchell is an investigative reporter for the Mississippi Center for Investigative Reporting , a nonprofit news organization that seeks to hold public officials accountable and empower citizens in their communities.\n\nEmail him at Jerry.Mitchell.MCIR@gmail.com and follow him on Facebook at @JerryMitchellReporter and on Twitter at @jmitchellnews .\n\nIf you have any information about the people who took this picture or who appeared in it, please let us know at Mississippi@ProPublica.org .\n\nCorrection, July 25, 2019: An earlier version of this story misidentified John Lowe as holding an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle. Lowe is squatting beneath the sign without a rifle."

(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\nJACKSON, Miss. (AP) - James Meredith knew he was putting his life in danger in the 1960s by pursuing what he believes was his divine mission : conquering white supremacy in the deeply, and often violently, segregated state of Mississippi.\n\nA half-century later, the civil rights leader is still talking about his mission from God. In recent weeks, he made several appearances around his home state, urging people to obey the Ten Commandments and the Golden Rule in order to reduce crime. On his 90th birthday on Sunday, Meredith said older generations should lead the way.\n\n\"Old folks not only can control it - it's their job to control it,\" Meredith told The Associated Press in an interview Sunday after an event honoring him at the Mississippi Capitol.\n\nMeredith is a civil rights icon who has long resisted that label because he believes it sets issues such as voting rights and equal access to education apart from other human rights.\n\nDuring the event, Meredith fell while trying to stand and speak . He leaned on an unsecured lectern, and it crashed forward with Meredith on top. People nearby scrambled to return him to a wheelchair.\n\nMeredith suffered no visible injuries. An ambulance crew checked him later, and then Meredith went to his home in Jackson to have a birthday celebration with his family. His wife, Judy Alsobrooks Meredith, said Monday that he was spending time with grandchildren and showing no signs of pain.\n\nIn October 1962, federal marshals escorted Meredith as he enrolled as the first Black student at the University of Mississippi, while white people rioted on the Oxford campus. Mississippi's governor at the time, Ross Barnett, had stirred mobs into a frenzy by declaring that Ole Miss would not be integrated under his watch.\n\nMeredith was a 29-year-old Air Force veteran who had already taken classes at one of Mississippi's historically Black colleges, Jackson State. NAACP attorneys represented him as he obtained a federal court order to enter the state's flagship public university. After a largely solitary existence at Ole Miss, Meredith graduated in 1963 with a bachelor's degree in political science.\n\nAfter graduating, Meredith set out to promote Black voter registration and show that a Black man could walk through Mississippi without fear. In June 1966, a white man with a shotgun wounded Meredith on the second day of a march from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi. With Meredith hospitalized, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., Stokely Carmichael and other civil rights leaders continued the march, often followed by long lines of activists and local people.\n\nLess than three weeks after he was shot, Meredith had recovered enough to join the final stretch of what became known as the March Against Fear. It ended at the state Capitol, where an estimated 15,000 people gathered for Mississippi's largest civil rights rally.\n\nThis year, Meredith had planned to walk 200 miles (322 kilometers) in Mississippi to spread his anti-crime message - roughly the same distance as the March Against Fear. Instead, he made a series of appearances in recent weeks, often using a rolling walker, a wheelchair or a golf cart.\n\nOn Sunday, Meredith rode in a golf cart for the final quarter-mile (0.40 kilometers) from Jackson City Hall to the Mississippi Capitol, led by a high school marching band and accompanied by dozens of people on foot. A racially diverse group of about 200 people sought shade under magnolia and oak trees while listening to songs, speeches and a child's poem praising Meredith.\n\nFlonzie BrownWright, a longtime Mississippi civil rights activist who participated in the 1966 March Against Fear, said she believes Meredith is a genius at creating strategies for social change.\n\n\"He is a very smart man, endowed with a lot of old-fashioned wisdom. He has been able to use that for the greater good of his people,\" BrownWright said Sunday. \"I love him like a big brother.\"\n\nIn the decades since Meredith integrated Ole Miss, the university has erected a statue of him on campus and has held several events to honor him and his legacy.\n\nJohn Meredith said Sunday that his father had a profound effect on higher education, but the March Against Fear had a greater impact on him as a son because it demonstrated the importance of elections.\n\n\"The silent gift of voting is the ability to help shape the laws under which you live. It is the beauty and the curse of America,\" said John Meredith, the current city council president in Huntsville, Alabama. \"Participation in voting yields inclusion, diversity and opportunity. Failure to vote results in the loss of freedom ... and government oppression.\"\n\nAt the Capitol birthday celebration, Iyanu B. Carson, a 5th grade student from Jackson, read her poem titled \"90 Years of History,\" saying she aspires to be like Meredith.\n\n\"You made the choice to use your voice, you were strong and made them believe you belonged,\" Iyanu said. \"Today we celebrate history, and Mr. Meredith, history is you! We're proud of your accomplishments and all that you have been through.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\nKOSCIUSKO, Miss. (AP) - A new historical marker has been unveiled in the hometown of James Meredith , honoring the Black man who fought white supremacy by integrating the University of Mississippi in 1962.\n\nMeredith, 91 , wore a red Ole Miss baseball hat as he watched Friday's ceremony from the front seat of a pickup truck owned by Kosciusko, a town of 6,800 that is also the birthplace of media mogul Oprah Winfrey. About 85 people attended, and many snapped selfies with Meredith and his wife, Judy Alsobrooks Meredith.\n\n\"Most important day of my life,\" Meredith said in a brief interview.\n\n\"Over half the people here are my relatives,\" he said. \"And for relatives to stand out in the cold like they did - that's something special.\"\n\nMeredith, who resists being called a civil rights leader , now lives in Mississippi's capital city of Jackson. He was born in Kosciusko and grew up on a nearby farm. He graduated from high school in St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1951, and served for nine years in the Air Force before returning to Mississippi.\n\nHe attended Jackson State College - the historically Black school that is now Jackson State University - for two years before suing to gain admission as the first Black student at the University of Mississippi.\n\nA white mob erupted in violence when Meredith registered at Ole Miss , and U.S. marshals protected him on and off the Oxford campus. The university has honored him several times in the decades since then. Today, about 10% of students at the university are Black.\n\n\"He's a man whose courage profoundly altered the course of history,\" Kosciusko Mayor Tim Kyle said Friday.\n\nWhile Meredith was enrolled at Ole Miss, his parents and some of his siblings lived in a small brick home in Kosciusko. The new historical marker is a short walk from that house, roughly where marshals would park when Meredith visited family in 1962 and 1963.\n\nFlorida State University professor Davis Houck and his students collaborated with the Mississippi Department of Archives and History on the new marker, which also notes that Meredith was shot during a 1966 \"March Against Fear\" - a planned walk from Memphis, Tennessee; to Jackson, Mississippi; to encourage Black voter registration.\n\nMeredith's oldest son, John Meredith, is currently the city council president in Huntsville, Alabama. He said he was unable to attend the unveiling of other historical markers honoring his father at Ole Miss, at the site of the 1966 shooting in Hernando, Mississippi, and outside the state Capitol.\n\nJohn Meredith said he has fond memories of visiting his grandmother, known as Ms. Roxie, in the brick home in Kosciusko.\n\n\"So all of this is quite the homecoming for me personally, and obviously my father is ecstatic about being honored this way in his hometown,\" John Meredith said. \"It's a great day for the Meredith family.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP) - A new documentary is diving into the complicated, and sometimes contradictory life of James Meredith, a Black civil rights figure who helped change Mississippi.\n\n\"Walk Against Fear: James Meredith,\" scheduled to air Thursday on the Smithsonian Channel, examines the life of a U.S. Air Force veteran and human rights agitator whose admission to the University of Mississippi forced President John F. Kennedy to send federal troops into the state to quell a white supremacy uprising. It was one of the most violent moments of the Civil Rights Movement and Meredith's determination to enroll in Ole Miss forever transformed life in the American Deep South.\n\nKnown as a bold, stubborn character from the movement, Meredith was later shot during a peaceful demonstration in Mississippi, and years later drew anger from civil rights leaders for endorsing former Klansman David Duke for Louisiana governor. He shunned interviews and openly supported former segregationists who he said he was helping transform.\n\nBut Meredith told The Associated Press on Tuesday he believed all of his actions in his life had been predestined by higher forces. \"My life has always been according to a plan,\" Meredith said. \"And I was not the engineer of most the plan.\"\n\nBorn in Kosciusko, Mississippi, Meredith graduated from high school in St. Petersburg, Florida, and enlisted in the U.S. Air Force, where he took courses at New Mexico Western College - now Western New Mexico University - in Silver City, New Mexico. Those classes in New Mexico changed his life and set him on a path to become a writer. \"It was the most important thing that ever happened to me,\" Meredith said.\n\nThe experience in New Mexico also got him thinking of attending Ole Miss, an all-white college that barred Black students.\n\nThe documentary follows Meredith from his decision to challenge the University of Mississippi's segregationist policies and then a governor who personally tried to refuse to admit him.\n\nMeredith eventually attended classes thanks to federal court orders only to see white students walk out in protest.\n\nLater, he set out on a public \"Walk Against Fear\" in 1966 to prove that a Black man could walk peacefully in Mississippi. He was shot on the second day. AP photographer Jack Thornell captured a haunting image of Meredith grimacing in pain as he tried to pull himself across Highway 51 after being shot in Hernando, Mississippi.\n\n\"I didn't feel anything,\" Meredith recalled. \"The only thing that mattered to me was that I wasn't dead.\"\n\nMeredith said he had been reluctant to open up about his life but was pleased with a BBC project about him that involved Sol B. River, a British theater director and filmmaker. River approached Meredith about the documentary idea and he agreed.\n\n\"He's an extremely intelligent and complex man,\" said River, who spent years getting to know Meredith. \"I hope that people will see this from the viewpoint from the first person ... almost as if they are James Meredith going through this.\"\n\n___\n\nRussell Contreras is a member of The Associated Press' Race and Ethnicity Team.

(AP) - The University of Mississippi is paying tribute to 89-year-old James Meredith 60 years after white protesters erupted into violence as he became the first Black student to enroll in what was then a bastion of Deep South segregation.\n\nAs it has done on other 10-year anniversaries of integration, the university is hosting celebrations and academic events . Meredith was honored Saturday during the Ole Miss-Kentucky football game, receiving a framed Ole Miss jersey with the number 62 - the year he integrated the university. The ceremony happened two days after he attended attended the Rebels' practice to speak to players.\n\n\"He came and revolutionized our thinking. He came to open our closed society,\" Donald Cole, who retired in 2018 as the university's assistant provost and head of multicultural affairs, said during a celebration Wednesday night.\n\nThe enigmatic Meredith , who lives in Jackson, has long resisted the label of civil rights leader, as if civil rights are separate from other human rights. He says his effort to enter Ole Miss was his own battle to conquer white supremacy.\n\nMeredith's being honored at the Ole Miss-Kentucky game was an ironic echo of history.\n\nTwo days before Meredith enrolled on the Oxford campus in 1962, race-baiting Gov. Ross Barnett worked a white crowd into a frenzy at a football stadium in Jackson. Ole Miss fans waved Confederate flags to support their Rebels over the Kentucky Wildcats - and to defy any move toward racial integration.\n\n\"I love Mississippi,\" Barnett declared. \"I love her people! Our customs! I love and I respect our heritage!\"\n\nThe next evening, Barnett quietly reached an agreement with U.S. Attorney General Robert Kennedy to let Meredith enter Mississippi's oldest public university. Meredith already had a federal court order.\n\nWhite mobs of students and outsiders erupted when he arrived on the leafy campus with the protection of more than 500 federal law enforcement officers. The attorney general's brother, President John F. Kennedy, deployed National Guard troops to quell the violence, and Meredith enrolled on Oct. 1 .\n\nDuring the event Wednesday at the university, Meredith told an audience: \"In my opinion, this is the best day I ever lived. But there's some more truth. Celebration is good. I don't think there's anybody in this house or in the state of Mississippi that think the problem has been solved.\"\n\nMeredith has said for the past several years that he's on a mission from God, to persuade people to abide by the Ten Commandments. He said Wednesday that he sees a special role for Black women to lead the way in restoring moral order to American society.\n\n\"There's nothing in Mississippi that God, Jesus Christ and the Black woman cannot fix,\" Meredith said.\n\nMeredith grew up in segregated Mississippi before finishing high school in Florida. He served in the Air Force and attended Jackson State College, a historically Black school in the state capital, before suing to gain admission to Ole Miss.\n\nA local resident and a French journalist were killed in the violence as Meredith enrolled. More than 200 officers and soldiers were wounded and 200 people were arrested.\n\nFederal marshals provided Meredith with round-the-clock protection until he graduated with a political science degree in 1963. Meredith said Wednesday that most of his knowledge about what was happening on campus came from the marshals.\n\n\"Most of them were scared to death of the Mississippi people with rifles and shotguns,\" he said.\n\nU.S. Marshals Service Director Ronald L. Davis named Meredith an honorary deputy marshal during the ceremony Wednesday. Davis , who is Black, said Meredith brought widespread change to American society.\n\n\"You chose a path that was not traveled - one with much resistance, one with fear and threats and violence, and you went there anyway,\" Davis said.\n\nThe University of Mississippi had about 21,850 students on all of its campuses in the 2021 fall semester, with about 12.7% Black enrollment. About 38% of Mississippi residents are Black.\n\nEthel Scurlock , the first Black dean of the university's honors college, said during the keynote speech Wednesday that she had not yet been born when Meredith integrated Ole Miss in 1962 or when he was shot soon after setting out on his March Against Fear in 1966.\n\n\"But Mr. Meredith, I am here today,\" Scurlock said. \"I am the unborn baby that you were willing to go to war for.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\nJACKSON, Miss. (AP) - Civil rights icon James Meredith fell outside the Mississippi Capitol on Sunday at an event marking his 90th birthday, but he suffered no visible injuries and was resting comfortably at home later.\n\nMeredith leaned onto an unsecured portable lectern as he stood to speak to about 200 people. The lectern toppled forward, and he fell on top of it. Those around him quickly scrambled to stand Meredith up upright, and they helped him back into the wheelchair he had been using. People also gave him ice packs and cold water as the temperature hovered at about 95 degrees Fahrenheit (35 degrees Celsius).\n\nMeredith remained at the event until it ended about 45 minutes later. An ambulance crew checked him afterward, and Meredith then left in a sport utility vehicle with friends and family.\n\nHis wife, Judy Alsobrooks Meredith, said in a text message to The Associated Press hours later that he was at home with family.\n\n\"He's enjoying his birthday cake now,\" she said. \"He's tougher than anybody I've ever known.\"\n\nMeredith was already an Air Force veteran in 1962 when he became the first Black student to enroll at the University of Mississippi, after winning a federal court order. White mobs rioted on the Oxford campus as federal marshals protected Meredith.\n\nIn 1966, Meredith set out to promote Black voting rights and to prove that a Black man could walk through Mississippi without fear. On the second day of his planned walk from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi, a white man with a shotgun shot and wounded Meredith on a highway.\n\nThe Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and other leaders of the Civil Rights Movement continued Meredith's march in his absence, and Meredith recovered enough to join them for the final stretch. About 15,000 people rallied outside the Mississippi Capitol on June 26, 1966.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved."

      "text": "Civil rights legend Meredith says he's on a mission from God\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.\n\nJACKSON, Miss. (AP) - James Meredith is a civil rights legend who resists neatly defined narratives.\n\nHe integrated the University of Mississippi while braving mob violence in 1962 - yet he worked in the late 1980s for archconservative Sen. Jesse Helms, considered a foe by many in the civil rights movement.\n\nWounded by shotgun fire while marching for voting rights in 1966, Meredith also shuns the title of \"civil rights icon,\" as if civil rights are different from other rights.\n\nNow, at 85, Meredith could rest assured of a place in history. But he says he's on a new mission from God - to confront what he sees as society's \"breakdown of moral character\" by encouraging people to live by the Ten Commandments.\n\nHe says black people must lead the way for Christians of all races to have spiritual healing.\n\n\"If the black Christians focus on teaching right, doing right, all other Christian religions would follow suit,\" Meredith says. \"Instead of religion healing the black-white race issue, the race issue is going to heal everything and correct all the rest of our problems.\"\n\nMeredith made the remarks during an interview with The Associated Press at a Jackson public library where he's a frequent patron.\n\nWearing cool white slacks, a white shirt and a straw hat, Meredith was approached by an African-American woman with three young girls. She thanked him for making Mississippi a better place and introduced him to the children.\n\nMeredith, a slender man with a white beard, asked her to speak up because he doesn't hear as well as he used to. The children shyly shook his hand. They posed for a picture, and the youngest girl kissed him on the cheek as she left. Meredith smiled.\n\n\"I've been in the God business all my life,\" Meredith says. \"Ole Miss to me was nothing but a mission from God. The Meredith March Against Fear was my most important mission from God, until this one coming up right now: Raising the moral character up, and making people aware of their duty to follow God's plan and the teachings of Jesus Christ.\"\n\nMeredith grew up in segregated Mississippi, served in the Air Force and sued to gain admission as the first black student at the state's flagship university. Facing resistance from the governor and riots that led to two deaths, Meredith enrolled at Ole Miss in 1962, under federal court order and protected by U.S. marshals. He graduated with a political science degree.\n\nIn June 1966, Meredith set out to prove a black man could walk through Mississippi without fear, aiming to trek from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson. On the second day, a white man shot and wounded him. Other civil rights leaders, including Martin Luther King Jr., arrived to continue the march.\n\nSince the 1960s, Meredith has been in and out of the public eye. He's been married and raised children and involved himself in Republican politics. He's run a used car dealership and has spoken on college campuses.\n\nAlways independent, Meredith is an iconoclast who says things that can sound grating to people who otherwise see him favorably. For instance, he sharply criticizes a black mother who left her 6-year-old son in her car last year while she went into a Jackson grocery store at night; the car was stolen, the boy was killed and young black men were charged in the crime.\n\nHe also wades into the issue of police treatment of black people. He says people fail to discuss whether Michael Brown, an unarmed black teenager, was stealing before he was shot to death by a white police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014.\n\nGeorgia Cohran, an African-American resident of Jackson, was a child in Oxford in 1962. She remembers the fear when Meredith enrolled, and the sense of wonder that a black student was finally studying on the campus where many African-Americans, including her mother, worked as cooks. She has known Meredith for years and he has spoken at the church she attends.\n\n\"To really understand Mr. Meredith, I think you would have to look at him through brown eyes instead of blue eyes,\" Cohran said. \"In my opinion, he's not very complicated. He's just focused - a very intelligent, focused black man.\"\n\nFor about two decades, Meredith has handed out photocopies of the Ten Commandments. He says he wants to form a lay religious order called a Bible Society and envisions people studying in small groups and holding each other accountable.\n\n\"You only have a good society when everybody's business is everybody's business,\" he says.\n\nExplaining his new mission, Meredith radiates calm confidence. An African-American man, about college age, has been studying at the next table in the library. The man closes his books and turns to listen. He clearly knows who Meredith is, and the young man is absorbing the older man's words.\n\nLater, as a reporter waves goodbye, Meredith raises a black power fist and lowers himself into his Honda Civic. The young man from the library walks over and taps on the car window. Meredith rolls it down and the young man smiles and shakes his hand.\n\n___\n\nFollow Emily Wagster Pettus on Twitter at http://twitter.com/EWagsterPettus .\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

(AP Photo/Rogelio V. Solis)\n\nKOSCIUSKO, Miss. (AP) - A new historical marker has been unveiled in the hometown of James Meredith , honoring the Black man who fought white supremacy by integrating the University of Mississippi in 1962.\n\nMeredith, 91 , wore a red Ole Miss baseball hat as he watched Friday's ceremony from the front seat of a pickup truck owned by Kosciusko, a town of 6,800 that is also the birthplace of media mogul Oprah Winfrey. About 85 people attended, and many snapped selfies with Meredith and his wife, Judy Alsobrooks Meredith.\n\n\"Most important day of my life,\" Meredith said in a brief interview.\n\n\"Over half the people here are my relatives,\" he said. \"And for relatives to stand out in the cold like they did - that's something special.\"\n\nMeredith, who resists being called a civil rights leader , now lives in Mississippi's capital city of Jackson. He was born in Kosciusko and grew up on a nearby farm. He graduated from high school in St. Petersburg, Florida, in 1951, and served for nine years in the Air Force before returning to Mississippi.\n\nHe attended Jackson State College - the historically Black school that is now Jackson State University - for two years before suing to gain admission as the first Black student at the University of Mississippi.\n\nA white mob erupted in violence when Meredith registered at Ole Miss , and U.S. marshals protected him on and off the Oxford campus. The university has honored him several times in the decades since then. Today, about 10% of students at the university are Black.\n\n\"He's a man whose courage profoundly altered the course of history,\" Kosciusko Mayor Tim Kyle said Friday.\n\nWhile Meredith was enrolled at Ole Miss, his parents and some of his siblings lived in a small brick home in Kosciusko. The new historical marker is a short walk from that house, roughly where marshals would park when Meredith visited family in 1962 and 1963.\n\nFlorida State University professor Davis Houck and his students collaborated with the Mississippi Department of Archives and History on the new marker, which also notes that Meredith was shot during a 1966 \"March Against Fear\" - a planned walk from Memphis, Tennessee; to Jackson, Mississippi; to encourage Black voter registration.\n\nMeredith's oldest son, John Meredith, is currently the city council president in Huntsville, Alabama. He said he was unable to attend the unveiling of other historical markers honoring his father at Ole Miss, at the site of the 1966 shooting in Hernando, Mississippi, and outside the state Capitol.\n\nJohn Meredith said he has fond memories of visiting his grandmother, known as Ms. Roxie, in the brick home in Kosciusko.\n\n\"So all of this is quite the homecoming for me personally, and obviously my father is ecstatic about being honored this way in his hometown,\" John Meredith said. \"It's a great day for the Meredith family.\"\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "'We Cannot Rewrite History, But We Can Right History'\n\nA South Carolina judge vacated the convictions of the Friendship 9, nine black college students who dared sit at a whites-only lunch counter in 1961.\n\nFifty-four years ago this week, nine young black men sat down at the whites-only counter of McCrory's five-and-dime store on Main Street in the town of Rock Hill, South Carolina. After ordering burgers and cokes, the men were asked to leave; after they refused to leave, they were arrested for trespassing.\n\nThe Civil Rights Movement was, relatively speaking, in its infancy at the time. Less than a year after the sit-ins in Greensboro, North Carolina , the Friendship 9 were arrested on the same day that James Meredith submitted his college application to then-segregated Ole Miss.\n\nOn Wednesday, the eight surviving members of the Friendship 9⎯most of the nine men had been students at nearby Friendship College in 1961⎯were back in a Rock Hill courthouse to see their sentences vacated and their convictions overturned. \"We cannot rewrite history, but we can right history,\" Circuit Court Judge John C. Hayes III told the courtroom to high applause as he threw out the cases⎯a poignant flourish given that Hayes' uncle had originally sentenced the men in 1961.\n\nAs NBC News noted , the men \"were represented in the hearing by Ernest A. Finney Jr., the same man who defended their case 54 years ago,\" who later served as South Carolina Supreme Court's first black chief justice since Reconstruction.\n\nThe saga of the Friendship 9 hadn't ended with their convictions. When the court ordered the men to pay a $100 fine, they refused, opting instead to spend 30 days in jail rather than have the NAACP pay their fee, a tactic that was dubbed \"Jail⎯No Bail.\"\n\n\"Jail⎯No Bail\" flipped the dynamic by which cities profited on the illegal arrests of civil rights activists and instead had to pay to confine and feed activists. It took the burden of payment off civil rights organizations in defiance of Jim Crow. Thomas Gaither, the Congress of Racial Equality activist who joined the eight Friendship students in the sit-in, described the strategy in an interview with South Carolina's ETV :\n\nWe'd had the sit-ins, and we didn't have actually a large number of gains. We had people who were arrested. They went to jail, they paid their bail, they went back and often there were people who repeated this. Well, we thought it was time to raise the level of commitment to show how serious we were about trying to transform our society into a more just society.\n\nDecades later, as the AP notes , Gaither's name along with the names of the rest of the Friendship 9⎯W.T. \"Dub\" Massey, Willie McCleod, Robert McCullough, James Wells, David Williamson Jr., John Gaines, and Mack Workman-are engraved on the restaurant 's stools where the man sat so many decades before. The trespassing charges will also remain, as the men requested that their records not be expunged by Wednesday's ruling."

      "text": "The Day the Civil-Rights Movement Changed\n\nWhat my father saw in Mississippi\n\nThere's a video of James Baldwin interviewing a stranger with my daddy's face. The VHS tape of this interview has been in my family for 40 years. The cassette bears a label that reads, \"James Baldwin Interviews Civil Rights Workers (1981).\" Baldwin himself gave the tape to my dad, who doesn't recall ever watching it. It stayed at my mother's house after my parents' divorce, collecting dust until I started researching my father's life a few years ago.\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nThe man whose face appears on the screen is my father, but not the one who figures in my memories from childhood. The man in the video is scowling, his hands pressed against his temples, the skin around his jaw drooping. I'd thought that the Dave Dennis Sr. I'd seen behind podiums with his finger to the sky, the civil-rights veteran who galvanized crowds, was the man who'd emerged from the movement. The Baldwin tape tells a different history. In this grainy video, the stranger dad is lost in his own fury. All that's left is a hardness. A calloused, impenetrable husk. His nostrils flare and he looks like he wants to set the world on fire. I'd seen him angry before. But never like that.\n\nIn the video, he talks about the 1964 Freedom Summer, when he and thousands of other activists campaigned for voter registration in Mississippi, facing unchecked violence from white protesters and police. He talks about the murders of his friends and the way the search for their remains also uncovered the mutilated, decapitated, desecrated bodies of long-forgotten and nameless Black Mississippians.\n\nMy father had told me these stories, but watching the video, I realized that I hadn't fully appreciated how they had affected him. I asked my father to tell them again, so I could better understand the man on the tape and so I could pass those stories on to my own children. Though his recollections were vivid, memory is always imperfect, so I talked with his friends in the movement and pored over historical documents and newspaper clippings as well, trying to fill in the gaps as best I could. But these are my father's stories, and I found that the only way I could tell them was in his voice. The dialogue you'll read in this essay all comes from my father's recollections. As he recounted events like the murder of his friend Medgar Evers, I saw flashes of that stranger on the tape.\n\nT he first time I met Medgar Evers, he was standing in his office at the Masonic Temple in West Jackson. \"Looks like my desk is the first tour stop for outsiders, huh? Someone must have told you that I like it when you all come to Mississippi looking for trouble.\" It was spring 1962. I was part of a flood of out-of-towners trying to do what we could to help the Mississippians who were already putting their lives on the line . An activist named Tom Gaither had given me the names of people I needed to get to know if I was going to survive in Mississippi, and Medgar was at the top of the list.\n\nMedgar was the son of a sawmill worker and a laundress from Decatur, Mississippi. He'd served in World War II, fighting in France and Germany before heading back home. Then, in 1954, he became the NAACP's field secretary, traveling throughout Mississippi to visit churches and preach the sermon of voter registration. He also spent his time investigating killings and searching for missing Black folks, doing what he could for every family who lost someone.\n\nFrom the May 2022 issue: Who will remember the Mississippi murders?\n\nBeing caught with an NAACP membership card could mean danger for a Black person in Mississippi. I knew a member who hid his card in a tin can in his backyard. \"Here's what you need to know about Medgar,\" Tom had told me. \"He keeps his membership card in his damn pocket.\"\n\n\"Where you from, kid?\" Medgar's warmth and confidence were evident from behind his desk, even though he was trying to give me a hard time. \"Actually, you don't have to answer that. I've known about you since the Freedom Rides\"-when a few dozen of us had been arrested in Jackson in 1961 for protesting segregated bus stations. I'd come from Louisiana to Mississippi as a field secretary for the Congress of Racial Equality, known as CORE, and I was enamored of the way the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC, had taken on the mission of voter registration. \"I knew y'all were coming back,\" Medgar said. \"You never really leave Mississippi.\"\n\nI told him I'd returned because I wanted to do what I could to get as many Black voters as possible. Medgar paused. \"What if I told you that you outsiders are going to just show up here and get people killed?\" he said. \"What if I told you that you and those SNCC kids running around were reckless?\" Maybe, he said, the sharecroppers and seamstresses were doing what they could on their own time, and doing it safely. \"What if I told you we didn't really need you here?\"\n\nI started talking before I had formed an answer. I said that if the people I met in Mississippi told me they didn't need me, I'd knock on Medgar's door again and ask him to drive me to the bus station so I could head back to Louisiana.\n\nMedgar got up from his desk and slowly walked over to me, his navy-blue suit fitting immaculately. He extended his hand and smiled this big smile that felt like a hug. \"Well then, all I can say is welcome to the real Mississippi. You got time for Smackover's?\"\n\nSmackover's was the place Medgar and I would go to for coffee or a plate of soul food and sweet tea. It's where I would get to know the man I'd eventually call my best friend.\n\n\"I admire you kids over there in SNCC and CORE, even though y'all all got screws loose.\" He was 15 years older than me, so he loved calling us kids. \"Sometimes the NAACP won't mix it up on the street level like we need to, and you kids just ... Y'all just get your tails beat like it's nothing.\"\n\nIn Focus: Photos from the civil-rights battles of 1964\n\nI told him I'd never quite learned how to get anything done without taking a beating. But he was the one with the NAACP card. He was just as ready to die as any of us.\n\nThat was where we differed, he said. \"I love us and I want us to be free. But I have a wife and three babies at home. You got kids, Dave?\"\n\nI said I did not. I'd never even considered such a possibility.\n\n\"Didn't think so.\" He said that the movement would go on without him if it had to. But his children needed him. He insisted that I'd be less willing to fall in front of bullets if I had to kiss a family goodbye every day. \"And I got two guns in that trunk that say that even if I invite danger,\" he told me, \"danger coming to me is getting a hell of a welcome gift.\"\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones: Did Freedom Summer 1964 really change Mississippi?\n\nMedgar drove me around Mississippi, introducing me to every person he thought I needed to know. He could talk business with Black lawyers and doctors and chat with farmers about how the crops were growing, from Indianola to Hattiesburg. All the while, he taught me about Mississippi. People embraced me because Medgar told them to. He introduced me to countless locals whose practical knowledge helped keep me safe. I would never have survived without him.\n\nThe bullet that tore through Medgar's flesh on June 12, 1963, changed the movement forever . Returning from an NAACP event after midnight, he was shot in the back as he got out of his car and walked toward his house. The country couldn't deny the truth of what had happened to Medgar. I remember hearing the word assassination used for the first time to describe the killing of a Black activist. Death was always possible, but some deaths we'd had time to prepare for-after a wrong turn down the wrong dark road, or whistling at a white woman. That's what death had looked like for us before. The act of registering Black people to vote and the quest to dismantle the American power structure made us feel a different kind of terror. We were going to change the country, after all, and that meant we were going to face coordinated, organized, directed murder.\n\nIn the 1950s, Mississippi formed a government entity called the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission with the goal of preserving segregation. The commission actively spread disinformation and privately funded white-supremacist groups. The state helped prepare the legal defense for Medgar's assassin. Long before that, the commission had been a daily nemesis in our lives, routinely employing spies to attend our meetings and follow us around. Some of these spies were Black people who had been paid off. All we could do was go about our regular business and hope for the best.\n\nWhatever sense of adventure we were feeling disappeared with Medgar. We weren't just fighting racists and cops. We were fighting the entire government. This is something we had always known, but the way Medgar was killed became a ringing in our ears that kept us from sleeping.\n\nFor me, losing Medgar ripped my soul apart. The last words I said to him-\"Someone's gonna get killed riding around with you\"-still bounce off my walls at night and haunt me when I wake up, sweat trickling down my chest. Why Medgar? Why him and not me?\n\nLife after Medgar's assassination felt like a series of moments between tragedies. And the tragedies started the very next morning, before I could even grieve.\n\nSome local students had already gotten riled up enough to start marching, so I wanted to make sure they could do it as safely as possible. Two hundred or so of us set out from Medgar's office at the Masonic Temple. The march didn't last long. The police had dozens of students locked up at the Mississippi State Fairgrounds. But I barely had time to worry about that, because I was still occupied with another crisis that had been brewing: Mrs. Hamer was in trouble.\n\nThree days earlier, Fannie Lou Hamer, a former sharecropper who had quickly become a guiding force of the Mississippi movement, and nine other activists had been on a bus trip back from a voter-registration training led by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, or SCLC, in South Carolina. When the bus stopped, the group would periodically sit at an interstate bus station's lunch counter or use its restrooms to test compliance with the federal regulations prohibiting segregation at such places. This upset the white bus driver, who began making phone calls at stops along the way. As the journey continued, Mrs. Hamer led the group in singing freedom songs, maybe in part to needle the driver. When Mrs. Hamer's group got to Winona, Mississippi, they realized that the driver had alerted the police.\n\nFive of the riders-June Johnson, Annell Ponder, Euvester Simpson, Rosemary Freeman, and James West-got out to use the \"whites only\" restrooms and sit down at the segregated lunch counter. The police were ready, and the riders were arrested. Mrs. Hamer saw the arrests from the bus and got out to talk with her friends. The police intercepted her, told her to get in their car, and kicked her. The jailhouse in Winona would become a torture chamber for her and the others who were forced inside .\n\nFirst was June Johnson.\n\nThe sheriff asked her if she was in the NAACP. June could have said no, but she said yes. The officer hit her in the face and stomach, asking her who ran the NAACP; she told him the people did. Then the sheriff, the chief of police, a state trooper, and another cop threw her to the floor and beat her, stomping her and tearing her clothes. They cracked her head with a blackjack, leaving her bloodied. She never gave them the answers they wanted. She was 15 years old.\n\nAnnell Ponder, an SCLC field supervisor, was a Georgia native and graduate of Clark College. The officers put her in the booking room and beat her with blackjacks and a belt, and said they'd keep beating her until she said \"Yes, sir\" when addressing them. She refused to say it.\n\nThe police tossed James West, the lone male in the group, in a cell with a few other incarcerated Black men. The cops then handed those men a blackjack and told them to beat on West. After they finished, the officers gave them shots of corn liquor as a reward for the violence.\n\nThen the cops dragged Mrs. Hamer into the cell with the incarcerated Black men, who reeked of alcohol. The officers made one of the men lash her until his arms gave out. Her booming voice, which had awakened the spirit in so many of us, was now a scream of terror. Then it was another imprisoned man's turn. He hesitated. Mrs. Hamer, her dress pulled up to expose her back and buttocks, blood soaking the sheets below her, looked back and, as she later told me, said to the man, \"Now go on 'head and do what you gotta do, because they gonna do you worse than you do me if you don't.\"\n\nThe man wept as he whipped her. He apologized through tears, but his crying didn't pause his swings.\n\nWhen Mrs. Hamer was finally allowed back into her cell, Euvester Simpson, who was all of 17 at the time, took care of her. In the night, Mrs. Hamer developed a fever and her blood pressure spiked. Simpson, wetting a towel, wiped Mrs. Hamer's forehead, the welts on her back, and her hands, which had turned purple from trying to shield herself.\n\nThey got through the night by singing. One lyric they sang over and over again was: \" Walk with me, Lord / Walk with me, Lord / While I'm on this tedious journey / I want Jesus to walk with me .\"\n\nMrs. Hamer and the others had been arrested the Sunday before Medgar was killed, and a group of us spent the rest of that day trying to find them. Hollis Watkins, a wily SNCC member, called jails in the area and threatened them by claiming, falsely, that the FBI was looking for the missing. Lawrence Guyot, a SNCC field secretary from Pass Christian, Mississippi, figured out that they were in Winona. When he went to the jail demanding answers, he was also arrested. While he was handcuffed, the police pounced. More blackjacks. More swelling and blood. They dragged Guyot to a cell.\n\nI spent hours calling anyone I could, trying to find out what was going on. Eventually, I got word that the SCLC had secured bail money, so an organizer, Andrew Young, and a few other SCLC members drove down from Birmingham, Alabama, to get everyone out of jail. The first thing Mrs. Hamer heard when she left jail was that Medgar was dead.\n\nPolice had brutalized activists in Winona, and Medgar had been assassinated. All in one week in Mississippi. A few days later, when I saw Mrs. Hamer, I felt a rage I hadn't felt before.\n\nShe looked like she was wearing a mask too small for her face. Her cheeks and forehead were swollen beyond recognition, and she could hardly open her eyes. I remember her trying to smile and her face barely moving as she told me about what had happened in that jail. It was the first time I'd heard the gruesome details. \"It's not the physical pain,\" she said through cracked, bloody lips. \"They lifted my skirt, Dave. That's the worst part. They lifted my skirt.\"\n\nI'll never get over her face. For the first time through all of this-bombings, burning crosses-I felt a desire for revenge. I wanted those white men dead. I wanted to walk to Winona and kill them all in their sleep. I wanted to bring their bodies to Mrs. Hamer and Annell and Euvester and tell them I had done this for them.\n\nI returned to Jackson, to a city that felt the way I felt. The Black community loved Medgar, and wanted the same revenge I wanted. But I had to betray my own instincts in order to keep as many people alive as I could. It all came to a head at Medgar's funeral.\n\nI didn't want to go to the ceremony. I didn't want to see the pomp and circumstance. I didn't want to believe he was dead. Instead, I roamed Farish Street, in the center of Jackson's Black business district, where the funeral would be held, and walked by an alley where some young Black men were gathered. Medgar had previously introduced me to this crew. They called themselves the \"Corner Boys\" and had taken on the role of community protectors, always keeping an eye out when white folks drove down Farish Street. They were generally peaceful, but today I noticed the handguns in their pockets and I saw the shotguns they weren't even trying to hide.\n\nI tried to persuade them to put their weapons away-to tell them that, if they started any violence, the police would end it. But they'd heard about our way long enough. Our way got Medgar, whom they all loved, killed. I didn't have any comeback to that.\n\nWe were arguing, but saying the same thing. We just wanted the hurt to go away. I kept walking down Farish Street, peeking through alleyways between the buildings. Men were standing by with guns in their hands, like they were ready to fire bullets at anyone who dared to bother the funeral. I kept walking south toward downtown. Then, around a corner and over the horizon, I saw the horsemen of the apocalypse. Not just four, but dozens. Police officers, state troopers, and sheriff's deputies were dressed for a massacre: Riot gear. Rifles. Shotguns. Some were indeed on horseback. Others held back snarling dogs. They were waiting for the funeral march to come their way. Violent or not, it wouldn't matter. I felt certain they had the green light to kill as many Black people as possible.\n\nI turned around and ran to all the alleyways and corners I could find, trying to talk to the men who were waiting with knives and guns. I kept begging them not to do anything, for their own good. I had to stop them from running into that wall of white rage without telling them what exactly was waiting for them. I didn't want them to take the possible war as a challenge. When I looked back up Farish Street, an agitated mass of Black marchers was heading straight toward the white militia.\n\nThe police arrested the first few marchers. But they weren't going to stop there. Several of the white men waved their batons with abandon. The Black folks weren't having it. They started tossing bottles and swinging any objects they could get their hands on. The police seemed to want blood. The only thing that eventually slowed them down was a single white man with a megaphone.\n\nJohn Doar was a Republican lawyer from Wisconsin who had started at the Justice Department in 1960 under President Dwight Eisenhower and stayed to work under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, making it his personal crusade to find justice for Black folks . He put his life on the line to bail the civil-rights leader Bob Moses out of jail in Mississippi whenever Bob got arrested for marches or for trying to register people to vote. Doar told Moses and me to call the Justice Department if we were arrested. When Black people disappeared, Doar's fingernails may as well have been filled with dirt from digging up bodies. He was there to make sure James Meredith got to Ole Miss, in the face of a furious mob protesting the school's first Black student. And it was Doar's presence that halted the white militia's march, most likely because the police knew he was a government official, and they didn't want the FBI on their back.\n\nI'd met Doar in planning meetings, and I would always call him if someone went missing or if I needed help getting somebody out of trouble. Most of the Black protesters on Farish Street, though, had no idea who Doar was. They just saw a white man who looked like an FBI agent. \"Please! Just listen to me! This is an unsafe situation! Please turn around!\" he kept yelling into the megaphone. As I approached Doar, I saw a Black man running toward him, out of his line of vision. He had a brick in his hand, raised above his head. I sprinted and got between them.\n\n\"Dave?\" said the man with the brick. \"The hell you doing?\"\n\n\"He's with the movement, brother. You're making a mistake.\"\n\nNearby, another man put down a shotgun he'd aimed at Doar.\n\n\"Jesus, thank God, Dave,\" Doar said. He handed me his megaphone, and asked me to say something to help stop things from going any further.\n\nI grabbed the megaphone and begged everyone to stop their march. To de-escalate, calm down, and go home, even though I wanted to join them and burn everything to the ground. It's what this damn city deserved. But we had to survive to fight. The crowd quieted.\n\nLosing Medgar ultimately galvanized the movement. In the months that followed his death, we would pull ourselves together and find a resolve we didn't know we had. A year after he was killed, we would launch the Freedom Summer, when thousands of activists campaigned for voter registration in Mississippi.\n\nAnd yet, at that moment, we all just stood around Farish Street like we'd collectively woken up from a nightmare. Like something had taken over us. A few people wandered home, left with their grief and anger. The rest of us stayed behind to clean up the mess.\n\nThe kids listened to me because Medgar had brought me in to train them. The rest of the people, rage-filled locals who loved Medgar, listened to me because they'd seen me with him. I think they knew he would have vouched for me if he were there. Medgar was still saving lives from a grave he hadn't yet been buried in.\n\nThis essay is adapted from David Dennis Jr.'s book, The Movement Made Us: A Father, a Son, and the Legacy of a Freedom Ride .

      "text": "The Great Land Robbery\n\nThe shameful story of how 1 million black families have been ripped from their farms\n\nImages above: A sign on a utility pole to deter hunters, near the old Scott-family homestead, Drew, Mississippi; Willena's brother Isaac Daniel Scott Sr. amid soybeans in Mound Bayou.\n\nUpdated at 2:15 p.m. ET on September 29, 2019.\n\n\"You ever chop before?\" Willena Scott-White was testing me. I sat with her in the cab of a Chevy Silverado pickup truck, swatting at the squadrons of giant, fluttering mosquitoes that had invaded the interior the last time she opened a window. I was spending the day with her family as they worked their fields just outside Ruleville, in Mississippi's Leflore County. With her weathered brown hands, Scott-White gave me a pork sandwich wrapped in a grease-stained paper towel. I slapped my leg. Mosquitoes can bite through denim, it turns out.\n\nCotton sowed with planters must be chopped-thinned and weeded manually with hoes-to produce orderly rows of fluffy bolls. The work is backbreaking, and the people who do it maintain that no other job on Earth is quite as demanding. I had labored long hours over other crops, but had to admit to Scott-White, a 60-something grandmother who'd grown up chopping, that I'd never done it.\n\n\"Then you ain't never worked,\" she replied.\n\nThe fields alongside us as we drove were monotonous. With row crops, monotony is good. But as we toured 1,000 acres of land in Leflore and Bolivar Counties, straddling Route 61, Scott-White pointed out the demarcations between plots. A trio of steel silos here. A post there. A patch of scruffy wilderness in the distance. Each landmark was a reminder of the Scott legacy that she had fought to keep-or to regain-and she noted this with pride. Each one was also a reminder of an inheritance that had once been stolen.\n\nDrive Route 61 through the Mississippi Delta and you'll find much of the scenery exactly as it was 50 or 75 years ago. Imposing plantations and ramshackle shotgun houses still populate the countryside from Memphis to Vicksburg. Fields stretch to the horizon. The hands that dig into black Delta dirt belong to people like Willena Scott-White, African Americans who bear faces and names passed down from men and women who were owned here, who were kept here, and who chose to stay here, tending the same fields their forebears tended.\n\nBut some things have changed. Back in the day, snow-white bolls of King Cotton reigned. Now much of the land is green with soybeans. The farms and plantations are much larger-industrial operations with bioengineered plants, laser-guided tractors, and crop-dusting drones. Fewer and fewer farms are still owned by actual farmers. Investors in boardrooms throughout the country have bought hundreds of thousands of acres of premium Delta land. If you're one of the millions of people who have a retirement account with the Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association, for instance, you might even own a little bit yourself.\n\nTIAA is one of the largest pension firms in the United States. Together with its subsidiaries and associated funds, it has a portfolio of more than 80,000 acres in Mississippi alone, most of them in the Delta. If the fertile crescent of Arkansas is included, TIAA holds more than 130,000 acres in a strip of counties along the Mississippi River. And TIAA is not the only big corporate landlord in the region. Hancock Agricultural Investment Group manages more than 65,000 acres in what it calls the \"Delta states.\" The real-estate trust Farmland Partners has 30,000 acres in and around the Delta. AgriVest, a subsidiary of the Swiss bank UBS, owned 22,000 acres as of 2011. (AgriVest did not respond to a request for more recent information.)\n\nUnlike their counterparts even two or three generations ago, black people living and working in the Delta today have been almost completely uprooted from the soil-as property owners, if not as laborers. In Washington County, Mississippi, where last February TIAA reportedly bought 50,000 acres for more than $200 million, black people make up 72 percent of the population but own only 11 percent of the farmland, in part or in full. In Tunica County, where TIAA has acquired plantations from some of the oldest farm-owning white families in the state, black people make up 77 percent of the population but own only 6 percent of the farmland. In Holmes County, the third-blackest county in the nation, black people make up about 80 percent of the population but own only 19 percent of the farmland. TIAA owns plantations there, too. In just a few years, a single company has accumulated a portfolio in the Delta almost equal to the remaining holdings of the African Americans who have lived on and shaped this land for centuries.\n\nThis is not a story about TIAA-at least not primarily. The company's newfound dominance in the region is merely the topsoil covering a history of loss and legally sanctioned theft in which TIAA played no part. But TIAA's position is instrumental in understanding both how the crimes of Jim Crow have been laundered by time and how the legacy of ill-gotten gains has become a structural part of American life. The land was wrested first from Native Americans, by force. It was then cleared, watered, and made productive for intensive agriculture by the labor of enslaved Africans, who after Emancipation would come to own a portion of it. Later, through a variety of means-sometimes legal, often coercive, in many cases legal and coercive, occasionally violent-farmland owned by black people came into the hands of white people. It was aggregated into larger holdings, then aggregated again, eventually attracting the interest of Wall Street.\n\nOwners of small farms everywhere, black and white alike, have long been buffeted by larger economic forces. But what happened to black landowners in the South, and particularly in the Delta, is distinct, and was propelled not only by economic change but also by white racism and local white power. A war waged by deed of title has dispossessed 98 percent of black agricultural landowners in America. They have lost 12 million acres over the past century. But even that statement falsely consigns the losses to long-ago history. In fact, the losses mostly occurred within living memory, from the 1950s onward. Today, except for a handful of farmers like the Scotts who have been able to keep or get back some land, black people in this most productive corner of the Deep South own almost nothing of the bounty under their feet.\n\nLand has always been the main battleground of racial conflict in Mississippi. During Reconstruction, fierce resistance from the planters who had dominated antebellum society effectively killed any promise of land or protection from the Freedmen's Bureau, forcing masses of black laborers back into de facto bondage. But the sheer size of the black population-black people were a majority in Mississippi until the 1930s-meant that thousands were able to secure tenuous footholds as landowners between Emancipation and the Great Depression.\n\nDriven by what W. E. B. Du Bois called \"land hunger\" among freedmen during Reconstruction, two generations of black workers squirreled away money and went after every available and affordable plot they could, no matter how marginal or hopeless. Some found sympathetic white landowners who would sell to them. Some squatted on unused land or acquired the few homesteads available to black people. Some followed visionary leaders to all-black utopian agrarian experiments, such as Mound Bayou, in Bolivar County.\n\nFrom March 1901: W. E. B. Du Bois's 'The Freedmen's Bureau'\n\nIt was never much, and it was never close to just, but by the early 20th century, black people had something to hold on to. In 1900, according to the historian James C. Cobb, black landowners in Tunica County outnumbered white ones three to one. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, there were 25,000 black farm operators in 1910, an increase of almost 20 percent from 1900. Black farmland in Mississippi totaled 2.2 million acres in 1910-some 14 percent of all black-owned agricultural land in the country, and the most of any state.\n\nThe foothold was never secure. From the beginning, even the most enterprising black landowners found themselves fighting a war of attrition, often fraught with legal obstacles that made passing title to future generations difficult. Bohlen Lucas, one of the few black Democratic politicians in the Delta during Reconstruction (most black politicians at the time were Republicans), was born enslaved and managed to buy a 200-acre farm from his former overseer, as the historian John C. Willis has documented in his 2000 book, Forgotten Time . But, like many farmers, who often have to borrow against expected harvests to pay for equipment, supplies, and the rent or mortgage on their land, Lucas depended on credit extended by powerful lenders. In his case, credit depended specifically on white patronage, given in exchange for his help voting out the Reconstruction government-after which his patrons abandoned him. He was left with 20 acres.\n\nIn Humphreys County, Lewis Spearman avoided the pitfalls of white patronage by buying less valuable wooded tracts and grazing cattle there as he moved into cotton. (Spearman's biographical details, too, appear in Forgotten Time .) But when cotton crashed in the 1880s, Spearman, over his head in debt, crashed with it. *\n\nAround the turn of the century, in Leflore County, a black farm organizer and proponent of self-sufficiency-referred to as a \"notoriously bad Negro\" in the local newspapers-led a black populist awakening, marching defiantly and by some accounts bringing boycotts against white merchants. White farmers responded with a posse that may have killed as many as 100 black farmers and sharecroppers along with women and children. The fate of the \"bad Negro\" in question, named Oliver Cromwell, is uncertain. Some sources say he escaped to Jackson, and into anonymity.\n\nLike so many of his forebears, Ed Scott Sr., Willena Scott-White's grandfather, acquired his land through not much more than force of will. As recorded in the thick binders of family history that Willena had brought along in the truck, and that we flipped through between stretches of work in the fields, his life had attained the gloss of folklore. He was born in 1886 in western Alabama, a generation removed from bondage. Spurred by that same land hunger, Scott took his young family to the Delta, seeking opportunities to farm his own property. He sharecropped and rented, and managed large farms for white planters, who valued his ability to run their sprawling estates. One of these men was Palmer H. Brooks, who owned a 7,000-acre plantation in Mississippi's Leflore and Sunflower Counties. Brooks was uncommonly progressive, encouraging entrepreneurship among the black laborers on his plantation, building schools and churches for them, and providing loans. Scott was ready when Brooks decided to sell plots to black laborers, and he bought his first 100 acres.\n\nUnlike Bohlen Lucas, Scott largely avoided politics. Unlike Lewis Spearman, he paid his debts and kept some close white allies-a necessity, since he usually rejected government assistance. And unlike Oliver Cromwell, he led his community under the rules already in place, appearing content with what he'd earned for his family in an environment of total segregation. He leveraged technical skills and a talent for management to impress sympathetic white people and disarm hostile ones. \"Granddaddy always had nice vehicles,\" Scott-White told me. They were a trapping of pride in a life of toil. As was true in most rural areas at the time, a new truck was not just a flashy sign of prosperity but also a sort of credit score. Wearing starched dress shirts served the same purpose, elevating Scott in certain respects-always within limits-even above some white farmers who drove into town in dirty overalls. The trucks got shinier as his holdings grew. By the time Scott died, in 1957, he had amassed more than 1,000 acres of farmland.\n\nScott-White guided me right up to the Quiver River, where the legend of her family began. It was a choked, green-brown gurgle of a thing, the kind of lazy waterway that one imagines to be brimming with fat, yawning catfish and snakes. \"Mr. Brooks sold all of the land on the east side of this river to black folks,\" Scott-White told me. She swept her arm to encompass the endless acres. \"All of these were once owned by black families.\"\n\nThat era of black ownership , in the Delta and throughout the country, was already fading by the time Scott died. As the historian Pete Daniel recounts, half a million black-owned farms across the country failed in the 25 years after 1950. Joe Brooks, the former president of the Emergency Land Fund, a group founded in 1972 to fight the problem of dispossession, has estimated that something on the order of 6 million acres was lost by black farmers from 1950 to 1969. That's an average of 820 acres a day-an area the size of New York's Central Park erased with each sunset. Black-owned cotton farms in the South almost completely disappeared, diminishing from 87,000 to just over 3,000 in the 1960s alone. According to the Census of Agriculture, the racial disparity in farm acreage increased in Mississippi from 1950 to 1964, when black farmers lost almost 800,000 acres of land. An analysis for The Atlantic by a research team that included Dania Francis, at the University of Massachusetts, and Darrick Hamilton, at Ohio State, translates this land loss into a financial loss-including both property and income-of $3.7 billion to $6.6 billion in today's dollars.\n\nJesmyn Ward: Racism is 'built into the very bones' of Mississippi\n\nThis was a silent and devastating catastrophe, one created and maintained by federal policy. President Franklin D. Roosevelt's New Deal life raft for agriculture helped start the trend in 1937 with the establishment of the Farm Security Administration, an agency within the Department of Agriculture. Although the FSA ostensibly existed to help the country's small farmers, as happened with much of the rest of the New Deal, white administrators often ignored or targeted poor black people-denying them loans and giving sharecropping work to white people. After Roosevelt's death, in 1945, conservatives in Congress replaced the FSA with the Farmers Home Administration, or FmHA. The FmHA quickly transformed the FSA's programs for small farmers, establishing the sinews of the loan-and-subsidy structure that undergirds American agriculture today. In 1961, President John F. Kennedy's administration created the Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, or ASCS, a complementary program to the FmHA that also provided loans to farmers. The ASCS was a federal effort-also within the Department of Agriculture-but, crucially, the members of committees doling out money and credit were elected locally, during a time when black people were prohibited from voting.\n\nThrough these programs, and through massive crop and surplus purchasing, the USDA became the safety net, price-setter, chief investor, and sole regulator for most of the farm economy in places like the Delta. The department could offer better loan terms to risky farmers than banks and other lenders, and mostly outcompeted private credit. In his book Dispossession , Daniel calls the setup \"agrigovernment.\" Land-grant universities pumped out both farm operators and the USDA agents who connected those operators to federal money. Large plantations ballooned into even larger industrial crop factories as small farms collapsed. The mega-farms held sway over agricultural policy, resulting in more money, at better interest rates, for the plantations themselves. At every level of agrigovernment, the leaders were white.\n\nMajor audits and investigations of the USDA have found that illegal pressures levied through its loan programs created massive transfers of wealth from black to white farmers, especially in the period just after the 1950s. In 1965, the United States Commission on Civil Rights uncovered blatant and dramatic racial differences in the level of federal investment in farmers. The commission found that in a sample of counties across the South, the FmHA provided much larger loans for small and medium-size white-owned farms, relative to net worth, than it did for similarly sized black-owned farms-evidence that racial discrimination \"has served to accelerate the displacement and impoverishment of the Negro farmer.\"\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nIn Sunflower County, a man named Ted Keenan told investigators that in 1956, local banks had denied him loans after a bad crop because of his position with the NAACP, where he openly advocated for voting rights. The FmHA had denied him loans as well. Keenan described how Eugene Fisackerly, the leader of the White Citizens' Council in Sunflower County, together with representatives of Senator James Eastland, a notorious white supremacist who maintained a large plantation there, had intimidated him into renouncing his affiliation with the NAACP and agreeing not to vote. Only then did Eastland's man call the local FmHA agent, prompting him to reconsider Keenan's loan.\n\nA landmark 2001 investigation by the Associated Press into extortion, exploitation, and theft directed against black farmers uncovered more than 100 cases like Keenan's. In the 1950s and '60s, Norman Weathersby, a Holmes County Chevrolet dealer who enjoyed a local monopoly on trucks and heavy farm equipment, required black farmers to put up land as collateral for loans on equipment. A close friend of his, William Strider, was the local FmHA agent. Black farmers in the area claimed that the two ran a racket: Strider would slow-walk them on FmHA loans, which meant they would then default on Weathersby's loans and lose their land to him. Strider and Weathersby were reportedly free to run this racket because black farmers were shut out by local banks.\n\nAnalyzing the history of federal programs, the Emergency Land Fund emphasizes a key distinction. While most of the black land loss appears on its face to have been through legal mechanisms-\"the tax sale; the partition sale; and the foreclosure\"-it mainly stemmed from illegal pressures, including discrimination in federal and state programs, swindles by lawyers and speculators, unlawful denials of private loans, and even outright acts of violence or intimidation. Discriminatory loan servicing and loan denial by white-controlled FmHA and ASCS committees forced black farmers into foreclosure, after which their property could be purchased by wealthy landowners, almost all of whom were white. Discrimination by private lenders had the same result. Many black farmers who escaped foreclosure were defrauded by white tax assessors who set assessments too high, leading to unaffordable tax obligations. The inevitable result: tax sales, where, again, the land was purchased by wealthy white people. Black people's lack of access to legal services complicated inheritances and put family claims to title in jeopardy. Lynchings, police brutality, and other forms of intimidation were sometimes used to dispossess black farmers, and even when land wasn't a motivation for such actions, much of the violence left land without an owner.\n\nIn interviews with researchers from the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in 1985, Henry Woodard Sr., an African American who had bought land in the 1950s in Tunica County, said he had managed to keep up for years through a combination of his own industry, small loans from the FmHA and white banks, and the rental of additional land from other hard-pressed black landowners. Then, in 1966, the activist James Meredith-whose 1962 fight to integrate Ole Miss sparked deadly riots and a wave of white backlash-embarked on the famous March Against Fear . The next planting season, Woodard recalled, his white lenders ignored him. \"I sensed that it was because of this march,\" he said. \"And it was a lady told me-I was at the post office and she told me, she said, 'Henry, you Negroes, y'all want to live like white folks. Y'all don't know how white folks live. But y'all are gonna have to be on your own now.' \"\n\nWoodard's story would have been familiar to countless farmers in the Delta. In Holmes County, a crucible of the voting-rights movement, a black effort to integrate the local ASCS committees was so successful that it was subject to surveillance and sabotage by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, an official agency created by Governor J. P. Coleman in 1956 to resist integration. Black landowners involved in running for the committees or organizing for votes faced fierce retaliation. In 1965, The New Republic reported that in Issaquena County, just north of Vicksburg, the \"insurance of Negroes active in the ASCS elections had been canceled, loans were denied to Negroes on all crops but cotton, and ballots were not mailed to Negro wives who were co-owners of land.\" Even in the decades after the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, formal and informal complaints against the USDA poured out of the Delta.\n\nThese cases of dispossession can only be called theft. While the civil-rights era is remembered as a time of victories against disenfranchisement and segregation, many realities never changed. The engine of white wealth built on kleptocracy-which powered both Jim Crow and its slave-state precursor-continued to run. The black population in Mississippi declined by almost one-fifth from 1950 to 1970, as the white population increased by the exact same percentage. Farmers slipped away one by one into the night, appearing later as laborers in Chicago and Detroit. By the time black people truly gained the ballot in Mississippi, they were a clear minority, held in thrall to a white conservative supermajority.\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones: Freedom Summer, 1964: Did it really change Mississippi?\n\nMass dispossession did not require a central organizing force or a grand conspiracy. Thousands of individual decisions by white people, enabled or motivated by greed, racism, existing laws, and market forces, all pushed in a single direction. But some white people undeniably would have organized it this way if they could have. The civil-rights leader Bayard Rustin reported in 1956 that documents taken from the office of Robert Patterson, one of the founding fathers of the White Citizens' Councils, proposed a \"master plan\" to force hundreds of thousands of black people from Mississippi in order to reduce their potential voting power. Patterson envisioned, in Rustin's words, \"the decline of the small independent farmer\" and ample doses of \"economic pressure.\"\n\nAn upheaval of this scale and speed-the destruction of black farming, an occupation that had defined the African American experience-might in any other context be described as a revolution, or seen as a historical fulcrum. But it came and went with little remark.\n\nWorld War II transformed America in many ways. It certainly transformed a generation of southern black men. That generation included Medgar Evers, a future civil-rights martyr, assassinated while leading the Mississippi NAACP; he served in a segregated transportation company in Europe during the war. It included Willena's father, Ed Scott Jr., who also served in a segregated transportation company. These men were less patient, more defiant, and in many ways more reckless than their fathers and grandfathers had been. They chafed under a system that forced them to relearn how to bow and scrape, as if the war had never happened. In the younger Scott's case, wartime service sharpened his inherited land hunger, pushing him to seek more land and greater financial independence, both for himself and for his community. One of his siblings told his biographer, Julian Rankin, that the family's deepest conviction was that \"a million years from now ... this land will still be Scotts' land.\"\n\nUpon his return to the Delta, Scott continued down his father's hard path, avoiding any interface with the FmHA and the public portions of the agrigovernment system, which by that time had spread its tendrils throughout Sunflower and Leflore Counties. He leaned on the friendships he and his father had made with local business owners and farmers, and secured credit for growing his holdings from friendly white bankers. Influenced by the civil-rights movement and its emphasis on community solidarity and activism, Scott borrowed from Oliver Cromwell's self-sufficiency playbook too. He used his status to provide opportunities for other black farmers and laborers. \"Daddy said that everyone who worked for us would always be able to eat,\" Willena Scott-White told me. He made sure of more than that. Scott sent relatives' and tenants' children to school, paid for books, helped people open bank accounts and buy their own land. When civil-rights activists made their way down for Mississippi's Freedom Summer, in 1964, he packed up meals and brought them to rallies.\n\nWhen Scott-White thinks of her father, who died in 2015, she seems to become a young girl again. With allowances for nostalgia, she recalls a certain kind of country poorness-but-not-poverty, whereby children ran barefoot and worked from the moment they could walk, but ate well, lived in houses with solid floors and tight roofs, and went to high school and college if they showed skill. \"We lived in something like a utopia,\" Scott-White told me. But things changed at the tail end of the 1970s. Plummeting commodity prices forced highly leveraged farmers to seek loans wherever they could find them. Combined with the accelerating inflation of that decade, the beginnings of the farm-credit crisis made farming at scale without federal assistance impossible. Yet federal help-even then, two decades after the Civil Rights Act-was not available for most black farmers. According to a 2005 article in The Nation , \"In 1984 and 1985, at the height of the farm crisis, the USDA lent a total of $1.3 billion to nearly 16,000 farmers to help them maintain their land. Only 209 of those farmers were black.\"\n\nAs Rankin tells it in his biography, Catfish Dream , Scott made his first visit to an FmHA office in 1978. With the assistance of Vance Nimrod, a white man who worked with the black-owned Delta Foundation, a nonprofit promoting economic advancement for black Mississippians, Scott secured an operating loan for a season of soybeans and rice from the FmHA agent Delbert Edwards. The first time was easy-although, crucially, Nimrod accompanied him to the Leflore County office, in Greenwood. When Scott returned the next year without Nimrod, driving a shiny new truck the way his father used to, Edwards asked where Nimrod was. According to Rankin, Scott told the agent that Nimrod had only come to help secure that first loan; he wasn't a business partner. When Edwards saw Scott's vehicle, he seemed perplexed. \"Who told you to buy a new truck?\" he asked. Edwards ended up denying the requested loan amount.\n\nAt the same time, Edwards and the FmHA were moving to help local white farmers weather the storm, often by advising them to get into raising catfish. Commercial catfish farming was a relatively new industry, and it had found a home in the Delta as prices for row crops crashed and new legislation gave the USDA power and incentive to build up domestic fish farming. FmHA agents pushed white farmers to convert wide fields on the floodplain into giant catfish ponds, many of which would become contract-growing hubs for Delta Pride Catfish, a cooperative that quickly evolved into a local monopoly. The federal government poured millions of dollars into the catfish boom by way of FmHA loans, many of which were seized on by the largest white landowners, and kept those white landowners solvent. Mississippi became the catfish capital of the world in the 1970s. But the FmHA did not reach out to Scott, nor is there evidence that it supported the ambitions of any black farmers who might have wanted to get into catfish.\n\nScott decided to get into catfish anyway, digging eight ponds in fields where rice had grown the season before. He found his own catfish stocks and learned the ins and outs of the industry pretty much on his own. Scott finished digging his ponds in 1981, at which point, according to Rankin, Edwards of the FmHA visited the property and told him point-blank: \"Don't think I'm giving you any damn money for that dirt you're moving.\" The Mississippi FmHA would eventually compel Edwards to provide loans for Scott's catfish operation for 1981 and 1982. But as court records show, the amount approved was far less than what white catfish farmers usually got-white farmers sometimes received double or triple the amount per acre that Scott did-and enough to stock only four of the eight ponds. (Edwards could not be reached for comment on any of the episodes recounted here.)\n\nScott's Fresh Catfish opened in 1983. As a marker outside the old processing shed now indicates, it was the first catfish plant in the country owned by an African American. But discrimination doomed the enterprise before it really began. Without enough capital, Scott was never able to raise fish at the volume he needed. He claimed in court and later to Rankin that he had also been denied a chance to purchase stock in Delta Pride-a requirement to become a contract grower-because he was black. Without access to a cooperative, he had to do the processing and packaging himself, adding to the cost of his product. In 2006, Delta Pride and Country Select Catfish were combined into a new business entity, Consolidated Catfish Producers. When reached for comment, a spokesperson for Consolidated Catfish said that no employee at the new company could \"definitively answer\" questions about Scott or alleged discrimination against him.\n\nScott was in his 60s by the time his plant got off the ground. The effort took a toll. He slowly went blind. Arthritis claimed his joints. His heart began to fail. The plant limped quietly through the '80s and then shut down. Lenders began the process of foreclosing on some of Scott's cropland as early as 1983. In 1995, the FmHA approved a request from Scott to lease most of his remaining acres. The USDA itself had claimed most of his land by the late 1980s.\n\nThe downfall of the Scott catfish enterprise was proof of the strength and endurance of what the federal government would later state could be seen as a federally funded \"conspiracy to force minority and disadvantaged farmers off their land through discriminatory loan practices.\" The Scotts were not small-timers. They had the kind of work ethic and country savvy that are usually respected around the Delta. When the powers that be finally prevailed over Ed Scott Jr., they had completed something decisive, something that even today feels as if it cannot be undone.\n\nBut land is never really lost, not in America. Twelve million acres of farmland in a country that has become a global breadbasket carries immense value, and the dispossessed land in the Delta is some of the most productive in America. The soil on the alluvial plain is rich. The region is warm and wet. Much of the land is perfect for industrialized agriculture.\n\nSome white landowners, like Norman Weathersby, themselves the beneficiaries of government-funded dispossession, left land to their children. Some sold off to their peers, and others saw their land gobbled up by even larger white-owned farms. Nowadays, as fewer and fewer of the children of aging white landowners want to continue farming, more land has wound up in the hands of trusts and investors. Over the past 20 years, the real power brokers in the Delta are less likely to be good ol' boys and more likely to be suited venture capitalists, hedge-fund managers, and agribusiness consultants who run farms with the cold precision of giant circuit boards.\n\nOne new addition to the mix is pension funds. Previously, farmland had never been a choice asset class for large-scale investing. In 1981, what was then called the General Accounting Office (now the Government Accountability Office) released a report exploring a proposal by a firm seeking pension-investment opportunities in farmland. The report essentially laughed off the prospect. The authors found that only about one dollar of every $4,429 in retirement funds was invested in farmland.\n\nBut commodity prices increased, and land values rose. In 2008, a weakened dollar forced major funds to broaden their search for hedges against inflation. \"The market in agricultural land in the U.S. is currently experiencing a boom,\" an industry analyst, Tom Vulcan, wrote that year. He took note of the recent entry of TIAA-CREF, which had \"spent some $340 million on farmland across seven states.\" TIAA, as the company is now called, would soon become the biggest pension-fund player in the agricultural real-estate game across the globe. In 2010, TIAA bought a controlling interest in Westchester Group, a major agricultural-asset manager. In 2014, it bought Nuveen, another large asset-management firm. In 2015, with Nuveen directing its overall investment strategy and Westchester and other smaller subsidiaries operating as purchasers and managers, TIAA raised $3 billion for a new global farmland-investment partnership. By the close of 2016, Nuveen's management portfolio included nearly 2 million acres of farmland, worth close to $6 billion.\n\nInvestment in farmland has proved troublesome for TIAA in Mississippi and elsewhere. TIAA is a pension company originally set up for teachers and professors and people in the nonprofit world. It has cultivated a reputation for social responsibility: promoting environmental sustainability and respecting land rights, labor rights, and resource rights. TIAA has endorsed the United Nations-affiliated Principles for Responsible Investment, which include special provisions for investment in farmland, including specific guidelines with regard to sustainability, leasing practices, and establishing the provenance of tracts of land.\n\nThe company has faced pushback for its move into agriculture. In 2015, the international nonprofit Grain , which advocates for local control of farmland by small farmers, released the results of an investigation accusing TIAA's farmland-investment arm of skirting laws limiting foreign land acquisition in its purchase of more than half a million acres in Brazil. The report found that TIAA had violated multiple UN guidelines in creating a joint venture with a Brazilian firm to invest in farmland without transparency. The Grain report alleges that when Brazil tightened laws designed to restrict foreign investment, TIAA purchased 49 percent of a Brazilian company that then acted as its proxy. According to The New York Times , TIAA and its subsidiaries also appear to have acquired land titles from Euclides de Carli, a businessman often described in Brazil as a big-time grileiro -a member of a class of landlords and land grabbers who use a mix of legitimate means, fraud, and violence to force small farmers off their land. In response to criticism of TIAA's Brazil portfolio, Jose Minaya, then the head of private-markets asset management at TIAA, told WNYC's The Takeaway : \"We believe and know that we are in compliance with the law, and we are transparent about what we do in Brazil. From a title perspective, our standards are very focused around not displacing individuals or indigenous people, respecting land rights as well as human rights ... In every property that we have acquired, we don't just do due diligence on that property. We do due diligence on the sellers, whether it's an individual or whether it's an entity.\"\n\nTIAA's land dealings have faced scrutiny in the United States as well. In 2012, the National Family Farm Coalition found that the entry into agriculture of deep-pocketed institutional investors-TIAA being an example-had made it pretty much impossible for smaller farmers to compete. Institutional investment has removed millions of acres from farmers' hands, more or less permanently. \"Pension funds not only have the power to outbid smaller, local farmers, they also have the long-term goal of retaining farmland for generations,\" the report noted.\n\nAsked about TIAA's record, a spokesperson for Nuveen maintained that the company has built its Delta portfolio following ethical-investment guidelines : \"We have a long history of investing responsibly in farmland, in keeping with our corporate values and the UN-backed Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI). As a long-term owner, we bring capital, professional expertise, and sustainable farming practices to each farm we own, and we are always looking to partner with expansion-minded tenants who will embrace that approach and act as good stewards of the land.\" The company did not comment on the history of any individual tract in its Delta portfolio.\n\nBut even assuming that every acre under management by big corporate interests in the Delta has been acquired by way of ethical-investment principles, the nature of the mid-century dispossession and its multiple layers of legitimation raise the question of whether responsible investment in farmland there is even possible. As a people and a class, black farmers were plainly targets, but the deed histories of tax sales and foreclosures don't reveal whether individual debtors were moved off the land because of discrimination and its legal tools.\n\nIn addition, land records are spotty in rural areas, especially records from the 1950s and '60s, and in some cases it's unclear exactly which records the investors used to meet internal requirements. According to Tristan Quinn-Thibodeau, a campaigner and organizer at ActionAid, an anti-poverty and food-justice nonprofit, \"It's been a struggle to get this information.\" The organization has tried to follow the trails of deeds and has asked TIAA-which manages ActionAid's own pension plan-for an analysis of the provenance of its Delta portfolio. Such an analysis has not been provided.\n\nWhat we do know is that, whatever the specific lineage of each acre, Wall Street investors have found a lucrative new asset class whose origins lie in part in mass dispossession. We know that the vast majority of black farmland in the country is no longer in black hands, and that black farmers have suffered far more hardships than white farmers have. The historian Debra A. Reid points out that \"between 1920 and 1997, the number of African Americans who farmed decreased by 98 percent, while white Americans who farmed declined by 66 percent.\" Referring to the cases studied in their 2001 investigation, Dolores Barclay and Todd Lewan of the Associated Press observed that virtually all of the property lost by black farmers \"is owned by whites or corporations.\" The foundation of these portfolios was a system of plantations whose owners created the agrigovernment system and absorbed thousands of small black-owned farms into ever larger white-owned farms. America has its own grileiros , and they stand on land that was once someone else's.\n\nAs we drove through the patchwork remnants of the Scotts' land, Willena Scott-White took me to the site of Scott's Fresh Catfish. Gleaming steel silos had turned into rusting hulks. The ponds were thick with weeds and debris. The exterior walls of the plant itself had collapsed. Rusted beams lay atop ruined machinery. Fire ants and kudzu had begun nature's reclamation.\n\nLate in Ed Scott Jr.'s life, as he slipped into Alzheimer's, Willena and his lawyer, Phil Fraas, fought to keep his original hopes alive. In the Pigford v. Glickman lawsuit of 1997, thousands of black farmers and their families won settlements against the USDA for discrimination that had occurred between 1981 and the end of 1996; the outlays ultimately reached a total of $2 billion. The Scotts were one of those families, and after a long battle to prove their case-with the assistance of Scott-White's meticulous notes and family history-in 2012 the family was awarded more than $6 million in economic damages, plus almost $400,000 in other damages and debt forgiveness. The court also helped the Scotts reclaim land possessed by the department. In a 1999 ruling, Judge Paul L. Friedman of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia acknowledged that forcing the federal government to compensate black farmers would \"not undo all that has been done\" in centuries of government-sponsored racism. But for the Scotts, it was a start.\n\n\"The telling factor, looking at it from the long view, is that at the time of World War I there were 1 million black farmers, and in 1992 there were 18,000,\" Fraas told me. The settlements stemming from Pigford cover only specific recent claims of discrimination, and none stretching back to the period of the civil-rights era, when the great bulk of black-owned farms disappeared. Most people have not pushed for any kind of deeper excavation.\n\nAny such excavation would quickly make plain the consequences of what occurred. During my drive with Scott-White, we traveled through parts of Leflore, Sunflower, and Washington Counties, three of the counties singled out by Opportunity Insights, a Harvard University research group, as among the worst in the country in terms of a child's prospects for upward mobility. Ten counties in the Delta are among the poorest 50 in America. According to new data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention on all 74,000 U.S. census tracts, four tracts in the Delta are among the lowest 100 when it comes to average life expectancy. More than 30 tracts in the Delta have an average life expectancy below 70. (The national average is 79.) In some Delta counties, the infant mortality rate is more than double the nationwide rate. As if to add gratuitous insult to injury, a new analysis from ProPublica finds that, as a result of the Internal Revenue Service's intense scrutiny of low-income taxpayers, the Delta is audited by the IRS more heavily than any other place in the country . In sum, the areas of deepest poverty and under the darkest shadow of death are the ones where dispossession was the most far-reaching.\n\nThe consequences of dispossession had long been predicted. Fannie Lou Hamer, a Sunflower County activist whose 1964 speech to a Democratic National Convention committee galvanized support for the Voting Rights Act, spoke often of the need for land reform as a precondition for true freedom. Hamer's utopian Freedom Farm experiment stressed cooperative landownership, and she said the concentration of land in the hands of a few landowners was \"at the base of our struggle for survival.\" In her analysis, mass dispossession should be seen as mass extraction. Even as the U.S. government invested billions in white farmers, it continued to extract wealth from black farmers in the Delta. Each black farmer who left the region, from Reconstruction onward, represented a tiny withdrawal from one side of a cosmic balance sheet and a deposit on the other side. This dynamic would only continue, in other ways and other places, as the Great Migration brought black families to northern cities.\n\nThis cosmic balance sheet underpins the national conversation-ever more robust-about reparations for black Americans. In that conversation, given momentum in part by the publication of Ta-Nehisi Coates's \"The Case for Reparations\" in this magazine in 2014, I hear echoes of Mississippi. I hear echoes of Hamer, the Scotts, Henry Woodard Sr., and others who petitioned the federal government to hold itself accountable for a history of extraction that has extended well beyond enslavement. But that conversation too easily becomes technical. How do we quantify discrimination? How do we define who was discriminated against? How do we repay those people according to what has been defined and quantified? The idea of reparations sometimes seems like a problem of economic rightsizing-something for the quants and wonks to work out.\n\nEconomics is, of course, a major consideration. According to the researchers Francis and Hamilton, \"The dispossession of black agricultural land resulted in the loss of hundreds of billions of dollars of black wealth. We must emphasize this estimate is conservative ... Depending on multiplier effects, rates of returns, and other factors, it could reach into the trillions.\" The large wealth gap between white and black families today exists in part because of this historic loss.\n\nBut money does not define every dimension of land theft. Were it not for dispossession, Mississippi today might well be a majority-black state, with a radically different political destiny. Imagine the difference in our national politics if the center of gravity of black electoral strength had remained in the South after the Voting Rights Act was passed.\n\nPolitics aside, how can reparations truly address the lives ruined, the family histories lost, the connection to the land severed? In America, land has always had a significance that exceeds its economic value. For a people who were once chattel themselves, real property has carried an almost mystical import. There's a reason the fabled promise that spread among freedmen after the Civil War was not a check, a job, or a refundable tax credit, but 40 acres of farmland to call home. The history of the Delta suggests that any conversation about reparations might need to be more qualitative and intangible than it is. And it must consider the land.\n\nLand hunger is ineffable, an indescribable yearning, and yet it is something that Americans, perhaps uniquely, feel and understand. That yearning tugged at me hardest as Willena Scott-White rounded out her tour of the fields, the afternoon slipping away. Out among the Scotts' fields is a clearing with a lone, tall tree. In the clearing is a small cemetery. A handful of crooked, weathered tombstones stand sentinel. This is where Ed Scott Jr. is buried, and where some of Willena's older siblings now rest. Willena posed for a picture beside her parents' grave. She told me that this is where her own bones will rest after her work on Earth is done.\n\n\"This is our land,\" she said.\n\nThis article appears in the September 2019 print edition with the headline \"This Land Was Our Land.\"\n\n* This article has been updated to reflect that the historian John C. Willis documented the biographies of Bohlen Lucas and Lewis Spearman in his book Forgotten Time."

Soviet missile bases discovered in Cuba triggered a crisis that brought the U.S. to the brink of war with the U.S.S.R. Civil rights activists won hard-earned victories against segregationists in the American South, and John Glenn became the first American to orbit the Earth. Algeria gained independence from France and the U.S. slowly escalated its involvement in Vietnam.

      "text": "Remembering Jack Greenberg\n\nThe last surviving lawyer who argued Brown v. Board of Education at the U.S. Supreme Court died Wednesday at 91.\n\nJack Greenberg, an influential civil-rights advocate and the last surviving lawyer who argued Brown v. Board of Education before the U.S. Supreme Court, died on Wednesday. He was 91.\n\nFrom 1961 to 1984, Greenberg led the NAACP's Legal Defense and Education Fund, more commonly known as the LDF, as it fought in the courts to dismantle Jim Crow's legal architecture during the Second Reconstruction. His predecessor, the legendary Thurgood Marshall, chose Greenberg as his successor after becoming a federal judge.\n\nUnder Greenberg's tenure, the LDF became one of the most powerful legal organizations in America. Among its Supreme Court victories were landmark rulings on employment discrimination, school desegregation, anti-miscegenation laws, and voting rights. Greenberg also played a leading role in the first legal campaign against American capital punishment, culminating in its brief abolition in 1972.\n\n\"Few understand how powerfully Jack Greenberg shaped the practice of civil rights law and the breadth of his contributions to our modern conception of equal opportunity and justice,\" said Sherrilyn Ifill, the LDF's current director-counsel, in a statement Wednesday.\n\nJames Jacob Greenberg was born on December 22, 1924, in New York City. His father Max was a public accountant; his mother Bertha was a homemaker. Born to a family of Jewish immigrants, Greenberg saw parallels between anti-Semitism's horrors and pervasive racial oppression against black Americans in the mid-20th century.\n\nGreenberg attended Columbia College and graduated in 1945, then briefly served as a Navy officer in the Pacific theater of World War II. Had the United States not dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, he would have taken part in Operation Downfall, the planned Allied invasion of the Japanese home islands. Instead he returned to New York and received a law degree from Columbia Law School.\n\nIn 1949, the 25-year-old Greenberg joined the LDF's cadre of young lawyers working alongside Thurgood Marshall to defeat American racial segregation in the courts. During that time Greenberg participated in some of the most pivotal Supreme Court decisions of the 20th century, even serving as one of Marshall's co-counsels in Brown v. Board of Education . He was the only white lawyer on the team.\n\nWhen President John F. Kennedy offered Marshall a seat on Second Circuit Court of Appeals in 1961, Marshall selected Greenberg to be the organization's second director-counsel. Choosing a white man stirred controversy among some of LDF's black lawyers but did not bother the civil-rights legend.\n\n\"As to those who are fighting discrimination, we cannot afford to practice it,\" Marshall told The New York Times .\n\nUnder Greenberg's leadership, the organization continued to play a central role in the civil-rights movement. LDF lawyers defended Martin Luther King, Jr. while he was jailed in Birmingham in 1963 and brought the lawsuit that allowed for the Selma-to-Mongomery marches in 1965. At the Supreme Court, Greenberg personally argued for James Meredith's integration into the University of Mississippi. In 1969, he represented the plaintiffs in Alexander v. Holmes County Board of Education , in which the justices ordered Southern schools to desegregate immediately.\n\nVirtually all of the LDF's work focused on protecting the legal rights of African Americans, both individually and as a community. But an exception of sorts was American capital punishment, against which Greenberg's LDF was the foremost opponent during the 1960s and 1970s. The campaign began in 1963 when Justice Arthur Goldberg wrote an unusual dissent that signaled a possible constitutional challenge to the death penalty. The other justices pressured him to strip out references to racism in an early draft, but Goldberg told his law clerk Alan Dershowitz to distribute their research on disparities himself. Among the organizations Dershowitz contacted was Greenberg's LDF.\n\nTrue to their origins, the LDF's early death-penalty work focused on capital punishment's virulent racial disparities, especially in cases of rape. But the organization soon shifted to a broader siege on its constitutionality and represented white defendants as part of that effort. Racism nonetheless remained a focus for Greenberg as the number of executions plummeted in the late 1960s.\n\n\"Were capital punishment to resume in this country,\" he testified before Congress in 1972, \"the result must fairly be seen as an expression of racial genocide.\"\n\nA few months later in Furman v. Georgia , one of five cases brought by the LDF, the Supreme Court struck down death-penalty statutes nationwide. Greenberg had drawn upon the racial-disparity statistics during oral arguments and urged the Court to abolish capital punishment for all crimes. But it did not. The de facto moratorium lasted four years before a more conservative Court upheld new capital statutes in Gregg v. Georgia .\n\nGreenberg stepped down as the LDF's director-counsel in 1984 and returned to Columbia Law School, first as a professor and later as dean. The organization, which helped bring down Jim Crow laws with only a handful of attorneys, had grown to nearly two dozen lawyers .\n\n\"Now, when there's a very considerable effort to roll things back, we're in a position to resist, to hold on to almost all our gains until the country starts going in the other direction,\" Mr. Greenberg told the Times that year. \"They can throw us back a few hundred yards, but we're dug in too deep.\""

      "text": "Must We Hate?\n\n\"What the mob at Oxford hated was the intolerable idea that this different human being should claim a manhood equal to their own.\"\n\nM ost things, public things , happen and go by and you forget about them, but not the Mississippi riots. Not for me, anyway, and I don't suppose I'm alone. There must be other Americans who find those faces in their minds as I do-flickering, twisted faces on last September's television screens and still there, still staring. You wonder why.\n\nNot, I'm pretty sure, for the usual reason, the reason we've decided to give ourselves: not because we were shocked by the open defiance of the law. Southern segregationists, including Southern segregationist lawyers, including Southern segregationist lawyers who have actually read law, have been shouting defiance of the law for years, declaring that the Congress is the sole lawmaking body under the Constitution, that when the Congress means by its laws is for every citizen to decide for himself according to his locality and his inclination, and that the interpretations of the laws by the federal courts in general, and by the Supreme Court in particular, are irrelevant, impertinent, and immaterial, Marbury v. Madison and its innumerable successors to the contrary notwithstanding.\n\nI am not suggesting that anyone outside the foggier bayous of Alabama or Louisiana or South Carolina or Mississippi has taken these contentions seriously. I am merely noting that we had heard them before the Oxford riots as we had heard, too, that the doctrine of nullification is till sound doctrine, that John C. Calhoun is the father and fountain of pure constitutional thought, and that the Civil War has been repealed. What was said in Jackson, in other words, and shouted at Oxford was not new and could scarcely have astonished us. Most of it, indeed, went back a hundred years or more. An anonymous professor at the University of Mississippi told the New York Times that \"sources of information on the thinking of the rest of the nation were shut off\" in 1830, at which time \"the state's leaders ceased to react to public issues in terms of established fact but were governed instead by the orthodox view,\" and, in brief, \"stopped thinking.\"\n\nThe date may surprise us. It is difficult-or is it?-to think of Faulkner, who spent his life in Mississippi, writing out of a deepfreeze a century old. But the argument itself sounds plausible. A state in which a decision of the highest American court can seriously be called a \"Communist conspiracy\" must necessarily be a state which has been out of touch with history for a rather long time. And a local mentality which can actually read, to say nothing of write, pronouncements like those which appeared in the Clarion Leader and Jackson Daily News at the time of the riots is obviously a mentality which only the Boston fudge manufacturer who invented the John Birch Society could regard as in any sense contemporaneous.\n\nThe same thing may be said of the violence which pronouncements such as these excited. That, too, should have been foreseen. Elsewhere in the Republic one might be surprised to find a governor who approved the lawlessness he was sworn to suppress, but not in Mississippi, where there were two kinds of law. And elsewhere one might be shocked by state police officers who deserted federal officials in a situation of obvious and increasing danger, but not in Mississippi, where federal officials and state policemen are on opposite sides. Once an entire state has seceded from history-which is, in a sense, to secede from reason-almost anything can happen. Even Ross Barnett. Even the sudden and inexplicable timidity of Ross Barnett's state police.\n\nBut if the governor of Mississippi was foreseeable in the light of his history or lack of it, and if the defiance was familiar, what was it that astonished us in Oxford? Why were we shocked into silence by that Sunday's news? Why did we spend the days and nights that followed fiddling with our television sets, watching the faces of little crowds of students on the university campus, following the slight, grave figure of the man who was the center of it all as he moved in and out of doors and corridors with federal marshals at his side and jeers and spitting catcalls in his ears? Why is it that those scenes come back and back and the heart sinks and a heavy apprehension which was not there before-was never, as long as I can remember, there before?\n\nI think, for myself, what shocked me, sickened me was the black pit of public hatred into which I looked. I had known, of course, that racial hatred existed in this country as it exists elsewhere. I could hardly have helped but know it after the events of my own lifetime. But, whether because of the kind of life I have lived or because of some failure of my own understanding, I had always thought of this hatred as something exceptional, something transient, something which would disappear with the illiteracy and poverty and ignorance out of which it came.\n\nI knew, of course, that there were presumably educated and visibly well-to-do men and women in the South and elsewhere who looked down on Negroes, because I had met such men and women. I knew there were college graduates with enough intelligence to write books who believed, or said they believed, that all Negroes are biologically inferior to all whites. I realized there were people who called themselves Christians who knew that God intended the black man to be a hewer of wood and a drawer of water to the white man, any white man of any qualifications or none-particularly none. But I also believed these people to be what they so obviously were-waifs and strays from the great process of history who needed to find somebody or other to look down on in order to look up to themselves. And I never doubted that in an actual test between these petulant opinions on the one side and the Republic on the other the opinions would wither away in shame and disappear. But what happened in Oxford was that they did not wither away. They stared back at you out of young men's faces ugly with spite. They spat back at you out of the faces of middle-aged men whose words would have been incredible if you had not heard them. And it was the Republic which gave ground. In spite of the decisiveness of the President and the courage of the marshals, it was the Republic which gave ground.\n\nFor the real confrontation in Mississippi was not a confrontation between federal marshals and a mob. It was not a confrontation between the President of the United states and the local governor. It was not even a confrontation between the Constitution and the doctrine of nullification. It was a confrontation between the Republic itself, the great idea on which the Republic is founded, and the one idea which may, someday, destroy it.\n\n\"All politics,\" as Valéry once said, \"presupposes an idea of man.\" But only the United States, among the nations of history, was brought into being by an explicit and reasoned idea of man to stand. It is not the second of July, 1776, when the thirteen colonies declared themselves absolved all allegiance to the British crown, which we celebrate as our national anniversary. It is the fourth day of July. And it is the fourth day of July because America, as the delegates to the Continental Congress well understood, did not begin with the repudiation of British rule. It began with the assertion of the American idea. And it was on the fourth that the American idea was spelled out. At the beginning of the Revolution and down through the first bloodshed at Lexington and Concord there had been no talk of independence and no desire for it. What the Colonists was British liberty in America. Only when the Tory ministers made it clear that there would be no British liberty in America, that liberty, if the Colonists were to have it, must be American liberty, did independence became a national objective, and even then independence was a means rather than an end. Liberty was still the prime concern, and until American liberty was defined-a new liberty for a new people in a new world-America had not begun.\n\nIt was for no sentimental or idealistic reason, in other words, that the old fathers celebrated the American festival not on the anniversary of American independence but on the anniversary of the declaration of the American idea. For the American idea, quite literally and realistically, is America. If we had not held these truths to be self-evident, if we had not believed that all men are created equal, if we had not believed that they are endowed, all of them, with certain unalienable rights, we would never have become America, whatever else we might have become.\n\nBut if this is what America is, then it is less difficult perhaps to understand why Oxford shocked us, for what looked out of those flickering faces was the antithesis of America-the passionate repudiation of the American proposition, and thus the implicit rejection of America itself. What we saw in those faces, heard in those words, was not hatred of James Meredith. Not a single member of the mob could have told you what he looked like. He was a Negro, and that was enough. But to hate a man because he is a Negro is to hate an abstraction. And to hate an abstraction is to hate an idea. And to hate the particular idea the mob at Oxford hated is to deny America. For the idea those young men and those old men hated was precisely and literally the idea on which this Republic was founded, the idea that any man may claim his equal manhood in this country, his unalienable right. What the mob at Oxford hated was the intolerable idea that this different human being should claim a manhood equal to their own.\n\nInsurrection, a congressman called the Oxford riots. And insurrection they were in the strict legal sense of that term-a revolt against lawful authority. But to those who still love this republic they were far worse than insurrection; they were subversion. And not subversion in the current witch-hunting sense, which sniffs with terror at every dissenting view, but subversion in the honest meaning of that word-subversion of the country itself. For America cannot survive if the American idea is repudiated. Nations are not made by territory, or the greatness of nations by extent of land. Nations are made by commitments of mind and loyalties of heart, and the nobler the commitment of the mind, the higher the loyalty of the heart, the greater the nation. If the American proposition is no longer the proposition to which the American heart and mind were committed at our beginning, then America is finished, and the only question left is when America will fall.\n\nNot soon, you will say. We survived for the first three generations of our history with slaves and masters, and thereafter we survived for a century with segregation and lynchings and all the rest of it, and as for the American idea, it is not our treatment of Negroes alone which has menaced it. Millions of Americans whose forebears came to the United States in the last century and the beginning of this came from countries where the American idea was strange and outlandish and where even the basic conception of self-government was unknown, with the result that there are pockets of opinion in the country even now in which the right of a citizen to exercise his American privilege-to make up his own mind for himself and say what he thinks-is deprecated; where censorship flourishes. All this, of course, is true. The American idea has had to struggle for survival for close to two hundred years, and not always against lynch mobs and White Citizens Committees.\n\nBut there is a great difference, notwithstanding, between ignorance of the American idea or misconception of it or even indifference to it on the one side, and denial, denunciation of it on the other. The woman who tries to expurgate her local library of books she does not like and to tell her fellow citizens what they may believe or learn regards herself as a good American-usually as a better American than anyone else. But the man who attempts to deprive other men of the equality of manhood to which the American idea entitles them has no illusions about himself or his relation to the American proposition. Hatred comes first with him, and everything else comes after-including his country's laws, his country's order, and his country itself.\n\nNo, it was not the openness of the defiance of the law that shocked me. It was the openness of the hatred, the open recklessness as to the effect of the hatred on anything or everything-United States marshals. United States troops, and the fundamental moral and human belief in which and by which the United States exists. Like a tragedy in which the clown prepares the scene, the great American drama of belief in man moved toward collision with the contempt for man which is its opposite. And before the night was over the people of the United States and of the world-but most immediately the people of the United States-had learned that a considerable body of Americans reject, violently reject, the American idea.\n\nIt was a sobering realization and one that should continue to be sobering for a long time to come. Before the Oxford riots we had been aware that our actions as a people did not always chime with our words. Our words described us as an open society, a free world, a bulwark of liberty. Our actions sometimes confessed that there were many Americans to whom our society was not open, many Americans to whom our world was not altogether free, many Americans whose liberty had fences around it. But our distress in these contradictions was more embarrassment than anything else. They lost us propaganda battles, and occasionally they made us feel like fools, but we were sure of ourselves notwithstanding-sure of our own integrity and sure, above all, that our hypocrisy was nothing compared with the hypocrisy of the Russians and the Chinese, to whom peace means war, conquest is called liberation, and democracy is the state police. Oxford changed all that. Oxford was not a mere propaganda victory for our enemies. Oxford was a defeat for ourselves.\n\nT he question which haunts us now is how it came about. Was it an aberration, a local flaw in the fabric of the Republic, a defect in the Mississippians attributable to their peculiarly parochial history? Or was it a larger fault, a graver fault, in some sense the fault of all of us? This is a question every man must answer for himself, but nevertheless must answer. To me, it seems the fault of all of us, for all of us seem to me guilty, in one degree or another, of the neglect out of which it came. I mean our neglect as a nation, as a people, of our own purpose, our own concern, in our obsession with the purpose, the concerns, of other nations, other peoples. For fifteen years, almost twenty, we have allowed the purposes, the plans, the maneuvers of the Communist countries to dominate our attention to such a point that we have all but forgotten what we mean for ourselves, what we propose for ourselves, what we intend. Where once the test of loyalty in an American was his love for his own cause, the test has now become what we call his \"anti-Communism\"-meaning his hatred of the Russian cause, that iron religion which the Russians would like to impose on the world.\n\nThat we should detest Communism is natural and inevitable. But that we should make the detestation of Communism the test of our own loyalty to our own intentions is neither natural nor inevitable nor even intelligent. A nation which define itself in terms of what it is not inevitably begins to forget what it is. And a nation which forgets what it is is a dying nation. What \"anti-Communism,\" as the great American slogan, produces is not the triumph of America. What it produces is organizations like the John Birch Society and people like the California fanatics who were recently intent on rewriting the California constitution in the image of the late Senator McCarthy.\n\nWhat it produces is the Oxford mob. For Oxford would have been impossible if the students in that mob who shouted \"Communist\" at the United States marshals had been brought up in a generation which believed not in anti-Communism but in America; a generation which understood that the American idea is not a rhetorical proposition but a realizable cause, the greatest and most powerful of all political cause, a cause which has no need to express itself in hatred for something else but only in affirmation of itself.\n\nThere is a moment and there are words in our history which prove that statement. The moment was the darkest our people have ever known, the great division which brought about civil war. The words are words spoken by Mr. Lincoln at Independence Hall in Philadelphia as he traveled to Washington for his inauguration as President of a divided land. It was at Independence Hall that the Union which was now about to fall had been created. But how, he asked, had it been created? What was it that had made the Union? What had held those different states so long together? Mr. Lincoln had often inquired of himself, he said, what \"great principle or idea it was.\" And here in Philadelphia he thought he found the answer. \"It was not the mere matter of the separation of the colonies from the motherland; but something in the Declaration giving liberty, not alone to the people of this country but hope to the world for all future time. It was that which gave promise that in due time the weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all men should have an equal chance.\"\n\nWhat had created the Republic, in other words, was an idea, a principle. And it was that idea, that principle which alone could save it now. Many of those who listened to him then, like many of those who hear his words today, may well have thought that an idea, a principle was a poor defense in the dreadful struggle which lay ahead. But Lincoln, having found his answer, never doubted it. Two years later, when the war was all but lost, when by defeat after defeat and Great Britain was on the point of recognizing the South, he put his faith to the test of action. He emancipated the slaves, political and constitutional cause to the cause affirmed in the Declaration of Independence, ended once and for all the danger of British recognition of the slaveholding South, and saved the Union.\n\nWhat we might perhaps he asking ourselves as we look back on Oxford, Mississippi, today and out over the Gulf toward Cuba and on toward the infinite dangers and difficulties which lie ahead is whether we have been wise to put our trust not in our love but in our fear, whether we should not listen even now to the man who knew this country better than any other ever has and find our future and our safety where he found it."

      "text": "The Day the Civil-Rights Movement Changed\n\nWhat my father saw in Mississippi\n\nThere's a video of James Baldwin interviewing a stranger with my daddy's face. The VHS tape of this interview has been in my family for 40 years. The cassette bears a label that reads, \"James Baldwin Interviews Civil Rights Workers (1981).\" Baldwin himself gave the tape to my dad, who doesn't recall ever watching it. It stayed at my mother's house after my parents' divorce, collecting dust until I started researching my father's life a few years ago.\n\nCheck out more from this issue and find your next story to read.\n\nThe man whose face appears on the screen is my father, but not the one who figures in my memories from childhood. The man in the video is scowling, his hands pressed against his temples, the skin around his jaw drooping. I'd thought that the Dave Dennis Sr. I'd seen behind podiums with his finger to the sky, the civil-rights veteran who galvanized crowds, was the man who'd emerged from the movement. The Baldwin tape tells a different history. In this grainy video, the stranger dad is lost in his own fury. All that's left is a hardness. A calloused, impenetrable husk. His nostrils flare and he looks like he wants to set the world on fire. I'd seen him angry before. But never like that.\n\nIn the video, he talks about the 1964 Freedom Summer, when he and thousands of other activists campaigned for voter registration in Mississippi, facing unchecked violence from white protesters and police. He talks about the murders of his friends and the way the search for their remains also uncovered the mutilated, decapitated, desecrated bodies of long-forgotten and nameless Black Mississippians.\n\nMy father had told me these stories, but watching the video, I realized that I hadn't fully appreciated how they had affected him. I asked my father to tell them again, so I could better understand the man on the tape and so I could pass those stories on to my own children. Though his recollections were vivid, memory is always imperfect, so I talked with his friends in the movement and pored over historical documents and newspaper clippings as well, trying to fill in the gaps as best I could. But these are my father's stories, and I found that the only way I could tell them was in his voice. The dialogue you'll read in this essay all comes from my father's recollections. As he recounted events like the murder of his friend Medgar Evers, I saw flashes of that stranger on the tape.\n\nT he first time I met Medgar Evers, he was standing in his office at the Masonic Temple in West Jackson. \"Looks like my desk is the first tour stop for outsiders, huh? Someone must have told you that I like it when you all come to Mississippi looking for trouble.\" It was spring 1962. I was part of a flood of out-of-towners trying to do what we could to help the Mississippians who were already putting their lives on the line . An activist named Tom Gaither had given me the names of people I needed to get to know if I was going to survive in Mississippi, and Medgar was at the top of the list.\n\nMedgar was the son of a sawmill worker and a laundress from Decatur, Mississippi. He'd served in World War II, fighting in France and Germany before heading back home. Then, in 1954, he became the NAACP's field secretary, traveling throughout Mississippi to visit churches and preach the sermon of voter registration. He also spent his time investigating killings and searching for missing Black folks, doing what he could for every family who lost someone.\n\nFrom the May 2022 issue: Who will remember the Mississippi murders?\n\nBeing caught with an NAACP membership card could mean danger for a Black person in Mississippi. I knew a member who hid his card in a tin can in his backyard. \"Here's what you need to know about Medgar,\" Tom had told me. \"He keeps his membership card in his damn pocket.\"\n\n\"Where you from, kid?\" Medgar's warmth and confidence were evident from behind his desk, even though he was trying to give me a hard time. \"Actually, you don't have to answer that. I've known about you since the Freedom Rides\"-when a few dozen of us had been arrested in Jackson in 1961 for protesting segregated bus stations. I'd come from Louisiana to Mississippi as a field secretary for the Congress of Racial Equality, known as CORE, and I was enamored of the way the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, or SNCC, had taken on the mission of voter registration. \"I knew y'all were coming back,\" Medgar said. \"You never really leave Mississippi.\"\n\nI told him I'd returned because I wanted to do what I could to get as many Black voters as possible. Medgar paused. \"What if I told you that you outsiders are going to just show up here and get people killed?\" he said. \"What if I told you that you and those SNCC kids running around were reckless?\" Maybe, he said, the sharecroppers and seamstresses were doing what they could on their own time, and doing it safely. \"What if I told you we didn't really need you here?\"\n\nI started talking before I had formed an answer. I said that if the people I met in Mississippi told me they didn't need me, I'd knock on Medgar's door again and ask him to drive me to the bus station so I could head back to Louisiana.\n\nMedgar got up from his desk and slowly walked over to me, his navy-blue suit fitting immaculately. He extended his hand and smiled this big smile that felt like a hug. \"Well then, all I can say is welcome to the real Mississippi. You got time for Smackover's?\"\n\nSmackover's was the place Medgar and I would go to for coffee or a plate of soul food and sweet tea. It's where I would get to know the man I'd eventually call my best friend.\n\n\"I admire you kids over there in SNCC and CORE, even though y'all all got screws loose.\" He was 15 years older than me, so he loved calling us kids. \"Sometimes the NAACP won't mix it up on the street level like we need to, and you kids just ... Y'all just get your tails beat like it's nothing.\"\n\nIn Focus: Photos from the civil-rights battles of 1964\n\nI told him I'd never quite learned how to get anything done without taking a beating. But he was the one with the NAACP card. He was just as ready to die as any of us.\n\nThat was where we differed, he said. \"I love us and I want us to be free. But I have a wife and three babies at home. You got kids, Dave?\"\n\nI said I did not. I'd never even considered such a possibility.\n\n\"Didn't think so.\" He said that the movement would go on without him if it had to. But his children needed him. He insisted that I'd be less willing to fall in front of bullets if I had to kiss a family goodbye every day. \"And I got two guns in that trunk that say that even if I invite danger,\" he told me, \"danger coming to me is getting a hell of a welcome gift.\"\n\nNikole Hannah-Jones: Did Freedom Summer 1964 really change Mississippi?\n\nMedgar drove me around Mississippi, introducing me to every person he thought I needed to know. He could talk business with Black lawyers and doctors and chat with farmers about how the crops were growing, from Indianola to Hattiesburg. All the while, he taught me about Mississippi. People embraced me because Medgar told them to. He introduced me to countless locals whose practical knowledge helped keep me safe. I would never have survived without him.\n\nThe bullet that tore through Medgar's flesh on June 12, 1963, changed the movement forever . Returning from an NAACP event after midnight, he was shot in the back as he got out of his car and walked toward his house. The country couldn't deny the truth of what had happened to Medgar. I remember hearing the word assassination used for the first time to describe the killing of a Black activist. Death was always possible, but some deaths we'd had time to prepare for-after a wrong turn down the wrong dark road, or whistling at a white woman. That's what death had looked like for us before. The act of registering Black people to vote and the quest to dismantle the American power structure made us feel a different kind of terror. We were going to change the country, after all, and that meant we were going to face coordinated, organized, directed murder.\n\nIn the 1950s, Mississippi formed a government entity called the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission with the goal of preserving segregation. The commission actively spread disinformation and privately funded white-supremacist groups. The state helped prepare the legal defense for Medgar's assassin. Long before that, the commission had been a daily nemesis in our lives, routinely employing spies to attend our meetings and follow us around. Some of these spies were Black people who had been paid off. All we could do was go about our regular business and hope for the best.\n\nWhatever sense of adventure we were feeling disappeared with Medgar. We weren't just fighting racists and cops. We were fighting the entire government. This is something we had always known, but the way Medgar was killed became a ringing in our ears that kept us from sleeping.\n\nFor me, losing Medgar ripped my soul apart. The last words I said to him-\"Someone's gonna get killed riding around with you\"-still bounce off my walls at night and haunt me when I wake up, sweat trickling down my chest. Why Medgar? Why him and not me?\n\nLife after Medgar's assassination felt like a series of moments between tragedies. And the tragedies started the very next morning, before I could even grieve.\n\nSome local students had already gotten riled up enough to start marching, so I wanted to make sure they could do it as safely as possible. Two hundred or so of us set out from Medgar's office at the Masonic Temple. The march didn't last long. The police had dozens of students locked up at the Mississippi State Fairgrounds. But I barely had time to worry about that, because I was still occupied with another crisis that had been brewing: Mrs. Hamer was in trouble.\n\nThree days earlier, Fannie Lou Hamer, a former sharecropper who had quickly become a guiding force of the Mississippi movement, and nine other activists had been on a bus trip back from a voter-registration training led by the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, or SCLC, in South Carolina. When the bus stopped, the group would periodically sit at an interstate bus station's lunch counter or use its restrooms to test compliance with the federal regulations prohibiting segregation at such places. This upset the white bus driver, who began making phone calls at stops along the way. As the journey continued, Mrs. Hamer led the group in singing freedom songs, maybe in part to needle the driver. When Mrs. Hamer's group got to Winona, Mississippi, they realized that the driver had alerted the police.\n\nFive of the riders-June Johnson, Annell Ponder, Euvester Simpson, Rosemary Freeman, and James West-got out to use the \"whites only\" restrooms and sit down at the segregated lunch counter. The police were ready, and the riders were arrested. Mrs. Hamer saw the arrests from the bus and got out to talk with her friends. The police intercepted her, told her to get in their car, and kicked her. The jailhouse in Winona would become a torture chamber for her and the others who were forced inside .\n\nFirst was June Johnson.\n\nThe sheriff asked her if she was in the NAACP. June could have said no, but she said yes. The officer hit her in the face and stomach, asking her who ran the NAACP; she told him the people did. Then the sheriff, the chief of police, a state trooper, and another cop threw her to the floor and beat her, stomping her and tearing her clothes. They cracked her head with a blackjack, leaving her bloodied. She never gave them the answers they wanted. She was 15 years old.\n\nAnnell Ponder, an SCLC field supervisor, was a Georgia native and graduate of Clark College. The officers put her in the booking room and beat her with blackjacks and a belt, and said they'd keep beating her until she said \"Yes, sir\" when addressing them. She refused to say it.\n\nThe police tossed James West, the lone male in the group, in a cell with a few other incarcerated Black men. The cops then handed those men a blackjack and told them to beat on West. After they finished, the officers gave them shots of corn liquor as a reward for the violence.\n\nThen the cops dragged Mrs. Hamer into the cell with the incarcerated Black men, who reeked of alcohol. The officers made one of the men lash her until his arms gave out. Her booming voice, which had awakened the spirit in so many of us, was now a scream of terror. Then it was another imprisoned man's turn. He hesitated. Mrs. Hamer, her dress pulled up to expose her back and buttocks, blood soaking the sheets below her, looked back and, as she later told me, said to the man, \"Now go on 'head and do what you gotta do, because they gonna do you worse than you do me if you don't.\"\n\nThe man wept as he whipped her. He apologized through tears, but his crying didn't pause his swings.\n\nWhen Mrs. Hamer was finally allowed back into her cell, Euvester Simpson, who was all of 17 at the time, took care of her. In the night, Mrs. Hamer developed a fever and her blood pressure spiked. Simpson, wetting a towel, wiped Mrs. Hamer's forehead, the welts on her back, and her hands, which had turned purple from trying to shield herself.\n\nThey got through the night by singing. One lyric they sang over and over again was: \" Walk with me, Lord / Walk with me, Lord / While I'm on this tedious journey / I want Jesus to walk with me .\"\n\nMrs. Hamer and the others had been arrested the Sunday before Medgar was killed, and a group of us spent the rest of that day trying to find them. Hollis Watkins, a wily SNCC member, called jails in the area and threatened them by claiming, falsely, that the FBI was looking for the missing. Lawrence Guyot, a SNCC field secretary from Pass Christian, Mississippi, figured out that they were in Winona. When he went to the jail demanding answers, he was also arrested. While he was handcuffed, the police pounced. More blackjacks. More swelling and blood. They dragged Guyot to a cell.\n\nI spent hours calling anyone I could, trying to find out what was going on. Eventually, I got word that the SCLC had secured bail money, so an organizer, Andrew Young, and a few other SCLC members drove down from Birmingham, Alabama, to get everyone out of jail. The first thing Mrs. Hamer heard when she left jail was that Medgar was dead.\n\nPolice had brutalized activists in Winona, and Medgar had been assassinated. All in one week in Mississippi. A few days later, when I saw Mrs. Hamer, I felt a rage I hadn't felt before.\n\nShe looked like she was wearing a mask too small for her face. Her cheeks and forehead were swollen beyond recognition, and she could hardly open her eyes. I remember her trying to smile and her face barely moving as she told me about what had happened in that jail. It was the first time I'd heard the gruesome details. \"It's not the physical pain,\" she said through cracked, bloody lips. \"They lifted my skirt, Dave. That's the worst part. They lifted my skirt.\"\n\nI'll never get over her face. For the first time through all of this-bombings, burning crosses-I felt a desire for revenge. I wanted those white men dead. I wanted to walk to Winona and kill them all in their sleep. I wanted to bring their bodies to Mrs. Hamer and Annell and Euvester and tell them I had done this for them.\n\nI returned to Jackson, to a city that felt the way I felt. The Black community loved Medgar, and wanted the same revenge I wanted. But I had to betray my own instincts in order to keep as many people alive as I could. It all came to a head at Medgar's funeral.\n\nI didn't want to go to the ceremony. I didn't want to see the pomp and circumstance. I didn't want to believe he was dead. Instead, I roamed Farish Street, in the center of Jackson's Black business district, where the funeral would be held, and walked by an alley where some young Black men were gathered. Medgar had previously introduced me to this crew. They called themselves the \"Corner Boys\" and had taken on the role of community protectors, always keeping an eye out when white folks drove down Farish Street. They were generally peaceful, but today I noticed the handguns in their pockets and I saw the shotguns they weren't even trying to hide.\n\nI tried to persuade them to put their weapons away-to tell them that, if they started any violence, the police would end it. But they'd heard about our way long enough. Our way got Medgar, whom they all loved, killed. I didn't have any comeback to that.\n\nWe were arguing, but saying the same thing. We just wanted the hurt to go away. I kept walking down Farish Street, peeking through alleyways between the buildings. Men were standing by with guns in their hands, like they were ready to fire bullets at anyone who dared to bother the funeral. I kept walking south toward downtown. Then, around a corner and over the horizon, I saw the horsemen of the apocalypse. Not just four, but dozens. Police officers, state troopers, and sheriff's deputies were dressed for a massacre: Riot gear. Rifles. Shotguns. Some were indeed on horseback. Others held back snarling dogs. They were waiting for the funeral march to come their way. Violent or not, it wouldn't matter. I felt certain they had the green light to kill as many Black people as possible.\n\nI turned around and ran to all the alleyways and corners I could find, trying to talk to the men who were waiting with knives and guns. I kept begging them not to do anything, for their own good. I had to stop them from running into that wall of white rage without telling them what exactly was waiting for them. I didn't want them to take the possible war as a challenge. When I looked back up Farish Street, an agitated mass of Black marchers was heading straight toward the white militia.\n\nThe police arrested the first few marchers. But they weren't going to stop there. Several of the white men waved their batons with abandon. The Black folks weren't having it. They started tossing bottles and swinging any objects they could get their hands on. The police seemed to want blood. The only thing that eventually slowed them down was a single white man with a megaphone.\n\nJohn Doar was a Republican lawyer from Wisconsin who had started at the Justice Department in 1960 under President Dwight Eisenhower and stayed to work under John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson, making it his personal crusade to find justice for Black folks . He put his life on the line to bail the civil-rights leader Bob Moses out of jail in Mississippi whenever Bob got arrested for marches or for trying to register people to vote. Doar told Moses and me to call the Justice Department if we were arrested. When Black people disappeared, Doar's fingernails may as well have been filled with dirt from digging up bodies. He was there to make sure James Meredith got to Ole Miss, in the face of a furious mob protesting the school's first Black student. And it was Doar's presence that halted the white militia's march, most likely because the police knew he was a government official, and they didn't want the FBI on their back.\n\nI'd met Doar in planning meetings, and I would always call him if someone went missing or if I needed help getting somebody out of trouble. Most of the Black protesters on Farish Street, though, had no idea who Doar was. They just saw a white man who looked like an FBI agent. \"Please! Just listen to me! This is an unsafe situation! Please turn around!\" he kept yelling into the megaphone. As I approached Doar, I saw a Black man running toward him, out of his line of vision. He had a brick in his hand, raised above his head. I sprinted and got between them.\n\n\"Dave?\" said the man with the brick. \"The hell you doing?\"\n\n\"He's with the movement, brother. You're making a mistake.\"\n\nNearby, another man put down a shotgun he'd aimed at Doar.\n\n\"Jesus, thank God, Dave,\" Doar said. He handed me his megaphone, and asked me to say something to help stop things from going any further.\n\nI grabbed the megaphone and begged everyone to stop their march. To de-escalate, calm down, and go home, even though I wanted to join them and burn everything to the ground. It's what this damn city deserved. But we had to survive to fight. The crowd quieted.\n\nLosing Medgar ultimately galvanized the movement. In the months that followed his death, we would pull ourselves together and find a resolve we didn't know we had. A year after he was killed, we would launch the Freedom Summer, when thousands of activists campaigned for voter registration in Mississippi.\n\nAnd yet, at that moment, we all just stood around Farish Street like we'd collectively woken up from a nightmare. Like something had taken over us. A few people wandered home, left with their grief and anger. The rest of us stayed behind to clean up the mess.\n\nThe kids listened to me because Medgar had brought me in to train them. The rest of the people, rage-filled locals who loved Medgar, listened to me because they'd seen me with him. I think they knew he would have vouched for me if he were there. Medgar was still saving lives from a grave he hadn't yet been buried in.\n\nThis essay is adapted from David Dennis Jr.'s book, The Movement Made Us: A Father, a Son, and the Legacy of a Freedom Ride .

He was chosen for the prime assignment because he was handsome; according to Benson, the other photographer was too ugly to pal around with Paul, John, Ringo, and George. Musings like this are revealed in Magnolia Pictures's new film, Harry Benson: Shoot First , a documentary that explores the iconic images of Benson's career. He remembers history as happenstance; Benson's just as lucky as he is ferocious. \"I've had an exciting life, every day is a new day,\" the 87-year-old said. \"What I've learned is that photography is not a team sport.

      "text": "James Meredith Is Not Nearly as Dead as Some People Think\n\n\"James Meredith is crazy.\"\n\nThe subject of that sentence says he's been hearing it all his life. But the first time he saw it in print was 1961, in a news story by New Orleans Times-Picayune reporter Bill Minor. Why in the world, Minor wanted to know, would this 29-year-old Mississippi native risk everything, including possibly his life, in a bid to become the first African-American to attend the lily-white University of Mississippi.\n\n\"Bill Minor wrote, 'James Meredith is crazy.' But he not only said I was crazy. He said why he thought I was crazy. Because he kept telling me white folks was going to kill me and I didn't believe it,\" Meredith says and laughs.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHe can laugh now, because for 84 years he's survived the death threats, including at least one nearly successful attempt on his life. And because he's been called crazy so many times by so many different people-including but not limited to white supremacists, Civil Right leaders, liberals, conservatives, Caucasians, and African Americans-these days he listens only to God.\n\nOutspoken, contrarian, and opinionated-as quick to change his mind as other men change their neckties-Meredith is the epitome of the cat that walks by himself.\n\n\"I ain't never stayed in touch at any point with nobody,\" he says, sitting in the living room of the modest, one-story house he shares with his wife on a leafy street in Jackson, MS. \"I been traveling all my life. I ain't once called home.\"\n\n\"Nobody handpicked me,\" Meredith wrote in his application for admission to Ole Miss in 1961. He acted alone, save for legal help from the NAACP. And, taking a stance that would prove lifelong, he pointedly distanced himself from the Civil Rights movement, volubly disagreeing with Martin Luther King's central tenet of non-violent protest. Though both men targeted institutional white supremacy as a common enemy, Meredith, who had spent nine years in the U.S. Air Force, put his faith in the power of the federal government and the military to protect him when he applied to Ole Miss. As far as he was concerned, he was at war with a state that refused to grant him his rights as an American citizen.\n\nMeredith and his lawyers successfully appealed his case through the courts. (Six years later he would earn his own law degree from Columbia University.) But when Mississippi stubbornly ignored the courts, Meredith's enrollment ultimately required the intercession of the Kennedy administration and U.S. troops, National Guardsmen, U.S. Marshals, and state highway patrolmen, culminating in a pitched battle with a mob composed of college students and vigilante racists on the Ole Miss campus on September 29, 1962. Tear gas and gunfire left scores wounded and two men dead. Most people called it a riot. Meredith calls it the last battle of the Civil War.\n\n1962:  James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals and lawyer John Doar (right).\n\nEven today you can see bullet holes left by the conflict in an an Ole Miss building. Mere steps away, you can also see a life-size statue, erected in 2006, of Meredith approaching an arch meant to symbolize his historic entry into the university. Until very recently, he took every opportunity to call for the statue's removal, dubbing it a \"false idol.\" But at a black alumni meeting last month, inspired he said by the outpouring of praise for his example in 1962, he reversed himself. Mississippi has changed, and so has James Meredith.\n\nIn 1966, Meredith again made headlines when he set out by himself on a walk from Memphis to Jackson. His goal was to encourage African Americans to set aside their fears and register to vote. Two days into his journey, he was shotgunned by a Memphis white man and left for dead in the road. He survived. A month later, at the conclusion of what by then had become the March Against Fear, with 15,000 participants inspired by Meredith's near martyrdom, he was well enough to rejoin the procession as it entered Jackson.\n\nButton promoting the Meredith Mississippi March of June 1966, which took its name from James Meredith, the first black student to attend the University of Mississippi in 1962.\n\nMeredith denies that bravery had anything to do with his willingness to put himself in harm's way at Ole Miss or on that Mississippi highway four years later. The only way he survived those ordeals, he says, was by imagining that he was already dead-\"and still feel that way!\"-thus rendering any fear of death beside the point. To judge the genuine depth of his serenity, you only need to know that during the rioting at Ole Miss in 1962, Meredith, under guard in a campus dormitory, slept through the whole thing.\n\nJames Meredith, right, chats with Dr. Martin Luther King after they met on U.S. 51 near Tougaloo, Mississippi on June 25, 1966. Dr. King had led a column of civil rights marchers from Tougaloo College to greet Meredith's marchers walking in from Canton.\n\n\"People come up to me and say thank you for being so brave, thank you for putting up with that,\" he says. \"But I ain't never in my life experienced nothing that anybody was talking about. What I think is, in order to be brave, there has to be something to fear, and it's an insult to me to think there's anything that would scare me.\"\n\nAs for those who assume that this pivotal figure of history is surely dead, Meredith is more amused than angered. On a recent visit to Jackson's new Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, \"I was sitting on a bench, and I heard two people saying, 'That's James Meredith sitting over there.' And they said, 'No, that can't be James Meredith. He dead.' And I heard someone else say, 'Is that Medgar Evers over there?' There is literally no black in Mississippi 50 years or older that don't think that James Meredith is supposed to be dead, for the same reason that Bill Minor said that James Meredith is crazy. Because of the things I have done, because blacks got killed for doing much less than that, everybody thought I was dead.\"\n\nFor his part, Meredith has never been willing to quietly take his place in American history's hall of fame. All his life he has spoken out, with no regard for what people thought of him, and certainly with no thought of burnishing his image as a hero of the Civil Rights movement, about which he says, \"My father paid a price far beyond anything I ever paid. And what I think about the so-called Civil Rights era is that it's an insult to all the elders that came before for a small group of people to say they got credited with this. I know it's a lie. And I ain't never going to give it no credibility if I can help it.\"\n\n-In 1967, he endorsed the gubernatorial bid of former Gov. Ross Barnett, the segregationist politician who was his chief antagonist in the Ole Miss struggle.\n\n-In 1991, he endorsed the Louisiana gubernatorial bid of white supremacist and former Klansman David Duke.\n\n-From 1989 to 1991, he served as domestic policy adviser for arch-conservative Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC).\n\nBut conservatives, like liberals, have learned the hard way not to take this modern Don Quixote for granted. For although he has never stopped criticizing the social engineering installed in the '60s under Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, he has been an equally relentless critic of racism and white supremacy, and lately praised Barack Obama: \"I think Obama is already challenging George Washington, up there in that category, and gonna remain there for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nAs for Donald Trump, he cannot even be bothered to offer an opinion: \"Christians must take care of only the business of God, and I can't talk about that because that's not God's business, that's man's business, and I'm on God's business.\"\n\nIt would be easier to dismiss Meredith as just another crank and sorehead were he not so self-aware and self-mocking and so willing to laugh at himself.\n\n\"For 50 years, my brother has been saying, James, why do you run every friend you got off? And not only do you run your friends off but when you come visit me and my friends come by, you run them off, too!\"\n\nIn his eighties, as sharp and irascible and energetic as a man half his age, Meredith has embarked on a new project that he frankly calls a \"mission from God.\" As far as he's is concerned, he's been on such a mission his whole life. In application to Ole Miss, he wrote, \"I believed, and believe now, that I have a Divine Responsibility.\"\n\nBut for the most part, he avoided such talk. \"Almost all my life I denied my mission,\" he says. \"I tried to cover it up. When my publisher titled my last book, I was shocked when I discovered that they'd called it  A Mission From God, because I'd spent all my life trying to make sure nobody thought I was doing that. When the book came out and I saw that title for the first time, I thought somebody had peeked my hole card.\"\n\nLately, he says, he's become more willing to be forthright. \"My God is telling me that the reason I'm not dead like everybody thought I would be is that He was saving me, preparing me to do this job now.\"\n\nThe \"job\" is the James Meredith Bible Society. According to its founder, God wants him to take his message to all 82 counties of Mississippi. \"So far I've been to one,  but I think God's gonna make me go back because I ain't got no proof that anybody heard me, much less that anybody's thinking about doing God's will as I'm promoting it.\"\n\nThe core message of the Bible Society is simple: Follow the 10 Commandments and the Golden Rule. Beyond that, members must agree to read the Bible from cover to cover, read or listen to one of the books of the Bible every week, teach the commandments and the Lord's Prayer to a child between the ages of one and five, and attend monthly society meetings. The membership, like an army of Christian soldiers, will be assigned ranks from private to general.\n\n\"I believe the most important thing for human beings is religion,\" Meredith says. \"And I believe the principle function of religion, of every one I've studied deeply, was moral character, keeping at or above a certain level and definitely taking care when it's below a certain level. Consequently, the only way to arrive at that level is to follow God's plan. But man always want to follow his plan.\"\n\nMeredith does not exempt himself. \"My God tells me I ain't never done nothing he instructed me to do. I've always done what I wanted to do. He let me fool myself into thinking I was fooling Him most all of my life. You and all the other people were human. But them laws didn't apply to me. I thought I was God's gift to the world. I was special. And the most shocking thing, when He got my attention, he said, James Meredith, you are my gift to the world, but you're just one among many. I said, God, you have got to be kidding. I always thought I was the only one. What you mean? But He convinced me He is in charge of everything, the good and the bad. It was hard for me to accept that He would do all the bad things for His own good purposes. But once I accepted that, I still had the problem, as He always put it to me, of just trying to do my job and not trying to judge other people and what they do. He said, if you really want to be important, just figure out the little bit I want you to do. When you do that, everything else will fall into place. I know He's right. I ain't sure I can do it. But I am getting hints now that people may start to listen.\"\n\nThen, as he does almost every time he catches himself answering a question at great length, he chuckles and says, \"God's jerking on my coat again, saying shut your mouth, you already answered the man's question, and now you're getting yourself in trouble by talking too much.\"\n\nBut, a little like an old-time stump preacher who, once wound up, can't seem to stop, he goes on: \"I've had to make some significant decisions in old age. The principle one I've made-most of my life I've spent trying to educate people to know what I know so they could understand what I'm talking about. It came to me that that is not the way. That is not God's way. What you have to do is start doing God's will so other people can follow that example. And that's what I'm setting out to do now. \"\n\nHis Bible society mission has consumed Meredith for the better part of the last decade. \"A whole lifetime really,\" he says. \"I can't remember a day since I was four years old, actually younger, that I didn't think that God had me on this mission. I remember clearly when I was four, standing in [his hometown of] Kosciusko and thinking that I'm going to build me a city. I don't know what it's going to be like, but it's going to be different from this.\"\n\nIn many ways, Meredith is a study in contradictions: proud and humble, vinegar and sugar, angry and beatific. Thus one minute he can say, when asked if he is surprised at the recent resurgence of white supremacy, that \"white supremacy ain't never gone anywhere, and it ain't never going anywhere.\" And the next minute he'll start talking about \"a change in the atmosphere in Mississippi. People want to be doing something different from what they been doing. That's everybody. I know that there's an atmosphere from anything I have ever experienced in my lifetime, that change is possible. Particularly in Mississippi now, nothing has bothered any group of people more than the black-white race issue has bothered good whites in Mississippi over the last 25 or 30 years. I feel very sure they want to change.\"\n\nJames H. Meredith, left, clutches his diploma at graduation on the campus of The University of Mississippi in Oxford on Aug. 19, 1963 after becoming the first African American to graduate in the University of Mississippi's 115-year-old history. Meredith received his degree from Dr. J.D. Williams, right, chancellor of \"Ole Miss.\"\n\nHe has no regrets about his life. \"My daddy always taught me the two greatest wastes of time are regretting the past and worrying about the future, and he did such a good job that I ain't never spent an ounce of energy on either one.\"\n\nAnd he is much less interested in talking about the past than what he's going to do next. Asked if he's not proud of what he accomplished at Ole Miss and on the March Against Fear, he bristles, his intense dark eyes burning even brighter.\n\n\"The only thing that question tells me.\" he says, \"is that you don't know nothing about James Meredith. I don't even have thoughts that would prepare me to answer that question.\"\n\nAbout the future he is more sanguine. Asked how he wants to be remembered in 50 years, he answers quickly, cheerfully, and with no equivocation: \"Doing God's will. Successfully!\"\n\nGot a tip?

And because he's been called crazy so many times by so many different people-including but not limited to white supremacists, Civil Right leaders, liberals, conservatives, Caucasians, and African Americans-these days he listens only to God.\n\nOutspoken, contrarian, and opinionated-as quick to change his mind as other men change their neckties-Meredith is the epitome of the cat that walks by himself.\n\n\"I ain't never stayed in touch at any point with nobody,\" he says, sitting in the living room of the modest, one-story house he shares with his wife on a leafy street in Jackson, MS. \"I been traveling all my life. I ain't once called home.\"\n\n\"Nobody handpicked me,\" Meredith wrote in his application for admission to Ole Miss in 1961. He acted alone, save for legal help from the NAACP. And, taking a stance that would prove lifelong, he pointedly distanced himself from the Civil Rights movement, volubly disagreeing with Martin Luther King's central tenet of non-violent protest. Though both men targeted institutional white supremacy as a common enemy, Meredith, who had spent nine years in the U.S. Air Force, put his faith in the power of the federal government and the military to protect him when he applied to Ole Miss. As far as he was concerned, he was at war with a state that refused to grant him his rights as an American citizen.\n\nMeredith and his lawyers successfully appealed his case through the courts. (Six years later he would earn his own law degree from Columbia University.) But when Mississippi stubbornly ignored the courts, Meredith's enrollment ultimately required the intercession of the Kennedy administration and U.S. troops, National Guardsmen, U.S. Marshals, and state highway patrolmen, culminating in a pitched battle with a mob composed of college students and vigilante racists on the Ole Miss campus on September 29, 1962. Tear gas and gunfire left scores wounded and two men dead. Most people called it a riot. Meredith calls it the last battle of the Civil War.\n\n1962:  James Meredith walking to class accompanied by U.S. marshals and lawyer John Doar (right).\n\nEven today you can see bullet holes left by the conflict in an an Ole Miss building. Mere steps away, you can also see a life-size statue, erected in 2006, of Meredith approaching an arch meant to symbolize his historic entry into the university. Until very recently, he took every opportunity to call for the statue's removal, dubbing it a \"false idol.\" But at a black alumni meeting last month, inspired he said by the outpouring of praise for his example in 1962, he reversed himself. Mississippi has changed, and so has James Meredith.\n\nIn 1966, Meredith again made headlines when he set out by himself on a walk from Memphis to Jackson. His goal was to encourage African Americans to set aside their fears and register to vote. Two days into his journey, he was shotgunned by a Memphis white man and left for dead in the road. He survived. A month later, at the conclusion of what by then had become the March Against Fear, with 15,000 participants inspired by Meredith's near martyrdom, he was well enough to rejoin the procession as it entered Jackson.\n\nButton promoting the Meredith Mississippi March of June 1966, which took its name from James Meredith, the first black student to attend the University of Mississippi in 1962.\n\nMeredith denies that bravery had anything to do with his willingness to put himself in harm's way at Ole Miss or on that Mississippi highway four years later. The only way he survived those ordeals, he says, was by imagining that he was already dead-\"and still feel that way!\"-thus rendering any fear of death beside the point. To judge the genuine depth of his serenity, you only need to know that during the rioting at Ole Miss in 1962, Meredith, under guard in a campus dormitory, slept through the whole thing.\n\nJames Meredith, right, chats with Dr. Martin Luther King after they met on U.S. 51 near Tougaloo, Mississippi on June 25, 1966. Dr. King had led a column of civil rights marchers from Tougaloo College to greet Meredith's marchers walking in from Canton.\n\n\"People come up to me and say thank you for being so brave, thank you for putting up with that,\" he says. \"But I ain't never in my life experienced nothing that anybody was talking about. What I think is, in order to be brave, there has to be something to fear, and it's an insult to me to think there's anything that would scare me.\"\n\nAs for those who assume that this pivotal figure of history is surely dead, Meredith is more amused than angered. On a recent visit to Jackson's new Mississippi Civil Rights Museum, \"I was sitting on a bench, and I heard two people saying, 'That's James Meredith sitting over there.' And they said, 'No, that can't be James Meredith. He dead.' And I heard someone else say, 'Is that Medgar Evers over there?' There is literally no black in Mississippi 50 years or older that don't think that James Meredith is supposed to be dead, for the same reason that Bill Minor said that James Meredith is crazy. Because of the things I have done, because blacks got killed for doing much less than that, everybody thought I was dead.\"\n\nFor his part, Meredith has never been willing to quietly take his place in American history's hall of fame. All his life he has spoken out, with no regard for what people thought of him, and certainly with no thought of burnishing his image as a hero of the Civil Rights movement, about which he says, \"My father paid a price far beyond anything I ever paid. And what I think about the so-called Civil Rights era is that it's an insult to all the elders that came before for a small group of people to say they got credited with this. I know it's a lie. And I ain't never going to give it no credibility if I can help it.\"\n\n-In 1967, he endorsed the gubernatorial bid of former Gov. Ross Barnett, the segregationist politician who was his chief antagonist in the Ole Miss struggle.\n\n-In 1991, he endorsed the Louisiana gubernatorial bid of white supremacist and former Klansman David Duke.\n\n-From 1989 to 1991, he served as domestic policy adviser for arch-conservative Sen. Jesse Helms (R-NC).\n\nBut conservatives, like liberals, have learned the hard way not to take this modern Don Quixote for granted. For although he has never stopped criticizing the social engineering installed in the '60s under Lyndon Johnson's Great Society, he has been an equally relentless critic of racism and white supremacy, and lately praised Barack Obama: \"I think Obama is already challenging George Washington, up there in that category, and gonna remain there for the foreseeable future.\"\n\nAs for Donald Trump, he cannot even be bothered to offer an opinion: \"Christians must take care of only the business of God, and I can't talk about that because that's not God's business, that's man's business, and I'm on God's business.\"\n\nIt would be easier to dismiss Meredith as just another crank and sorehead were he not so self-aware and self-mocking and so willing to laugh at himself.\n\n\"For 50 years, my brother has been saying, James, why do you run every friend you got off? And not only do you run your friends off but when you come visit me and my friends come by, you run them off, too!\"\n\nIn his eighties, as sharp and irascible and energetic as a man half his age, Meredith has embarked on a new project that he frankly calls a \"mission from God.\" As far as he's is concerned, he's been on such a mission his whole life. In application to Ole Miss, he wrote, \"I believed, and believe now, that I have a Divine Responsibility.\"\n\nBut for the most part, he avoided such talk. \"Almost all my life I denied my mission,\" he says. \"I tried to cover it up. When my publisher titled my last book, I was shocked when I discovered that they'd called it  A Mission From God, because I'd spent all my life trying to make sure nobody thought I was doing that. When the book came out and I saw that title for the first time, I thought somebody had peeked my hole card.\"\n\nLately, he says, he's become more willing to be forthright. \"My God is telling me that the reason I'm not dead like everybody thought I would be is that He was saving me, preparing me to do this job now.\"\n\nThe \"job\" is the James Meredith Bible Society. According to its founder, God wants him to take his message to all 82 counties of Mississippi. \"So far I've been to one,  but I think God's gonna make me go back because I ain't got no proof that anybody heard me, much less that anybody's thinking about doing God's will as I'm promoting it.\"\n\nThe core message of the Bible Society is simple: Follow the 10 Commandments and the Golden Rule. Beyond that, members must agree to read the Bible from cover to cover, read or listen to one of the books of the Bible every week, teach the commandments and the Lord's Prayer to a child between the ages of one and five, and attend monthly society meetings. The membership, like an army of Christian soldiers, will be assigned ranks from private to general.\n\n\"I believe the most important thing for human beings is religion,\" Meredith says. \"And I believe the principle function of religion, of every one I've studied deeply, was moral character, keeping at or above a certain level and definitely taking care when it's below a certain level. Consequently, the only way to arrive at that level is to follow God's plan. But man always want to follow his plan.\"\n\nMeredith does not exempt himself. \"My God tells me I ain't never done nothing he instructed me to do. I've always done what I wanted to do. He let me fool myself into thinking I was fooling Him most all of my life. You and all the other people were human. But them laws didn't apply to me. I thought I was God's gift to the world. I was special. And the most shocking thing, when He got my attention, he said, James Meredith, you are my gift to the world, but you're just one among many. I said, God, you have got to be kidding. I always thought I was the only one. What you mean? But He convinced me He is in charge of everything, the good and the bad. It was hard for me to accept that He would do all the bad things for His own good purposes. But once I accepted that, I still had the problem, as He always put it to me, of just trying to do my job and not trying to judge other people and what they do. He said, if you really want to be important, just figure out the little bit I want you to do. When you do that, everything else will fall into place. I know He's right. I ain't sure I can do it. But I am getting hints now that people may start to listen.\"\n\nThen, as he does almost every time he catches himself answering a question at great length, he chuckles and says, \"God's jerking on my coat again, saying shut your mouth, you already answered the man's question, and now you're getting yourself in trouble by talking too much.\"\n\nBut, a little like an old-time stump preacher who, once wound up, can't seem to stop, he goes on: \"I've had to make some significant decisions in old age. The principle one I've made-most of my life I've spent trying to educate people to know what I know so they could understand what I'm talking about. It came to me that that is not the way. That is not God's way. What you have to do is start doing God's will so other people can follow that example. And that's what I'm setting out to do now. \"\n\nHis Bible society mission has consumed Meredith for the better part of the last decade. \"A whole lifetime really,\" he says. \"I can't remember a day since I was four years old, actually younger, that I didn't think that God had me on this mission. I remember clearly when I was four, standing in [his hometown of] Kosciusko and thinking that I'm going to build me a city. I don't know what it's going to be like, but it's going to be different from this.\"\n\nIn many ways, Meredith is a study in contradictions: proud and humble, vinegar and sugar, angry and beatific. Thus one minute he can say, when asked if he is surprised at the recent resurgence of white supremacy, that \"white supremacy ain't never gone anywhere, and it ain't never going anywhere.\" And the next minute he'll start talking about \"a change in the atmosphere in Mississippi. People want to be doing something different from what they been doing. That's everybody. I know that there's an atmosphere from anything I have ever experienced in my lifetime, that change is possible. Particularly in Mississippi now, nothing has bothered any group of people more than the black-white race issue has bothered good whites in Mississippi over the last 25 or 30 years. I feel very sure they want to change.\"\n\nJames H. Meredith, left, clutches his diploma at graduation on the campus of The University of Mississippi in Oxford on Aug. 19, 1963 after becoming the first African American to graduate in the University of Mississippi's 115-year-old history. Meredith received his degree from Dr. J.D. Williams, right, chancellor of \"Ole Miss.\"\n\nHe has no regrets about his life. \"My daddy always taught me the two greatest wastes of time are regretting the past and worrying about the future, and he did such a good job that I ain't never spent an ounce of energy on either one.\"\n\nAnd he is much less interested in talking about the past than what he's going to do next. Asked if he's not proud of what he accomplished at Ole Miss and on the March Against Fear, he bristles, his intense dark eyes burning even brighter.\n\n\"The only thing that question tells me.\" he says, \"is that you don't know nothing about James Meredith. I don't even have thoughts that would prepare me to answer that question.\"\n\nAbout the future he is more sanguine. Asked how he wants to be remembered in 50 years, he answers quickly, cheerfully, and with no equivocation: \"Doing God's will. Successfully!\"\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Heritage and Hate at Ole Miss\n\nLast weekend, at the University of Mississippi, vandals defaced a statue of James Meredith-who stood against white mobs and the state government to desegregate the school in 1962. According to reports , two white men approached the statue in the early morning and placed a tight noose on its neck. They draped the statue with an early version of the Georgia state flag, which shows the \"stars and bars\" of the Confederacy.\n\nThe message, to the black students of Ole Miss, was straightforward: Go away. We don't want you here. But 52 years after Meredith went on campus, non-whites are a quarter of μthe student body. They're not going anywhere.\n\nIt should be said that, thanks to an immediate response from the university, local police have several suspects-three freshmen, all of them white males-and all are wanted for questioning.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGiven the extent to which this deals directly with the school's reputation, I have no doubt that it will come to a satisfying conclusion. Those kids will face punishment for their vandalism, and the administration will congratulate itself for its efforts. And indeed, as the New York Times reports , the school's student establishment has-to its credit-moved to condemn the perpetrators, \"Fifteen fraternity presidents vowed in a statement to expel any member who participated in the attack on the statue.\"\n\nOf course, this incident is about more than just the statue. It sits in dialogue-of sorts-with the school's pattern of racist incidents, like the anti-Obama demonstration that followed the 2012 elections, where students burned Obama campaign signs and chanted \"the South will rise again.\"\n\nAs always, these incidents are condemned for having \"no place\" at Ole Miss. But, sadly, they do, especially given the school's embrace of Confederate symbols, which it defends as part of its \"tradition.\" Prominent examples include the Confederate monument near the center of the university, the school mascot-a \"Rebel\"-and its embrace of \" Dixie \" as a fight song for football games.\n\nYes, the school has made tremendous progress towards building a safe environment for its black students. But it's hard-if not impossible-to reconcile this with the use of Confederate symbols. Most white students at Ole Miss, if they hail from the South, can salvage a history to honor from the CSA (hence slogans like \"heritage not hate\"). Blacks have the same roots, and they go just as deep-if not deeper. But there's nothing they can draw from the Confederacy. And if school pride is tied to this kind of Southern \"heritage,\" then it's hard to see how African Americans can feel fully comfortable on campus.\n\nWhat's more, those symbols can encourage the view that the school is for whites, and whites alone. Put simply, if you're going to honor the Confederacy on your campus, you shouldn't be surprised when some students that seriously .\n\nI get the reverence for tradition that defines a place like Ole Miss. It's a fact of life at the flagship universities of the South, like my alma mater, the University of Virginia. But \"tradition\" isn't an unalloyed good, and there are parts of our traditions that we should set aside. Ole Miss is a 21st century campus with the worst of our 19th century symbols. It's time for a change.\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

The student, James \"JP\" Staples, was identified on Instagram by the NAACP.\n\n\"Phi Delta Theta General Headquarters is aware of the video regarding the student protest at the University of Mississippi,\" the statement reads.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The racist actions in the video were those of an individual and are antithetical to the values of Phi Delta Theta and the Mississippi Alpha chapter. The responsible individual was removed from membership on Friday, May 3.\"\n\nIt was unclear whether Staples would be allowed to rejoin the organization at Ole Miss or any other chapter in the future. Kate Fulmer, spokesperson for Phi Delta Theta's national headquarters, told The Daily Beast that the decision to expel Staples was made in consultation with other groups.\n\n\"In partnership with local alumni, undergraduate leadership, and the university, disciplinary due process was initiated which resulted in the removal of membership. The situation will continue to be monitored in cooperation with any further investigation,\" Fulmer said.\n\nThe fraternity's announcement came just days after the university launched a student conduct investigation into at least one student as a result of the racist counterprotest encounter.\n\nIn a letter addressed to the campus community on Friday, Chancellor Glenn Boyce said the university was aware of behavior that was \"offensive, hurtful and unacceptable, including actions that conveyed hostility and racist overtones,\" although he did not clarify that it was pro-Israel counterprotesters who lodged those racist attacks.\n\n\"While student privacy laws prohibit us from commenting on any specific student, we have opened one student conduct investigation. We are working to determine whether more cases are warranted,\" Boyce wrote.\n\nOn Thursday, counter protesters overwhelmed a small demonstration in support of Palestine, which had been peacefully assembled on the grassy area of campus. Counter protesters surrounded the fenced-off protest area and chanted things like \"Hit the showers!\" and \"Your nose is huge,\" the nonprofit news outlet Mississippi Today reported.\n\nThe jeers were especially vicious toward a Black female protester who separated from the rest of the protest encampment. Video showing a group of mostly white male counter protesters mocking her quickly went viral after they hurled taunts like \"Lizzo!\" and \"Lock her up!\" as she was guided away by police.\n\nOle Miss taking care of business. pic.twitter.com/JiL9hs2pHz\n\nIn his message, Boyce said that kind of harassment was unacceptable.\n\n\"We will not tolerate discrimination, intimidation, harassment or bias of anyone in our campus community. To be clear, people who say horrible things to people because of who they are will not find shelter or comfort on this campus,\" Boyce continued.\n\nElected officials said otherwise. Rep. Mike Collins (R-GA) proudly reposted the video and captioned it, \"Ole Miss taking care of business.\" Governor Tate Reeves tweeted his approval with footage of the counterprotests.\n\n\"Warms my heart,\" he wrote.\n\nThe confrontation drew comparisons to the 1962 protests, when its white student body found themselves in uproar over the decision to admit a single Black student, James Meredith. Ole Miss, which has long been entwined with Confederate history, continued to be a site of cultural conflict through the late 2010s and 2020s, when students rallied to remove Confederate monuments from campus that they argued were glorifying slavery.\n\nIt's a legacy the school-which takes its nickname from enslavement era language-still grapples with. In his Friday message, Boyce faintly alluded to the school's ties to the Confederacy without naming it.\n\n\"While we are a modern university with a vibrant community of more than 25,000 people, it is important to acknowledge our challenging history, and incidents like this can set us back,\" Boyce wrote.\n\nThough Black Mississippians make up nearly 40 percent of the state's population, they are vastly underrepresented at the university, where Black students make up only 11 percent of the student body.\n\nBreaking News Intern\n\namanda.yen@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "This Professor Protested a School's Racism. Then He Lost His Job.\n\nThe University of Mississippi has been a formidable institution since its founding in 1848-13 years before the Civil War started. And it has been steeped in racism and exclusion for decades. The school's mascot has changed several times since 1928, but the most controversial-from the late '70s through 2003-was \" Colonel Reb ,\" a caricature of a slaveowner (the current mascot is the \"Landshark\"). The school didn't remove the song \"Dixie\" from its marching band's repertoire until 2016 .  A long-contested Confederate statue that graced the entrance of the campus was finally moved in 2020 to a less prominent location on university property. Yet, the racist monikers of \" Ole Miss ,\" an antebellum term used by the enslaved, and \" Rebels \" who fought to uphold slavery, are still held dear.\n\nIn 2018, Ed Meek, a wealthy businessman who donated $5.3 million to the School of Journalism and New Media and had it subsequently named after him, wrote a blatantly racist, sexist Facebook post that made Black female students feel specifically targeted and unwelcome at a university where underrepresented Black students and faculty make up 13 and 6 percent respectively in a state where 38 percent of the population is Black. By contrast, an overrepresented 76 percent of students and faculty are white. Several members of the faculty and staff and students initiated a petition to rename the building, remove the Confederate statue, and to establish scholarships for Black women in journalism. A name that was floated to replace Meek's was that of my great-grandmother Ida B. Wells -a journalism pioneer and native Mississippian from nearby Holly Springs.\n\nOne of those who protested was UM history professor Dr. Garrett Felber, who strongly advocated for the renaming of the journalism school. I met him in 2018 when he organized an Ida B. Wells Teach-In that featured various speakers, a student choir, a short video, and I gave a few remarks. Interacting with advocates for justice and inclusion gave me a sense of hope that UM, which has a contentious history of race relations, would finally get on the path to being a more open and inclusive institution. When I met with the then-dean of the journalism school, I did not experience a warm reception. I left the meeting with the impression that there was more sympathy for the wealthy donor Meek, who was viewed as having his character attacked, than the Black students whose presence he implied denigrated the quality of the school. Meek eventually withdrew his money and removed his name from the school.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nDespite the tough and sometimes racially contentious environments on some college campuses, the academy is routinely framed by some as liberal enclaves where people mull over philosophies that are removed from the \"real world.\" Felber is the opposite of that. Like Wells, he has advocated fiercely to address and solve issues of criminal justice. He was the lead organizer of the Making and Unmaking Mass Incarceration conference , project director of the Parchman Oral History Project, and co-founder of Liberation Literacy , an abolitionist collective which began as a racial justice reading group inside and outside of prisons in Oregon. He initiated the Prison Abolition Syllabus , which contextualized the prison strikes in 2016 and 2018. He also helped launch Study and Struggle , a political education program that addresses the crises of Mississippi prisons and detention centers.\n\nHis advocacy is reminiscent of Wells, who frequently visited prisoners and even worked as a probation officer because she was committed to helping those who were easy targets of the police state. She wrote about the injustice of the convict lease system , which used prisoners as sources of free labor.  She also wrote her detailed pamphlet The Arkansas Race Riot, after she visited a group of imprisoned sharecroppers from Elaine, Arkansas who defended themselves from attack by a group of white vigilantes.\n\nFelber was on the brink of expanding his work focused on the carceral state when a $57,000 grant he applied for was heralded by the university to support the Study and Struggle program. Then a second grant for the same program was rejected by the chair of his department with the claim that the program was political versus historical and could jeopardize department funding. This was in the climate of the Trump administration's attack on critical race theory and antiracist work . Felber suspected the rejection of the grant was more about appeasing racist donors than the excuse he was given about him not following proper procedure. He requested a written explanation outlining the rationale for the rejection of the grant as a condition of him meeting with his chair about the matter. Then he lost his job.\n\nThe sudden termination of Felber sends a very strong and disturbing message. Felber was doing antiracist work and initiated programs that benefited the marginalized and disenfranchised. He was questioning the university's deference to wealthy racists, which is part of its long and storied history of racial intolerance, marginalization, and downright violence against Black people and their allies. To directly address past injustices, he organized a program in February 2020 to commemorate the 50th anniversary of the mass arrest and expulsion of Black students who simply demanded equality, respect, and support.  From the need to have federal protection for James Meredith to integrate the school in 1962, to the lethargy with which the university has addressed offensive symbols, songs, and statues, the flagship state school in my great-grandmother's home state of Mississippi seems proud to uphold an environment that is hostile toward diversity, equity, and inclusion.\n\nA letter of support for Felber with pledges to avoid speaking at the school until he is reinstated has already garnered over 5,000 signatures from his fellow academics across the country. This show of solidarity among scholars illustrates that there is a community that believes in tolerance, inclusion, academic freedom, and institutional transparency. After a protest-filled summer in response to systemic racism and police brutality, some institutions are examining their environments and making significant strides to reckon with racist pasts and policies. Maybe UM will someday be proactive in a march toward reparative justice versus begrudgingly responding to agitation.\n\nMichelle Duster teaches at Columbia College Chicago.

      "text": "Jim Crow Is Resurrected in Mississippi\n\nEarlier this month, white representatives in the Mississippi House approved a bill to create a new district-that includes all of the majority-white neighborhoods in Jackson, a capital city that is 83 percent Black. This includes creating a criminal justice system for the district, overseen by an all-white power base.\n\nUnder House Bill 1020, the white conservative chief justice of the Mississippi Supreme Court would handpick the new district's two supervising judges; its prosecutors and public defenders would be chosen by the state's white Republican attorney general.\n\nThe zone would be policed by an expanded Capitol Police force, led by the current white police chief, and supervised by the state's white Public Safety commissioner. Because all the district's officials would be appointed instead of elected, Jackson's majority-Black citizenry would have no voting rights on the matter-making it Mississippi's only jurisdiction where, according to the ACLU, \"unelected judges and prosecutors have jurisdiction over criminal and civil law matters\"-although 12 percent of their sales taxes would be redirected to help pay for it all.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"It's oppressive because it strips the right of Black folks to vote,\" Jackson Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba said , after the bill cleared the House. \"It's oppressive because it puts a military force over people that has no accountability to them. It's oppressive because there will be judges who will determine sentences over people's lives. It's oppressive because it redirects their tax dollars to something they don't endorse nor believe in.\"\n\nState Rep. Trey Lamar, the white Republican who sponsored the bill, lives in and represents a majority-white district more than two hours away from Jackson . (He holds a seat once held by his grandfather , Leon Hannaford, whose legacy includes introducing a 1962 bill to tighten residency requirements for college students, which a local paper at the time reported, \"would have kept Negro James Meredith from filing suit to enter the University of Mississippi.\") In various statements on the House floor and in an op-ed from last weekend , the legislator has insisted that HB 1020, by adding unelected judges to Hinds County's courts, will help clear up lengthy case backlogs, while an expanded Capitol Police force will address a spike in crime in Jackson, allowing his constituents to \" feel safe when they come \" to the capital.\n\nCalling the bill \" racially neutral ,\" he suggested Jackson's Black elected representatives, who overwhelmingly rejected the legislation, have \" used race \" as some kind of political maneuver, and has even gone so far as to accuse those same black officials of \"incompetence in leadership.\"\n\nIf it's not already obvious already, there's really only one way to describe an effort to create a white political stronghold in America's second blackest city , where the Black majority is subject to taxation without representation-and that is, \"trying to pull a Jim Crow.\"\n\nBut it's not just the top-down white supremacist power structure the bill proposes that begs the Jim Crow comparisons. It's also the overtly racist subtext needed to justify the idea that white power is the natural \"solution\"-an assumption so frequently made, it's recognizable between all those lines of \"racially neutral\" language. (At the suggestion of an amendment to ensure his bill's unelected judges at least be from Jackson, Lamar suggested the search not be limited to the majority-Black city, asking, \"Do we not want our best and brightest sitting in judgment?\")\n\nBlack House Democrats rightly compared the bill to Mississippi's 1890 Constitution, which was drafted explicitly to \" exclude the Negro \" from voting through sinster methods of Black disenfranchisement. But the toppling of Reconstruction, in Mississippi as elsewhere, was also driven by the white supremacist assumption of Black incompetence, intellectual unfitness, and innate inadequacy, ideas fabricated to cast Black folks as incapable of leading. One Mississippi delegate would later write that the goal of the state's constitutional convention had been \"to adopt some provision in our organic law which would serve to the State a good and stable government, freed from...negro rule from which we had suffered\" and to \"remove from the sphere of politics in the state the ignorant and unpatriotic negro.\"\n\nFor nearly a century, the white racist recollection of Reconstruction would redact and overwrite history, smearing Black leaders as inherently unfit to hold office, and falsely portraying the reestablishment of absolute white authority as a necessary intervention and saving grace.\n\nPerhaps this history is lost to Mississippi's current white legislators, but that seems unlikely considering the effort they've put into scrubbing it from textbooks . (Ditto the fact that \"no Black official has held \" any of the designated shot-calling positions-attorney general, chief justice of the Supreme Court-nor \"any statewide elected office since the brief period of Reconstruction after the Civil  War, which ended due to white terrorism to block Black voting power,\" the Mississippi Free Press reported.)\n\nApartment complexes and neighborhoods in the southern part of the capital city in Jackson, Mississippi.\n\nMississippi Today reports that during the four-hour debate over the bill, as \"Black House members were doing all they could to plead with the humanity of their GOP colleagues, a large number of Republicans left the House floor altogether for a majority of the debate, reappearing from the back halls of the Capitol to cast a final 'yea' vote.\" Lamar, apparently indifferent, \"sat behind the well and scrolled his phone.\"\n\nAnd yet, Lamar keeps saying that HB 1020 is a \"good faith effort at helping the people\" of Jackson and Hinds County, but it sure seems like the same tired narrative of the \"civilizing\" power of whiteness being used to save \"uncivilized\" Blackness from itself.\n\nWhat's more, this sudden compulsion to help by takeover-framed almost as charitable giving, in debate over the bill-comes after years of apparently feeling unmoved. Both Lamar and Gov. Tate Reeves used the language of \"incompetence\" when indicting Jackson's Black leaders about the recent water crisis, but Jackson's leaders had already pleaded for funds from Mississippi's legislative supermajority, only to be repeatedly shortchanged. Jackson city schools have long been underfunded, an issue that was exacerbated by 2013's Charter Public Schools Act , but instead of correcting the problem, a takeover was again proposed as a logical solution. And during this legislative session, instead of organizing a hostile takeover, the legislature could vote to expand Medicaid, which would do far more to aid Black Jacksonians than stripping their voting rights could even pretend to. But so far, Mississippi's legislative majority seems uninterested in providing that sort of help .\n\nMakes you wonder where the ineptitude truly lies.\n\nIf HB 1020 isn't an attempt at a \"land grab,\" as Democratic Rep. Ed Blackmon called it, then why does the bill not simply seek to fund more permanent elected judges to Hinds County and Jackson's courts, instead of diverting tax money to a whole new district? If criminal cases have surged in tandem with Jackson's crime surge, thus creating the backlog that Lamar wants to address, then why are the unelected judges of HB 1020 also going to be handling civil cases, to re-pose another question from Blackmon? (Especially since, in his op-ed self-defense, Lamar notes that Hinds County District Attorney Jody Owen stated that \"our current judges are working really hard, but they have half civil and half criminal dockets.\")\n\nMississippi's crime lab has been underfunded, understaffed, and under-equipped for years- contributing to backlogs in Jackson's courts and all around the state-and yet Lamar's bill does nothing to address long-standing appeals from lab staffers to address any of those issues. Overlooking these problems doesn't seem like a good way to address Jackson's criminal court case backlogs, unless what you were really trying to do was to create yet another entrenched white power system in the state.\n\nMississippi's Capitol Police officers reportedly shot more people in 2022 than any other Mississippi law enforcement department, with the most recent shooting occurring in December . The department's fatal police shooting of 25-year-old Jaylen Lewis in September is still under investigation by the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation . At a meeting between the police chief and public safety officers, Black residents expressed concerns that Capitol officers don't know \" how to deal with Black people in Black neighborhoods,\" and fears that most of the force's officers are from counties \"known for their racial prejudice.\"\n\nWhile the new Capitol District will still be majority Black, it will also include 80 percent of Jackson's white residents , and guess whose property rights will be prioritized over all else, including certain folks' lives? Nevermind Capitol Police lack an \"oversight board or standard requirements around transparency of reporting regarding officer-involved shootings,\" as Jackson-based organizer Makani Themba wrote for The Nation .\n\nJust as Lamar wants his constituents to \" feel safe when they come \" to the capital, Black Jacksonians want to feel safe, too, both from crime and from over-policing. It's a concern the legislator blithely dismissed by stating , \"if you're not committing crimes in Jackson, you really don't have anything to worry about.\"\n\nThat's quite a statement from someone with deep roots in a state notorious for creating the first Black Codes , having the most racial terror lynchings , having a Senate that voted to ship its Black residents to Africa at the late date of 1922, which created the first White Citizens' Council , which removed the Confederate flag from its banner in 2020 , and which attempted to ban the teaching about all of those things with a bill that erroneously calls it \" critical race theory .\"\n\nIn 2023, the Mississippi House passed a bill that would essentially resurrect Jim Crow; now that proposed law will head to the Senate, where Republicans also retain majority power. Perhaps Mississippi will become the first state to so openly reinstate Jim Crow, extracting Black power in every form it can, yet again. And others will undoubtedly follow.\n\nGot a tip?

Church in Charleston, S.C., left nine peaceful parishioners dead. Those bullets allegedly fired by white supremacist Dylann Storm Roof murdered many, but they may also have shot the roof off the Confederacy. Within days of the shooting, Confederate flags were taken down from the Alabama state capitol grounds. They disappeared from the shelves and websites of vendors like Wal-Mart, Amazon and Etsy. After 10 days, African-American activist Bree Newsome climbed the flagpole outside the South Carolina Statehouse, pulled down the flag and was quickly arrested. While the flag was put right back up, it almost took two more weeks for the Republican-controlled South Carolina Legislature to pass a bill, which was then signed into law by the state's Republican governor, Nikki Haley, removing the battle flag of the Confederacy once and for all from South Carolina's Statehouse grounds. It had flown there, either on the capitol dome or, later, beside the capitol at the Confederate war memorial, since 1961.\n\nAs Roof languishes in prison, awaiting trial on both federal and state felony charges, the movement that was sparked by the massacre continues to grow. Most recently, students at the University of Mississippi in Oxford have been organizing to force the removal from campus of the state flag of Mississippi. That state flag, alone among the 50, retains the actual design of the stars and bars of the Confederate flag. In the upper-left corner of the flag, this symbol of racist violence and secession still flies proudly.\n\nOn Tuesday night, the University of Mississippi's Associated Student Body ( ASB ) voted on a resolution put forth by one of that group's senators, a white student named Allen Coon, president of the University of Mississippi College Democrats, to remove the flag. The resolution passed by a vote of 33 to 15, with one abstention. I asked Coon why he took on the issue of the Mississippi state flag:\n\n\"After the tragic events in Charleston, there's been this national movement to address Confederate iconography,\" he told me. \"Our campus is steeped in symbols of the Confederacy and symbols of white supremacy. I felt we ought to utilize this momentum to address these symbols. So, in late September, I contacted my allies in the NAACP on campus, and we decided to form a coalition and challenge ASB to take a stand.\"\n\nThe resolution was supported by the campus NAACP , whose chapter president, Dominique Scott, told me, \"We want to institutionalize inclusion here at the university.\" The University of Mississippi was at the center of the civil-rights movement. In 1962, James Meredith became the first African-American to enroll there as a student, eight full years after the U.S. Supreme Court formally overturned all school segregation laws. President John F. Kennedy deployed the military to keep order; white segregationists rioted when Meredith entered the campus.\n\nEven the university's name is freighted with racism. The University of Mississippi is popularly referred to as \"'Ole Miss.\" Scott explained the history of the nickname:\n\n\"Historically, the term 'Ole Miss' is a term that slaves used to refer to the mistresses or matriarchs of their plantations. When the school was deciding on [its] nickname, one woman was quoted saying that 'Ole Miss'... used to refer to the mistress of their plantations. When the vote was passed to use the term 'Ole Miss,' the runner-up was 'Ole Massa.' The term is steeped within a history of white supremacy and racial oppression.\"\n\nRacism is still all too present on campus. As Scott recalled, \"In 2013, three individuals placed a noose around the neck of the James Meredith statue with the old Georgia state flag. They shouted racial slurs and 'white power,' in a way to intimidate black students on campus.\" At the rally on campus to support the ASB resolution to remove the flag, a group of white supremacists staged a counter-rally, carrying the Confederate flag and shouting racist slogans.\n\nUniversity officials say they are proud of the stand the students are taking. But, as a state institution, the university says it is bound to fly the official state flag, though they encourage the state government to change it. Scott finds the official stance \"cowardly.\" Already, at least three other universities in Mississippi have taken down the flag, along with the cities of Greenwood and Oxford. Jackson, the state capital, is expected to follow soon. Allen Coon seconded the concern: \"It's a nonbinding resolution ... the senior leadership of the university has the opportunity to listen to our voices, but we've been receiving indications that they may not necessarily take the flag down. ... We may have to do more.\"\n\nEducation is a two-way street. The chancellor of the University of Mississippi should learn from his students: take the flag down now.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

The student government at the University of Mississippi will vote today on whether to seek removal of the state flag from campus grounds. The flag features the Confederate battle symbol in its upper left corner-the only state flag in the country that continues to use the design. It's the latest Confederate symbol to be targeted for removal from a public space since a white supremacist killed nine African-American worshipers in Charleston, South Carolina, four months ago. Alabama and South Carolina have already taken down the Confederate flag on capitol grounds. Removing the flag would be particularly significant for the University of Mississippi, where in 1962 white students rioted over the registration of African-American student James Meredith, an incident that became a flashpoint in the civil rights struggle. Allen Coon, president of the University of Mississippi College Democrats, and Dominique Scott, secretary of the university's chapter of the NAACP , discuss the student-led effort to remove the flag from campus grounds.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : College students in Mississippi are confronting the national legacy of racism and slavery in a new battle over the display of Confederate symbols. The student government at the University of Mississippi will vote today on whether to seek removal of the state flag from campus grounds. The flag features the Confederate battle symbol in its upper left corner, the only state flag in the country that continues to use the Confederate battle flag in its design. It's the latest Confederate symbol to be targeted for removal from a public space since a white supremacist killed nine African-American worshipers in Charleston, South Carolina, four months ago. Alabama and South Carolina have already taken down the Confederate flag on capitol grounds.\n\nOn Friday, a crowd of several hundred people gathered beneath the University of Mississippi campus flagpole to make their case for removal.\n\nSTUDENT PROTESTER : ... to discuss the Confederate flag and the way that it impedes upon people's personal belonging here at the University of Mississippi. We think that this symbol detracts from the purpose of inclusion that this university has adopted.\n\nASB !\n\nPROTESTERS : Take it down!\n\nSTUDENT PROTESTER : What do we want?\n\nPROTESTERS : Justice!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The students' rally attracted a counterdemonstration from white supremacist groups who carried the Confederate flag and shouted racist slogans. If the flag is removed, the University of Mississippi would join three other state schools who do not display it. The towns of Oxford and Greenwood recently voted to remove the flag from public grounds, and a similar effort is underway in Jackson. But it would be particularly significant for the University of Mississippi, a school with a deep-rooted history of white supremacy. It was there in 1962 that white students rioted over the registration of African-American student James Meredith, an incident that became a flashpoint in the civil rights struggle. He would be the first African-American student to integrate the University of Mississippi.\n\nFor more, we're joined by two students. Allen Coon is president of the University of Mississippi College Democrats. As a senator in the university's student government, he has introduced the proposal to take down the Mississippi state flag from campus. And Dominique Scott is an undergraduate in sociology and African-American studies at the University of Mississippi, the secretary of the university's chapter of the NAACP and a regional organizer for Students Against Social Injustice.\n\nWe welcome you both to Democracy Now! as you join us from your campus at the University of Mississippi in Oxford, Mississippi. Dominique Scott, let's start with you. Why is this vote important today? And how did it come about?\n\nDOMINIQUE SCOTT : Well, this vote is really important today because it's going to essentially put pressure on our senior leadership, as well as just the city as a whole-as the whole city, sorry-showing that students are really rallying together and that we want the flag taken down and that we want to institutionalize inclusion here at the university.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Allen Coon, you introduced this bill. It's going to be voted on not by the whole student body-right?-but by the student government. Explain exactly how you introduced this.\n\nALLEN COON : Well, you know, after the tragic events in Charleston, there's been this national movement to address Confederate iconography. You know, our campus is steeped in symbols of the Confederacy and symbols of white supremacy. And I felt we ought to utilize this momentum to address these symbols. So, in late September, I contacted my allies in the NAACP on campus, and we decided to form a coalition and challenge ASB to take a stand. So many-so many universities across the state had released statements. You know, the student body at Mississippi State University actually released a statement challenging the state flag, and yet our student government had done nothing up until that point. So we wanted to show the world that we are prepared to take steps forward and create a positive, progressive change on our campus.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what's your assessment? Do you have the votes?\n\nALLEN COON : We feel very confident that this resolution will pass tonight.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Dominique Scott, a lot of people refer to the University of Mississippi as \"Ole Miss.\" You don't. Why?\n\nDOMINIQUE SCOTT : I avoid using the term \"Ole Miss\" at all times, my friends and I. The term \"Ole Miss\" is definitely steeped in a history of racial oppression. Historically, the term \"Ole Miss\" is a term that slaves used to refer to the mistresses and-or matriarchs of their plantations. And so, when the school decided-was deciding on what they would nickname this school, one woman was quoted saying that \"Ole Miss\" was what old \"darkies\" used to refer to the mistress of their plantations as. And when the vote was passed to use the term \"Ole Miss,\" the runner-up was \"Ole Massa.\" And so, definitely the term is steeped within a history of white supremacy and racial oppression, so I refuse to refer to the institution from-of my institution of learning as what my ancestors used to refer to their oppressors as.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Dominique, can you talk about what happened around the statue of James Meredith that is on campus, the first African American to integrate University of Mississippi, what happened last year?\n\nDOMINIQUE SCOTT : Yes, ma'am. In 2013, three individuals placed a noose around the neck of James Meredith-of the James Meredith statue with the old Georgia state flag. And they shouted racial slurs and \"white power,\" in a way to intimidate black students on campus and once again perpetuate that culture of white supremacy and racial oppression.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Allen Coon, what do you say to those who talk about the flag representing heritage on campus?\n\nALLEN COON : I agree, it does represent a heritage. It represents a heritage of hate. It represents a heritage of white supremacy. It represents a heritage that this university has, in which this university-university actively oppressed people of color attempting to receive an education, to-you know, their attempting to acquire personal growth at this university. And it continues today. So we're attempting to create a more inclusive environment. We're trying to create a safe, tolerant academic space for all students.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And so, what exactly happens today? What will take place? And what does the vote mean?\n\nALLEN COON : So, tonight we have a Senate meeting at 7:00 p.m. We will be discussing, debating this resolution. Hopefully, it will be voted upon. There's 49 senators. We need a simple majority of 25 to pass this resolution. And it's a nonbinding resolution, so when it passes, the senior leadership of the university has the opportunity to listen to our voices, but we've been receiving indications that they may not necessarily take the flag down when we pass this resolution. We may have to do more. And it's disappointing to know that our voices aren't enough, that our actions aren't enough to bring down the symbol of oppression on our campus.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I just want to turn to Danny Blanton, director of public relations for the University of Mississippi. He said, quote, \"We commend our students for using the democratic process to engage in debate over civic issues. As a state institution we fly the flags representing our state and nation. However, as a university committed to fostering a welcoming and inclusive campus for all students, we continue to join other leaders in Mississippi to encourage our government to change the state flag.\" As we wrap up, Dominique Scott, what about that? You take down the flag, but it's still the flag of Mississippi. In that upper left, the Confederate flag is very prominent. What is being done to change the flag of Mississippi?\n\nDOMINIQUE SCOTT : I believe that there have been efforts and that there is conversations within Mississippi government to change the state flag. But regarding that statement from that individual, I would definitely say that the students are very upset that our senior leadership is not paying attention to the voices of the students. I honestly find that statement quite cowardly, that the-that senior leadership will not institutionalize inclusion. We had a meeting with the vice chancellor, who told us that the primary reason behind them not changing the flag was funding, and that they received threats from alumni and from the state government that they would have funding taken away from the school if they remove the flag. And so, I find it extremely, honestly, disturbing that we would not be able to fully fund the educations of our students here simply because the institution wants to institutionalize inclusion and detract and separate itself from symbols of white supremacy and symbols of racial oppression. And so I find that statement quite cowardly, and I really want to challenge my senior leadership to definitely be on the right side of history and be on the right side of what is right.\n\nAnd, you know, essentially, to me, statements like that, that they are listening, that they hear the students, but, \"Oh, well, you know, there's nothing we can do about it, we're a state institution,\" that really shows me what side the university is on, that it's on the side of those Ku Klux Klan protesters that came, that it's on the side of the League of the South, that it will not stand with students who want justice. And so, I would definitely say it's really disconcerting and very disturbing being a student here, knowing that my institution, from which I receive an education, isn't willing to stand with its black students and with other students that want justice.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But, Allen Coon, if you do vote to take it down, couldn't this put the university in a very uncomfortable position, considering other universities, at Mississippi state universities, have taken the flag down?\n\nALLEN COON : Yes, ma'am, and that's definitely the intention. We want to put pressure on our senior leadership. We want this to come down. We want our voices to be heard. And it's time that we take down this symbol of oppression from our campus.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to thank you both for being with us. Of course, we'll continue to follow this story, and we'll report on headlines tomorrow what happened with your student government vote. Allen Coon, president of the University of Mississippi College Democrats, and Dominique Scott, secretary of the university's chapter of the NAACP , a member of Students Against Social Injustice.\n\nThis is Democracy Now! When we come back, there's a question about whether Joe Biden will run for president. It's been lingering for quite a long time. What is Joe Biden's record? Stay with us.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Charles Cabbage and Coby Smith were working with Dr. King to organize the march in Memphis in support of the sanitation workers. [includes rush transcript]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Yes, we are broadcasting today from Memphis, Tennessee. Dr. Martin Luther King Day is a federal holiday today. He was born January 15, 1929, murdered on April 4th, 1968. Had he lived, he would have been 78 years old today.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Dr. King focused his challenge on legalized racial discrimination in the South, where police dogs and bullwhips and cattle prods were used against Southern blacks seeking the right to vote or to eat at a public lunch counter. After passage of the Civil Rights Act of '64 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Dr. King began challenging the nation's fundamental priorities. By 1967, he had come out against the war and for the poor, giving major addresses opposing the Vietnam War and organizing a major Poor People's March to take place in Washington, D.C.\n\nIn March of '68, Dr. King came here to Memphis to support striking African-American sanitation workers who were demanding better working conditions and facing massive resistance from white city officials. Days before he was to lead a march in Memphis, Dr. King was assassinated.\n\nWell, joining me today are three guests who were all active in Memphis at the time. Taylor Rogers was a sanitation worker. He and 1,300 of his fellow workers launched the strike in 1968. Charles Cabbage and Coby Smith were community organizers in Memphis and led a local black power group called the Invaders. Cabbage and Smith were working with Dr. King to organize the march in Memphis in support of the sanitation workers. We welcome you all to Democracy Now! It's wonderful to have you with us.\n\nI want to start with Taylor Rogers. Talk about the struggle you were engaged in, in 1968, that Dr. King was in Memphis to support the sanitation workers' union.\n\nTAYLOR ROGERS : Back in 1968, 1,300 sanitation workers, led by T.O. Jones, the late T.O. Jones - we decided that we were tired going, we weren't going to take no more. We were tired of being mistreated, overworked and underpaid. We decided that we were just going to stand up and be men and do something about our condition. And that's what we did. We stood up, and we told Henry Loeb in the city of Memphis that \"I am a man.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Henry Loeb was the mayor at the time.\n\nTAYLOR ROGERS : Henry Loeb was the mayor.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"I am a man.\"\n\nTAYLOR ROGERS : \"I am a man.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That is the poster that has become so famous all over the world. You all carried this poster?\n\nTAYLOR ROGERS : Right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : How did Dr. King end up joining you in this struggle to ratify your union contract?\n\nTAYLOR ROGERS : Through the ministers. I think Reverend Lawson got in contact with Dr. King and asked him come to Memphis. And I think everybody was against him - his staff and everybody was against him coming to Memphis, but he decided that poor people in Memphis - the garbage men, the people on the bottom of the ladder - needed his support, and he stopped everything to come to Memphis to see about us. And I think that makes him one of the greatest leaders we've ever had.\n\nCOBY SMITH : Amen.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Coby Smith, you were opposed to Dr. King coming to Memphis. Is that fair to say?\n\nCOBY SMITH : No, that's not fair. In fact, a lot is made of that, some remarks that I made about organizing, which I had learned from Dr. King and from Stokely Carmichael in 1966, as a matter of fact, and over the time that I had known him, his principle for organizing was to, first of all, know the people and the turf. And that situation had been misrepresented to him by people around those who had invited him to come. There was a lot of conflict in the community about Dr. King coming, but it was not from us; it was from more middle class and affluent people who had something to lose. They were, in effect, superintendents in the plantation, and they were supposed to oversee the activities of all black people. When they could not control us as young men, and when they could not control the sanitation workers themselves, they would become adamant about handling it their way.\n\nThere was a move afoot to get the leaders of the sanitation - the support, the leading supporters of the sanitation workers' strike to have the sanitation workers in the strike, and they were opposed - they were the ones who were really opposed to Dr. King coming. They didn't want to rock the boat anymore. They didn't want any more public support against the city and the administration with its policy of not supporting the sanitation workers.\n\nIf you will review the record, you'll find out that the difference between the city's offer and what the sanitation workers wanted was only 10 cents. So we weren't the ones who were opposed to him coming. We were opposed to having the terms dictated to us about how to act and how to respond. We were traditional organizers, for the most part - young and foolish, perhaps, arrogant and obnoxious, in many respects. We just didn't look the part that they wanted us to look. None of us were ministers. So we didn't fit into the strategic mold that they wanted for SCLC leadership or for staff organizers.\n\nWe were, in effect, mostly young men who had resisted the war. Some were veterans who had been to Vietnam. And for the most part, we were the underprivileged youngsters who were talking simply about being recognized as men ourselves. In fact, we had spent over a year organizing in Memphis, and we hoped that some of our attempts to organize encouraged the sanitation workers to go ahead and take the stand that they took. We welcomed this kind of challenge to start speaking up. We were at that time mostly young black power advocates who thought that the numbers and the energy and the synergism of the whole community, the whole South - the whole country, for that matter - dictated that we step up and speak up.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Charles Cabbage, you were negotiating with Dr. King hours before he was killed at the Lorraine Motel.\n\nCHARLES CABBAGE : Yes, I was.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about that time that you were speaking directly with him. What were you negotiating over?\n\nCHARLES CABBAGE : Well, our major concern at that particular point was to get what we called our community unification program funded. And since, you know, the majority of the conversations that we had, the major topics that were covered in the meetings was, you know, how could we get some of what we wanted and give them what they wanted. And at the time, this was after the first riot. And they wanted very badly -- I mean, everything was on the line. So it was important for them to be able to pull off a demonstration, a march, or what have you, without any violence or anything like that occurring. And I thought, you know, it was kind of ridiculous. You know, I mean, no individual or group of individuals can actually prevent this from happening. But we would, you know, if they would assist us in getting our program funded, then we would be willing to act as marshals in the demonstration that was to come about, and --\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, you're saying if the SCLC , the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, would give money to the Invaders, your group, you would engage in nonviolence and act as marshals for the march?\n\nCHARLES CABBAGE : Yeah. But, you know, let me make it clear that we were not asking SCLC to be the total source of funding, because we were seeking funding from many other different sources. It just happened that, you know, when Dr. King came to town, we were in the midst of other negotiations with other parties, just trying to get funded. So all of it just came together. And in the process of it coming together with nobody having a real script to work off of, you know, things kind of got a little bit confused.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Were those negotiations heated with Dr. King? Can you describe the scene? What room were you in at the Lorraine Motel?\n\nCHARLES CABBAGE : We were downstairs in the dining room, you know, where they usually would hold lunch and what have you. And I wouldn't go so far as to say the discussions were heated. There were some that had differences of opinions, but, you know, I'm proud to say that, you know, we actually had some very good meetings, and we got a chance to deal with some things that had not been openly discussed by SCLC leadership with members of the outside community, meaning those people who were not necessarily involved with the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, because at that particular time very few people had contact with Dr. King. Reverend Lawson was one of those people, which gave him such an outstanding role, you understand, in putting this together, bringing Dr. King here, trying to pull off the demonstrations, as they were.\n\nSo, you know, the conversation that we had, at first it was difficult, because we had to feel each other out. And this was an awkward situation. Here was a man whose entire soul was wrapped into the nonviolent movement. And here are a group of about 2,000 strong, at that time, and here are a group of young men that nobody really knew anything about, because we were not seeking publicity, you know, none of that. You know, we were busy trying to do some of the things that we felt was necessary to bring the black community up to where it should be. So it was almost like a built-in collision, you understand, from the onset, but we managed to get around that. And when it ended, you know, we all left on a cordial note.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Charles Cabbage and Coby Smith. They were with a group called the Invaders, a young black power group, black militant group in Memphis, that were working with the sanitation workers to organize, demanding a union contract from the city. We're also talking to Taylor Rogers. He was one of the more than 1,200 sanitation workers who were demanding that contract, who Dr. King came to march with. We'll be back with all of them in a minute.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're talking to Taylor Rogers, sanitation worker who became head of the sanitation workers a few years after Dr. King was assassinated; Charles Cabbage and Coby Smith, two Memphis community activists with the group called the Invaders. Charles Cabbage was negotiating with Dr. King hours before Dr. King's death at the Lorraine Motel.\n\nTaylor Rogers, I wanted to ask about what was just referred to, the march that got aborted on March 28th. What happened then? What caused Dr. King to have to leave Memphis and then come back?\n\nTAYLOR ROGERS : Well, the march got violent. Once we turned off of Beale Street on Main Street, they started breaking windows and - but it wasn't the marchers. It wasn't the workers. We was nonviolent, as Dr. King wanted us to be. We don't know what happened or why it started. But I believe some outside group or someone started it to discredit Dr. King, because he was planning to march on Washington, and they really wanted to stop that. So I think a lot of that was to discredit Dr. King, so that he would turn back and not talk about going to Washington.\n\nWell, when the violence broke out, Reverend Lawson, Reverend Jackson and a lot of other ministers got Dr. King out of here. He didn't want to go, but they insisted on him leaving, because, you know, they said to him, \"The police are after us, not them.\" So, they took Dr. King on out. And that's when Dr. King said he had to come back to Memphis.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : There were those on both sides who criticized King for going to a fancy white hotel out of the violence, when people were being maced. When he ultimately - so he was hit on both sides, by the right-wing press and by militants who were saying, \"Why did he end up going to that hotel?\" So when he came back to Memphis, he ended up at the Lorraine Motel, which had very little protection.\n\nTAYLOR ROGERS : Well, that's when Cabbage and them got involved, talked with Dr. King, and Dr. King had agreed that they would work together to keep down the violence. And so, Dr. King had agreed with Coby and them that that's what they would do. But that march never happened. The next day, Dr. King got assassinated.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You were at the speech at the Mason Temple. What was that like?\n\nTAYLOR ROGERS : Well, it was - I really can't explain it. It was just something else, you know. The place was full, wall to wall with people, storming and raining outside. You could tell by the sound of his voice and the way that he was speaking and the look on his - the expression on his face, that he knew something was going to happen. He didn't know when or where. He didn't know whether it was going to be in Memphis or on the way to Washington. But I could feel that, from the way he talked, he felt like something was going to happen, because he said, you know, \"I'm not fearing any man. Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.\" You know, and he went on, and people was crying and everything, and that was, you know, just a great speech. And so, that's why I feel that he was one of the greatest leaders we'll ever have.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And him being with sanitation workers in Memphis, Tennessee, that's not often remembered when people talk about Dr. King. What did it mean to you?\n\nTAYLOR ROGERS : It meant a lot to me to know that somebody was thinking about us, somebody like - powerful like Dr. King. He stopped everything that he was doing. He stopped his march on Washington and everything to come to Memphis and see about the people on the bottom of the ladder, the sanitation workers. And I'll always hold it in my heart that Dr. King was one of the greatest leaders we'll ever have.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Coby Smith, some were very angry afterwards and felt - I mean, people were outraged afterwards all over the world. But some accused the Invaders of being provocateurs. What was your response to that?\n\nCOBY SMITH : You know, it's very - it's interesting that we're talking about this at a time that's very much like those times were. We've got a president who's talking about sending more troops to Iraq. We've got a community - the people of America want to stop it. They want to right the wrongs and the injustices and just stand up and let the world know what we stand for.\n\nWe were in that same position then. You know, people did not want to look at what equality really represented in a Southern city like Memphis. It wasn't the police necessarily beating everybody over the head and turning dogs loose, but it was doing the same thing with sanitation workers, because they were living the life - they weren't living - the absolute worst life in this community. But here were men who worked all day every day who could have still qualified for welfare, and they were willing to put everything on the line, to give up their jobs. And they didn't have much of jobs to start with.\n\nBut in this community, the city was trying to enforce a situation, using government to stand on the backs of black people. We were not getting - we didn't get the same proportion of taxes that we put in spent in our community. We didn't have - it was only in 1967 that the first black went on the civil service rolls. So we didn't have - if you were in Memphis then and you were black, you couldn't have a job as a salesman or a sales manager or as middle management somewhere. You couldn't be anybody's supervisor. You had to be a yard man; your wife had to be a maid. If you had a job with the city, you were lucky to be working for public works or the utility company, digging the holes in the ground.\n\nI think a lot of people don't understand what actually was occurring. The life of people, the regular people, was almost irrelevant to anybody in government. You didn't get a chance to have a say. You couldn't - occasionally they would recognize a preacher or somebody with a lot of money, and there were people with lots of money around. And they wanted to dictate the terms. So it wasn't that the conflict was between those of us who felt like we were active -- in fact, when Charles and I agreed to come back to Memphis, I had just left the Meredith March in Mississippi, where I was with Dr. King almost daily. And what we were talking about doing then was coming here to organize, because we thought that this city had the greatest potential for putting together a black united front, having --\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Explain, when you say marching with Meredith, we don't have a media that goes into history very much.\n\nCOBY SMITH : In 1966, James Meredith who was the first black to attend the University of Mississippi, \"Ole Miss,\" right down the road - that's only 80 miles down the road - Meredith was trying to have a march for freedom in Mississippi to demonstrate that you didn't have to fear for your life if you were a black man in Mississippi. Before he got twelve miles out of Memphis, he was shot down with a shotgun. And leaders from all over the world came to Memphis to take up where Meredith had left off. Among those leaders was Martin King.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This was called the March Against Fear.\n\nCOBY SMITH : Right. Well, we called it the Meredith March in Mississippi, but many people I see referring to it as the March Against Fear. And it was very interesting, because what we did was, we went down the highways, the back roads and everything, and let people know, went and told them, \"The march is coming. Y'all come on out and join us.\" We wanted to let people know that we're about to stand up for the rights of people.\n\nYou know, this is not so long after Emmett Till was killed, after Schwerner, Goodman and Chaney were killed, after [inaudible]. The South was a pit of terror. You had to be afraid every day, for simply wearing our hair a little longer than I can wear mine now, and saying the words \"black power\" or having a medallion on your neck, you could be killed. You could be arrested or detained. In fact, one of the first episodes that happened for us was that Charles and John Smith, who was one of our early organizers, a veteran from Vietnam, had gone to a service station to get some gas. And the service station attendant stole their gas cap. And they complained and called the police, and when they did that, the police arrested them and said we had started a riot, that the black power boys were in town.\n\nWe had gone to the city. When we first got back, I came here to organize for Vietnam Summer, which was an antiwar group, and we eventually ended up working for the war on poverty, trying to help organize poor people in the projects and in some really bad-off little communities to aspire to something quite different. And we were working with the people when all of this started to occur. But nobody wanted to see us working there. In fact, the political leaders came out and demanded that our jobs be taken because we had belonged to SNCC , the Southern -\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The Southern Nonviolence Coordinating Committee.\n\nCOBY SMITH : - Southern Nonviolence Coordinating Committee and to other organizations. What they wanted was to be in charge of everything. They didn't want the sanitation workers to say anything. They didn't want us to say anything to anybody. As a matter of fact, they had picked out who the leadership would be, and we weren't it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Charles Cabbage, were you concerned about your group, the Invaders, being used by provocateurs to discredit Dr. King?\n\nCHARLES CABBAGE : Absolutely. Absolutely. But, you know, in looking back on this, you know, it seemed as if we all got 20-20 vision here. But the truth of the matter is, when you talk about the march that broke up, we got to talk about COINTELPRO . This is the program that the government began to initiate to try to destroy.\n\nCOBY SMITH : Much like the program you talked about with looking into bank records. They investigated us all the time. One night, Charles and the guys called up from a club over on South Parkway. They had found Army intelligence officers over there, who had tried to mix in with them, and they had found the guy's ID and identified them as Army intelligence. So we knew that there were people in town, and we had heard - and incidentally when you were talking to Taylor about the Mountain Top speech - \"I've been to the mountain top\" - we had been hearing the comments from community - our job, our business was to talk to people in the streets. We had heard all kinds of threats against his life, against the lives of everybody around.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Charles Cabbage, you were driving away from the Lorraine Motel when Dr. King was killed.\n\nCHARLES CABBAGE : Yes. That's the understanding that I have of it. But, you know, like, nobody really thought that they would assassinate Dr. King, a man that stood for nonviolence. The man was a minister. You understand, his whole being was one of peace and harmony. So when the shot broke out, we were loading up our car. And there's another long story that goes with that, but I am going to try to skip to the part that you probably want to deal with. And you know, when we were getting ready to pull off, I heard the shot. Well, we all, you know, like, hit the floor for cover. No other shots came. So I just jumped up and raised up and looked around, then pulled off.\n\nBy the time I left from the hotel and got to my home, you know, my mother come running out of the house, you know, I mean, crying and everything. And she said, \"Dr. King got shot.\" Well, see, her reaction was one of tears and sadness and sorrow. Mine was, how long is it going to get them to get here, because, you know, the way that I could see that COINTELPRO was operating here inside of Memphis itself, now that I have done a little research and looked back, was that they wanted to create as much disruption as they could. And they did a pretty good job of it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're going to leave it there. I want to thank you, Taylor Rogers, for being with us, sanitation worker who marched along Dr. Martin Luther King; Charles Cabbage and Coby Smith, both with the black power group, the Invaders, who also marched with King.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Martin Luther King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee. He was just 39 years old. Today we look back at the last three years of King's life, beginning after President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Despite passage of the monumental legislation, King set his eyes on new battles by launching a Poor People's Campaign and campaigning to stop the Vietnam War. King's decision to publicly oppose the war isolated him from many of his closest supporters. We feature clips from a new HBO documentary about King's last years, titled \"King in the Wilderness,\" and speak with Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Taylor Branch, who wrote the \"America in the King Years\" trilogy and is featured in the film, as well as the film's director Peter Kunhardt and writer Trey Ellis.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're broadcasting from the Sundance Film Festival here in Park City, Utah. Fifty years ago this April, the Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee. He was just 39 years old. Today we look back at the last three years of King's life, beginning after President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Despite passage of the monumental legislation, King set his eyes on new battles by launching a Poor People's Campaign and campaigning to stop the Vietnam War. King's decision to publicly oppose the war isolated him from many of his closest supporters.\n\nWell, a new HBO documentary about King's last years has just premiered here at the Sundance Film Festival. It's titled King in the Wilderness . It will air on HBO in April. I had a chance to sit down this week with the film's director, longtime documentary filmmaker Peter Kunhardt, as well as two of the film's executive producers, the writer Trey Ellis and Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Taylor Branch, who wrote the America in the King Years trilogy. I began by asking Peter Kunhardt about why he named the film King in the Wilderness .\n\nPETER KUNHARDT : We came up with the title of King in the Wilderness late in the editing of the film. And it was based on the fact that we were overcome by the fact that King was struggling in every possible way during those last three years, trying to find his way as he branched away, or in addition to his work on racism, to work on poverty, to work on moving his movement north to the Northern cities and to oppose the war in Vietnam. And as he did this, his support, that he had enjoyed all during the early part of the civil rights movement, vanished. And he was left with no roadmap. He felt his friends abandoned him. And he was alone and struggling and trying to find his way. And we just felt that the title captured that kind of loneliness that he experienced.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Trey Ellis, you did a lot of the interviews with these legendary figures, the contemporaries of Dr. Martin Luther King. Talk about the people that you spoke to and this particular period in his life. Of course, Dr. King is a legend, an icon, and people can't imagine that there was this period where he did feel so alone, felt so vilified.\n\nTREY ELLIS : Yeah. I mean, to me, I want to say first, it was such an amazing experience to talk to these people that were all of my parents' generation and to talk to Xernona Clayton, who opens our film and said Martin died of a broken heart. It's really heartbreaking. And then, when I talked to Diane Nash, and she said she happened to know my parents from-at Howard University, and I didn't know that until I interviewed her. So, it really-my journey of interviewing all these legends was really transformative for me. These are all people that I knew just from books.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about who Diane Nash was.\n\nTREY ELLIS : Right. So, Diane Nash is really one of-I think of her as Wonder Woman a little bit, like the-she's a legendary civil rights activist, really responsible-Taylor will know more-but for the march to Selma, the voting rights movement in Alabama, the lunch counter movement in Nashville when she was a student at Fisk. But she was also a mother and had to-you know, she had all the problems of being a woman in the movement and being a legend in the movement, where we know who John Lewis is-he's a congressman and a household name-and Diane Nash should be as famous as him. And hopefully, I think, with-this film might help with that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And Diane Nash's comments about Dr. King and the differences she had with him in those last three years, where she felt the efforts of the civil rights movement should be focused?\n\nTREY ELLIS : Well, she's still-to this day, she's still very fiery. And she says this-the idea of the cult of personality, the idea of us, as the people, sort of ceding our sense of agency to one or two leaders, she's really very much against that. And she speaks pretty eloquently about how we have to find the movement in ourselves, and each of us has to pitch in. And so I think that-and she, being on the ground floor, she knew that there were other people around Dr. King that were also great leaders. And it's sort of easy for us to sort of outsource our activism to people who are more active than us.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Taylor Branch, let's talk about those last three years, where Dr. King is moving north. And he would say, at that time, he was never so afraid as he was in Chicago. I mean, for all that he faced in the South, Chicago-\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -the Northern United States.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Well, within a month of Selma, in 1965, he was saying, \"We have to go north.\" And the staff, including Diane, did not want him to go, did not want to go north. \"We still have work to do in the South.\" That's what she said. But King became more determined. He was reluctant in the early years. He was trying to make the movement climb up. He gets the Nobel Peace Prize. Andy Young said, \"We wanted to have chicken dinners and congratulate ourselves for 20 years.\" He says, \"No, we want to go to Selma.\" As soon as Selma was done, he says, \"We want to go north to show America that the race issue has never-is not, and never has been, purely Southern.\" And the staff didn't want to go.\n\nThen he-all the staff, except for one person, was against his coming out and making the Riverside Church speech against Vietnam. And none of the staff-the film shows how much staff dissension there was on the Poor People's Campaign, and then on Memphis. So, there was a downward pull of King in the last years, where he felt compelled to make a witness on things that he didn't have confidence were going to be big breakthrough moments like \"I Have a Dream\" or the Civil Rights Act of 1965. So, he's in the wilderness, and he's lonely, but he is much more of a leader, almost a possessed leader. \"We have to do this.\" He even made a speech to his staff saying, \"We have to finish. There's a quote in Revelation: 'We have to finish on our principles, even if we have very little left.'\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you take us on the trajectory of the Mississippi March-this is after the Selma to Montgomery March, this is James Meredith-and why King decided to join this, through the whole challenge by Stokely Carmichael, who would later become Kwame Ture? Some incredible footage there of them publicly sort of feuding, or it was more a battle of ideas of who should be included in the march. But start with Meredith.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Well, the Meredith March was a watershed in the public perception of the movement. It was the birth of Black Power. Stokely had just taken over the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee from John Lewis. Lewis was ousted because he was too much like Martin Luther King, too steadfast in nonviolence. And when Meredith got shot, Dr. King and Stokely were thrown together in continuing his march through Mississippi.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And explain what happened to James Meredith.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : James Meredith was-had his own solo March Against Fear to try to inspire black Mississippians, who were afraid to go to the courthouse to register to vote after the Voting Rights Act. And he said, \"If I can march through Mississippi by myself, then you shouldn't be afraid to register.\" But on the third day out, he was shot by white people who were angry that he was trying to rally black people to vote.\n\nAnd civil rights leaders, many of whom weren't-they weren't consulted about this march, but they felt they had to continue it, because it was so public. And it threw Dr. King together with the new SNCC leader, Stokely. And Stokely said, openly, that he used the fact that all the press came with Dr. King to announce this new doctrine to make the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee not be so much second fiddle. They had always felt Dr. King got all the publicity, and they were spending more time in jail.\n\nAnd he pronounced this new doctrine: \"We want Black Power!\" And it mesmerized the media. To this day, I mean, it's more popular. There are a lot of nonviolent movement veterans who are embarrassed that they were nonviolent, because Black Power became so popular. And Dr. King would argue with Stokely, marching down the road, and there are scenes of that. But then, at night, they would argue.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : With a reporter between them-\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : With a reporter between them.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -holding a mic, going back and forth.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And also the inclusion of non-black activists in the movement.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Yes, but-well, yes, they wanted-the march was very integrated, the March Against Fear. Remember, it's 220-something miles. It went on for almost a month. It's bigger than the Selma March.\n\nBut its significance is that it marks this big transformation between violence and nonviolence, or the opening of a debate. And Stokely would say, \"How come we have to be nonviolent? How come America admires nonviolence only in black people, but otherwise they admire John Wayne, you know? And why do we have to do that?\" And Dr. King would say, \"We don't. I'm not telling you you have to do it. What I'm telling you is that nonviolence is a leadership doctrine. It's ahead of America. If we become violent, it's not that we're stepping up to be like John Wayne. It's that we're stepping back from nonviolence to try to move the country toward reconciliation, toward votes, nonviolence, toward spirituality.\"\n\nSo they had this big argument about whether the civil rights movement needed to be nonviolent, whether it was-whether it was effective, whether it was principled, and what kind of leadership strategy it was. And that debate dominated the last couple years of Dr. King's life.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Historian Taylor Branch, who won the Pulitzer Prize for his book Parting the Waters: America in the King Years , part of his remarkable trilogy, talking about the new HBO documentary King in the Wilderness , which is directed by Peter Kunhardt. We'll be back with them and the film's executive producer, Trey Ellis, in a minute, as they talk about King moving to Chicago in 1966 and much more.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"Programmed to Perceive,\" Talia Keys, here on Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, as we broadcast from the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah. We're broadcasting from Park City TV.\n\nWe return now to our coverage of the documentary King in the Wilderness , that just premiered here at Sundance. It's about Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s last three years. I spoke this week with filmmaker Peter Kunhardt, as well as two of the film's executive producers, the writer Trey Ellis, who did many of the interviews, and the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Taylor Branch, who wrote the America in the King Years trilogy. We return to our conversation in a moment, but first an excerpt from the documentary, which is playing right here at Sundance and debuts on HBO in April. This is Harry Belafonte speaking, a dear friend and close confidant of Dr. Martin Luther King.\n\nHARRY BELAFONTE : I do not know that everything that Martin said or did, he was quite prepared for. He had felt that, in many ways, dealing with the South was a more predictable outcome, because in the North the racial hypocrisy was very subverted. It gave the appearance of being not like the South: The South was the center of all evil, and the North was a place of a higher experience. And Dr. King said, no, that's not the case.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's Harry Belafonte, one of the closest confidants of Dr. Martin Luther in the last 10 years of Dr. King's life, talking about Dr. King moving North. He didn't just march in Chicago. He moved his family to Chicago, as he particularly took on the issue of housing. Taylor Branch, you're a veteran civil rights historian. You won the Pulitzer Prize for Parting the Waters . But you, too, were surprised by some of the footage that you saw in-for King in the Wilderness .\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Yes, I was surprised by-I wrote, but I didn't feel as-I wrote in my book that these thousands of white people would come out and throw bricks. And it was women with pocketbooks, and they'd hit people with pocketbooks, and they'd yell and scream. But to write it is different, based on source material, than to see Nazi signs and people yelling and screaming in Chicago. It was a very rough place.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, the swastikas, the presence of these swastikas.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Yes. There were lots of swastikas and lots of young people involved. Now, on the other side, Dr. King was trying to experiment with nonviolence in the North, and, in many respects, it was\u0005safe. There are no stories, as there were in Memphis, of nonviolence breaking down on the movement side in Chicago. In fact, a number of gang leaders would come up to Dr. King's apartment and argue with him all night, and a number of gang leaders were in those marches. So, he had the Blackstone Rangers and a number of them in these marches. In some respects, it was the far reaches of the laboratory of who could be nonviolent and whether or not it could work.\n\nBut what you get out of the film is you see the other side of it. Dr. King said, \"We have to show America that there's a race problem in the North, because you'd be surprised how many millions of people think that there is no more race problem since we passed the civil rights bill.\" And in that one little task, they succeeded admirably. Nobody really argued that there was no racism in the North, after Chicago.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Wasn't he hit by a brick in Chicago?\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : He was hit by a brick on that same march, and once or twice by a rock. Of course, he was struck many times, stabbed. You know, violence had always been close to him his whole life, before Memphis. That wasn't new. But I think, in Chicago, even what Andy said-down in the South, you would have a couple hundred Klansmen, you'd be scared. But in Chicago, there were thousands of people, and they were enraged, and you could hear them. It was an angry crowd.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Trey Ellis, let's talk more about the riots in Chicago, the white Nazi swastika-holding protesters who were going after King. Your interviews done as President Trump took office, and we see Charlottesville this summer, with self-proclaimed Nazis and fascists marching in Virginia. Your thoughts, connecting these two, 50 years apart?\n\nTREY ELLIS : Yeah, it was quite moving and, in some ways, depressing to see how things-how little movement had been-how segregated still much of the country is, and to hear Diane Nash and the other Chicago people talk about the issues of Chicago and the-I mean, I remember, as a kid, talking about, you know, the Nazis marching in Skokie, Illinois, as well. This kind of Northern-that Northern racism really, while I was interviewing these subjects, was really, on the eve of the Trump-you know, Trump had just been inaugurated when I started these interviews-was certainly reverberating in my head in ways that were-that was troubling.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The inclusion of women, who you don't often see, in this documentary, when talking about the civil rights movement, can you talk about some of the figures?\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : It wasn't \"We need to include some women.\" It's \"Who are the most important people alive, at various stages,\" and they were women. I mean, Dorothy Cotton trained the young black children who did the children's marches in Birmingham. That was her job. She was a singer. And that was one of the great, watershed moments in the civil rights era, when the dogs and the fire hoses came out. She did that. And Diane Nash, who helped her, then took that reaction and said, \"We have to do something to answer these kids that got bombed.\" And she designed-and there's a document-what became the blueprint for the Selma-for the Selma voting rights.\n\nSo, these are not just women thrown in there. These are women who were central, but they have been not recognized in their true proportions. Joan Baez, very, very significant in the huge arguments within the movement about whether Vietnam or poverty. Marian Edelman, it was her idea, you know, mediating between Dr. King and Bobby Kennedy, to move into the Poor People's Campaign. So, these are highly significant women, that I think get their due in this film, and you can feel their significance in the interviews.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about the relationship between LBJ and Dr. King-really significant-and especially LBJ's alarm, President Johnson's alarm, as riots are breaking out, uprising, rebellions. Who does he call? He calls Dr. King. And so interesting that you have the audio recordings. What-did you get them from FBI surveillance tapes?\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : No, those are presidential recordings. So, you have LBJ talking to J. Edgar Hoover, who tells him he's a faker, Dr. King is a faker, \"He's not for you, he's against you on Vietnam,\" trying to undercut him. You know, just blanket hostility, and you can hear it. But also LBJ talking to Martin Luther King, you know, saying, \"This is terrible. What can we do?\"\n\nAnd it was really sad, because in one of the conversations-it was too long to fit in the film-LBJ said, \"What we did in Selma, with you mobilizing the public and me being able to give that speech, that's the way democracy is supposed to work. You know, energized citizen and responsive government, that's about the best thing that ever happened.\" And in that same conversation, they're talking about Vietnam. And we have that in the film, where you can feel Vietnam pulling them apart and Johnson just being-he said, \"My legacy is civil rights, but that's being threatened by these riots. And I've got this war, and my ally, Dr. King, is turning against me on the war.\" So, there's a lot-a lot of passion in those conversations.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, let's talk about Vietnam and how King ended up making this Riverside address, speech, \"Why I Oppose the War in Vietnam.\" I wanted to turn to a clip of Vince Harding, before he died. We had a long conversation with him about the speech and his conversations with Dr. King. The man, Vince Harding, who helped to craft that speech, this is what he had to say.\n\nDR. VINCENT HARDING : Martin was, towards the end of his life, you may remember, by the last years of his life, he was saying that America had to deal with three-what he called triple evils: the evil of racism, the evil of materialism and the evils of militarism. And he saw those three very much connected to each other. ...\n\nIn a way, Amy, as long as Martin and I knew each other, we were talking about the kinds of things that were involved in that speech. We were talking about the tremendous damage that war does to those who participate in it, to those who are the victims of it, to those who lose tremendous possibilities in their own lives because of it. And we were always talking about what it might mean to try to find creative, nonviolent alternatives to the terrible old-fashionedness of war as a way of solving problems.\n\nAnd then, when Vietnam began to develop on all of our screens in the 1960s, we talked a great deal about our country's role and a great deal about the role of those of us who were believers in the way of nonviolent struggle for change and what our responsibility was both as nonviolent believers and as followers of the teachings and the ways of Jesus the Christ. So when Martin was clear with himself that he had to make a major public address on this subject, as fully as he could possibly do it, he was looking for a setting in which that could be done on the grounds of his religious stance particularly. And when clergy and laity against the war in Vietnam invited him to do that at Riverside for the occasion of their gathering in April 1967, it was clear to him that that was the place that he really ought to make the speech or to take the stand in the most public way possible.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Vince Harding, a close ally of Dr. King, who helped to craft that \"Beyond Vietnam\" speech, or \"Why I Oppose the War in Vietnam,\" the speech that Dr. King gave at Riverside Church in New York on April 4th, 1967, a year to the day before Dr. King was assassinated in Memphis. Talk about Vince Harding's role in that speech, Taylor Branch.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Well, Vince Harding was a Mennonite student of nonviolence his whole life, who lived in Atlanta, not far from Dr. King. And when the speech was-when he undertook the speech, for reasons that Trey can explain, it was one of the few that he actually wrote out. He had to have it-a condition of doing this was that they wanted to publicize it and get his views out. They wanted a written version of the speech. Normally-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That Dr. King wrote out.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Yeah. And normally, Dr. King kind of improvised and winged things. He was like a jazz-but he had to have a formal speech. And he called in a number of people, but, principally, Vince Harding did the first draft of the speech to try to get it right, one moment to speak. And the idea was-the staff didn't want him to give the speech, but they said, \"If you're going to do it, do it in a way that at least you don't have-the press will pay attention to it. Don't do it with a lot of 'Hey, hey, LBJ , how many kids,' you know, placards in the background. Don't do it\"-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"How many kids did you kill today?\"\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : \"'How many kids did you kill?' Don't-with anything provocative. Do it in a nice setting,\" turning to Clergy and Laity Concerned and Dick Fernandez. And Trey interviewed Dick Fernandez about how they went in there. But they were trying to make it as palatable as possible and get the world one chance to listen to his comprehensive argument about the history of Vietnam, about the Vietnamese people, about how they viewed our claims that we were fostering this out of concern for their democratic future. And he crafted this comprehensive speech, and nobody listened to it anyway. They said, \"You're a traitor. You shouldn't\"-it was one of the big disappointments in his life. And-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what did King and Vince Harding say?\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Next time he saw him-Vince told me that the next time Dr. King saw him in Atlanta, he said, \"Vince, you got me really in a lot of trouble, and I'm going to blame you and stuff.\" But they survived on gallows humor. And Dr. King was a champion.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Trey, talk more about the significance of this speech. I want to play another clip, this one of Dr. King himself. So many of the phrases he used became so important later.\n\nREV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: I speak as a child of God and brother to the suffering poor of Vietnam. I speak for those whose land is being laid waste, whose homes are being destroyed, whose culture is being subverted. I speak for the poor of America, who are paying the double price of smashed hopes at home and death and corruption in Vietnam. I speak as a citizen of the world, for the world as it stands aghast at the path we have taken. I speak as one who loves America, to the leaders of our own nation: The great initiative in this war is ours; the initiative to stop it must be ours.\n\nAs I have walked among the desperate, rejected and angry young men, I have told them that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems. I have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through nonviolent action. But they ask, and rightly so, \"What about Vietnam?\" And they ask if our own nation wasn't using massive doses of violence to solve its problems, to bring about the changes it wanted. Their questions hit home. And I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, my own government.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that's Dr. King saying that his country, the United States, was the greatest purveyor of violence on Earth. The corporate media, the mainstream media, went after him, from the Times to Time magazine to Life magazine. I have the Life magazine copy still. And they talked about the fact-they said that his speech sounded like a script from Radio Hanoi. They said he had done a disservice to his cause, his country and his people. So, for those young people today who say, \"It was easy for King, because everything he did, everyone idolized,\" he was slammed.\n\nTREY ELLIS : Yeah, it was fascinating for me. We begin, in the documentary, talking about when he sort of nudged into the idea of global politics, talking to Ambassador Goldberg with Andrew Young. And anytime he would try to say anything except for white Southerners shouldn't segregate, he was pilloried. So they really tried their best, as Taylor said, to say, \"How can we make this strong statement as innocuous, as palatable as possible?\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what happens after, a year to the day before he's assassinated, that speech, is what King says.\n\nTREY ELLIS : Yeah, it's just amazing, the coincidence that a year to the day after that speech he's gunned down in Memphis. But the backlash against the speech wasn't only the media or the white community. It was also Roy Wilkins and the NAACP . All the black clergymen were very concerned. And even inside the SCLC , they were very concerned.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The Southern Christian Leadership Conference.\n\nTREY ELLIS : The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which he led, they were concerned. Their money dried up. He had no friends. And that's when Xernona says-Xernona Clayton, his great adviser, who begins our film, says he died of a broken heart. That's really one of those great reasons, that everybody seemed to have turned against him, with his turn against the war.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's writer Trey Ellis, executive producer of the new documentary King in the Wilderness . We'll be back with him, with Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Taylor Branch and the film's director, Peter Kunhardt, in a minute, talking about King's last year alive.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"Why (The King of Love is Dead)\" by Nina Simone. This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman.\n\nKing in the Wilderness . That's the name of a new documentary about the Reverend Martin Luther King's last three years alive. I spoke this week, here at the Sundance Film Festival, with filmmaker Peter Kunhardt, as well as two of the film's executive producers, the writer Trey Ellis and the Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Taylor Branch, who wrote the America in the King Years trilogy. The film premiered here at the Sundance Film Festival. I asked Trey Ellis to talk about King's Poor People Campaign.\n\nTREY ELLIS : Well, so, after the coming out against the war in Vietnam-and he's really at his lowest point. Some people might say, and Andy Young would say, \"You deserve it. If you want to just be-you know, take over Riverside Church and live in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, you know, you deserve it.\" Right? He said, no, he still wanted to fight longer.\n\nAnd the first interview I did was with Marian Wright Edelman. And when she said that-we have her on tape saying, when she came to-when she visited the poor in Mississippi with Bobby Kennedy, and Bobby Kennedy said to her, \"Tell King to bring the poor to Washington,\" which goes to Taylor's point about having the public/private, how governance works best, how King and LBJ could work together-when she brought that message to King, she goes into his office, he's very, very sad. She tells him this idea from Bobby Kennedy and her, and he lights up.\n\nAnd it's really-I think he saw this as like this-and he talks about this march on Washington, this Poor People's Campaign. He really envisioned it as bigger than the \"I Have a Dream\" speech. He figured this as like this would be all Americans-white, black, Hispanic. All poor people would march on Washington, and real big transformative change. And when you see that it's-the plans for that march and what could have been in that march cut short by this assassin's bullet, this murderer's bullet, it's really quite heartbreaking.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Taylor Branch?\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : One reason that he may have lit up so much is this idea of racism, poverty and war, that you mentioned. He called it the \"triple scourge of evil.\" Andy Young mentions it in the film. That was not a new idea for Dr. King. It's the theme of his Nobel Prize lecture, that they are related-racism, poverty and war, the violence of the flesh and violence of the spirit. So, he had done racism. He had done war, in Vietnam. And poverty is equally violent, in his worldview. So, an opportunity to make an explicit witness on the third leg of this, what he called the \"ancient triple scourge\" of racism, poverty and war, I think, was something that he knew he needed to do to make his message complete, because he had been speaking about this, but he hadn't been demonstrating on poverty.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, let's move on to Memphis and this-not the final moment of Memphis, but it was in two parts. And again, we're talking about enormous tension within the SCLC and Dr. King's closest advisers being concerned about King going to Memphis. He had been invited to stand with the sanitation workers as they tried to unionize.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : I will just talk a little bit about the origins of Memphis. The staff-he had-it took, as the film shows, an enormous effort to get the staff behind the Poor People's Campaign. There were a lot of dissension. Some people said, \"If you don't end the Vietnam War, it doesn't matter what we do.\" And other people said, \"We still have segregation in the South and in the North, and we should be on race relations.\" So he finally gets them to going on the Poor People's Campaign and their plans, and then this incident happened in Memphis.\n\nThe strike started because two of the sanitation workers were crushed to death in the back of a cylinder garbage truck, when they were not allowed to seek shelter in rainstorms, because they were all black, and their rules did not allow them to seek shelter in any white neighborhood, because it offended white people. And the only place they could find shelter is in the garbage, with the garbage itself. And a broom fell and hit a lever and compacted them, literally crushed them. That's the origins of \"I Am a Man,\" meaning they picked that slogan because the whole strike was-it was economic, but it was also just essential dignity. They were being crushed like the garbage that they were picking up, and nobody cared.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So they carried these signs that said \"I Am a Man.\"\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : They carried these signs. And the person that was leading the demonstrations, Jim Lawson, was one of Dr. King's old mentors in nonviolence. And he calls him and says, \"Martin, can you come?\" And so, that's where the-Trey did most of the interviews about Memphis, but that's where it was. He said, \"I have to go to Memphis. If we don't answer this-yes, it's a diversion, but it's from Jim Lawson, and if these people don't personify what the Poor People's Campaign is going to be about, nobody does.\" So he once again drags his staff to Memphis as a diversion from Poor People's Campaign.\n\nTREY ELLIS : Yeah, I think it's-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Trey, take it from there.\n\nTREY ELLIS : Well, I think what's really amazing about it, we have this-every time that, you know, when he wanted to go north, when he wanted to go against the war, he was getting this pushback from his staff. And then, now there's such dissent, that they actually-he has a little hunger strike, right? That like he's just-it's the first time that, Andy Young will say, that he can't get through to them. And he just has to do something really extreme, so they will-they will listen to him.\n\nTo me, an extraordinary moment is like when he goes to the first Memphis March, and it goes badly, and some people, for some-it's unclear what all their reasons were, but some people in the back are taking those \"I Am a Man\" wooden placards and using them to break some windows, or they're agent provocateurs. Things are happening, and the march is a disaster. I am most impressed by Dr. King when he's on the film and he says, \"Yes, it was terrible, and I should have done a better job organizing this march. I shouldn't have just jumped in, and sight unseen, into this march.\" You never see-there's not a single politician I've ever heard in my life who would admit to that kind of a mistake. And then, when he comes back, he's really redoubling his efforts to come back next time and make it right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Talk about his returning to Atlanta.\n\nTREY ELLIS : Right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And I think you have Andy Young, the former mayor of Atlanta, close ally of Dr. King for so many years, saying, \"I have never seen Dr. King so angry.\" Taylor Branch?\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Tension broke out after that march. They went back to Atlanta. And a lot of the staff, who had not wanted to go to Memphis in the first place, thought that they were right: \"We shouldn't have gone to Memphis. Violence broke out there. We told you you shouldn't do it.\" And other people said, \"Yes, we should be doing these other things.\" And to Dr. King, he was possessed: \"We have to show them that-we have to go back and rectify this. We have to show them that nonviolence can work.\" And he had some of his staff people saying, \"Martin, you can't assume the burden of making every black person in Memphis adhere to nonviolence. These were young kids who thought they could name a name for themselves by being militant. You can't impose that.\" And he said, \"We have to make an effort.\" And so, he was possessed to get everybody behind him. And he was mad at them, said, you know, \"Don't tell me you're for me. You know, I'm out here alone on this.\" And so, it was a very, very rare moment. He yelled at all of them. They chased him, tried to-couldn't find him. He went off and slept one night. And so the staff went to Ralph Abernathy, who got his wife to cook some catfish, and took him to try to talk him back.\n\nAnyway, so they went all-they went back united to Memphis. And that's where they were when the assassination happened. So they were trying to rectify this error and prove that nonviolence was still pertinent. And they had to get a court order to allow them to vote again. And Andy Young was in court all the last day and comes back-comes back from court, and says Martin hit him with a pillow and that they had a pillow fight like a bunch of 10-year-olds and were laughing.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Before we go to that pillow fight, one of what Andy Young said was one of the lightest moments he had experienced with King for years, I want to go to the clip of Dr. King the night before he was killed. This was April 3rd, 1968.\n\nREV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to the mountaintop. I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And he has allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over, and I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the promised land! So I'm happy tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man! Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's Dr. King, hours before-the evening before he was assassinated. You interviewed Jesse Jackson, who was at his side at the time of his death, about that speech and what happened in those ensuing hours after it.\n\nTREY ELLIS : Yeah, it was really amazing talking to someone like Jesse Jackson, who you think you know, from-as such a public figure, to get him to really open up in a very personal way and to really tear up about this story. Really, that's the part of me, as a narrative filmmaker, talking to someone, almost like as a director, trying to put them back into this space that I know is very uncomfortable for them.\n\nSo, as he starts telling this story, I don't know where it's going first. I see him and Dr. King-he describes Dr. King teasing him about not wearing a tie. And he says, \"Oh, I just need an appetite for\"-and then he says-and he makes a jump. Jesse Jackson makes a jump. And I just jumped out of my chair. And he describes the bullet severing Dr. King's tie. And it's just one of the most harrowing moments of my life, talking to him about that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And Jesse Jackson then saying the one thing he knew he needed to do was to call Coretta Scott King.\n\nTREY ELLIS : And then he says, \"I had to call Coretta Scott King.\" And so, it was just-and this is a young guy, Jesse Jackson, a former football player, big guy. He's got to do the hardest thing of his life, right? He's got to call her. And he says, \"I just-he got shot in the shoulder.\" He said, \"I couldn't tell her. I couldn't tell her the truth.\"\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : The film shifts, really, to Coretta, in a way, then, and the footage centering around Coretta handling this shock, back in Atlanta, from the house, that we've seen Xernona Clayton and other people in the film, where Dr. King left. And it assembles-and Andy Young says, quite forthrightly, \"We could not hold the movement together without Dr. King.\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And the funeral took place in the Ebenezer Baptist Church, the church of Dr. Martin Luther King and his father. You see his father breaking down. Coretta Scott King is stoic as she stands next to the open casket of her husband. Trey?\n\nTREY ELLIS : It's really one of the most painful moments of the script. But I also want to talk about-it's one of the most painful moments of the film. But in terms of how progressive Dr. King is-and that's what's so sort of pertinent for now-he talks about, in the film, a universal income, how that would be a good idea. He talks about how he wants to internationalize the, you know, anti-poverty and antiwar movements. And he talks about subsidies. He says, \"Listen, if it's for poor people, it's called 'welfare.' If it's wealthy people, and we put in highways, or the GI Bill, then it's just called 'subsidies.'\" He's really-everything he was saying is so prescient. It's so exactly what we need right now.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And I wanted to end with Taylor Branch talking about today, this film coming out in the era of Trump, this last year, with the white supremacists, the Nazis marching in Charlottesville, empowered around the country. President Trump, after his \"s-hole\" comments, talking about African countries and Haiti as \"s-hole\" countries, the next day he's extolling the virtues of Dr. Martin Luther King.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Well, I think this film is a great opportunity in two respects. First of all, it shows a side of Dr. King that I think most people not only don't know, but will find shocking, that he suffered, that he was on these issues toward the end of his life.\n\nBut the pertinence is that if we had listened to him and accepted him as a leader on the issues he cared about-racism, poverty and war-we wouldn't live in a cynical era. A lot of our politics in the last 50 years has been denying the leadership of the civil rights movement, that spread to the women's issues and to gay rights movements and to all sorts of things. But our politics are cynical because we don't-Trump is only making explicit what a lot of the anti-government, anti-we-the-people cynicism that's been pervasive in our society.\n\nAnd I'm hoping that we're turning, at the end of this 50-year cycle, so that King's spirit could join together with Black Lives Matter and the #MeToo movements, because without his discipline to recognize that it's both spiritual and political-you put one foot in the scripture, one foot in the Constitution-we don't have the depth to make-to turn it around. But I think it's very, very topical, because this film is about Dr. King struggling with the issues that our country needs to struggle with now.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Taylor Branch, writer Trey Ellis and director Peter Kunhardt. Their new documentary, King in the Wilderness , airs on HBO April 2nd, and it premiered here at the Sundance Film Festival.\n\nTune in tomorrow for an in-depth interview with Jane Fonda, as she talks about the five chapters of her life, from acting to opposing the war in Vietnam to organizing around civil rights and economic justice.\n\nAnd that does it for today's show. I'll be speaking here at the Sundance Film Festival with Dolly's Bookstore on Friday at 1 p.m. The free event is at 1:00 the the Park City Museum, 528 Main Street, right next door to Dolly's.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in Memphis. He was just 39 years old. We turn now to a conversation Democracy Now! recently had with Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Taylor Branch and writer Trey Ellis, who both worked on the new HBO documentary \"King in the Wilderness,\" which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival. The film recalls the last three years of King's life, beginning after President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Despite passage of the monumental legislation, King set his eyes on new battles by launching a Poor People's Campaign and campaigning to stop the Vietnam War. King's decision to publicly oppose the war isolated him from many of his closest supporters.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : It was 50 years ago today when Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated in Memphis, Tennessee, just 39 years old. We turn now to a conversation I recently had with Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Taylor Branch and with writer Trey Ellis. They both worked on the new HBO documentary called King in the Wilderness , which premiered at Sundance, where we spoke, but went on HBO this week. The film recalls the last three years of King's life, beginning after President Lyndon Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act of 1965. I began by talking to Taylor Branch, who wrote the America in the King Years trilogy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's talk about those last three years, where Dr. King is moving north. And he would say, at that time, he was never so afraid as he was in Chicago. I mean, for all that he faced in the South, Chicago-\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -the Northern United States.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Well, within a month of Selma, in 1965, he was saying, \"We have to go north.\" And the staff, including Diane, did not want him to go, did not want to go north. \"We still have work to do in the South.\" That's what she said. But King became more determined. He was reluctant in the early years. He was trying to make the movement climb up. He gets the Nobel Peace Prize. Andy Young said, \"We wanted to have chicken dinners and congratulate ourselves for 20 years.\" He says, \"No, we want to go to Selma.\" As soon as Selma was done, he says, \"We want to go north to show America that the race issue has never-is not, and never has been, purely Southern.\" And the staff didn't want to go.\n\nThen he-all the staff, except for one person, was against his coming out and making the Riverside Church speech against Vietnam. And none of the staff-the film shows how much staff dissension there was on the Poor People's Campaign, and then on Memphis. So, there was a downward pull of King in the last years, where he felt compelled to make a witness on things that he didn't have confidence were going to be big breakthrough moments like \"I Have a Dream\" or the Civil Rights Act of 1965. So, he's in the wilderness, and he's lonely, but he is much more of a leader, almost a possessed leader. \"We have to do this.\" He even made a speech to his staff saying, \"We have to finish. There's a quote in Revelation: 'We have to finish on our principles, even if we have very little left.'\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you take us on the trajectory of the Mississippi March-this is after the Selma to Montgomery March, this is James Meredith-and why King decided to join this, through the whole challenge by Stokely Carmichael, who would later become Kwame Ture? Some incredible footage there of them publicly sort of feuding, or it was more a battle of ideas of who should be included in the march. But start with Meredith.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Well, the Meredith March was a watershed in the public perception of the movement. It was the birth of Black Power. Stokely had just taken over the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee from John Lewis. Lewis was ousted because he was too much like Martin Luther King, too steadfast in nonviolence. And when Meredith got shot, Dr. King and Stokely were thrown together in continuing his march through Mississippi.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And explain what happened to James Meredith.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : James Meredith was-had his own solo March Against Fear to try to inspire black Mississippians, who were afraid to go to the courthouse to register to vote after the Voting Rights Act. And he said, \"If I can march through Mississippi by myself, then you shouldn't be afraid to register.\" But on the third day out, he was shot by white people who were angry that he was trying to rally black people to vote.\n\nAnd civil rights leaders, many of whom weren't-they weren't consulted about this march, but they felt they had to continue it, because it was so public. And it threw Dr. King together with the new SNCC leader, Stokely. And Stokely said, openly, that he used the fact that all the press came with Dr. King to announce this new doctrine to make the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee not be so much second fiddle. They had always felt Dr. King got all the publicity, and they were spending more time in jail.\n\nAnd he pronounced this new doctrine: \"We want Black Power!\" And it mesmerized the media. To this day, I mean, it's more popular. There are a lot of nonviolent movement veterans who are embarrassed that they were nonviolent, because Black Power became so popular. And Dr. King would argue with Stokely, marching down the road, and there are scenes of that. But then, at night, they would argue.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : With a reporter between them-\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : With a reporter between them.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -holding a mic, going back and forth.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And also the inclusion of non-black activists in the movement.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Yes, but-well, yes, they wanted-the march was very integrated, the March Against Fear. Remember, it's 220-something miles. It went on for almost a month. It's bigger than the Selma March.\n\nBut its significance is that it marks this big transformation between violence and nonviolence, or the opening of a debate. And Stokely would say, \"How come we have to be nonviolent? How come America admires nonviolence only in black people, but otherwise they admire John Wayne, you know? And why do we have to do that?\" And Dr. King would say, \"We don't. I'm not telling you you have to do it. What I'm telling you is that nonviolence is a leadership doctrine. It's ahead of America. If we become violent, it's not that we're stepping up to be like John Wayne. It's that we're stepping back from nonviolence to try to move the country toward reconciliation, toward votes, nonviolence, toward spirituality.\"\n\nSo they had this big argument about whether the civil rights movement needed to be nonviolent, whether it was-whether it was effective, whether it was principled, and what kind of leadership strategy it was. And that debate dominated the last couple years of Dr. King's life.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Taylor Branch, you're a veteran civil rights historian. You won the Pulitzer Prize for Parting the Waters . But you, too, were surprised by some of the footage that you saw in-for King in the Wilderness .\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Yes, I was surprised by-I wrote, but I didn't feel as-I wrote in my book that these thousands of white people would come out and throw bricks. And it was women with pocketbooks, and they'd hit people with pocketbooks, and they'd yell and scream. But to write it is different, based on source material, than to see Nazi signs and people yelling and screaming in Chicago. It was a very rough place.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I mean, the swastikas, the presence of these swastikas.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Yes. There were lots of swastikas and lots of young people involved. Now, on the other side, Dr. King was trying to experiment with nonviolence in the North, and, in many respects, it was\u0005safe. There are no stories, as there were in Memphis, of nonviolence breaking down on the movement side in Chicago. In fact, a number of gang leaders would come up to Dr. King's apartment and argue with him all night, and a number of gang leaders were in those marches. So, he had the Blackstone Rangers and a number of them in these marches. In some respects, it was the far reaches of the laboratory of who could be nonviolent and whether or not it could work.\n\nBut what you get out of the film is you see the other side of it. Dr. King said, \"We have to show America that there's a race problem in the North, because you'd be surprised how many millions of people think that there is no more race problem since we passed the civil rights bill.\" And in that one little task, they succeeded admirably. Nobody really argued that there was no racism in the North, after Chicago.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Wasn't he hit by a brick in Chicago?\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : He was hit by a brick on that same march, and once or twice by a rock. Of course, he was struck many times, stabbed. You know, violence had always been close to him his whole life, before Memphis. That wasn't new. But I think, in Chicago, even what Andy said-down in the South, you would have a couple hundred Klansmen, you'd be scared. But in Chicago, there were thousands of people, and they were enraged, and you could hear them. It was an angry crowd.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's talk about Vietnam and how King ended up making this Riverside address, speech, \"Why I Oppose the War in Vietnam.\" I wanted to turn to a clip of Vince Harding, before he died. We had a long conversation with him about the speech and his conversations with Dr. King. The man, Vince Harding, who helped to craft that speech, this is what he had to say.\n\nDR. VINCENT HARDING : Martin was, towards the end of his life, you may remember, by the last years of his life, he was saying that America had to deal with three-what he called triple evils: the evil of racism, the evil of materialism and the evils of militarism. And he saw those three very much connected to each other. ...\n\nIn a way, Amy, as long as Martin and I knew each other, we were talking about the kinds of things that were involved in that speech. We were talking about the tremendous damage that war does to those who participate in it, to those who are the victims of it, to those who lose tremendous possibilities in their own lives because of it. And we were always talking about what it might mean to try to find creative, nonviolent alternatives to the terrible old-fashionedness of war as a way of solving problems.\n\nAnd then, when Vietnam began to develop on all of our screens in the 1960s, we talked a great deal about our country's role and a great deal about the role of those of us who were believers in the way of nonviolent struggle for change and what our responsibility was both as nonviolent believers and as followers of the teachings and the ways of Jesus the Christ. So when Martin was clear with himself that he had to make a major public address on this subject, as fully as he could possibly do it, he was looking for a setting in which that could be done on the grounds of his religious stance particularly. And when clergy and laity against the war in Vietnam invited him to do that at Riverside for the occasion of their gathering in April 1967, it was clear to him that that was the place that he really ought to make the speech or to take the stand in the most public way possible.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That was Vince Harding, a close ally of Dr. King, who helped to craft that \"Beyond Vietnam\" speech, or \"Why I Oppose the War in Vietnam,\" the speech that Dr. King gave at Riverside Church in New York on April 4th, 1967, a year to the day before Dr. King was assassinated in Memphis. Talk about Vince Harding's role in that speech, Taylor Branch.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Well, Vince Harding was a Mennonite student of nonviolence his whole life, who lived in Atlanta, not far from Dr. King. And when the speech was-when he undertook the speech, for reasons that Trey can explain, it was one of the few that he actually wrote out. He had to have it-a condition of doing this was that they wanted to publicize it and get his views out. They wanted a written version of the speech. Normally-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That Dr. King wrote out.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Yeah. And normally, Dr. King kind of improvised and winged things. He was like a jazz-but he had to have a formal speech. And he called in a number of people, but, principally, Vince Harding did the first draft of the speech to try to get it right, one moment to speak. And the idea was-the staff didn't want him to give the speech, but they said, \"If you're going to do it, do it in a way that at least you don't have-the press will pay attention to it. Don't do it with a lot of 'Hey, hey, LBJ , how many kids,' you know, placards in the background. Don't do it\"-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : \"How many kids did you kill today?\"\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : \"'How many kids did you kill?' Don't-with anything provocative. Do it in a nice setting,\" turning to Clergy and Laity Concerned and Dick Fernandez. And Trey interviewed Dick Fernandez about how they went in there. But they were trying to make it as palatable as possible and get the world one chance to listen to his comprehensive argument about the history of Vietnam, about the Vietnamese people, about how they viewed our claims that we were fostering this out of concern for their democratic future. And he crafted this comprehensive speech, and nobody listened to it anyway. They said, \"You're a traitor. You shouldn't\"-it was one of the big disappointments in his life. And-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what did King and Vince Harding say?\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : Next time he saw him-Vince told me that the next time Dr. King saw him in Atlanta, he said, \"Vince, you got me really in a lot of trouble, and I'm going to blame you and stuff.\" But they survived on gallows humor. And Dr. King was a champion.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, Trey, talk more about the significance of this speech. I want to play another clip, this one of Dr. King himself. So many of the phrases he used became so important later.\n\nREV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: I speak as a child of God and brother to the suffering poor of Vietnam. I speak for those whose land is being laid waste, whose homes are being destroyed, whose culture is being subverted. I speak for the poor of America, who are paying the double price of smashed hopes at home and death and corruption in Vietnam. I speak as a citizen of the world, for the world as it stands aghast at the path we have taken. I speak as one who loves America, to the leaders of our own nation: The great initiative in this war is ours; the initiative to stop it must be ours.\n\nAs I have walked among the desperate, rejected and angry young men, I have told them that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems. I have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through nonviolent action. But they ask, and rightly so, \"What about Vietnam?\" And they ask if our own nation wasn't using massive doses of violence to solve its problems, to bring about the changes it wanted. Their questions hit home. And I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today, my own government.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, that's Dr. King saying that his country, the United States, was the greatest purveyor of violence on Earth. The corporate media, the mainstream media, went after him, from the Times to Time magazine to Life magazine. I have the Life magazine copy still. And they talked about the fact-they said that his speech sounded like a script from Radio Hanoi. They said he had done a disservice to his cause, his country and his people. So, for those young people today who say, \"It was easy for King, because everything he did, everyone idolized,\" he was slammed.\n\nTREY ELLIS : Yeah, it was fascinating for me. We begin, in the documentary, talking about when he sort of nudged into the idea of global politics, talking to Ambassador Goldberg with Andrew Young. And anytime he would try to say anything except for white Southerners shouldn't segregate, he was pilloried. So they really tried their best, as Taylor said, to say, \"How can we make this strong statement as innocuous, as palatable as possible?\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And what happens after, a year to the day before he's assassinated, that speech, is what King says.\n\nTREY ELLIS : Yeah, it's just amazing, the coincidence that a year to the day after that speech he's gunned down in Memphis. But the backlash against the speech wasn't only the media or the white community. It was also Roy Wilkins and the NAACP . All the black clergymen were very concerned. And even inside the SCLC , they were very concerned.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The Southern Christian Leadership Conference.\n\nTREY ELLIS : The Southern Christian Leadership Conference, which he led, they were concerned. Their money dried up. He had no friends. And that's when Xernona says-Xernona Clayton, his great adviser, who begins our film, says he died of a broken heart. That's really one of those great reasons, that everybody seemed to have turned against him, with his turn against the war.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Trey, explain this last year of Dr. King's life, the Poor People's March.\n\nTREY ELLIS : Well, so, after the coming out against the war in Vietnam-and he's really at his lowest point. Some people might say, and Andy Young would say, \"You deserve it. If you want to just be-you know, take over Riverside Church and live in the Upper West Side of Manhattan, you know, you deserve it.\" Right? He said, no, he still wanted to fight longer.\n\nAnd the first interview I did was with Marian Wright Edelman. And when she said that-we have her on tape saying, when she came to-when she visited the poor in Mississippi with Bobby Kennedy, and Bobby Kennedy said to her, \"Tell King to bring the poor to Washington,\" which goes to Taylor's point about having the public/private, how governance works best, how King and LBJ could work together-when she brought that message to King, she goes into his office, he's very, very sad. She tells him this idea from Bobby Kennedy and her, and he lights up.\n\nAnd it's really-I think he saw this as like this-and he talks about this march on Washington, this Poor People's Campaign. He really envisioned it as bigger than the \"I Have a Dream\" speech. He figured this as like this would be all Americans-white, black, Hispanic. All poor people would march on Washington, and real big transformative change. And when you see that it's-the plans for that march and what could have been in that march cut short by this assassin's bullet, this murderer's bullet, it's really quite heartbreaking.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Taylor Branch?\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : One reason that he may have lit up so much is this idea of racism, poverty and war, that you mentioned. He called it the \"triple scourge of evil.\" Andy Young mentions it in the film. That was not a new idea for Dr. King. It's the theme of his Nobel Prize lecture, that they are related-racism, poverty and war, the violence of the flesh and violence of the spirit. So, he had done racism. He had done war, in Vietnam. And poverty is equally violent, in his worldview. So, an opportunity to make an explicit witness on the third leg of this, what he called the \"ancient triple scourge\" of racism, poverty and war, I think, was something that he knew he needed to do to make his message complete, because he had been speaking about this, but he hadn't been demonstrating on poverty.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, let's move on to Memphis and this-not the final moment of Memphis, but it was in two parts. And again, we're talking about enormous tension within the SCLC and Dr. King's closest advisers being concerned about King going to Memphis. He had been invited to stand with the sanitation workers as they tried to unionize.\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : I will just talk a little bit about the origins of Memphis. The staff-he had-it took, as the film shows, an enormous effort to get the staff behind the Poor People's Campaign. There were a lot of dissension. Some people said, \"If you don't end the Vietnam War, it doesn't matter what we do.\" And other people said, \"We still have segregation in the South and in the North, and we should be on race relations.\" So he finally gets them to going on the Poor People's Campaign and their plans, and then this incident happened in Memphis.\n\nThe strike started because two of the sanitation workers were crushed to death in the back of a cylinder garbage truck, when they were not allowed to seek shelter in rainstorms, because they were all black, and their rules did not allow them to seek shelter in any white neighborhood, because it offended white people. And the only place they could find shelter is in the garbage, with the garbage itself. And a broom fell and hit a lever and compacted them, literally crushed them. That's the origins of \"I Am a Man,\" meaning they picked that slogan because the whole strike was-it was economic, but it was also just essential dignity. They were being crushed like the garbage that they were picking up, and nobody cared.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So they carried these signs that said \"I Am a Man.\"\n\nTAYLOR BRANCH : They carried these signs. And the person that was leading the demonstrations, Jim Lawson, was one of Dr. King's old mentors in nonviolence. And he calls him and says, \"Martin, can you come?\" And so, that's where the-Trey did most of the interviews about Memphis, but that's where it was. He said, \"I have to go to Memphis. If we don't answer this-yes, it's a diversion, but it's from Jim Lawson, and if these people don't personify what the Poor People's Campaign is going to be about, nobody does.\" So he once again drags his staff to Memphis as a diversion from Poor People's Campaign.\n\nTREY ELLIS : Yeah, I think it's-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Trey, take it from there.\n\nTREY ELLIS : Well, I think what's really amazing about it, we have this-every time that, you know, when he wanted to go north, when he wanted to go against the war, he was getting this pushback from his staff. And then, now there's such dissent, that they actually-he has a little hunger strike, right? That like he's just-it's the first time that, Andy Young will say, that he can't get through to them. And he just has to do something really extreme, so they will-they will listen to him.\n\nTo me, an extraordinary moment is like when he goes to the first Memphis March, and it goes badly, and some people, for some-it's unclear what all their reasons were, but some people in the back are taking those \"I Am a Man\" wooden placards and using them to break some windows, or they're agent provocateurs. Things are happening, and the march is a disaster. I am most impressed by Dr. King when he's on the film and he says, \"Yes, it was terrible, and I should have done a better job organizing this march. I shouldn't have just jumped in, and sight unseen, into this march.\" You never see-there's not a single politician I've ever heard in my life who would admit to that kind of a mistake. And then, when he comes back, he's really redoubling his efforts to come back next time and make it right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : I want to go to the clip of Dr. King the night before he was killed. This was April 3rd, 1968.\n\nREV . MARTIN LUTHER KING JR.: Well, I don't know what will happen now. We've got some difficult days ahead. But it really doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to the mountaintop. I don't mind. Like anybody, I would like to live a long life. Longevity has its place. But I'm not concerned about that now. I just want to do God's will. And he has allowed me to go up to the mountain. And I've looked over, and I've seen the promised land. I may not get there with you, but I want you to know tonight that we, as a people, will get to the promised land! So I'm happy tonight. I'm not worried about anything. I'm not fearing any man! Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the lord!\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Dr. Martin Luther King, speaking April 3rd, 1968. He was assassinated less than 24 hours later in Memphis, 50 years ago today, April 4th, 1968.

On the balcony outside room 306, where Dr. King last stood, museum co-founder Judge D'Army Bailey talks about Dr. King's legacy and the long struggle for the museum that honors it. [includes rush transcript]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in front of room 306, where Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated the evening of April 4, 1968. I'm standing with Judge D'Army Bailey, who is the founder of the National Civil Rights Museum, which is what the Lorraine Motel has been incorporated into today.\n\nJudge Bailey, where were you when Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated here on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel?\n\nJUDGE D'ARMY BAILEY : I was working in New York in the national headquarters of the American Civil Liberties Union, and I ran an organization that had the responsibility of recruiting law students and sending them to the South to help on civil rights work. So I had 10 law students that were in Memphis working with the sanitation strike and with the lawyers here. And I was in my office in Manhattan packing my briefcase to take a plane the next morning to Memphis, because they had that march coming up within two or three days. And so, I was there in my office, and my secretary came in, and she said - she had the radio on - she said that she had just heard that Dr. King had been shot in Memphis, and I sat at my desk, stunned. And within about 10 minutes, she came back out crying and said that he had died.\n\nAnd I finished packing very quickly and walked downstairs with her and put her in a taxi, and then I went over and took the Lexington uptown to Grand Central Station, and when I got off the train in Grand Central Station, no one was speaking to anybody. It was just tense and quiet. And you could cut the tension with a knife there. And I went on uptown to - and shortly later that night, the rioting started in Harlem and in other parts of the country.\n\nAnd I did come on to Memphis the next day. And when I got here, the city was under martial law, and National Guard troops were throughout the city. And, of course, the march did occur, that Dr. King was to lead, two days later, I think, on the 8th of April. And thousands of people were here. Mrs. King came with her children. I talked with Mrs. King when we brought her here for the dedication of the museum, and she told me the story that she was - that some of her family members had urged her not to come to that march - they were fearful in the wake of the assassination - and that Harry Belafonte had called her and said, \"Mrs. King, you've got to go,\" and that that was what tipped the scales, had caused her to come to Memphis and be in that march.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about how this motel has been turned into a museum?\n\nJUDGE D'ARMY BAILEY : Well, the owner of the motel was a black man by the name of Walter Bailey, same name as my father, and including middle initial, but we weren't related. But he had struggled in the years following the assassination to keep the doors of the motel open, because business had declined with blacks being able to go to the white hotels, and also this area was declining. And so, the motel went up for foreclosure.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Is it true that Mr. Bailey's wife died as a result of the killing of Dr. Martin Luther King?\n\nJUDGE D'ARMY BAILEY : Mr. Bailey's wife, Loree Bailey, used to help him run this place, and she had a stroke on the night of the assassination, and she died two days later.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So the motel was operating for a few years after Dr. King was assassinated?\n\nJUDGE D'ARMY BAILEY : Yes. It continued to operate, although, frankly, the clientele were prostitutes mostly and just sort of transient trade. They had maybe eight or 10 weekly tenants here. It was on hard times.\n\nI joined with a group of four other African Americans in Memphis and we formed a nonprofit group to raise money, and we bought the Lorraine with $140,000 in a foreclosure auction on the courthouse step.\n\nMy feeling, having been involved as a student activist in the civil rights movement - I was expelled from Southern University in 1962 for participating in sit-in protests and arrested at Gwynn Oak amusement park in 1963 in Baltimore for trying to desegregate a segregated park. So I had - and I had traveled through the South, and I knew about the strength and courage of John Lewis and Ella Baker and Dave Dennis and Bob Moses and Jim Foreman and others who had been through the movement. And I felt that if we used this site to tell the story of that struggle, to recreate it in as dramatic and dynamic a way possible, the courage and the sacrifice, the determination that young people made to help turn around this country, and so we used the site of a tragedy to exploit it in a communications way to tell the story of a deep movement, of a deeper story of the movement.\n\nSo it's not a museum that celebrates Dr. King; it's a museum that celebrates the spirit of a movement. And so, we had the exhibits on Selma and on Montgomery, and on the Freedom Summer of 1954, and we had the exhibit on the courage of the nine black children at Central High School in Little Rock, who braved the mobs to desegregate that school, and James Meredith's singular courage to desegregate the University of Mississippi, and, of course, finally this tragic event that occurred here on April 4th of 1968.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You actually have preserved the pavement that is red with Dr. King's blood to this day.\n\nJUDGE D'ARMY BAILEY : You know, I just couldn't believe, Amy, when they told me, before we even started the renovation, and this balcony was here, and Mr. Bailey had kind of preserved a little room here, which was the room that Dr. King had come out of with book cases and display of the dishes that he last ate from and the bedspread that had been thrown over him when he lay here on the balcony, so he had created sort of his own exhibit in here, but that was the only part that was open as for an exhibit. But when they told me that that was his bloodstains in this old balcony, it was just hard to believe that in 1968, the assassination, and here we were 20 years later, and the bloodstain is still speaking to us from that concrete. And so, I knew that we couldn't just tear up this balcony. We had to put in a new balcony, because of the deterioration of the old one, but I knew we couldn't tear that up, and so I asked the contractors to cut that part out of the old balcony, and that's been reinstalled here in this balcony here.\n\nTo me, the importance of Dr. King's death is the inspiration that we do something positive to make change. And so, we ought to be using this day in strategy meetings on how we're going to go out and challenge the local companies and businesses that don't have equal opportunities at the high levels of management and on their boards of directors, and we need to be going to meet with these political officials who are not demanding that we have programs to deal with the homelessness and with the poor and with the lack of educational opportunities for kids who are struggling. And so, we need to be developing strategies and implementing strategies. This is not a day for ceremony. It ought to be a day for action.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So you're talking about challenging the very corporations that support the National Civil Rights Museum.\n\nJUDGE D'ARMY BAILEY : I think we must. And I recognize that you have to have corporate support, but the problem occurs when it dominates in its support and when the chairman of the executive committee is one of the corporate leaders, a conservative Republican who had George Bush as a guest in his home to raise funds against Congressman Harold Ford Jr. That's the man who chairs the executive committee of this museum.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Who is that?\n\nJUDGE D'ARMY BAILEY : Pitt Hyde, J.R. Pitt Hyde, who formed the AutoZone Corporation here, which is sponsoring a big ceremonial basketball game celebrating Dr. King. And yet AutoZone Corporation has been in litigation with the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission on issues of - allegedly where there were some 63 managers hired and promoted and none were African-American. And so, you have to recognize that as you allow this corporate control and involvement, then you sort of paralyze yourself in terms of being able to be proactive to make those very corporations accountable. Now, to the extent that - and especially in a small town like Memphis. Now, if you're in a large city, you have a number of possible supporters you can go to, and you have a diversification of influence. But where it boils down to two or three or four corporations who work with each other in tandem on most charitable projects, then it becomes a very close and tight control. And that's not just with the museum. The NAACP here in Memphis gets most of its finances from local corporations. And so, they have to find harmonious kind of social programs, as opposed to the hard issues that challenge these corporations.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is also the headquarters of FedEx, isn't it? Fred Smith, the CEO , who is a well-known Republican activist.\n\nJUDGE D'ARMY BAILEY : Yes, Fred Smith. And he and Pitt Hyde, the chairman of this museum's executive committee, which meets monthly and sets its policy and controls its operations, and yet you can see that the actual maintenance is not really that good here. There are cobwebs here in the windowsill. There needs to be painting out here. And this same board would give $50,000 to Bono or to Oprah Winfrey in a freedom award, cash money, when it could use that money to paint up here, and you wouldn't have all of these repair issues.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Judge Bailey, the founder of the National Civil Rights Museum that incorporates the Lorraine Motel, where we're standing now on the balcony outside room 306, where Dr. Martin Luther King had walked out of on April 4, 1968, in the evening, looked out over the balcony and was assassinated.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

One of the main characters, Sam, hosts the campus radio show \"Dear White People,\" where she confronts the racist stereotypes and dilemmas faced by students of color. Racial tensions on campus come to a head when a group of mostly white students throw an African-American-themed party, wearing blackface and using watermelons and fake guns as props. We speak to actor Marque Richardson and award-winning, first-time director Justin Simien.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : A new film tackling racial politics in contemporary America is getting a major Hollywood break. The film, Dear White People , took the Sundance Film Festival by storm earlier this year, winning U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Breakthrough Talent. Now, Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions have acquired rights to the film, pretty much guaranteeing a wide U.S. and Canadian distribution.\n\nDear White People examines race relations through comedy and satire. While it elicits many laughs from the audience, at its core, it's a serious film. The film follows a group of black students at a fictional, predominantly white, Ivy League school called Winchester University. One of the main characters, Sam, hosts a radio show on campus called Dear White People , where she confronts the racist stereotypes and dilemmas faced by students of color. Racial tensions on campus come to a head when a group of mostly white students throw an African-American-themed party wearing blackface and using watermelons and fake guns as props.\n\nThe concept is not all that far-fetched. Just as the film was premiering at Sundance, a fraternity at Arizona State University decided to mark Martin Luther King Day by holding a, quote, \" MLK Black Party\" where white partygoers donned basketball jerseys, flashed gang signs and drank from cups made of watermelons. When posting photos of the event to social media, they used hashtags like \"hood,\" \"blackout for MLK ,\" \"my boy martin\" and \"kill em.\"\n\nMore recently, three freshmen were expelled from their fraternity at University of Mississippi, popularly known as Ole Miss, for hanging a noose and plastering a flag bearing the Confederate symbol on a statue of James Meredith, a civil rights hero who was the first African American to attend the university. The fraternity was also suspended after the incident, which took place in February during Black History Month.\n\nFurther north, at one of the world's top universities, students of color say they're tired of people suggesting they don't belong. Black students at Harvard recently began a photo montage campaign called \"I, Too, Am Harvard\" that went viral. In it, students hold signs that say things like \"Having an opinion does not make me an 'Angry Black Woman'\" and \"No, I will not teach you how to twerk.\" A Harvard student named Ahsante Bean made this promo video for the campaign.\n\nHARVARD STUDENT 1: There's always that moment when you're the only black student in your section.\n\nHARVARD STUDENT 2: When, in class, and you're the only black kid, and this-the N-word comes up or some-in a book or something where there's slavery or whatever it is.\n\nHARVARD STUDENT 1: And the issue of race comes up or the issue of slavery or the issue of whatever. Everyone looks to you ...\n\nHARVARD STUDENT 2: Everyone looks to you -\n\nHARVARD STUDENT 1: ... as if you're about to speak for your race.\n\nHARVARD STUDENT 2: As if, like, you represent everybody in the race, and suddenly your voice will, like, carry such weight.\n\nHARVARD STUDENT 1: And it's kind of frustrating, because you would hope that people would understand that there are all different types of black people, and black people don't all have the same opinions about the same issues.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : An excerpt from the promo video, \"I, Too, Am Harvard.\"\n\nWell, black students have launched similar campaigns across the country, including at the University of Mississippi, after the incident involving the James Meredith statue, and at University of Michigan, after a fraternity planned a \"hood\"-themed party invoking racial stereotypes. That party was canceled following an uproar. Campaigns by students of color demanding acceptance and respect have also been launched abroad, at Cambridge and Oxford.\n\nWell, the film Dear White People deals with these very real issues in creative and often humorous ways. The film just showed here-is showing this weekend at New Directors/New Films festival presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art. It's scheduled for a theatrical release this year.\n\nWhile at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, earlier this year, I sat down with the film's director, Justin Simien, who was recently named one of Variety 's \"10 Directors to Watch.\" We were also joined by Marque Richardson, who plays Reggie in the film. I began by asking the director, Justin Simien, about the film's storyline.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : You know, the story revolves around four black kids at a mostly white Ivy League college. And Samantha White is-you know, she's sort of this Angela Davis, Malcolm X, Huey from The Boondocks , you know, Lisa Bonet's character from The Cosby Show amalgamation of, you know, a girl who really hangs her identity on being this black militant in this white place and sort of really challenging the status quo and trying to, what she calls, pop the post-racial bubble and sort of this illusion that because Barack Obama is president and, you know, everyone loves Beyoncé, that somehow we're all past race. You know, that's really her thing.\n\nLionel Higgins, who is sort of like on the polar opposite end, has no black identity to speak of in the beginning of the film, and because he is also gay and dealing with sexual issue-you know, sexual identity issues, is sort of really feeling sort of, you know, like he belongs in no place and very much in the middle and sort of watching the other black characters in the film from the sidelines.\n\nCoco Conners, whose government name is Colandrea, is, you know, also kind of a flipside of Sam. She's just taking a different approach to sort of owning her black identity. You know, some might call her a bit of a conformist. She definitely comes in the package that I think, you know, the people at this particular school would, you know, expect-what she believes that they expect from. But she also is kind of daring and cunning in her way of surviving in this place.\n\nAnd then you have Troy Fairbanks, which is-he's sort of the poster black child of diversity of the school. He's the son of the dean. He's a legacy kid. He's a, you know, perfectly coiffed sort of, you know, Essence , Ebony magazine kind of black man and is sort of like a nonthreatening version of black for his white friends, but, you know, he can black it up when need be for his black friends. So-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And his dad is Dennis Haysbert, who is-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : His dad is played fantastically by Dennis Haysbert, who-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Who is the president of the United States in 24 .\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's right. That's right. That's right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In 24 .\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's right. But, you know, at Winchester, only the dean. There's also a president of the school, that doesn't deserve it, but is, you know, his boss. And it's that sort of like-you know, when a-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Who is white, and the dean is black.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, exactly, who is white. And I just wanted to sort of get into the pressure that I, as a black man, feel from, you know, my parents' generation of just sort of what they had to go through and, you know, this idea that the \"Talented Tenth\" has to work 10 times harder, and we have to appear perfect and, you know, have everything. That's a kind of pressure that I don't know if people who aren't minorities feel.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, who are you?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Who am I?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In Dear White People .\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Oh, god, I'm all of them. I'm all of them, truly. I mean, I like to say, because it's easy to say, that I entered college Lionel and left as Sam. But the truth is, is that I'm each one of those characters. I mean, there are really autobiographical threads in all of them.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, it's amazingly diverse. And here at Sundance, when the film premiered, one of the audience members raised their hand and congratulated you for the diversity. And in response, you came out.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, yeah, that's true. I mean, I've never been in, but yeah. I mean, that happened years ago. But, you know, no one has really asked me to stand in front of a bunch of people and talk about myself, so, you know. But yeah, I mean, I think it's an-I think it's an important thing to talk about. I think it's a thing that, like, is still an issue in the black community for black men to own their sexual identity and to say that, yeah, I can be all of these things and be gay and be black, and still it's all good. All these things can still-can coexist together. And, you know, I think Lionel's trepidation over that is certainly an anchor for a lot of people in the film.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Justin, talk about the inspiration for this film.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : The beginning really came from two places. I mean, I had had a college experience that was certainly not as extreme as the events that take place in the film, but, you know, this sense of being one of very few black people in the room and having to sort of toggle my blackness and what parts of my identity I showed to people based on what groups of friends I was with was something that I felt like that was kind of what all of my friends were doing and feeling the pressure to do, and I wanted to talk about that in the movie. And-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Where did you go to school?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I went to school at Chapman University. It's a great school.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In California.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, a great school, really lovely people, lots of people touching my hair, lots of people thinking I could play basketball. You know, it was funny. It was like-it was kind of anecdotal. And that's really where it began. And it really wasn't until I started to research particularly what has happened at Ivy League schools, research blackface parties, which are unfortunately a very common occurrence in predominantly white institutions, that the script really, for me, began to be more about the American black experience, as opposed to my specific college experience. And I began to treat Winchester University as a microcosm of, you know, this sort of identity crisis that I feel like-I know I'm having, that my black friends are having, and, you know, just-and finding ways to sort of broach these sort of uncomfortable topics, you know, as we go through life.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, you've been driven to do this. It's not like it's your 10th film.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Sure, yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is your first film.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And you've been working on it for a few years. What were you doing in between?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I actually was a studio publicist for a while. I worked at several major studios doing publicity, online publicity, that kind of thing, and most recently was doing sort of like independent-I'm sorry, not independent, but doing Internet content, like digital content, and all along, on the side, sort of writing and trying to work on the craft and push the boulder up the hill for the movie.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And so, what made you finally put down the day job-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -and just do the other full-time?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I think what it was is we made a concept trailer, you know? I had a script that I believed in. And particularly with a multi-protagonist script about-you know, ruminating on black consciousness and identity, you know, I felt like I needed to do something to give people a reason to let it come in the room and pitch myself. So I, you know, poured my tax return into a concept trailer.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And a concept trailer, for people who don't know, is just sort of like a-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : It's like an as if-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -big trailer?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : As if the movie existed. You know, we cut like a three-minute piece, and I just shot what's in the trailer. You know, we shot it very quickly over two days, with no money, and put that online, and it blew up. And, you know, a year and a half later, we were able to get the financing and actually make the movie. So, when the concept trailer hit, though, I just felt like I needed to do something dramatic. And so I quit my job and basically said, \"You know what? Making this movie is the only thing that matters to me right now.\" And it was a year and a half of figuring out, but we finally did.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The director of Dear White People , Justin Simien, speaks to us at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, earlier this year. In our next segment, he'll be joined by Marque Richardson, who plays the character Reggie in the film. We'll have more in a minute.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, as we go back to our interview with Justin Simien, the director of the remarkable new film, Dear White People , that just played in New York this weekend. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. With him is Marque Richardson, who plays the character Reggie in the film. I asked Justin Simien about his ensemble film, Dear White People , and who inspired him as he was making this film, his first ever.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I'm a big fan of ensemble films. They're probably-it's probably my favorite genre. I just love the way they're put together, and particularly when it comes to issues. I love films that talk about things like race from many, many different, conflicting points of view, because it's not-I never wanted to make a morality play. I never wanted to say this is how it is and this is what you should feel. I wanted these characters to disagree with each other and to all be struggling to figure out the answer, because, you know, I just think that that's more interesting. I think that speaks to the human experience. Movies like Network do that. Movies like Do the Right Thing do that, Election , even The Royal Tenenbaums . Like, they find a way to talk about the human condition from all of these different points of views. And particularly with race identity, I couldn't-I can't think of another way to do it. You know, there's just so many different ways to go about it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Reggie-well, you're Reggie in the film; you're Marque Richardson in real life.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yes, ma'am.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But talk about your character, Reggie.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah. Reggie represents the angry black man in my head. And so, in doing a lot of research, you know, for the project and for Reggie, I was listening to a lot of Malcolm X, Public Enemy, Flavor Flav, you know, just all of these prominent black leaders, and James Brown, you know, and-in terms of, you know, rebelling against the man or really having that strong black identity, and that's it. You know, so.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And talk about who Reggie is in-at Winchester University, where you go to school.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Reggie is-I had it that he's the Michelle Obama to Samantha, who is the Obama. You know, he's her support system, that's-he does everything for her.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, Sam is Dear White People . She has a radio show. She has a voice, and she is angry.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yes, yeah. Yeah, she is. And she's amazing. I'm going back into my character right now, [inaudible] character.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That you worship her.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah, I worship her, pretty much. Yeah, pretty much. So-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And you're an IT guy, too-I mean, in the film. You're very good. You know how to work the system. You-\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yes. Yes, yes, yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And that serves you very well. What was it like to perform in this ensemble company? And how do things change? I want to ask both of you this. When you're all together, do things change as you're-you know, your lines change, the feelings change, as you're working together? Do you get inspired by the other people on the set?\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah, I say I was inspired by everybody on the set, just in terms of-because a lot of these people were my friends before we actually started to work. And, you know, to be able to work with your friends and actually work on a project that you're so proud of, even though it's not the easiest thing to do, was phenomenal. It was like a summer camp. And, you know, you take-I just took everything that happened and used it in the work, and you stay present. And, you know, we created this. So-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : And Marque Richardson is a beast, man. I mean, what was cool about it is that, like, it was just a bunch of beasts. I mean, seriously, like these really incredible actors who had not had a chance to really show this side of themselves in a movie before. And it was great to just see them sort of like see each other other's takes and get inspired. And, you know, you talk about things changing. I mean, you know, they always say there's a movie that you write, there's a movie that you make, and then there's a movie that you edit, and they're all different. And, you know, we had a very tight budget and schedule, and so, yeah, stuff changed all the time. I mean, there were all sorts of days where you'd walk in and say, \"Oh, well, this is the set we're shooting on now. How do we make the scene work for that?\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So let's go to the first clip. This is in Dear White People where Samantha White, who is played by Tessa Thompson, confronts Kurt Fletcher. Kurt is the character in the movie, and he's the son of the university president, President Fletcher. He's in the dining hall of Armstrong/Parker House. And explain Armstrong/Parker House.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Armstrong/Parker House is sort of the residence hall that's deemed like the black house, like where the black kids that want to be around other black kids historically have gone to. And it's basically being challenged by the administration, who thinks it's a sort of self-segregation, and so they're actually-they're actually randomizing housing. And so, this sort of like, you know, history of black students going to this school is in danger for the first time.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's go to the clip. And then I want to ask Marque what was it like to shoot this scene. This is Dear White People .\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : [played by Tessa Thompson] Well, on behalf of all the colored folks in the room, let me apologize to all the better-qualified white students whose place we're taking up.\n\nKURT FLETCHER : [played by Kyle Gallner] No, it's fine. We're OK.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : I'm sorry. Did you get lost? Bechet [ phon. ] is that way.\n\nKURT FLETCHER : I know where it is. I'm actually supposed eat there. Yeah, it's just there's-this is the only dining hall that you can actually get yourself some chicken-and waffles. Look, you're Dear White People , right? It's funny. It's funny stuff. It really is. How have we not staffed you yet?\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : Oh, me? Oh, what? On Pastiche , your uninspired humor magazine?\n\nKURT FLETCHER : It's actually much more than just a magazine, sweetheart. SNL 's staff is basically half- Lampoon , half- Pastiche . Same goes for the network comedies.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : And what gives you clubhouse kids the right to come to our dining hall? You don't live here.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED : Sam, what are you doing?\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : So you can't eat here.\n\nTROY FAIRBANKS : [played by Brandon Bell] Chill, Sam. Damn, all right, let the man eat.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : Got this.\n\nKURT FLETCHER : Got this. Look, who are you to throw me out?\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : Well, I think I'm head of this house. And I'm doing things my way.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That last voice, Sam White. She is the radio announcer, the radio host, and now the president of Armstrong/Parker House, throwing out the white guys. Yes, that's a clip from Dear White People . And our guests in studio are here at Sundance Film Festival headquarters, are the star of-one of the stars of this ensemble production, Dear White People , Marque Richardson, as well as the director, first-time director Justin Simien. Marque, talk about that scene.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : That scene was just-to be there and to watch the work-first off, the work of Tessa and Kyle, like Justin said, they were just beasts, and to see them play and to see them go at it with each other was just phenomenal, to be a witness of it. And then, for my character, anyway, it riled me up.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : OK.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : It was arousing, you know, because-you know, Sam is Reggie's muse. I mean, he does everything for her. And just to sit there and watch her work, as Reggie, was just-you know, that was love.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I think, in a lot of ways, too, Sam is sort of like-Sam and, then, eventually, other characters are sort of like mouthpieces for Reggie. Like-\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I think he-I think he likes when she does things that maybe he's too timid to do, you know, which I think is an interesting-\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I mean, I love-you know, one of the things I tell the actors is, in the cutting room, like I love to watch-you know, because the camera is on lots-on all the different groups in Armstrong/Parker House in that scene, and I love to watch them when they're not on camera. You know what I mean? When I know we're going to cut to Sam and Kyle, but I love just watching-I just loved watching them watch what was happening, because they never turn off. They're just always in the moment, and all these-so many good reactions to choose from.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Marque, in your life, how much do you identify with Dear White People ?\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : A lot.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Where did you-where were you born?\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : I actually-I was born in San Diego, and I went to USC . And right before-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : University of Southern California.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah, University of Southern California-fight on. But right before this interview, I told Justin, I said, \"I just realized that I actually lived on an all-black floor at USC .\" And it just hit me that I lived this. You know, I lived this. And, you know, we would go off campus and integrate with other students and whatnot, but, you know, they would ask us why. You know, \"Why are you integrating yourselves? Why are you-you know, just living in your own world?\" And it was a support system, you know, to go out there in the world and have people try and touch your hair, have people, you know, professors, say these things to you, and to go back home and to share that experience with your people.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Interestingly, Sam, Tessa Thompson, throws out not only Kurt, the white president's son-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -who ends up throwing the-what would you call it? Not \"block party,\" \"black party,\" whatever you call it.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The costume party. But she also throws out Lionel.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Mm-hmm, yeah. I wanted to-first of all, I wanted to-I'm always about telling the truth and being honest, and I didn't want-I didn't want these to be just grandstanding archetypes. I wanted them to be complicated and complex and to sometimes do things that confuse people.\n\nAnd one of the things that I experienced in college-I'll never forget it-is, there was a moment when I was sitting in-you know, and I was new to the school, and, you know, I don't think particularly at the time I came in the expected, you know, black male package. I was kind of a mess. My hair was all over the place, not quite where Lionel's is in the movie, but-I don't know. I don't know what it was about me, but, you know, the Black Student Union meeting started to happen around me in this area that I-you know, I had seated to study and was kind of waiting for the meeting to start. It would have been my first meeting. I was brand new to the campus. And there was something about me they just didn't think I was down enough. And they were just like, \"Hey, so you know we're doing Black Student Union here. You might want to like leave.\" And I just remember, like, ooh, like that was such an awful feeling to not feel black enough in that environment, when, like, I feel like exoticized for being black in other-you know, in other areas of my experience.\n\nAnd, you know-and also because Sam White, in that moment, is saying, \"If you don't live in this residence hall, you don't eat here,\" it wasn't-I didn't want to make it specifically about the fact that they were white, because then that would make her just a racist. And, to me, that's not interesting. What's more interesting is her being about the principle of it, like if you're not down enough to live in Armstrong/Parker, you don't get to eat here. And that, to me, was more interesting.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And so, you have Lionel, the black, gay character in this film, being thrown out here.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Sure.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But when he walks into the newspaper room, he's assuring the white student, \"I'm not going to write for you. Don't worry.\"\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I wanted to talk about that toggle, that weird toggle of like-it's like a tap dance, you know what I mean? It's like it's a softshoe. You've got to-you've got to sort of be-you don't have to be, but certainly in college I felt a pressure to be different things to different groups of people, because of-you know, when you walk through the world as any minority, when you walk through the world as a woman, like, in every space you go, there's-you're aware that you are what you are and that people are going to have, you know, ideas about you just by seeing you. And I wanted each of the characters to be dealing with that conflict of their identity versus who they really are.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Dean Fairbanks, the African-American dean, says to Sam that she's racist, and Sam replies, \"Black people can't be racist.\"\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, yeah. Actually, you know what? I don't believe-I don't agree with everything Sam says. I just want to put that for the record, like Sam is not my mouthpiece. Neither is Lionel. None of the characters just say what I believe. But I actually agree with her. I think racism is-it speaks to a system of disadvantage. I think that like, certainly, there are people who can be called racist because of very specific attitudes that they have, but it's about coming up in a system and being at a disadvantage because of race. And I think when you look at racism as a system, you know, as an infrastructure, I think that that is-that's more truthful, because people can be polite to me all day long and be sweet and nice, and I've never-I personally have never run into a lynch mob or had any issues like that, but I am at a disadvantage as a black man in this country, and that it's a much more complicated issue than just like what are you-being PC or being polite or, you know, saying the right-what's expected of you in a situation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's go to another clip.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Sure.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And this is Sam and Dean Fairbanks. Justin, set it up for us.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Oh, sure. So, this is-Dean Fairbanks is concerned that Sam's sort of like movement on the campus is gathering a lot of negative attention for the university, so he confronts her over a would-be rally to save the \"blackness\" of Armstrong/Parker residence hall.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : The role of counterculture is to wake up the mainstream.\n\nDEAN FAIRBANKS : [played by Dennis Haysbert] I have furniture older than you. Counterculture? Is that what you think this is? Your little show?\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : What about my show?\n\nDEAN FAIRBANKS : Your show is racist.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : Black people can't be racist. Prejudiced, yes, but not racist. Racism describes a system of disadvantage based on race. Black people can't be racist since we don't stand to benefit from such a system.\n\nDEAN FAIRBANKS : Your antics are making press, Sam. And press like this keeps men like President Fletcher up at night.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : Warm milk?\n\nDEAN FAIRBANKS : He's building a file on you.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : OK, it's not my fault that your son couldn't beat me in an election.\n\nDEAN FAIRBANKS : I'm sure it was tough growing up, wondering which side you'd fit into, feeling like you have to overcompensate, perhaps.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : If that's true, Dean, I'm not the only one.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's a clip from Dear White People , that's premiered here at the Sundance Film Festival. Justin, talk about that.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : You know, with that scene, I just-I really wanted to make a point of these two very different, but kind of valid in their own way, approaches of surviving in this place. I think, you know, for Dean Fairbanks, who kind of represents maybe an older guard, a different generation's way of thinking, you know, the answer is to not shake the boat, to simply be excellent, be better than excellent, and to never be controversial. And for Sam, you know, her thing is to just break everything in sight and cause a fuss. And I think that they both have really valid points, actually. And I think that they're both right in the scene. And I love-I love movies that do that, and I love scenes that do that, where you have two people that do not agree with each other, and they're both right, and they're both wrong. And I just wanted to-you know, I just wanted the two of them to come head to head in that way.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We haven't even talked about what this whole film leads up to, and that is the-what, the African-American-themed costume party. Was this Halloween?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, Halloween in the film, yeah, mm-hmm. But, you know, there's a billion-I mean, they happen at-it happens at Halloween time, happens for Martin Luther King Day. You know, it happens a lot. And sometimes-and oftentimes it doesn't even make the news. I mean, a lot of times, you know, in just doing research and talking to people, they're like, \"Yeah, that happened at my school. It never got out, but it happened.\" And it's happened at Ivy Leagues. It's happened at smaller institutions. It happens, you know, in grad programs. Like, it's a thing that happens.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, as we just said, it just happened at Arizona State University-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, just happened. Yeah, that's right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -for Martin Luther King Day.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's right. That's right. And I think-you know, I think part of it is-and what I also wanted to do, I didn't want to vilify anyone in the film. I think that one of the most interesting things about researching these parties is the responses that these students give after the fact. And believe it or not, there really is a sort of a naïveté to what they're saying and a really sort of like-they kind of didn't realize like how messed up this was and didn't completely comprehend how that would come across to a minority, particularly in those environments. And ultimately, the movie, to me, is not even really about racism; it's about identity and about sort of like what is the mask that you wear, what is the mask that you're forced to wear by the culture around you. And there's no better way to get into that than by showing students who are literally wearing blackface and wearing these masks and wearing these costumes that, to them, represent Martin Luther King. To me, like there's just no-there's no-that, to me, was like a perfect end, and particularly since it's kind of a phenomenon. I mean, it happens every year, all the time, no matter how many times these controversial stories come out.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And you show clips-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -from around the country.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Sure.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You know, not just below the Mason-Dixon Line.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's right, yeah, yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You have Dartmouth. A fraternity-sorority holds a \"Bloods and Crips\" party. We have-just saw Arizona State, Florida. How did you do the research? How did you find all this?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I mean, Google is a really easy way to do it, but also asking a lot of questions and reading a lot. You know, there's a lot of books that went into just, you know, my understanding of the issue. I wanted to-I wanted to tell the truth, but I also wanted to be fair, and I wanted to be honest. And I didn't want anyone to come across as a villain, you know, so-so, yeah, there was a lot of that. And I specifically looked for the response from, you know, the fraternity or the group or whoever did it. I was looking for the response that they gave. And also a big influence was just what happens on TV, like, you know, when you have these sort of mostly white comedy rooms that do black jokes. You know, whether it's, you know, cartoons for adults or sketch shows or whatever, like, you find these sort of black jokes bubbling up from all-white writers' rooms, and it's interesting. And I can always sort of tell that there's-when there's not a black guy in that writers' room and-or a black woman, for that matter. And I just thought that that was interesting, because I think, for some people, because racism is-it's more subversive now, and it is about the infrastructure, as opposed to, you know, specific, say, rights being taken away-of course, that's an issue, too. Particularly in this past election, we saw that. But, you know, because it's sort of relaxed little bit, I think people feel the right and, you know, feel like it's OK to sort of-to make those jokes, but they don't realize that it actually-it really is harmful and hurts, you know, for a minority to see that kind of stuff.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And you have the characters at this party literally unmask.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, that's absolutely right. And they all have-they all arrive at the party with different ideas about it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And you have a leading African-American character, black woman, Coco.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Explain her role in all of this.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : To me, Coco is the kind of person that understands that identity is just a form of currency. Like, I don't think that she-I think that she actually, in a funny way, knows more who she is than Sam does at certain points. And she just-she realized that being a black person, it's not-it's a mask that I wear anyway, so why not use it to get what I want? And, you know, she-I don't want to give too much away, but she is involved in the party, in ways that may feel a little unseemly, but honestly, we all do it. We all do it a little bit. And, you know, we all sort of use our blackness to get us someplace. That's been my experience. And I don't know if everyone wants to cop to that or admit to that, but sometimes it comes in handy. And the way people see you, you know, is something to be used sometimes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's the director of a new film called Dear White People . He is Justin Simien, speaking to us at Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, along with Marque Richardson, who plays the character Reggie in the film. Richardson has played a number of roles, including Kenneth in the HBO series True Blood . We'll have more with them in a minute.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We go back to our interview with Justin Simien, the director of the remarkable new film Dear White People , which premiered at Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, where the film won a U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Breakthrough Talent. Dear White People also played in New York this weekend at the New Directors/New Films cinema-festival, with Justin Simien and Marque Richardson, who plays the character Reggie in the film. I asked Justin about the theme of reality shows that runs throughout Dear White People .\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : You see this with every-especially now, every ethnic pocket. Every cultural pocket that seems a bit different from the mainstream now has a reality show around it. And you have these people who I think probably feel a pressure to really play up whatever their thing is, because without that, the show is really not that interesting, you know, if they're not the extreme version of whatever it is the thing is, you know, whether it's a show set in Atlanta or Jersey or whatever the-whatever the subculture may be. I mean, you know, it's entertainment. They're sort of using their identities to entertain the mainstream culture. And there's something about that that's very disturbing. And I wanted-but there's also-there's also opportunity there for these people to make a living and to make a life for themselves, and I kind of wanted to-I wanted to get into that a little bit, because that's a reality of being a minority in this country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Marque, did you ever experience anything like this on campus, a black-themed party, not African-American partygoers, but the whites on campus?\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah, it was-it wasn't a black-themed party, but, I mean, you have, you know, Cinco de Mayo parties. You have, you know, Chinese New Year.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Cinco de Mayo parties.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah, all these different-so, as minorities as a whole-right before we started shooting, a friend was throwing a white-trash party. That's what they called it, a white-trash party. And I had read the script. And prior to reading the script, I probably would have went. I probably wouldn't have even thought-you know, I wouldn't have thought anything of it. But I didn't go, because it was the same thing-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : -in terms of-you know, whether it's economics, it's the same thing.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Marque, you've acted in a lot of different productions, like True Blood , for people who know that vampire series.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah, some [inaudible].\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What about your experience in getting jobs, the few jobs for African Americans? This is an amazing film, because you actually see, you know, a core of African-American actors, characters. How much-how different is this from your other work?\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Well, first off, we-you know, Justin allowed us to play, you know, and this was-I honestly can say that this is the proudest thing I've ever worked on. So, you know, just from the work, just from the message, just from all that it is, so that's the hugest difference for me. In terms-I think, in terms of black actors, you know, we are put into a box. I, fortunately, have not been put into a box. A lot of the stuff that I've done has not been, you know, the stereotypical gangster, or I haven't had to wear a dress-but not saying I'm not opposed to it, but I have not had to do it.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Not on camera, anyway.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Not on camera, anyway. Just for the wrap party. But I have not had to do that. So, to actually play this militant character was exciting for me, because I don't live there, you know? I don't-in my life, I don't live there. I do get angry a lot about different things, but I don't live there.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's talk about the rule book that Sam White writes, \"Ebony and Ivy.\" It's interesting, because we just did an interview with Craig Wilder , and he wrote the book, Ebony and Ivy -\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -which is about the roots of Ivy League universities, how they gained from slavery, actual slavery, in their founding. But she has this rule book she has written. Talk about it.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Sure. It's a survival guide. It's a survival guide for being a black face in a white space. And, you know, I thought-it's just something that I thought she would do. And in it is a series of, what they're called, paper bag tests. And it's meant to be tests for black people to take to find out how black they are. And she's-you know, it's just sort of her tongue-in-cheek, you know, kind of anarchistic way of getting her point across, that it really does take sort of wearing a certain mask to survive at this place.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, let's go to another clip from Dear White People , and this is Samantha White narrating, well, one of those tests.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : The tip test. You hit up Jellies for a snack. Your waitress mistakes you for someone who looks like you, black, who once ran up a $30 bill and left a dollar tip. You watch all the other customers order before you do.\n\nLIONEL HIGGINS : [played by Tyler James Williams] Pastrami sandwich on rye.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : And then proceed to wait no less than 40 minutes for your food. How do you tip? A.\n\nLIONEL HIGGINS : Forty minutes? She's lucky if she gets 40 cents. OK, you do a good job, maybe see a tip.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : B.\n\nLIONEL HIGGINS : She was trippin', but 15 percent is the least I can do.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : Or C.\n\nLIONEL HIGGINS : I reject the stereotype that African Americans do not tip. I will leave 20-no, 25, just to prove that I can.\n\n\"One Hundred, Oofta, Nose Job\"?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So that ended with-well, that was the narration of Sam and ends with Lionel saying he's going to tip big.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Justin?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's-I mean, I'm sorry, but that is a real pressure that I feel as a black person whenever I go to a restaurant.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Same, same, same, yeah.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Especially when the service is bad, because like-it's like, well, damn, like, I don't want to-I don't want to reinforce the stereotype, but I also-like, you didn't come and check on us for like an hour, you know? And I'm, unfortunately-you know, I fall-I pick C just about every time. You know, I always overtip, because I feel this pressure that I'm expected to undertip. And it's a thing, like it's a real thing that I just think is an interesting aspect of being a black person in the world.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Marque, you raised your hand.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Same, guilty, guilty of it. But-but I refuse-you know, if I get bad service, I'll leave a reason. I'll write a reason on the receipt-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : -why you're not getting a tip, so it was not because I'm black. It's because you didn't check on me for 20 minutes. Yeah.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's a better way to do it.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's a better way to do it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What are some of the other rules?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Well, there's a couple things that didn't make the film that, you know, we'll see what happens in the future life of these characters. But there was a dance test that was in there for a long time. It was called the twerk test, of what do you do-what do you do when there's like a dance craze that's sweeping the nation that starts with black people, whether it's the \"Single Ladies\" dance or how to Dougie or the twerk.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Wait, the \"Single Ladies\" dance?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, remember the Beyoncé \"Single Ladies\" dance? How to Dougie or twerk, whatever it may be, and all your white friends are expecting you to teach them how to do it, which is also a really annoying, but very real aspect of being a black person with a bunch of white friends, because, one, like even if you do know how to do it, there's just something that feels wrong in like sort of like getting up and teaching people how to-I don't know, it just feels weird, feels a little too close to like tap dancing.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Shuckish-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : -and jivish, you know?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, feels a little-it's slightly shuckish. And so-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But you took it out.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah. Well, you know, we couldn't-we couldn't shoot it, unfortunately, just time and budgetary restrictions. But it is, you know, one of the realities of, you know, what do you do in that moment? Do you just teach them? Do you act like you don't know it? Or, you know, do you like throw a big fit and \"How dare you? And, you know, I will never shuck and jive for you, you know.\" But, you know, it's-I don't know. I just thought those were funny ways to talk about, you know, the kind of awkward moments that kind of happen for people who sort of live in between all the cultures like that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, one other thing, here you're on Democracy Now! , a global news hour, and of your main characters, two of them are journalists, in a sense. I mean, you've got Sam with her camera all the time.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Sure.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And she's got that microphone in front of her face saying, \"Dear White People.\"\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And also Lionel is a local journalist-I mean, is a journalist on campus.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Sure, that's right. I think that might come-I don't even know if that was particularly conscious, to be honest. But I knew that-I knew that what I wanted to talk about in this movie is culture and how culture affects our identities, and how identities come into conflict with who we are. And so, it was really important-I think where that comes from is that, you know, even the name of the movie, Dear White People , is sort of an admission that in a lot of ways black culture is in response to white mainstream culture. And so, you know, while I can't say it was like-it was on purpose, I think that there's-you know, subconsciously, there is a reason why the characters in some way are contributing to culture, whether or not it's the black culture on their campus or the mainstream culture on their campus, because, you know, that, to me, is just a really interesting issue and, in many ways, like subversively dangerous. And yeah, so I think that's where that came from.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : As you introduced Dear White People here at Sundance, at its showings, you give white people permission to laugh.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, that's right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What do you say?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : You know, I just say to all the white people in the audience, on behalf of all the black people in the world, you have the right to laugh. You get a free honorary black card with each Sundance ticket. Because it is-it's meant to be a satire, you know? I think if you stop at the title, and you get the knee-jerk reaction-\"Oh, this is just going to be an indictment, you know, an hour-long indictment\"-you're kind of missing the point. It's the title of a movie, and I just want to put people at ease. It's OK, you know? This movie is meant for people of all races to connect to. I think that the issue of being an other is a universal human experience. I happen to be talking about it from a black point of view, and just like every filmmaker is talking about whatever they're talking about from their point of view. And that should make it no harder to watch or enjoy than any other movie.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, what are you working on now? Or is it possible to even talk about that, since this is your first film? It has just broken out.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, it's exciting. No, I am very hungry to get a few other stories to the screen. There's a lot of things that I want to say. And I'm excited about all the possibilities after this film, particularly after this reception, to say-to say even more daring and interesting things.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : How do you compare Dear White People , would you, last year a film based on real-life experience, though it was a feature film-and we usually cover the documentary track, but this was, you know, so significant, was Fruitvale , Fruitvale Station ?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Absolutely, yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ryan Coogler\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I actually just met Ryan Coogler just now, yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Oh, he's here.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : It's very-yeah, it's very crazy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, how do you compare what you did, Dear White People , with that?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Well, first of all, they're very different films. But Fruitvale , what is so brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant about that movie is that, because you know how it's going to end at the beginning, you are watching this black man toggle his blackness and modulate his blackness around everyone-it's like a game of survival. He's one way with his mother. He's one way with his friends.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, of course, this is the film about Oscar Grant, who was killed by police at the Fruitvale station in California on New Year's Day.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's right. And he's-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And he then fictionalizes it.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Absolutely. And he's all these different versions of himself for all these different people, in all these different situations. And he slipped up. He was the wrong version of himself at the wrong time, and he died because of it. And that's a tragedy. And that's what it's like to be a black man in this country. And I think that that movie said that in such an eloquent and moving and beautiful, simple way. You know, to be even mentioned in the same, you know, reference with that film is an honor, because it really is a masterpiece. And, you know, I think that, you know, Ryan and I have very different approaches to talking about that issue, but it's that pressure to be a different version of yourself all the time that I think, you know, our films share. We share that same message.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The director of Dear White People , Justin Simien, along with Marque Richardson, who plays the character Reggie in the film Dear White People . It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, where we interviewed them earlier this year. There, it won the U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Breakthrough Talent. The film also played this weekend in New York at the New Directors/New Films festival. Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions have just bought the film.\n\nAnd that does it for our broadcast.

      "text": "Un deseo flamea sobre Mississippi: Estudiantes universitarios piden retirar símbolos racistas\n\nPublicado el 23 de octubre de 2015\n\nAmy Goodman y Denis Moynihan\n\nHan pasado cuatro meses desde la masacre perpetrada en la Iglesia Metodista Africana Emanuel de Charleston, Carolina del Sur, en la que perdieron la vida nueve pacíficos integrantes de su congregación. Aquellas balas presuntamente disparadas por el partidario de la supremacía blanca Dylann Storm Roof hirieron de muerte a varias personas, pero podrían también haber asestado un duro golpe a la Confederación. Pocos días después de la masacre, la bandera confederada fue retirada del predio del capitolio estatal de Alabama. La bandera desapareció además de las góndolas y sitios web de tiendas como Wal-Mart, Amazon y Etsy. Diez días después, la activista afroestadounidense Bree Newsome trepó uno de los mástiles ubicados en el predio del parlamento de Carolina del Sur, retiró la bandera confederada y fue inmediatamente arrestada. La bandera fue colocada nuevamente en su lugar y le tomó casi dos semanas más al parlamento controlado por los republicanos aprobar una ley -que fue luego promulgada por la gobernadora republicana Nikki Haley- que establece el retiro de la bandera de batalla de la Confederación de una vez y para siempre del predio del Parlamento de Carolina del Sur. La bandera flameaba allí desde 1961, primero sobre la cúpula del Capitolio y luego, a un costado, en el monumento en conmemoración de la Guerra de Secesión.\n\nMientras Dylan Roof permanece en prisión, a la espera de que comiencen los juicios en su contra por cargos federales y estatales, el movimiento generado a raíz de la masacre continúa creciendo. Recientemente, los estudiantes de la Universidad de Mississippi, en Oxford, se organizaron para exigir el retiro de la bandera estatal de Mississippi del predio de la universidad. La bandera de ese estado es la única de las 50 banderas estatales que mantiene el mismo diseño de estrellas y barras de la bandera confederada. En la esquina superior izquierda de esta bandera continúa flameando con orgullo ese símbolo de violencia racista y secesión.\n\nEl martes por la noche, el senado estudiantil de la Universidad de Mississippi ( ASB ) aprobó una resolución que propone retirar la bandera.  La resolución fue presentada por uno de sus senadores, un estudiante blanco llamado Allen Coon, presidente de la agrupación Universitarios Demócratas de la Universidad de Missisippi y fue aprobada en una votación de 33 votos a favor, 15 en contra y una abstención. Le pregunté a Allen Coon por qué abrazó la causa de enfrentarse a la bandera del estado de Mississippi. Me respondió:\n\n\"Después de los trágicos hechos que tuvieron lugar en Charleston, surgió este movimiento nacional que tiene por objetivo abordar el tema de la iconografía de la Confederación. Nuestra universidad está llena de símbolos de la Confederación y de la supremacía blanca. Creo que tenemos que aprovechar esta coyuntura para ocuparnos de esos símbolos. Por lo que a fines de septiembre me puse en contacto con nuestros aliados de la Asociación Nacional para el Progreso de la Gente de Color de la universidad y decidimos formar una coalición e instar al senado estudiantil a adoptar una postura al respecto\".\n\nLa resolución contó con el apoyo de la filial de la Asociación Nacional para el Progreso de la Gente de Color ( NAACP , por sus siglas en inglés) de la universidad, cuya presidenta, Dominique Scott, me dijo: \"Esto muestra que los estudiantes se están uniendo de verdad, que queremos que se retire la bandera y que queremos institucionalizar la inclusión aquí en la universidad\". La Universidad de Mississippi ocupó un lugar central en el movimiento por los derechos civiles. En 1962, James Meredith se convirtió en el primer afroestadounidense que se inscribió en esta universidad como estudiante, ocho largos años después de que la Corte Suprema de Estados Unidos dejara formalmente sin efecto todas las leyes de segregación en instituciones educativas. A pesar de que el presidente John F. Kennedy desplegó militares para mantener el orden, estudiantes blancos partidarios de la segregación generaron disturbios cuando Meredith ingresó al predio de la universidad.\n\nIncluso el nombre de la universidad está impregnado de racismo. La Universidad de Mississippi recibe comúnmente el nombre de \"'Ole Miss.\" Dominique Scott explicó la historia del sobrenombre:\n\n\"Históricamente, el término 'Ole Miss' era utilizado por los esclavos para referirse a las señoras o matriarcas de sus plantaciones. Cuando la institución estaba decidiendo cuál sería el sobrenombre de la universidad, alguien citó a una mujer que había dicho que 'Ole Miss' era la forma en que los negros de antes se referirían a la señora de las plantaciones.  Cuando se aprobó por votación el uso de 'Ole Miss', el favorito era en realidad 'Ole Massa'. El término está definitivamente impregnado de una historia de supremacía blanca y de opresión racial\".\n\nEl racismo se encuentra aún muy presente en la universidad. Según recordó Dominique Scott, \"en 2013, tres personas colocaron alrededor del cuello de la estatua de James Meredith una horca hecha con la antigua bandera del estado de Georgia. Profirieron insultos racistas y gritaron 'poder blanco' a fin de intimidar a los estudiantes negros de la universidad y una vez más perpetuar esa cultura de supremacía blanca y opresión racial\". Durante la marcha realizada en la universidad en apoyo a la resolución de los estudiantes de retirar la bandera, un grupo de partidarios de la supremacía blanca llevó a cabo una contramarcha en la que portaron la bandera de la Confederación y gritaron consignas racistas.\n\nLas autoridades de la universidad afirman estar orgullosas de la postura que están adoptando los estudiantes. Sin embargo, como institución estatal, la universidad afirma estar obligada a izar la bandera oficial del estado, aunque alienta al gobierno estatal a cambiarla. Dominique Scott considera que la postura oficial de la universidad es \"cobarde\". Al menos otras tres universidades de Mississippi han retirado la bandera, además de las ciudades de Greenwood y Oxford. Está previsto que Jackson, la capital del estado, siga los mismos pasos. Allen Coon apoya su opinión: \"Se trata de una resolución no vinculante. Por lo tanto, cuando pase a las principales autoridades de la universidad, estas tienen la oportunidad de escuchar lo que expresamos o no. Pero hemos recibido indicios de que podrían no necesariamente retirar la bandera cuando presentemos esta resolución. Así que tendremos que hacer aún algo más. Y resulta decepcionante ver que nuestra voz no alcanza, que las acciones que llevamos a cabo no son suficientes para retirar ese símbolo de opresión de nuestra universidad\".\n\nLa educación es un proceso de ida y vuelta. El rector de la Universidad de Mississippi  debería aprender de sus estudiantes y retirar la bandera ya.\n\n© 2015 Amy Goodman\n\nTraducción al español del texto en inglés : Fernanda Gerpe.

On the balcony outside room 306, where Dr. King last stood, museum co-founder Judge D'Army Bailey talks about Dr. King's legacy and the long struggle for the museum that honors it. [includes rush transcript]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We're standing on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in front of room 306, where Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated the evening of April 4, 1968. I'm standing with Judge D'Army Bailey, who is the founder of the National Civil Rights Museum, which is what the Lorraine Motel has been incorporated into today.\n\nJudge Bailey, where were you when Dr. Martin Luther King was assassinated here on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel?\n\nJUDGE D'ARMY BAILEY : I was working in New York in the national headquarters of the American Civil Liberties Union, and I ran an organization that had the responsibility of recruiting law students and sending them to the South to help on civil rights work. So I had 10 law students that were in Memphis working with the sanitation strike and with the lawyers here. And I was in my office in Manhattan packing my briefcase to take a plane the next morning to Memphis, because they had that march coming up within two or three days. And so, I was there in my office, and my secretary came in, and she said - she had the radio on - she said that she had just heard that Dr. King had been shot in Memphis, and I sat at my desk, stunned. And within about 10 minutes, she came back out crying and said that he had died.\n\nAnd I finished packing very quickly and walked downstairs with her and put her in a taxi, and then I went over and took the Lexington uptown to Grand Central Station, and when I got off the train in Grand Central Station, no one was speaking to anybody. It was just tense and quiet. And you could cut the tension with a knife there. And I went on uptown to - and shortly later that night, the rioting started in Harlem and in other parts of the country.\n\nAnd I did come on to Memphis the next day. And when I got here, the city was under martial law, and National Guard troops were throughout the city. And, of course, the march did occur, that Dr. King was to lead, two days later, I think, on the 8th of April. And thousands of people were here. Mrs. King came with her children. I talked with Mrs. King when we brought her here for the dedication of the museum, and she told me the story that she was - that some of her family members had urged her not to come to that march - they were fearful in the wake of the assassination - and that Harry Belafonte had called her and said, \"Mrs. King, you've got to go,\" and that that was what tipped the scales, had caused her to come to Memphis and be in that march.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Can you talk about how this motel has been turned into a museum?\n\nJUDGE D'ARMY BAILEY : Well, the owner of the motel was a black man by the name of Walter Bailey, same name as my father, and including middle initial, but we weren't related. But he had struggled in the years following the assassination to keep the doors of the motel open, because business had declined with blacks being able to go to the white hotels, and also this area was declining. And so, the motel went up for foreclosure.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Is it true that Mr. Bailey's wife died as a result of the killing of Dr. Martin Luther King?\n\nJUDGE D'ARMY BAILEY : Mr. Bailey's wife, Loree Bailey, used to help him run this place, and she had a stroke on the night of the assassination, and she died two days later.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So the motel was operating for a few years after Dr. King was assassinated?\n\nJUDGE D'ARMY BAILEY : Yes. It continued to operate, although, frankly, the clientele were prostitutes mostly and just sort of transient trade. They had maybe eight or 10 weekly tenants here. It was on hard times.\n\nI joined with a group of four other African Americans in Memphis and we formed a nonprofit group to raise money, and we bought the Lorraine with $140,000 in a foreclosure auction on the courthouse step.\n\nMy feeling, having been involved as a student activist in the civil rights movement - I was expelled from Southern University in 1962 for participating in sit-in protests and arrested at Gwynn Oak amusement park in 1963 in Baltimore for trying to desegregate a segregated park. So I had - and I had traveled through the South, and I knew about the strength and courage of John Lewis and Ella Baker and Dave Dennis and Bob Moses and Jim Foreman and others who had been through the movement. And I felt that if we used this site to tell the story of that struggle, to recreate it in as dramatic and dynamic a way possible, the courage and the sacrifice, the determination that young people made to help turn around this country, and so we used the site of a tragedy to exploit it in a communications way to tell the story of a deep movement, of a deeper story of the movement.\n\nSo it's not a museum that celebrates Dr. King; it's a museum that celebrates the spirit of a movement. And so, we had the exhibits on Selma and on Montgomery, and on the Freedom Summer of 1954, and we had the exhibit on the courage of the nine black children at Central High School in Little Rock, who braved the mobs to desegregate that school, and James Meredith's singular courage to desegregate the University of Mississippi, and, of course, finally this tragic event that occurred here on April 4th of 1968.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You actually have preserved the pavement that is red with Dr. King's blood to this day.\n\nJUDGE D'ARMY BAILEY : You know, I just couldn't believe, Amy, when they told me, before we even started the renovation, and this balcony was here, and Mr. Bailey had kind of preserved a little room here, which was the room that Dr. King had come out of with book cases and display of the dishes that he last ate from and the bedspread that had been thrown over him when he lay here on the balcony, so he had created sort of his own exhibit in here, but that was the only part that was open as for an exhibit. But when they told me that that was his bloodstains in this old balcony, it was just hard to believe that in 1968, the assassination, and here we were 20 years later, and the bloodstain is still speaking to us from that concrete. And so, I knew that we couldn't just tear up this balcony. We had to put in a new balcony, because of the deterioration of the old one, but I knew we couldn't tear that up, and so I asked the contractors to cut that part out of the old balcony, and that's been reinstalled here in this balcony here.\n\nTo me, the importance of Dr. King's death is the inspiration that we do something positive to make change. And so, we ought to be using this day in strategy meetings on how we're going to go out and challenge the local companies and businesses that don't have equal opportunities at the high levels of management and on their boards of directors, and we need to be going to meet with these political officials who are not demanding that we have programs to deal with the homelessness and with the poor and with the lack of educational opportunities for kids who are struggling. And so, we need to be developing strategies and implementing strategies. This is not a day for ceremony. It ought to be a day for action.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So you're talking about challenging the very corporations that support the National Civil Rights Museum.\n\nJUDGE D'ARMY BAILEY : I think we must. And I recognize that you have to have corporate support, but the problem occurs when it dominates in its support and when the chairman of the executive committee is one of the corporate leaders, a conservative Republican who had George Bush as a guest in his home to raise funds against Congressman Harold Ford Jr. That's the man who chairs the executive committee of this museum.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Who is that?\n\nJUDGE D'ARMY BAILEY : Pitt Hyde, J.R. Pitt Hyde, who formed the AutoZone Corporation here, which is sponsoring a big ceremonial basketball game celebrating Dr. King. And yet AutoZone Corporation has been in litigation with the Equal Employment Opportunities Commission on issues of - allegedly where there were some 63 managers hired and promoted and none were African-American. And so, you have to recognize that as you allow this corporate control and involvement, then you sort of paralyze yourself in terms of being able to be proactive to make those very corporations accountable. Now, to the extent that - and especially in a small town like Memphis. Now, if you're in a large city, you have a number of possible supporters you can go to, and you have a diversification of influence. But where it boils down to two or three or four corporations who work with each other in tandem on most charitable projects, then it becomes a very close and tight control. And that's not just with the museum. The NAACP here in Memphis gets most of its finances from local corporations. And so, they have to find harmonious kind of social programs, as opposed to the hard issues that challenge these corporations.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is also the headquarters of FedEx, isn't it? Fred Smith, the CEO , who is a well-known Republican activist.\n\nJUDGE D'ARMY BAILEY : Yes, Fred Smith. And he and Pitt Hyde, the chairman of this museum's executive committee, which meets monthly and sets its policy and controls its operations, and yet you can see that the actual maintenance is not really that good here. There are cobwebs here in the windowsill. There needs to be painting out here. And this same board would give $50,000 to Bono or to Oprah Winfrey in a freedom award, cash money, when it could use that money to paint up here, and you wouldn't have all of these repair issues.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Judge Bailey, the founder of the National Civil Rights Museum that incorporates the Lorraine Motel, where we're standing now on the balcony outside room 306, where Dr. Martin Luther King had walked out of on April 4, 1968, in the evening, looked out over the balcony and was assassinated.\n\nWe are hiring for an Individual Giving Manager to support our fundraising team!"

One of the main characters, Sam, hosts the campus radio show \"Dear White People,\" where she confronts the racist stereotypes and dilemmas faced by students of color. Racial tensions on campus come to a head when a group of mostly white students throw an African-American-themed party, wearing blackface and using watermelons and fake guns as props. We speak to actor Marque Richardson and award-winning, first-time director Justin Simien.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : A new film tackling racial politics in contemporary America is getting a major Hollywood break. The film, Dear White People , took the Sundance Film Festival by storm earlier this year, winning U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Breakthrough Talent. Now, Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions have acquired rights to the film, pretty much guaranteeing a wide U.S. and Canadian distribution.\n\nDear White People examines race relations through comedy and satire. While it elicits many laughs from the audience, at its core, it's a serious film. The film follows a group of black students at a fictional, predominantly white, Ivy League school called Winchester University. One of the main characters, Sam, hosts a radio show on campus called Dear White People , where she confronts the racist stereotypes and dilemmas faced by students of color. Racial tensions on campus come to a head when a group of mostly white students throw an African-American-themed party wearing blackface and using watermelons and fake guns as props.\n\nThe concept is not all that far-fetched. Just as the film was premiering at Sundance, a fraternity at Arizona State University decided to mark Martin Luther King Day by holding a, quote, \" MLK Black Party\" where white partygoers donned basketball jerseys, flashed gang signs and drank from cups made of watermelons. When posting photos of the event to social media, they used hashtags like \"hood,\" \"blackout for MLK ,\" \"my boy martin\" and \"kill em.\"\n\nMore recently, three freshmen were expelled from their fraternity at University of Mississippi, popularly known as Ole Miss, for hanging a noose and plastering a flag bearing the Confederate symbol on a statue of James Meredith, a civil rights hero who was the first African American to attend the university. The fraternity was also suspended after the incident, which took place in February during Black History Month.\n\nFurther north, at one of the world's top universities, students of color say they're tired of people suggesting they don't belong. Black students at Harvard recently began a photo montage campaign called \"I, Too, Am Harvard\" that went viral. In it, students hold signs that say things like \"Having an opinion does not make me an 'Angry Black Woman'\" and \"No, I will not teach you how to twerk.\" A Harvard student named Ahsante Bean made this promo video for the campaign.\n\nHARVARD STUDENT 1: There's always that moment when you're the only black student in your section.\n\nHARVARD STUDENT 2: When, in class, and you're the only black kid, and this-the N-word comes up or some-in a book or something where there's slavery or whatever it is.\n\nHARVARD STUDENT 1: And the issue of race comes up or the issue of slavery or the issue of whatever. Everyone looks to you ...\n\nHARVARD STUDENT 2: Everyone looks to you -\n\nHARVARD STUDENT 1: ... as if you're about to speak for your race.\n\nHARVARD STUDENT 2: As if, like, you represent everybody in the race, and suddenly your voice will, like, carry such weight.\n\nHARVARD STUDENT 1: And it's kind of frustrating, because you would hope that people would understand that there are all different types of black people, and black people don't all have the same opinions about the same issues.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : An excerpt from the promo video, \"I, Too, Am Harvard.\"\n\nWell, black students have launched similar campaigns across the country, including at the University of Mississippi, after the incident involving the James Meredith statue, and at University of Michigan, after a fraternity planned a \"hood\"-themed party invoking racial stereotypes. That party was canceled following an uproar. Campaigns by students of color demanding acceptance and respect have also been launched abroad, at Cambridge and Oxford.\n\nWell, the film Dear White People deals with these very real issues in creative and often humorous ways. The film just showed here-is showing this weekend at New Directors/New Films festival presented by the Film Society of Lincoln Center and the Museum of Modern Art. It's scheduled for a theatrical release this year.\n\nWhile at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, earlier this year, I sat down with the film's director, Justin Simien, who was recently named one of Variety 's \"10 Directors to Watch.\" We were also joined by Marque Richardson, who plays Reggie in the film. I began by asking the director, Justin Simien, about the film's storyline.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : You know, the story revolves around four black kids at a mostly white Ivy League college. And Samantha White is-you know, she's sort of this Angela Davis, Malcolm X, Huey from The Boondocks , you know, Lisa Bonet's character from The Cosby Show amalgamation of, you know, a girl who really hangs her identity on being this black militant in this white place and sort of really challenging the status quo and trying to, what she calls, pop the post-racial bubble and sort of this illusion that because Barack Obama is president and, you know, everyone loves Beyoncé, that somehow we're all past race. You know, that's really her thing.\n\nLionel Higgins, who is sort of like on the polar opposite end, has no black identity to speak of in the beginning of the film, and because he is also gay and dealing with sexual issue-you know, sexual identity issues, is sort of really feeling sort of, you know, like he belongs in no place and very much in the middle and sort of watching the other black characters in the film from the sidelines.\n\nCoco Conners, whose government name is Colandrea, is, you know, also kind of a flipside of Sam. She's just taking a different approach to sort of owning her black identity. You know, some might call her a bit of a conformist. She definitely comes in the package that I think, you know, the people at this particular school would, you know, expect-what she believes that they expect from. But she also is kind of daring and cunning in her way of surviving in this place.\n\nAnd then you have Troy Fairbanks, which is-he's sort of the poster black child of diversity of the school. He's the son of the dean. He's a legacy kid. He's a, you know, perfectly coiffed sort of, you know, Essence , Ebony magazine kind of black man and is sort of like a nonthreatening version of black for his white friends, but, you know, he can black it up when need be for his black friends. So-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And his dad is Dennis Haysbert, who is-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : His dad is played fantastically by Dennis Haysbert, who-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Who is the president of the United States in 24 .\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's right. That's right. That's right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In 24 .\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's right. But, you know, at Winchester, only the dean. There's also a president of the school, that doesn't deserve it, but is, you know, his boss. And it's that sort of like-you know, when a-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Who is white, and the dean is black.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, exactly, who is white. And I just wanted to sort of get into the pressure that I, as a black man, feel from, you know, my parents' generation of just sort of what they had to go through and, you know, this idea that the \"Talented Tenth\" has to work 10 times harder, and we have to appear perfect and, you know, have everything. That's a kind of pressure that I don't know if people who aren't minorities feel.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, who are you?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Who am I?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In Dear White People .\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Oh, god, I'm all of them. I'm all of them, truly. I mean, I like to say, because it's easy to say, that I entered college Lionel and left as Sam. But the truth is, is that I'm each one of those characters. I mean, there are really autobiographical threads in all of them.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, it's amazingly diverse. And here at Sundance, when the film premiered, one of the audience members raised their hand and congratulated you for the diversity. And in response, you came out.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, yeah, that's true. I mean, I've never been in, but yeah. I mean, that happened years ago. But, you know, no one has really asked me to stand in front of a bunch of people and talk about myself, so, you know. But yeah, I mean, I think it's an-I think it's an important thing to talk about. I think it's a thing that, like, is still an issue in the black community for black men to own their sexual identity and to say that, yeah, I can be all of these things and be gay and be black, and still it's all good. All these things can still-can coexist together. And, you know, I think Lionel's trepidation over that is certainly an anchor for a lot of people in the film.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Justin, talk about the inspiration for this film.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : The beginning really came from two places. I mean, I had had a college experience that was certainly not as extreme as the events that take place in the film, but, you know, this sense of being one of very few black people in the room and having to sort of toggle my blackness and what parts of my identity I showed to people based on what groups of friends I was with was something that I felt like that was kind of what all of my friends were doing and feeling the pressure to do, and I wanted to talk about that in the movie. And-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Where did you go to school?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I went to school at Chapman University. It's a great school.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : In California.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, a great school, really lovely people, lots of people touching my hair, lots of people thinking I could play basketball. You know, it was funny. It was like-it was kind of anecdotal. And that's really where it began. And it really wasn't until I started to research particularly what has happened at Ivy League schools, research blackface parties, which are unfortunately a very common occurrence in predominantly white institutions, that the script really, for me, began to be more about the American black experience, as opposed to my specific college experience. And I began to treat Winchester University as a microcosm of, you know, this sort of identity crisis that I feel like-I know I'm having, that my black friends are having, and, you know, just-and finding ways to sort of broach these sort of uncomfortable topics, you know, as we go through life.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, you've been driven to do this. It's not like it's your 10th film.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Sure, yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is your first film.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And you've been working on it for a few years. What were you doing in between?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I actually was a studio publicist for a while. I worked at several major studios doing publicity, online publicity, that kind of thing, and most recently was doing sort of like independent-I'm sorry, not independent, but doing Internet content, like digital content, and all along, on the side, sort of writing and trying to work on the craft and push the boulder up the hill for the movie.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And so, what made you finally put down the day job-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -and just do the other full-time?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I think what it was is we made a concept trailer, you know? I had a script that I believed in. And particularly with a multi-protagonist script about-you know, ruminating on black consciousness and identity, you know, I felt like I needed to do something to give people a reason to let it come in the room and pitch myself. So I, you know, poured my tax return into a concept trailer.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And a concept trailer, for people who don't know, is just sort of like a-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : It's like an as if-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -big trailer?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : As if the movie existed. You know, we cut like a three-minute piece, and I just shot what's in the trailer. You know, we shot it very quickly over two days, with no money, and put that online, and it blew up. And, you know, a year and a half later, we were able to get the financing and actually make the movie. So, when the concept trailer hit, though, I just felt like I needed to do something dramatic. And so I quit my job and basically said, \"You know what? Making this movie is the only thing that matters to me right now.\" And it was a year and a half of figuring out, but we finally did.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The director of Dear White People , Justin Simien, speaks to us at the Sundance Film Festival in Park City, Utah, earlier this year. In our next segment, he'll be joined by Marque Richardson, who plays the character Reggie in the film. We'll have more in a minute.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : This is Democracy Now! , democracynow.org, The War and Peace Report . I'm Amy Goodman, as we go back to our interview with Justin Simien, the director of the remarkable new film, Dear White People , that just played in New York this weekend. It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. With him is Marque Richardson, who plays the character Reggie in the film. I asked Justin Simien about his ensemble film, Dear White People , and who inspired him as he was making this film, his first ever.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I'm a big fan of ensemble films. They're probably-it's probably my favorite genre. I just love the way they're put together, and particularly when it comes to issues. I love films that talk about things like race from many, many different, conflicting points of view, because it's not-I never wanted to make a morality play. I never wanted to say this is how it is and this is what you should feel. I wanted these characters to disagree with each other and to all be struggling to figure out the answer, because, you know, I just think that that's more interesting. I think that speaks to the human experience. Movies like Network do that. Movies like Do the Right Thing do that, Election , even The Royal Tenenbaums . Like, they find a way to talk about the human condition from all of these different points of views. And particularly with race identity, I couldn't-I can't think of another way to do it. You know, there's just so many different ways to go about it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Reggie-well, you're Reggie in the film; you're Marque Richardson in real life.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yes, ma'am.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But talk about your character, Reggie.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah. Reggie represents the angry black man in my head. And so, in doing a lot of research, you know, for the project and for Reggie, I was listening to a lot of Malcolm X, Public Enemy, Flavor Flav, you know, just all of these prominent black leaders, and James Brown, you know, and-in terms of, you know, rebelling against the man or really having that strong black identity, and that's it. You know, so.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And talk about who Reggie is in-at Winchester University, where you go to school.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Reggie is-I had it that he's the Michelle Obama to Samantha, who is the Obama. You know, he's her support system, that's-he does everything for her.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Now, Sam is Dear White People . She has a radio show. She has a voice, and she is angry.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yes, yeah. Yeah, she is. And she's amazing. I'm going back into my character right now, [inaudible] character.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That you worship her.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah, I worship her, pretty much. Yeah, pretty much. So-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And you're an IT guy, too-I mean, in the film. You're very good. You know how to work the system. You-\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yes. Yes, yes, yes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And that serves you very well. What was it like to perform in this ensemble company? And how do things change? I want to ask both of you this. When you're all together, do things change as you're-you know, your lines change, the feelings change, as you're working together? Do you get inspired by the other people on the set?\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah, I say I was inspired by everybody on the set, just in terms of-because a lot of these people were my friends before we actually started to work. And, you know, to be able to work with your friends and actually work on a project that you're so proud of, even though it's not the easiest thing to do, was phenomenal. It was like a summer camp. And, you know, you take-I just took everything that happened and used it in the work, and you stay present. And, you know, we created this. So-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : And Marque Richardson is a beast, man. I mean, what was cool about it is that, like, it was just a bunch of beasts. I mean, seriously, like these really incredible actors who had not had a chance to really show this side of themselves in a movie before. And it was great to just see them sort of like see each other other's takes and get inspired. And, you know, you talk about things changing. I mean, you know, they always say there's a movie that you write, there's a movie that you make, and then there's a movie that you edit, and they're all different. And, you know, we had a very tight budget and schedule, and so, yeah, stuff changed all the time. I mean, there were all sorts of days where you'd walk in and say, \"Oh, well, this is the set we're shooting on now. How do we make the scene work for that?\"\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So let's go to the first clip. This is in Dear White People where Samantha White, who is played by Tessa Thompson, confronts Kurt Fletcher. Kurt is the character in the movie, and he's the son of the university president, President Fletcher. He's in the dining hall of Armstrong/Parker House. And explain Armstrong/Parker House.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Armstrong/Parker House is sort of the residence hall that's deemed like the black house, like where the black kids that want to be around other black kids historically have gone to. And it's basically being challenged by the administration, who thinks it's a sort of self-segregation, and so they're actually-they're actually randomizing housing. And so, this sort of like, you know, history of black students going to this school is in danger for the first time.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's go to the clip. And then I want to ask Marque what was it like to shoot this scene. This is Dear White People .\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : [played by Tessa Thompson] Well, on behalf of all the colored folks in the room, let me apologize to all the better-qualified white students whose place we're taking up.\n\nKURT FLETCHER : [played by Kyle Gallner] No, it's fine. We're OK.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : I'm sorry. Did you get lost? Bechet [ phon. ] is that way.\n\nKURT FLETCHER : I know where it is. I'm actually supposed eat there. Yeah, it's just there's-this is the only dining hall that you can actually get yourself some chicken-and waffles. Look, you're Dear White People , right? It's funny. It's funny stuff. It really is. How have we not staffed you yet?\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : Oh, me? Oh, what? On Pastiche , your uninspired humor magazine?\n\nKURT FLETCHER : It's actually much more than just a magazine, sweetheart. SNL 's staff is basically half- Lampoon , half- Pastiche . Same goes for the network comedies.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : And what gives you clubhouse kids the right to come to our dining hall? You don't live here.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED : Sam, what are you doing?\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : So you can't eat here.\n\nTROY FAIRBANKS : [played by Brandon Bell] Chill, Sam. Damn, all right, let the man eat.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : Got this.\n\nKURT FLETCHER : Got this. Look, who are you to throw me out?\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : Well, I think I'm head of this house. And I'm doing things my way.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That last voice, Sam White. She is the radio announcer, the radio host, and now the president of Armstrong/Parker House, throwing out the white guys. Yes, that's a clip from Dear White People . And our guests in studio are here at Sundance Film Festival headquarters, are the star of-one of the stars of this ensemble production, Dear White People , Marque Richardson, as well as the director, first-time director Justin Simien. Marque, talk about that scene.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : That scene was just-to be there and to watch the work-first off, the work of Tessa and Kyle, like Justin said, they were just beasts, and to see them play and to see them go at it with each other was just phenomenal, to be a witness of it. And then, for my character, anyway, it riled me up.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : OK.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : It was arousing, you know, because-you know, Sam is Reggie's muse. I mean, he does everything for her. And just to sit there and watch her work, as Reggie, was just-you know, that was love.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I think, in a lot of ways, too, Sam is sort of like-Sam and, then, eventually, other characters are sort of like mouthpieces for Reggie. Like-\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I think he-I think he likes when she does things that maybe he's too timid to do, you know, which I think is an interesting-\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I mean, I love-you know, one of the things I tell the actors is, in the cutting room, like I love to watch-you know, because the camera is on lots-on all the different groups in Armstrong/Parker House in that scene, and I love to watch them when they're not on camera. You know what I mean? When I know we're going to cut to Sam and Kyle, but I love just watching-I just loved watching them watch what was happening, because they never turn off. They're just always in the moment, and all these-so many good reactions to choose from.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, Marque, in your life, how much do you identify with Dear White People ?\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : A lot.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Where did you-where were you born?\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : I actually-I was born in San Diego, and I went to USC . And right before-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : University of Southern California.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah, University of Southern California-fight on. But right before this interview, I told Justin, I said, \"I just realized that I actually lived on an all-black floor at USC .\" And it just hit me that I lived this. You know, I lived this. And, you know, we would go off campus and integrate with other students and whatnot, but, you know, they would ask us why. You know, \"Why are you integrating yourselves? Why are you-you know, just living in your own world?\" And it was a support system, you know, to go out there in the world and have people try and touch your hair, have people, you know, professors, say these things to you, and to go back home and to share that experience with your people.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Interestingly, Sam, Tessa Thompson, throws out not only Kurt, the white president's son-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -who ends up throwing the-what would you call it? Not \"block party,\" \"black party,\" whatever you call it.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The costume party. But she also throws out Lionel.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Mm-hmm, yeah. I wanted to-first of all, I wanted to-I'm always about telling the truth and being honest, and I didn't want-I didn't want these to be just grandstanding archetypes. I wanted them to be complicated and complex and to sometimes do things that confuse people.\n\nAnd one of the things that I experienced in college-I'll never forget it-is, there was a moment when I was sitting in-you know, and I was new to the school, and, you know, I don't think particularly at the time I came in the expected, you know, black male package. I was kind of a mess. My hair was all over the place, not quite where Lionel's is in the movie, but-I don't know. I don't know what it was about me, but, you know, the Black Student Union meeting started to happen around me in this area that I-you know, I had seated to study and was kind of waiting for the meeting to start. It would have been my first meeting. I was brand new to the campus. And there was something about me they just didn't think I was down enough. And they were just like, \"Hey, so you know we're doing Black Student Union here. You might want to like leave.\" And I just remember, like, ooh, like that was such an awful feeling to not feel black enough in that environment, when, like, I feel like exoticized for being black in other-you know, in other areas of my experience.\n\nAnd, you know-and also because Sam White, in that moment, is saying, \"If you don't live in this residence hall, you don't eat here,\" it wasn't-I didn't want to make it specifically about the fact that they were white, because then that would make her just a racist. And, to me, that's not interesting. What's more interesting is her being about the principle of it, like if you're not down enough to live in Armstrong/Parker, you don't get to eat here. And that, to me, was more interesting.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And so, you have Lionel, the black, gay character in this film, being thrown out here.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Sure.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But when he walks into the newspaper room, he's assuring the white student, \"I'm not going to write for you. Don't worry.\"\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, yeah, yeah. And I wanted to talk about that toggle, that weird toggle of like-it's like a tap dance, you know what I mean? It's like it's a softshoe. You've got to-you've got to sort of be-you don't have to be, but certainly in college I felt a pressure to be different things to different groups of people, because of-you know, when you walk through the world as any minority, when you walk through the world as a woman, like, in every space you go, there's-you're aware that you are what you are and that people are going to have, you know, ideas about you just by seeing you. And I wanted each of the characters to be dealing with that conflict of their identity versus who they really are.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Dean Fairbanks, the African-American dean, says to Sam that she's racist, and Sam replies, \"Black people can't be racist.\"\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, yeah. Actually, you know what? I don't believe-I don't agree with everything Sam says. I just want to put that for the record, like Sam is not my mouthpiece. Neither is Lionel. None of the characters just say what I believe. But I actually agree with her. I think racism is-it speaks to a system of disadvantage. I think that like, certainly, there are people who can be called racist because of very specific attitudes that they have, but it's about coming up in a system and being at a disadvantage because of race. And I think when you look at racism as a system, you know, as an infrastructure, I think that that is-that's more truthful, because people can be polite to me all day long and be sweet and nice, and I've never-I personally have never run into a lynch mob or had any issues like that, but I am at a disadvantage as a black man in this country, and that it's a much more complicated issue than just like what are you-being PC or being polite or, you know, saying the right-what's expected of you in a situation.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's go to another clip.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Sure.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And this is Sam and Dean Fairbanks. Justin, set it up for us.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Oh, sure. So, this is-Dean Fairbanks is concerned that Sam's sort of like movement on the campus is gathering a lot of negative attention for the university, so he confronts her over a would-be rally to save the \"blackness\" of Armstrong/Parker residence hall.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : The role of counterculture is to wake up the mainstream.\n\nDEAN FAIRBANKS : [played by Dennis Haysbert] I have furniture older than you. Counterculture? Is that what you think this is? Your little show?\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : What about my show?\n\nDEAN FAIRBANKS : Your show is racist.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : Black people can't be racist. Prejudiced, yes, but not racist. Racism describes a system of disadvantage based on race. Black people can't be racist since we don't stand to benefit from such a system.\n\nDEAN FAIRBANKS : Your antics are making press, Sam. And press like this keeps men like President Fletcher up at night.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : Warm milk?\n\nDEAN FAIRBANKS : He's building a file on you.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : OK, it's not my fault that your son couldn't beat me in an election.\n\nDEAN FAIRBANKS : I'm sure it was tough growing up, wondering which side you'd fit into, feeling like you have to overcompensate, perhaps.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : If that's true, Dean, I'm not the only one.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's a clip from Dear White People , that's premiered here at the Sundance Film Festival. Justin, talk about that.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : You know, with that scene, I just-I really wanted to make a point of these two very different, but kind of valid in their own way, approaches of surviving in this place. I think, you know, for Dean Fairbanks, who kind of represents maybe an older guard, a different generation's way of thinking, you know, the answer is to not shake the boat, to simply be excellent, be better than excellent, and to never be controversial. And for Sam, you know, her thing is to just break everything in sight and cause a fuss. And I think that they both have really valid points, actually. And I think that they're both right in the scene. And I love-I love movies that do that, and I love scenes that do that, where you have two people that do not agree with each other, and they're both right, and they're both wrong. And I just wanted to-you know, I just wanted the two of them to come head to head in that way.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We haven't even talked about what this whole film leads up to, and that is the-what, the African-American-themed costume party. Was this Halloween?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, Halloween in the film, yeah, mm-hmm. But, you know, there's a billion-I mean, they happen at-it happens at Halloween time, happens for Martin Luther King Day. You know, it happens a lot. And sometimes-and oftentimes it doesn't even make the news. I mean, a lot of times, you know, in just doing research and talking to people, they're like, \"Yeah, that happened at my school. It never got out, but it happened.\" And it's happened at Ivy Leagues. It's happened at smaller institutions. It happens, you know, in grad programs. Like, it's a thing that happens.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Well, as we just said, it just happened at Arizona State University-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, just happened. Yeah, that's right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -for Martin Luther King Day.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's right. That's right. And I think-you know, I think part of it is-and what I also wanted to do, I didn't want to vilify anyone in the film. I think that one of the most interesting things about researching these parties is the responses that these students give after the fact. And believe it or not, there really is a sort of a naïveté to what they're saying and a really sort of like-they kind of didn't realize like how messed up this was and didn't completely comprehend how that would come across to a minority, particularly in those environments. And ultimately, the movie, to me, is not even really about racism; it's about identity and about sort of like what is the mask that you wear, what is the mask that you're forced to wear by the culture around you. And there's no better way to get into that than by showing students who are literally wearing blackface and wearing these masks and wearing these costumes that, to them, represent Martin Luther King. To me, like there's just no-there's no-that, to me, was like a perfect end, and particularly since it's kind of a phenomenon. I mean, it happens every year, all the time, no matter how many times these controversial stories come out.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And you show clips-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -from around the country.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Sure.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You know, not just below the Mason-Dixon Line.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's right, yeah, yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : You have Dartmouth. A fraternity-sorority holds a \"Bloods and Crips\" party. We have-just saw Arizona State, Florida. How did you do the research? How did you find all this?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I mean, Google is a really easy way to do it, but also asking a lot of questions and reading a lot. You know, there's a lot of books that went into just, you know, my understanding of the issue. I wanted to-I wanted to tell the truth, but I also wanted to be fair, and I wanted to be honest. And I didn't want anyone to come across as a villain, you know, so-so, yeah, there was a lot of that. And I specifically looked for the response from, you know, the fraternity or the group or whoever did it. I was looking for the response that they gave. And also a big influence was just what happens on TV, like, you know, when you have these sort of mostly white comedy rooms that do black jokes. You know, whether it's, you know, cartoons for adults or sketch shows or whatever, like, you find these sort of black jokes bubbling up from all-white writers' rooms, and it's interesting. And I can always sort of tell that there's-when there's not a black guy in that writers' room and-or a black woman, for that matter. And I just thought that that was interesting, because I think, for some people, because racism is-it's more subversive now, and it is about the infrastructure, as opposed to, you know, specific, say, rights being taken away-of course, that's an issue, too. Particularly in this past election, we saw that. But, you know, because it's sort of relaxed little bit, I think people feel the right and, you know, feel like it's OK to sort of-to make those jokes, but they don't realize that it actually-it really is harmful and hurts, you know, for a minority to see that kind of stuff.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And you have the characters at this party literally unmask.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, that's absolutely right. And they all have-they all arrive at the party with different ideas about it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And you have a leading African-American character, black woman, Coco.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Explain her role in all of this.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : To me, Coco is the kind of person that understands that identity is just a form of currency. Like, I don't think that she-I think that she actually, in a funny way, knows more who she is than Sam does at certain points. And she just-she realized that being a black person, it's not-it's a mask that I wear anyway, so why not use it to get what I want? And, you know, she-I don't want to give too much away, but she is involved in the party, in ways that may feel a little unseemly, but honestly, we all do it. We all do it a little bit. And, you know, we all sort of use our blackness to get us someplace. That's been my experience. And I don't know if everyone wants to cop to that or admit to that, but sometimes it comes in handy. And the way people see you, you know, is something to be used sometimes.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : That's the director of a new film called Dear White People . He is Justin Simien, speaking to us at Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, along with Marque Richardson, who plays the character Reggie in the film. Richardson has played a number of roles, including Kenneth in the HBO series True Blood . We'll have more with them in a minute.\n\n[break]\n\nAMY GOODMAN : We go back to our interview with Justin Simien, the director of the remarkable new film Dear White People , which premiered at Sundance Film Festival earlier this year, where the film won a U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Breakthrough Talent. Dear White People also played in New York this weekend at the New Directors/New Films cinema-festival, with Justin Simien and Marque Richardson, who plays the character Reggie in the film. I asked Justin about the theme of reality shows that runs throughout Dear White People .\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : You see this with every-especially now, every ethnic pocket. Every cultural pocket that seems a bit different from the mainstream now has a reality show around it. And you have these people who I think probably feel a pressure to really play up whatever their thing is, because without that, the show is really not that interesting, you know, if they're not the extreme version of whatever it is the thing is, you know, whether it's a show set in Atlanta or Jersey or whatever the-whatever the subculture may be. I mean, you know, it's entertainment. They're sort of using their identities to entertain the mainstream culture. And there's something about that that's very disturbing. And I wanted-but there's also-there's also opportunity there for these people to make a living and to make a life for themselves, and I kind of wanted to-I wanted to get into that a little bit, because that's a reality of being a minority in this country.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Marque, did you ever experience anything like this on campus, a black-themed party, not African-American partygoers, but the whites on campus?\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah, it was-it wasn't a black-themed party, but, I mean, you have, you know, Cinco de Mayo parties. You have, you know, Chinese New Year.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Cinco de Mayo parties.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah, all these different-so, as minorities as a whole-right before we started shooting, a friend was throwing a white-trash party. That's what they called it, a white-trash party. And I had read the script. And prior to reading the script, I probably would have went. I probably wouldn't have even thought-you know, I wouldn't have thought anything of it. But I didn't go, because it was the same thing-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : -in terms of-you know, whether it's economics, it's the same thing.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Marque, you've acted in a lot of different productions, like True Blood , for people who know that vampire series.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah, some [inaudible].\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What about your experience in getting jobs, the few jobs for African Americans? This is an amazing film, because you actually see, you know, a core of African-American actors, characters. How much-how different is this from your other work?\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Well, first off, we-you know, Justin allowed us to play, you know, and this was-I honestly can say that this is the proudest thing I've ever worked on. So, you know, just from the work, just from the message, just from all that it is, so that's the hugest difference for me. In terms-I think, in terms of black actors, you know, we are put into a box. I, fortunately, have not been put into a box. A lot of the stuff that I've done has not been, you know, the stereotypical gangster, or I haven't had to wear a dress-but not saying I'm not opposed to it, but I have not had to do it.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Not on camera, anyway.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Not on camera, anyway. Just for the wrap party. But I have not had to do that. So, to actually play this militant character was exciting for me, because I don't live there, you know? I don't-in my life, I don't live there. I do get angry a lot about different things, but I don't live there.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Let's talk about the rule book that Sam White writes, \"Ebony and Ivy.\" It's interesting, because we just did an interview with Craig Wilder , and he wrote the book, Ebony and Ivy -\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : -which is about the roots of Ivy League universities, how they gained from slavery, actual slavery, in their founding. But she has this rule book she has written. Talk about it.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Sure. It's a survival guide. It's a survival guide for being a black face in a white space. And, you know, I thought-it's just something that I thought she would do. And in it is a series of, what they're called, paper bag tests. And it's meant to be tests for black people to take to find out how black they are. And she's-you know, it's just sort of her tongue-in-cheek, you know, kind of anarchistic way of getting her point across, that it really does take sort of wearing a certain mask to survive at this place.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, let's go to another clip from Dear White People , and this is Samantha White narrating, well, one of those tests.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : The tip test. You hit up Jellies for a snack. Your waitress mistakes you for someone who looks like you, black, who once ran up a $30 bill and left a dollar tip. You watch all the other customers order before you do.\n\nLIONEL HIGGINS : [played by Tyler James Williams] Pastrami sandwich on rye.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : And then proceed to wait no less than 40 minutes for your food. How do you tip? A.\n\nLIONEL HIGGINS : Forty minutes? She's lucky if she gets 40 cents. OK, you do a good job, maybe see a tip.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : B.\n\nLIONEL HIGGINS : She was trippin', but 15 percent is the least I can do.\n\nSAMANTHA WHITE : Or C.\n\nLIONEL HIGGINS : I reject the stereotype that African Americans do not tip. I will leave 20-no, 25, just to prove that I can.\n\n\"One Hundred, Oofta, Nose Job\"?\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So that ended with-well, that was the narration of Sam and ends with Lionel saying he's going to tip big.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Justin?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's-I mean, I'm sorry, but that is a real pressure that I feel as a black person whenever I go to a restaurant.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Same, same, same, yeah.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Especially when the service is bad, because like-it's like, well, damn, like, I don't want to-I don't want to reinforce the stereotype, but I also-like, you didn't come and check on us for like an hour, you know? And I'm, unfortunately-you know, I fall-I pick C just about every time. You know, I always overtip, because I feel this pressure that I'm expected to undertip. And it's a thing, like it's a real thing that I just think is an interesting aspect of being a black person in the world.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Marque, you raised your hand.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Same, guilty, guilty of it. But-but I refuse-you know, if I get bad service, I'll leave a reason. I'll write a reason on the receipt-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : -why you're not getting a tip, so it was not because I'm black. It's because you didn't check on me for 20 minutes. Yeah.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's a better way to do it.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Yeah.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's a better way to do it.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What are some of the other rules?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Well, there's a couple things that didn't make the film that, you know, we'll see what happens in the future life of these characters. But there was a dance test that was in there for a long time. It was called the twerk test, of what do you do-what do you do when there's like a dance craze that's sweeping the nation that starts with black people, whether it's the \"Single Ladies\" dance or how to Dougie or the twerk.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Wait, the \"Single Ladies\" dance?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, remember the Beyoncé \"Single Ladies\" dance? How to Dougie or twerk, whatever it may be, and all your white friends are expecting you to teach them how to do it, which is also a really annoying, but very real aspect of being a black person with a bunch of white friends, because, one, like even if you do know how to do it, there's just something that feels wrong in like sort of like getting up and teaching people how to-I don't know, it just feels weird, feels a little too close to like tap dancing.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : Shuckish-\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nMARQUE RICHARDSON : -and jivish, you know?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, feels a little-it's slightly shuckish. And so-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : But you took it out.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah. Well, you know, we couldn't-we couldn't shoot it, unfortunately, just time and budgetary restrictions. But it is, you know, one of the realities of, you know, what do you do in that moment? Do you just teach them? Do you act like you don't know it? Or, you know, do you like throw a big fit and \"How dare you? And, you know, I will never shuck and jive for you, you know.\" But, you know, it's-I don't know. I just thought those were funny ways to talk about, you know, the kind of awkward moments that kind of happen for people who sort of live in between all the cultures like that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, one other thing, here you're on Democracy Now! , a global news hour, and of your main characters, two of them are journalists, in a sense. I mean, you've got Sam with her camera all the time.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Sure.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And she's got that microphone in front of her face saying, \"Dear White People.\"\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And also Lionel is a local journalist-I mean, is a journalist on campus.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Sure, that's right. I think that might come-I don't even know if that was particularly conscious, to be honest. But I knew that-I knew that what I wanted to talk about in this movie is culture and how culture affects our identities, and how identities come into conflict with who we are. And so, it was really important-I think where that comes from is that, you know, even the name of the movie, Dear White People , is sort of an admission that in a lot of ways black culture is in response to white mainstream culture. And so, you know, while I can't say it was like-it was on purpose, I think that there's-you know, subconsciously, there is a reason why the characters in some way are contributing to culture, whether or not it's the black culture on their campus or the mainstream culture on their campus, because, you know, that, to me, is just a really interesting issue and, in many ways, like subversively dangerous. And yeah, so I think that's where that came from.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : As you introduced Dear White People here at Sundance, at its showings, you give white people permission to laugh.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, that's right.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : What do you say?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : You know, I just say to all the white people in the audience, on behalf of all the black people in the world, you have the right to laugh. You get a free honorary black card with each Sundance ticket. Because it is-it's meant to be a satire, you know? I think if you stop at the title, and you get the knee-jerk reaction-\"Oh, this is just going to be an indictment, you know, an hour-long indictment\"-you're kind of missing the point. It's the title of a movie, and I just want to put people at ease. It's OK, you know? This movie is meant for people of all races to connect to. I think that the issue of being an other is a universal human experience. I happen to be talking about it from a black point of view, and just like every filmmaker is talking about whatever they're talking about from their point of view. And that should make it no harder to watch or enjoy than any other movie.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, what are you working on now? Or is it possible to even talk about that, since this is your first film? It has just broken out.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Yeah, it's exciting. No, I am very hungry to get a few other stories to the screen. There's a lot of things that I want to say. And I'm excited about all the possibilities after this film, particularly after this reception, to say-to say even more daring and interesting things.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : How do you compare Dear White People , would you, last year a film based on real-life experience, though it was a feature film-and we usually cover the documentary track, but this was, you know, so significant, was Fruitvale , Fruitvale Station ?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Absolutely, yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Ryan Coogler\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : I actually just met Ryan Coogler just now, yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : Oh, he's here.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : It's very-yeah, it's very crazy.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : So, how do you compare what you did, Dear White People , with that?\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Well, first of all, they're very different films. But Fruitvale , what is so brilliant, brilliant, brilliant, brilliant about that movie is that, because you know how it's going to end at the beginning, you are watching this black man toggle his blackness and modulate his blackness around everyone-it's like a game of survival. He's one way with his mother. He's one way with his friends.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And, of course, this is the film about Oscar Grant, who was killed by police at the Fruitvale station in California on New Year's Day.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : That's right. And he's-\n\nAMY GOODMAN : And he then fictionalizes it.\n\nJUSTIN SIMIEN : Absolutely. And he's all these different versions of himself for all these different people, in all these different situations. And he slipped up. He was the wrong version of himself at the wrong time, and he died because of it. And that's a tragedy. And that's what it's like to be a black man in this country. And I think that that movie said that in such an eloquent and moving and beautiful, simple way. You know, to be even mentioned in the same, you know, reference with that film is an honor, because it really is a masterpiece. And, you know, I think that, you know, Ryan and I have very different approaches to talking about that issue, but it's that pressure to be a different version of yourself all the time that I think, you know, our films share. We share that same message.\n\nAMY GOODMAN : The director of Dear White People , Justin Simien, along with Marque Richardson, who plays the character Reggie in the film Dear White People . It premiered at the Sundance Film Festival, where we interviewed them earlier this year. There, it won the U.S. Dramatic Special Jury Award for Breakthrough Talent. The film also played this weekend in New York at the New Directors/New Films festival. Lionsgate and Roadside Attractions have just bought the film.\n\nAnd that does it for our broadcast.

Plus: five of the best Oscars podcasts\n\nNorthern News Widely available, episodes weekly \"Mum Finds Soggy Whole Potato in her Packet of Cheese and Onion Crisps!\" That's just one of the headlines that \"northerners-in-London\" comedians Amy Gledhill and Ian Smith are catching up on in local newspapers from back home in the opener of this fun, breezy series. As they check in on the happenings up north, they're joined by guests such as Maisie Adam, Isy Suttie, Tim Key, Phil Wang, Rosie Jones and Nick Helm. Hollie Richardson\n\nBreaking Mississippi BBC Sounds, all episodes out on Mon This powerful podcast tells the story of James Meredith, the first Black student at the University of Mississippi. At nearly 90, it's precious to hear him tell his story and in the first episode journalist Jenn White covers how his segregated upbringing and forward-thinking father inspired his quest for equality. Hannah Verdier\n\nStarted from the Bottom Widely available, episodes weekly Broken Record's Justin Richmond knows that for people of colour, getting into college or a top job is only the beginning. He speaks to leaders and success stories including Nike executive Larry Miller, who opens up about being convicted of murder when he was 16, a secret he harboured throughout his career. HV\n\nUnder the Lights Widely available, all episodes out now Jaguar's (pictured above) excellent two-part series reveals what life is like for women, trans and non-binary people in dance music, with guests such as Annie Mac, Jamz Supernova and the Blessed Madonna. It's not just about breaking into the boys' club - DJ Priya tells a horrific story of being assaulted as she took to the decks at a gig.

HV\n\nAhead of this weekend's ceremony, Ann Lee chooses five of the best podcasts for Oscars fans , whether you want the lowdown on the awards past and present, or a look back at the films that didn't quite make the cut.\n\nLittle Gold Men Vanity Fair's annual Oscars bash is the party to be seen posing at post-ceremony and the magazine's podcast is just as much of an essential in the run-up. Enthusiastic hosts Katey Rich, Richard Lawson, Rebecca Ford and David Canfield take us through the awards race with in-depth analysis, insider gossip and thoughtful celebrity interviews. While the latest episodes have dissected the furore over Andrea Riseborough's nod for best actress and the lessons learned from the Golden Globes, they also look at the Academy Awards through a historical lens with their Oscar Flashback series. It's as close as you'll get to the red carpet without leaving your house.\n\nAnd the Runner-Up Is Even if you pull off the colossal achievement of being nominated for an Oscar, there is still a good chance you may go home empty-handed. Kevin Jacobsen's show focuses on the Oscar-nominated films and actors that got pipped at the post. Each week he is joined by special guests to break down why the presumed runner-up lost out that year and debate the quality of the winner (and whether voters picked the right one).

      "text": "The James Meredith statue noose is another sign we're not post-racial\n\nI t's black history month, and here's how America is celebrating: another Florida jury decided that a white man who disliked \"thug music\" didn't commit murder when he shot an unarmed black boy to death. Members of the Ku Klux Klan turned up at a black history month presentation at the Boone County Library in Harrison , Arkansas, wearing \"Anti-Racist is a Code Word for Anti-White\" stickers. Campaigning in Texas for Republican gubernatorial candidate Greg Abbott, rocker and gun fetishist Ted Nugent called Barack Obama a \"communist-nurtured subhuman mongrel\" . And in the early hours of 16 February, somebody \"decorated\" the statue of James Meredith, the first African American admitted to the University of Mississippi, with an old Confederate flag and a noose around the neck.\n\nIn the US, we like to congratulate ourselves on how far we've come since the 1950s and 1960s. Racial prejudice is no longer enshrined in statute. The most famous scientist in the country is a black guy: astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson. And 12 Years a Slave may win a slew of Oscars.\n\nBut the so-called post-racial society everybody got all excited about in 2008 when Barack Obama was elected president hasn't arrived, no matter how hard we've tried to will it into being. \"Things have changed in the South,\" said Chief Justice John G Roberts when he wrote the opinion gutting the Voting Rights Act, the most important legislation to come out of the Civil Rights Movement. As if the state legislatures of Florida, North Carolina, Indiana, Texas, Virginia and Pennsylvania (among others) weren't passing laws to impede voting by college students, women, the poor and especially people of color.\n\nConservatives want to believe that African Americans need to get over it and stop whining about slavery and Jim Crow and white privilege. According to the Fox News wing of the Republican Party, racism is practiced mostly by black people like Jesse Jackson and Barack Obama, black people who apparently hate white people. Terrified of demographic projections showing that by 2043 non-Latino whites will be in a minority , they've convinced themselves they're already being oppressed. One form \"oppression\" takes is that ghastly \"political correctness\". They know they shouldn't email pictures of President Obama in a feather head-dress with a bone through his nose or assume that a young black guy in a hoodie is going to rob, rape or murder them. They know they can't call Martin Luther King a terrorist out loud, or make jokes in public about the black and gay football player Michael Sam.\n\nClearly, the pressure on white folks is immense. No wonder they need to let off a little steam by vandalizing the statue of James Meredith with the central symbol of racial violence, the noose, a reminder that in the years following the end of Reconstruction, over 3000 African Americans were lynched . Some comments in reaction to news reports insist it was just a little harmless \"fun,\" not like back in 1962 when Meredith first set foot on the Ole Miss campus and the place exploded in days of rioting , killing two and injuring 300.\n\nThis particular strain of stupidity is not (and never has been) confined to the states of the Old Confederacy. This January at Arizona State University, a white fraternity commemorated the Martin Luther King Jr holiday by wearing basketball jerseys, sideways baseball caps and saggin' britches (you know, African American national costume), flashing what they imagined to be \"gang signs\" and drinking out of watermelon cups. Former top aides to Wisconsin governor (and possible 2016 presidential contender) Scott Walker have recently been caught sending racist emails . In New Jersey, the all-white state champion high school wrestling team tweeted out a photo of themselves cavorting in front of a black blow-up dummy hanging by a rope , and a private school in California got into the black history month spirit by serving students a lunch of fried chicken and watermelon (what? no chitlins ?). Indeed, Ted Nugent is from Michigan.\n\nThe good news is that when there's an eruption of idiocy in the South, the brighter bulbs amongst us fight back. We're the ones with the lurid 350-year history of slavery and legal segregation, the stage on which America's racial drama plays out. We know how to articulate the problem; we know how to call for a solution. Within hours of the Meredith statue's desecration, University of Mississippi alumni ponied up a $25,000 reward for information on the perpetrators and students organized a rally.\n\nThe nickname \"Ole Miss\" refers not to \"Old Mississippi,\" but the name the slaves would call the eldest white lady on the plantation. Yet the university's deep-sixed a lot of its former Old South imagery, replacing \"Colonel Reb\", the mascot who looks like a cartoon antebellum plantation master. They've invested in the study of the South's cultural gifts to the world: the Blues, barbecue, the writing of William Faulkner and Richard Wright.\n\nThis is not to oversell Southern enlightenment: we still vote Republican and a billboard with SECEDE in gigantic letters has just appeared in Tallahassee, the capital of Florida. It was put up by the League of the South, self-proclaimed neo-Confederates who've apparently forgotten just how well secession worked out in 1861 . But despite the South's bloody and hateful history, there's hope for progressivism. The new generation, the kind of young people who surrounded the statue of James Meredith at Ole Miss, holding its bronze hands and calling for an end to hatred, will stick around - and, as the old song says, take their stand in Dixie."

      "text": "University of Mississippi investigates student over Palestine counter-protest\n\nAlmost entirely white group made 'offensive, hurtful, and unacceptable' statements with 'racist overtones', school says\n\nThe conduct of at least one student at the University of Mississippi is under official investigation after white counter-protesters at a pro-Palestinian demonstration made what the school called \"offensive, hurtful, and unacceptable\" statements with \"racist overtones\".\n\nThe university's chancellor, Glenn Boyce, said that a conduct investigation had been launched into one student and more might follow in the wake of Thursday's volatile scenes on campus. The clash occurred after a diverse group of about 30 students protesting against Israel's war in Gaza were outnumbered by almost entirely white counter-protesters at a ratio of 10 to one, according to the Mississippi Free Press .\n\nA video that has since gone viral showed one of the white male counter-protesters jumping up and down and making monkey noises in front of a Black woman with the pro-Palestinian protest group. Other white men then echoed the racist noises, and began chanting: \"Lock her up!\"\n\nSome of the protesters were dressed in Stars and Stripes dungarees, others held aloft US and Donald Trump flags. They threw water bottles and cups at the pro-Palestinian protesters and yelled: \"Who's your daddy?\", \"Take a shower\", and \"Shave your legs\", among other offensive chants.\n\nAnnouncing the investigation, Boyce acknowledged the bitter history of racism and segregation at the 25,000-strong university, which only accepted its first Black student under legal duress in 1962. \"It is important to acknowledge our challenging history, and incidents like this set us back. It is one reason we do not take this lightly,\" the chancellor said.\n\nThe fraternity Phi Delta Theta has said that it has expelled a member it called \"the responsible individual\" behind \"racist actions\" that it said were \"antithetical to the values of Phi Delta Theta and the Mississippi Alpha chapter\". The identity of the individual, as well as that of the person under university investigation, have not been released.\n\nTrump, the presumptive Republican presidential candidate, struck a different response. Invoking an acronym for his \"Make America great again\" slogan, the former president published a video on Instagram showing white counter-protesters waving a Trump flag and wrote: \"Thank you Ole Miss-MAGA!\"\n\nThe overtly racist tone adopted by some of the counter-protesters on such an august campus called to mind some of the most regrettable events of segregation in the deep south of the US. When James Meredith became the first Black student at the university 62 years ago, his arrival was met with rioting by 2,000 white people, culminating with President John F Kennedy sending in the national guard.\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nIn 1983, Black students had to go into hiding on campus after 1,000 white students descended on their house singing \"Dixie\". A year earlier, the Ku Klux Klan marched brazenly through the university grounds.\n\nToday the university remains disproportionately white. About 11% of the student body is African American and 76% white, compared with an overall Mississippi population that is 38% Black and 58% white."

Two men were seen near the statue early on Sunday and investigators were looking at surveillance footage.\n\n\"It's a racial hate crime,\" Mississippi National Association for the Advancement of Colored People president Derrick Johnson said on Tuesday, after a news conference at the state capitol. \"At what level do they get prosecuted? I don't know. But as long as we tolerate hate, we will continue to revisit history and the past of this state, and at some point we must move forward.\"\n\nIn a statement, Chancellor Dan Jones condemned the action as contrary to the beliefs and values of the university community.\n\n\"These individuals chose our university's most visible symbol of unity and educational accessibility to express their disagreement with our values,\" Jones said. \"Their ideas have no place here, and our response will be an even greater commitment to promoting the values that are engraved on the statue - courage, knowledge, opportunity and perseverance.\"\n\nUniversity police asked for the FBI's help, said Deborah R Madden, a spokeswoman for the Mississippi FBI office in Jackson.\n\nJohnson said there was an overall problem at Ole Miss.\n\n\"You cannot have a university where, when you turn down the main drag, it's called Confederate Drive ... at some point, we're going to have to reverse course on the image of Ole Miss so we can reverse course on the image of the state of Mississippi,\" he said.\n\nThe Ole Miss Alumni Association is offering at $25,000 reward for information leading to an arrest.\n\nWhen Meredith tried to enter Ole Miss in the fall of 1962, Mississippi's governor tried to stop him, leading to rioting on the Oxford campus. US attorney general Robert Kennedy sent 500 US Marshals to take control and a couple weeks later, Meredith was allowed in the school. Though he faced harassment during his time at the school, he graduated with a degree in political science.\n\nAssistant to the chancellor for multicultural affairs Don Cole reiterated the creed that the university stands by.\n\n\"This is particularly painful because the James Meredith statue has become a gathering place for students to discuss many things, including the tenets of our creed, which calls for dignity and respect for all people,\" he said."

      "text": "A Dream That's Dying\n\nContributor\n\nFifty years ago today, James Meredith made his way across the University of Mississippi campus through mobs of enraged whites threatening to burn him alive. His offense? Daring to enroll at the historically white institution. Although almost a decade had passed since the famous Brown v. Board of Education decision outlawing segregation, public universities across the deep south remained all white. Then-governor of Mississippi Ross Barnett was determined to keep the status quo, but he wasn't counting on Meredith, a 29-year-old black Air Force veteran, who was just as determined to seize his Constitutional rights and enroll at Ole Miss. He was repeatedly rejected until a court order forced the school to admit him. On October 1, 1962, Meredith entered the campus, accompanied by U.S. Marshals. Before that day was over, it would take hundreds of marshals and an entire Army Combat Battalion to repel the violent mob of segregationists who rioted to block his enrollment.\n\nIn his memoir, A Mission from God, Meredith recounts the thousands of death threats pouring in from across the country with gruesomedetails of how he was to die. About the day of his enrollment Meredith writes, \"Rocks start flying in my direction, the screaming intensifies, and the crowd surges closer....\" But Meredith enrolled at Ole Miss and despite daily harassment, he graduated in 1963 with a bachelor's degree in political science.\n\nSadly, the integration that Meredith and so many others risked their lives for still does not exist in schools in the United States. Recent reports by the U.S. Department of Education and UCLA's Civil Rights Project describe alarming segregation levels for both Latina/o and black students nationally, with most attending schools that are majority non-white and almost 40% of both groups attending schools that are more than 90% non-white. Most experience \"double segregation\" -- attending schools that are segregated by race and class. While most white children, even poor white children, don't attend high-poverty schools, most black and brown children, even middle-class ones, do. And high-poverty schools almost always lag behind in measures of resources and success -- they have less experienced and qualified teachers, more decrepit buildings, less access to technology and advanced curricula, and few or outdated textbooks.\n\nBeyond this lies a more obscured truth: Even \"desegregated,\" schools are typically not truly integrated. Manifesting what social scientists call \"second-generation segregation,\" these schools are resegregated internally through ability grouping or tracking. In the post- Brown v. Board of Ed era, tracking has become what UNC sociologist Karolyn Tyson describes in her book Integration Interrupted as a \"legally permissible way to separate students by race.\" And tracking matters.\n\nDecades of research has found vast differences in the quality of education in high and low tracks and shows that poor and minority students are placed disproportionately in the bottom groups or lower tracks. Racial disparities in tracking exist in at least in three ways: Predominantly minority schools have fewer high track classes; racially mixed schools have lots of second-generation segregation, with blacks and Latinos underrepresented in high tracks and overrepresented in low and vocational tracks; and \"high track\" classes at poor schools are likely to be less rigorous and have less-qualified teacher than those same classes at non-poor schools.\n\nSuch findings have led the non-partisan National Research Council to call for the end of tracking in high schools. All of these patterns reinforce the widely reported racial achievement gaps.\n\nIs this the desegregation Meredith fought for?\n\nSome might say that such ability grouping is educationally beneficial -- necessary to address the needs of students with different skill levels. This belief stems in part from the widespread assumption today that track placements reflect real differences in ability. High-track classes, so the thinking goes, are for the best and smartest children. Mounting evidence tells us that even bright children of color are often not enrolled in these higher tracks. In just one study from research in North Carolina, sociologist Roslyn Mickelson found that 72% of white students scoring in the top 10% on the California Achievement Test were placed in top tracks while only 19% of top-scoring blacks were.\n\nSome would argue that while there are some unfortunate consequences of tracking for racial equity, the benefits of homogenous grouping to all (teachers and students) outweigh the costs. The benefits of being in a high-track class to those placed there, however, comes not from the grouping of those with \"like\" ability but from the enhanced curriculum, special resources and supports in high-track classes. Everyone, regardless of prior achievement, benefits from the placement. And it is hard to find anyone who advocates enrolling in low-track classes because of the educational benefits of grouping those with lesser skills.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Log in to hide these messages.\n\nDebates abound today among educators and the civil rights community about what to do about racial inequality in education: The courts have largely abandoned deliberate desegregation efforts, white families continue to largely avoid schools with more than nominal minority representation, and obtaining legal remedies for racially discriminatory practices within desegregated schools remains very difficult. Shockingly, some have argued for abandoning the struggle for integration and instead fighting for equal if separate schools.\n\nA small but growing number of courageous teachers, principles and superintendents have begun to move away from tracking, pushing toward providing high-quality, challenging curriculum, with supports, for all children. In some places \"detracking\" schools, in others just eliminating the low tracks, these educators are clearly acting in the tradition of Meredith and others who pushed for all students to have access to the best education our country has to offer. However, even when successful these efforts face multiple challenges and they remain to few and far between.\n\nOn a day that commemorates such a significant moment in the civil rights movement, In an era when manylike to point to the nations first black president as evidence that we live in a post-racial society, what will it take for us as society to once again live up to Meredith's legacy and stand up for the dream of truly integrated schools?\n\nAmanda Lewis is an Associate Professor of Sociology at Emory University and a Public Voices Fellow at The OpEd Project .

      "text": "50 Years of Progress Should Not Be Erased With One Ruling\n\nPresident and Founder, National Action Network\n\nFifty years ago this week, James Meredith integrated the University of Mississippi when he became the first black student to enroll at the prestigious school. At a time when many, including Mississippi Governor Ross Barnett, opposed integration as some sort of 'federal government intrusion,' Meredith pressed on, escorted by soldiers and police as mobs of angry whites gathered outside of the university. It's ironic, and yet tragic, that 50 years later, the notion of inclusion and diversity is once again being contested and now finding its way to the U.S. Supreme Court. On Oct. 10th, oral arguments in Fisher v. University of Texas at Austin begin. A challenge to affirmative action in higher education, the outcome of this case will have national repercussions. That's precisely why it's vital for all of us to be there in Washington, D.C. next week and let our voices be heard. On the morning of Oct. 10th, National Action Network will join other civil rights groups, representatives of educational institutions, and community leaders from around the country for a 'Day of Action for Opportunity' on the steps of the Supreme Court. We will organize buses and modes of transportation for all those that would like to convene at the highest court in the land to show our support for the University of Texas and for educational equality for all. As one of the pivotal gateways for prosperity, higher education should be accessible to all and should reflect the diversity of the United States. As oral arguments in Fisher v. University of Texas begin, all those committed to justice in education need to join us, for the future of our children and the country as a whole are hanging in the balance. In 2003, the Supreme Court (SCOTUS) ruled on another affirmative action case regarding universities in what was known as Grutter v. Bollinger. In a 5-4 decision, SCOTUS upheld the affirmative action policy in institutes of higher learning in the interest of creating diversity in college classrooms on a multitude of levels, including geographic, religious, gender and racial. The University of Texas carefully practiced SCOTUS's own guidelines as outlined in this case, as well as in Gratz v. Bollinger in that they did not admit students based solely on their race. Nor did they deny a student based solely on his or her race. Translation: no quotas. The plaintiff in Fisher v. University of Texas, Abigail Fisher, claims that she was denied admittance into the school in 2008 because the policy that considered race violated her constitutional rights. But what's important to note here is the fact that race was never the sole determining factor. If it were, I would be the first one advocating for Ms. Fisher's civil liberties. But let's remember that a host of criteria -- including GPA/SAT scores, extracurricular activities, experiences and more -- are weighed when considering a candidate for acceptance, especially when the pool of applicants these days is so competitive. Just because one is not accepted into the school of his or her choice, we cannot blame a program designed to balance the blatant inequities prevalent in society. A few years ago, President Obama asked former Republican Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich and I to conduct a national education tour designed to raise awareness and spark reform in our alarmingly imbalanced education system. Usually on opposing ends of the spectrum, Gingrich and I put our differences aside because we both understood that education remains one of the greatest civil rights issues of our time. If a child has ineffective teachers, crammed classrooms, lack of textbooks and improper curricula, how can we expect him/her to succeed in life? In order to try to combat some of these nuances that most certainly fall along racial lines, affirmative action is not only necessary on moral grounds, but on practical grounds as well . As our demographics continue to diversify, do we really want to let our black and Latino students fall behind? Without higher education and a level playing field, we're setting them up for failure; and in turn setting ourselves up for failure too. We cannot allow 50 years of progress since the day Meredith enrolled in the University of Mississippi to be erased with one ruling. Far too much is at stake for us to remain silent. Join NAN and organizations, students, parents and teachers from diverse backgrounds as we demonstrate in front of SCOTUS on Oct. 10th to make sure that we remain an inclusive nation.

      "text": "The Noose, Ole Miss, and Free Speech\n\nGuest Writer\n\nA few days ago on the campus of the University of Mississippi, someone (reportedly two males) draped a Confederate flag on a statue honoring James Meredith and hung a noose around its neck. Meredith was the African-American student who courageously desegregated the University of Mississippi in 1962, weathering a storm of ugly protest, riots and threats of violence. This act was, by any measure, deeply disrespectful and hateful.\n\nUniversity of Mississippi Chancellor Dan Jones responded by stating of those who did this: \"Their ideas have no place here, and our response will be an even greater commitment to promoting the values that are engraved on the statue -- Courage, Knowledge, Opportunity, and Perseverance.\"\n\nThis poses an interesting question. How should the University of Mississippi respond? What does it mean to say that these \"ideas have no place here\"? Assuming the individuals who did this were students, should the university expel or otherwise discipline them? Are there \"ideas\" that \"have no place\" on a university campus?\n\nSeveral years ago, I crafted an official statement for my own university -- The University of Chicago -- on the institution's Principles of Free Expression. It read, in part:\n\nEighty years ago, a student organization at the University of Chicago invited William Z. Foster, the Communist Party's candidate for President, to lecture on campus. This triggered a storm of protest from critics both on and off campus. To those who condemned the University for allowing the event, University President Robert M. Hutchins responded that \"our students . . . should have freedom to discuss any problem that presents itself.\" He insisted that the \"cure\" for ideas we oppose \"lies through open discussion rather than through inhibition.\". . .\n\nBecause a university is committed to free and open inquiry in all matters, it guarantees all members of its community the broadest possible latitude to speak, write, listen, challenge and learn. A university must respect and support the freedom of all students, faculty and staff \"to discuss any problem that presents itself,\" free of interference.\n\nThis is not to say that this freedom is absolute. In narrowly-defined circumstances, a university may properly restrict expression, for example, that violates the law, is threatening, harassing, or defamatory, or invades substantial privacy or confidentiality interests. Fundamentally, however, a university must be committed to the principle that it may not restrict debate or deliberation because the ideas put forth are thought to be offensive, unwise, immoral, or wrong-headed. It is for the members of the university community to make those judgments for themselves. . . . As Robert M. Hutchins observed, without a vibrant commitment to free and open inquiry, a university ceases to be a university.\n\nThe premise of this statement is that a university should not discipline a student for expressing views that are hateful, offensive, inappropriate, or stupid. Nor should it discipline a student for expressing views that are racist, homophobic, sexist, unpatriotic, or otherwise outrageous or infuriating.\n\nOn the other hand, the freedom of expression is not absolute. A university may legitimately discipline a student for expression that is \"threatening.\" Was the hanging of a Confederate flag and a noose on the statue of James Meredith \"threatening\"? Certainly, in the broadest sense of the term, it was. No doubt, some African-Americans on campus felt \"threatened\" by this act.\n\nBut as offensive as this act was, it does not quite fit the conventional definition of a \"threat.\" To constitute a \"threat,\" an individual's speech must not just put people in fear, but must (a) be directed at specific individuals and (b) be unambiguous. \"If you don't give me your money, I will kill you,\" if stated in circumstances in which the statement would reasonably be taken seriously, is a \"threat.\" Hanging a noose on the door of an African-American student's dorm room, in circumstances in which the message would reasonably be taken as a threat, is also be a \"threat.\" But is it a \"threat\" to hang a noose around the neck of a statute of James Meredith?\n\nThe Supreme Court has dealt with a somewhat similar situation. The Court has held that burning a cross on the lawn of an African-American family that just moved into a previously all-white community is punishable as a \"threat,\" but that burning a cross at a Ku Klux Klan rally cannot be deemed a \"threat\" and is, indeed, constitutionally protected speech -- even though the very existence of the rally and the cross-burning will quite predictably be seen by some people as threatening.\n\nAnother example is the Nazi march in Skokie, a predominantly Jewish suburb of Chicago, in the late 1970s. Someone who hangs a swastika on the front lawn of a Jewish family, in circumstances in which the family would reasonably understand it as a \"threat,\" can constitutionally be punished, but the Nazis have a First Amendment right to march through downtown Skokie, carrying swastika banners, because, although their message might be deeply offensive and frightening to the Jews in Skokie, it does not constitute an unambiguous \"threat\" to particular individuals. There is a difference between a rallying cry, however offensive, and a threat.\n\nFor these reasons, the University of Mississippi situation is not as clear-cut as most people seem to think. Those who did this may, indeed, be despicable people, but it does not necessarily follow that the university should punish them for expressing their views, however hateful and offensive they might be. The situation is not as simple as it might first appear.\n\nPerhaps the university, its students, its faculty and its alumni should see this as an opportunity for \"open discussion\" rather than \"inhibition,\" as an occasion on which to reaffirm the deeper values of the university and, in the words of Chancellor Jones, an opportunity for the university to renew its \"commitment to promoting the values that are engraved on the statue -- Courage, Knowledge, Opportunity, and Perseverance.\"\n\nBy entering your email and clicking Sign Up, you're agreeing to let us send you customized marketing messages about us and our advertising partners.

But one former student has spoken out and hoping to help her alma mater move past its history of intolerance.\n\nLast week, the statue of the first black student at University of Mississippi, James Meredith, was found vandalized with a confederate flag and noose around the neck. However, the incident is not isolated from the university's historical civil rights struggle and racist sentiments within the student body, an experience all too familiar to the college's first black, female student body president, Kimberly Dandridge.\n\nDandridge, who graduated in 2013, held the position during her junior year in 2012. She recently spoke out against the vandalism in a written response entitled \"Life and Irony at Ole Miss. \"\n\nIn the response, Dandridge chronicled harassment she endured for being voted into the homecoming court, admitted into the Phi Mu sorority chapter, and elected to her position as student body president. She goes on to describe how her classmates weren't the only perpetrators of hate on campus during her undergraduate years, sharing a story of when the Ku Klux Klan demonstrated on school grounds.\n\nHowever, Dandridge said she relied on support from friends and looked to James Meredith as an example to salvaged her experience at the university.\n\nWhen discouraged, I reflected on James Meredith, the first black student at Ole Miss. I reminded myself of his tumultuous experiences at Ole Miss. And when I thought about the riot and the lives lost the night before he was admitted, it made the struggles that I faced at Ole Miss seem trivial. James Meredith forever changed Ole Miss. Anything I accomplished was because of him.\n\nShe addressed the grim implications of the vandalism and how it reflects social climate on campus, but ended her response in a confidently optimistic tone.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "Ole Miss Students Vote To Remove Confederate Symbol From Campus\n\nSenior Reporter, HuffPost\n\nStudent leaders at the University of Mississippi voted on Tuesday night to remove the Mississippi state flag, which contains the Confederate battle emblem, from campus. Once the resolution is signed , it will be up to school administrators to act on it.\n\nThe university in Oxford, Mississippi, has a long record of racial turmoil. In 1962, it was the site of a violent protest to prevent the enrollment of James Meredith , a black military veteran. But Ole Miss students said Tuesday's decision signals an important shift for the school and the state as a whole.\n\n\"Seeing an institution with such an unpleasant history take steps toward progress can have an immense impact on the decisions of lawmakers,\" said Tysianna Marino, vice president of the University of Mississippi NAACP, prior to the vote. \"We have the ability to show the nation Mississippi is not stagnant. We are ready for progress.\"\n\nAt Ole Miss, the flag flies on campus near a monument honoring Confederate soldiers who died in the Civil War. This is the first time in \"recent history\" that a student government resolution has been introduced to remove it, said Danny Blanton, a spokesman for the University of Mississippi.\n\nAttitudes toward the flag and other symbols of the Confederacy are swiftly changing. After 21-year-old white man, Dylann Roof, shot nine black churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, in June -- an act the NAACP national president called \"racial terrorism\" -- lawmakers there removed the Confederate flag from the statehouse grounds. The flag also came down in Alabama . On Monday, the Florida Senate voted to remove the Confederate emblem from its state seal.\n\nBut top Mississippi lawmakers have continued to ignore national calls to change the design of the state flag.\n\nPrior to Tuesday's vote, several other public universities in Mississippi had already chosen not to fly the flag. Allen Coon, a 20-year-old sophomore who heads the Ole Miss College Democrats, introduced a resolution to remove the flag in September with the support of the university chapter of the NAACP.\n\n\"This is an issue that affects us as students on a daily basis,\" Coon told The Huffington Post.\n\nThe university's student population is 14.3 percent African-American, while the state's population is 37.5 percent black, according to recent data.\n\nOle Miss students held a rally to support removing the flag on Friday, led by the school's chapter of the NAACP. While the rally primarily aimed to draw attention to the flag, the group seeks to remove all Confederate symbols on campus.\n\nMembers of the Ku Klux Klan and Mississippi's League of the South, a pro-secessionist group, showed up after the rally, The Clarion-Ledger reported. Marino told HuffPost that members used \"racial slurs and chants.\"\n\n\"They simply answered our questions with more questions, and shouted things like 'Black lives don't matter, whites are more supreme,' and 'This is exactly why we should have remained segregated,'\" Marino said.\n\nSome conservative members of the Ole Miss student body oppose removing the state flag, including student senator Andrew Soper, 21, who started an online Change.org petition to keep it flying. It received \" over 200 signatures in a couple hours ... and then I was made to take the petition down,\" he said.\n\nSoper did not say who asked him to remove his petition, but there's now a competing Change.org petition calling for his impeachment.\n\n\"P olitically correct positions should not be forced onto the students of the University of Mississippi by a few liberal leaning students and organizations, and media bias,\" Soper wrote on Facebook to HuffPost.\n\nIt's now up to university administrators to decide whether to take down the the flag. Prior to the vote, several students said that they were under the impression that the institution might drag its feet. \"I do not believe the university officials will take it down hastily,\" Marino said.\n\nOne of the university's relevant administrators, Interim Chancellor Morris Stocks, has denounced the flag. But Blanton, the university spokesman, did not indicate how soon the flag might come down. He said that the university may seek input from other campus representative bodies \"before considering how to move forward.\"\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

But one former student has spoken out and hoping to help her alma mater move past its history of intolerance.\n\nLast week, the statue of the first black student at University of Mississippi, James Meredith, was found vandalized with a confederate flag and noose around the neck. However, the incident is not isolated from the university's historical civil rights struggle and racist sentiments within the student body, an experience all too familiar to the college's first black, female student body president, Kimberly Dandridge.\n\nDandridge, who graduated in 2013, held the position during her junior year in 2012. She recently spoke out against the vandalism in a written response entitled \"Life and Irony at Ole Miss. \"\n\nIn the response, Dandridge chronicled harassment she endured for being voted into the homecoming court, admitted into the Phi Mu sorority chapter, and elected to her position as student body president. She goes on to describe how her classmates weren't the only perpetrators of hate on campus during her undergraduate years, sharing a story of when the Ku Klux Klan demonstrated on school grounds.\n\nHowever, Dandridge said she relied on support from friends and looked to James Meredith as an example to salvaged her experience at the university.\n\nWhen discouraged, I reflected on James Meredith, the first black student at Ole Miss. I reminded myself of his tumultuous experiences at Ole Miss. And when I thought about the riot and the lives lost the night before he was admitted, it made the struggles that I faced at Ole Miss seem trivial. James Meredith forever changed Ole Miss. Anything I accomplished was because of him.\n\nShe addressed the grim implications of the vandalism and how it reflects social climate on campus, but ended her response in a confidently optimistic tone.\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

      "text": "The Fight For Civil Rights Is Far From Over\n\nDirector; Professor, University of California at Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism; Author, 'True South'\n\nNot Your Grandma's Civil Rights Strategy Cross-posted with TomDispatch.com\n\nOn a glorious afternoon in August 1963, after the massive March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom wrapped up on the national mall, President John F. Kennedy, prodded by Attorney General Robert Kennedy, welcomed John Lewis, Martin Luther King Jr., Bayard Rustin, and other march organizers to the White House for a discussion of proposed civil rights legislation. Fifty-four years later, on an afternoon in January 2017, when the even more massive Women's March on Washington wrapped up, President Donald Trump responded with a sarcastic tweet . Just the day before, Trump's team had removed the \"civil rights\" page from the issues section of the WhiteHouse.gov website and replaced it with a new entry entitled \"Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community.\" The page is still missing.\n\nToday, with the three branches of government controlled by men intolerant of dissent and hounded by their own dark vision of pluralism, few human rights advocates of any stripe can reasonably expect a hearing in Washington. Our long-running, ongoing, unfinished American civil rights struggle that so often focused on pressing the federal government toward justice, is suddenly in uncharted territory. The legacy of Reverend Martin Luther King has slammed up against the legacy of Alabama Governor George Wallace, whose snarling campaign for president in 1968 has come home to roost in the presidency of Donald Trump. Where civil rights leaders, warriors, and foot soldiers found support in high places they will now find a void.\n\nPartners With Power\n\nAmid discussion of renewed civil rights activism, you may well ask whether we'll need to fight those fights all over again. Will black people once more have to claim their humanity? For perspective on this moment, let's consider why the strategies of the southern liberation struggle worked as well as they did back in the day.\n\nThe classic civil rights movement (1954-1965) was sparked, organized, and driven by local people and leaders (maids, teachers, farmers, cooks, janitors, students, ministers) in a hundred southern towns who, with ferocious courage, stood up and said \"No more!\" Their victories ― some temporary, some lasting ― regularly depended on their ability as citizens to reach beyond local and state segregationists to faraway presidents, congressional representatives, federal circuit court judges, and Supreme Court justices in Washington, appealing to them to respond with regulations, executive orders, laws, and even armed force.\n\nDogged organizing by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the Congress Of Racial Equality (CORE), and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), together with the NAACP's decades-long legal campaigns, Martin Luther King's rhetorical genius, and the massed moral crusade of black southerners first shamed and finally forced the latent hand of federal power. Alert to this leapfrog tactic, Malcolm X, W.E.B. Du Bois, and others went a step further and tried unsuccessfully to appeal to the United Nations, as more recently have the parents of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Jordan Davis.\n\nWith its unanimous 1954 Brown v. Board of Education school desegregation decision, the Supreme Court signaled to African Americans in the former Confederacy that they had a friend in Washington. In Brown , by the sheer weight of evidence, moral suasion, and reason, a handful of African American parents, children, and their lawyers had compelled nine aging white justices (including former Ku Klux Klansman Hugo Black ) to agree that all citizens deserve equal education.\n\nIn a similar manner over the next decade, one powerful judicial, congressional, and presidential ally after another would step up, willfully or grudgingly, to affirm simple justice, rights long promised but also long deferred. Their embrace of civil rights was sometimes a matter of conscience, sometimes a savvy calculation of their constituents' electoral mood. Those actions would, in the end, help open doors and extend legal rights to ethnic minorities, women, immigrants, workers, and most recently gay, lesbian, and transgendered citizens.\n\nMajor legislation ― the Civil Rights Act of 1957 which established the Justice Department's civil rights division, the 1964 Act which outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, or national origin, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 ― and hundreds of decisions handed down by federal district courts, circuit courts, and the Supreme Court all slowly expanded protections to African Americans and set precedents for all Americans. Unlike blacks within white-ruled South Africa who, at the time, were not citizens of their own nation and had little hope of federal protection, blacks across the deep South could succeed because they were citizens not only of their own states, but of the United States.\n\nFew in the 1960s believed that marching, demonstrating, sitting in, agitating, witnessing, disrupting, or singing could ever change the minds, much less the policies, of a half-dozen southern governors, a hundred county sheriffs, or millions of white segregationists. The Montgomery bus boycott was successful in driving the bus company to the edge of bankruptcy, but legal bus segregation remained intact until the Supreme Court stepped in.\n\nWell-schooled in the strategies of Gandhi, civil rights leaders knew of the critical value of mass meetings, collective action, and civil disobedience for building resolve, visibility, and a powerful sense of community, but they also knew its limits: solidarity was not enough. Coming together to raise awareness would not in itself achieve concrete results. Birmingham leader Fred Shuttlesworth put it this way: \"Look, America, look at your promises; look how you've treated your poor Negro citizens. But you can't shame segregation. Rattlesnakes don't commit suicide.\"\n\nPersuasion, appeals to reason, and simple justice certainly recruited northern liberals and some white southern moderates to the cause, but southern blacks could have preached the Sermon on the Mount or the U.S. Constitution daily to White Citizens' Councils to no effect. In the end, the decisive language that spoke to white oppression was power, and the power that proved decisive often lay in Washington.\n\nWhile economic boycotts might sometimes force compromise on local businesses and segregationist officials, generally the trick was to vault over them to, if necessary, the president himself. In the documentary Eyes On The Prize , Burke Marshall, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division under President Kennedy explained, that, when push came to shove, no deep southern city or state could resist escalating federal force. \"I suppose,\" he commented, \"the president could have sent the United States Navy up the Mississippi River\" ― which was exactly what Abraham Lincoln had done a century earlier.\n\nAt the extreme, Republican and Democratic presidents deployed deputies, federal marshals, national guardsmen, and in the end even Army troops to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws and protect dissenters' rights under the First Amendment when state and local officials refused to do so. If the attack dogs, bombings, and mass arrests of children got bad enough in Birmingham , and if it all appeared on television nationwide, local black organizers came to understand that they could usually depend on predictable moral outrage in the White House, a Congress worried about reelection, or the Supreme Court for a remedy.\n\nIn 1957, faced with news bulletins of white rioters and Alabama national guardsmen blocking nine black students from entering Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower reluctantly sent in elements of the Army's 101st Airborne Division, declaring on prime-time television, \"Mob rule cannot be allowed to override the decisions of the courts.\" Five years later, President Kennedy, a convert to the civil rights cause, would similarly dispatch his Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and 200 federal marshals backed by the U.S. Army to ensure that James Meredith could enter the besieged campus of the University of Mississippi.\n\nThe Revolution Will Be Televised\n\nMovement leaders patiently calculated a strategy for success that often depended on the press, in particular the new medium of television news, to haul Jim Crow's physical, social, and civic brutality out of the backwoods and into the nation's living rooms. They understood that news crews would flock not only to record Martin Luther King's oratory but also the flamboyant antics of a few southern sheriffs and the grand theater of mass non-violent resistance. Confronted with televised attacks on peaceful demonstrators, a majority of congressmen, including dozens of Republicans , might acknowledge the searing contradictions of state racism for what they were. Whether good will, cynicism, or electoral savvy drove politicians' actions, the strategy worked.\n\nThe national media provided a direct prod that regularly stiffened spines in Washington, but such public disapproval by hectoring northern journalists also brought white southerners together in solidarity against the media elites (a phenomenon that should have a certain resonance in present-day America). White crowds knew that network television coverage spelled trouble for legal segregation and often went for the cameras. Those mobs understood the postmodern power of images as well as any postmodernist. When the first Freedom Riders' bus rolled into Birmingham's bus station in 1961, dozens of Klansmen attacked the waiting newsmen first before they went after the riders. There would be no news clips of that event on TV that evening.\n\nOn the horrific night when James Meredith tried to enter the University of Mississippi, the mob , flying Confederate battle flags, attacked the media, smashing cameras, beating cameramen, and killing a reporter from Agence France-Presse execution-style, before shooting 35 federal marshals.\n\nSecond only to the courage of African Americans was the courage of those highly visible TV crews. They would stay miraculously calm and focused, navigating the mayhem between marchers, mobs, and lawmen. Though they were constrained by journalistic standards from partisanship in reporting, many of those crews could not escape their growing sympathy for the movement, and found themselves ready to join in the reformation of America with their pictures and words. They were televising a particularly disgusting pageant: officers, under the sanction of state and local laws, bludgeoning, fire hosing, arresting, punching, cattle prodding, whipping, tear-gassing, and even shooting defenseless, unresisting black people who had declared their commitment to nonviolence. It happened month after month throughout the 1960s.\n\nThe Selma Show\n\nMovement leaders chose their sheriffs carefully, judging their battlegrounds in part by the quality of available villains. They favored bad actors like Chief Bull Connor, the proud bigot of Birmingham, who unleashed fire hoses on teenaged marchers with operatic fury, and Selma's increasingly unhinged arch-segregationist sheriff, Jim Clark .\n\nThe 1965 battle royal in Selma, Alabama, marked a milestone in the expansion of democracy for the town's African Americans, which had begun with the emancipation of its slaves during the Civil War. Selma first came under siege by Union regulars in April 1865. The Confederate defenders, an ill-trained muster of white militiamen, kids, and old men, were no match for the northern troops who ran them out of their hometown, then spent the night burning and looting. Selma's slaves were officially freed, but after a fleeting window of hope, Reconstruction and Jim Crow would strip them and their immediate descendants of nearly all their constitutional rights.\n\nBy 1965, almost a century after the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which unambiguously declares, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged... on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\" the percentage of registered black voters in Alabama was actually falling. Local white voter registration clerks in Selma had allowed only 2% of the city's 14,000 black citizens to register, compared to 90% of Selma's whites. A carefully targeted registration campaign by local organizers and SNCC (later joined by the SCLC) aimed to shine a national spotlight on local oppression and so spur congressional action that would open up voting for black citizens throughout Alabama and eventually across the entire deep South.\n\nStrategically deploying Martin Luther King (just back from accepting the Nobel Prize in Norway), the movement in Selma set out to provoke Sheriff Clark and his famously brutal posse. As SNCC's Jim Forman said, \"We were laying a trap.\" The aim was to heighten a moral battle of Shakespearian proportions that television would then beam directly to President Lyndon Johnson.\n\nAt one point, the city would have 20 times more blacks in jail than on its voting rolls. Confrontations simmered throughout the winter of 1964-1965, punctuated by sudden explosions of violence. Reason, brotherly love, massed demonstrations, and inflamed national opinion made no dent in Jim Clark's enduring pathology . Like a man possessed, he simply couldn't stop himself from behaving badly in front of the cameras. He delivered the gaudy media goods, week after week, exactly as movement strategists had hoped he would, exactly as Selma's few moderate whites feared. The scenes of violence flashed around the country on TV every night, and appeared in the pages of the New York Times and Washington Post .\n\n\"... Will activism translate into concrete results the way it once did?\"\n\nBy 1965, President Johnson, a Texas Democrat, was ready to take risks on civil rights. He had already directed his White House staff to secretly prepare sweeping voting rights legislation and even a constitutional amendment. Now, the only thing needed was a trigger, and that finally came on March 7th, \"Bloody Sunday,\" when John Lewis, Hosea Williams, Bob Mants, and Albert Turner, leading hundreds of locals, crested the Pettus Bridge on their way to deliver a voting rights petition to Governor George Wallace at the state capitol.\n\nAll hell broke loose. Whites cheered from the roadside as Alabama state troopers and Clark's mounted posse clubbed, bullwhipped, and tear-gassed their way through 600 unarmed black men, women, and children. A trooper fractured John Lewis's skull with his billy club. Here was the massacre of the innocents for all Americans to see: southern lawmen in their pig-faced gas masks going berserk against African Americans who stood and took it. That televised attack, a crystalline icon of the era, worthy of Dante, had by evening rallied nearly all of Washington to the marchers' cause. It would one day become a sturdy staple of history texts and documentaries. That night, local whites murdered a northern Unitarian minister.\n\nSelma's young white mayor, Joe Smitherman, said, \"I didn't understand how big it was until I saw it on television... That looked like a war; that went all over the country. And then... the wrath of the nation came down on us.\" Citing television coverage, 31 Republican leaders condemned the situation in Alabama, as well as the administration's delay in proposing new federal voting legislation. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen rose to declare, \"The time is now.\"\n\nPresident Johnson sent 2,000 federal troops to Selma as Lincoln had done 100 years before, this time to protect peaceful citizens of Alabama from Alabama state troopers. He went on national television to proclaim, \"Their cause must be our cause, and together we shall overcome!\" and then dispatched a sweeping voting rights bill to a willing Congress. After it passed the House by a vote of 328 to 74 and the Senate by 79 to 18, Johnson signed the act into law with John Lewis and Dr. King at his side.\n\nBy their determined organizing, marching, demonstrating, and most of all by their relentless courage, local black people had successfully appealed to Washington, finally brought legalized American apartheid to its knees. Black voting in Alabama jumped seven-fold in the next three years.\n\nWithout the media slamming blunt facts in the face of sympathetic (or politically savvy) power brokers in Washington, \"Bloody Sunday\" might have left in its wake little more than a few hundred broken and bleeding marchers and the Jim Crow voting system still intact. Without the TV coverage and a president and Congress capable of being won over, it might have been the civil rights equivalent of a tree falling silently in the forest, not the engine of sweeping change that it was.\n\n\"Freedom Is A Constant Struggle\"\n\nBut that was then.\n\nBack in 1965, the charm of Selma was lost on most of us who ventured there. I've returned a few times since, first in 1985 to shoot scenes for Eyes on the Prize , including an interview with an unrepentant Jim Clark. The town was, by then, smaller, blacker, and poorer.\n\nIn 2015, I returned again with producer Orlando Bagwell to work on a film for the Southern Poverty Law Center. From a distance, nestled on a bluff above the Alabama River, Selma looked to me like a picturesque little town in southern France. The air below the Edmund Pettus Bridge , now a national historic landmark, was alive with swallows. Selma's lovely historic district seemed nicely parked somewhere between 1850 and 1950, but much of the rest of the once-prosperous town had, like so much of small town America, been hollowed out by recession and a changing economy. We could find only one restaurant open for supper downtown. Many of its beautiful nineteenth-century buildings were boarded up. Gaping bullet holes pockmarked the granite tombstone of Jimmie Lee Jackson, whose murder by a state trooper had sparked the original Bloody Sunday march. The Civil War Battle of Selma is still reenacted annually on a field outside town, with the Confederates defeated again, each year.\n\nThe Voting Rights Act forged in Selma had been a triumph of the classic civil rights movement, the hinge between everything that came before and so much that would come after. But we had little reason to suspect or notice when, shortly after the act's passage in 1965, conservative organizers began a methodical 40-year campaign to gut it. As black voter rolls in rural Alabama swelled, the state's young federal prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, brought charges of voter fraud against civil rights organizer Albert Turner, a leader of the Bloody Sunday march. His case collapsed in court, but resistance continued, culminating in a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down one of that act's key provisions (federal approval of state changes in their voting laws). Ever since, a Republican campaign to put new voting restrictions in place has only gained momentum .\n\nIn 2015, however, few had noticed the most profound changes of all, even though they were stirring just below the surface of things: sweeping working class frustration; previously dormant strains of racism, misogyny, and nativism; galloping income inequality; and Democratic Party failures that went unnoticed and uncorrected. All of these factors would help lay the groundwork for the successful candidacy of Donald J. Trump. He was slow indeed to reject the white supremacists and nationalists who rushed to endorse his presidential bid and he was brought to office in some measure by the very forces that the civil rights movement naively thought it had largely silenced. Because the lid had been kept on overt public racism and nativism for so long, many Americans were slow to understand how deeply systemic the problem is.\n\nThe citizens of Selma voted for Hillary Clinton by a wide margin, but no matter. Trump's wave has driven from power the vital center with which mass movements had once been able to partner. Vestiges of the very ethos against which the civil rights movement fought have grown ever stronger and found a welcome place in his White House, their strength buoyed by a growing societal disapproval of media elites. In the process, Trump has inoculated himself against appeals for justice as has no president in our lifetime.\n\nWhen it comes to any rights appeals in the immediate future, no one with real federal power is likely to be listening. There will be no sympathy for human rights petitioners from majority Republicans in the House of Representatives untroubled by reelection fears in their ferociously gerrymandered districts, nor from the soon-to-be-devastated civil rights division of the Department of Justice. What mechanisms will remain for the activists to activate?\n\nIn a country becoming less white every day, Democrats recently stood helpless when it came to blocking the confirmation of the whitest cabinet in decades. Soon enough, the Supreme Court will have a conservative majority and then President Trump will have the run of the table, racking up a political monoculture unknown in our time.\n\nWhat many Americans think of as the civil rights movement ― something in our black and white past, back there, back then ― is, in fact, a deep running project launched long before we were born and sure to endure long after we are gone. In one now-historic decade, civil rights organizers brilliantly identified the levers of government power they could seize, but most of those levers are today out of reach.\n\nIn response, will activism translate into concrete results the way it once did? Surely, a new generation of organizers now rising with a resolve and passion not seen in years, having broadened the civil rights project into a human rights one, will develop new strategies. Surely, they will discover or invent new means of stopping what threatens to be a contraction of democracy. Surely, with the power of social media ― a veritable television station in the hands of every citizen ― they will find their own ways of ensuring that oppression can't dodge the spotlight. Already, the bottom-up strategy championed by SNCC has found new fluency in the ascendance of hyper-democratic Internet organizing and the raw eloquence of #BlackLivesMatter .\n\nBig money interests are running the government - and influencing the news you read.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nVirtually every Democratic Party politician, black or white, claims the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nConveniently forgotten is the fact that in the final years of his life, before his assassination in 1968, King broke with Democratic President Lyndon Johnson over the Vietnam War and the administration's failure to enforce civil rights legislation in the South. That's something no Democrats of national stature have been willing to do today.\n\nWhile the reforms advocated by King for most of his life were mild compared to the demands of the more radical black nationalists, they were nevertheless condemned by the same Democrats who have since tried to turn King into a heroic icon and a symbol of black accommodation to the system.\n\nIn order to understand King's eventual shift to the left, it's necessary to look at the class struggles that underpinned the civil rights movement and the nature of King's organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).\n\nWhen King emerged as a leader of the Montgomery Bus Boycott in the 1950s, he was at the forefront of a local movement whose example was followed in dozens of other Southern cities in subsequent years. The organization he helped found, SCLC, established several field offices, but it was essentially a group of professional organizers who typically moved from city to city to be involved in struggles initiated by local black students, workers, and farmers.\n\nSCLC's aim was not to help these activists develop independently, but rather to lead them into nonviolent confrontation with segregationists and the brutal cops and state police who backed up Jim Crow law. According to SCLC leaders such as Hosea Williams and Wyatt T. Walker , the federal government would then be forced to intervene to support civil rights activists in order to stop the mayhem.\n\nAt first, the strategy seemed to work. A Supreme Court decision supported the Montgomery Bus Boycott. President Kennedy introduced civil rights legislation after Birmingham, AL cops repeatedly attacked SCLC-organized marches in 1963, and the bill became law a year later. Bloody confrontations in St Augustine, FL and Selma, AL prodded Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson, to push the Voting Rights Act of 1965 through Congress.\n\nKennedy and Johnson supported civil rights only when they believed it was necessary to stave off more militant black rebellion. They had no wish to alienate the powerful Southern Dixiecrat wing of their party. King and the SCLC 's protests could be tolerated as long as they remained \"nonviolent,\" were limited to fighting segregation in the South, and did not challenge racist economic discrimination rooted in US capitalism.\n\nBut by 1965, King's credibility among Southern activists was waning. The SCLC's habit of arriving in town in the midst of a struggle, grabbing the media spotlight, and negotiating a settlement irritated both local blacks and the increasingly radical members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), who were trying to help Southern blacks develop their own leadership.\n\nMeanwhile, black nationalist Malcolm X rightly argued that the nonviolence advocated by King and the SCLC exposed blacks to attack by police and racist thugs.\n\nCriticism of King reached a new peak in Selma in 1965, where police tear-gassed and clubbed activists who were attempting to march to the state capital in Montgomery. When a second march was organized, police didn't block it. But King led marchers back into Selma rather than defy a court injunction. This retreat, along with King' s acceptance of token concessions from Selma politicians, was denounced as a sellout by radicals.\n\nDifferences spilled into the open a year later after James Meredith , the first black student to attend the University of Mississippi, was gunned down during his solo protest march across the state. King and SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael (later known as Kwame Ture) were among the civil rights leaders who joined several hundred activists to complete Meredith's march in the summer of 1966.\n\nHounded by racist thugs and brutal cops every step of the way, angry marchers eagerly joined Carmichael's impromptu chant of \"Black Power\" and listened intently to his nationalist ideas. While King refused to join more conservative black civil rights leaders in attacking the Black Power slogan as racist, he refused to support it on the grounds that it implied violence and would alienate potential white support.\n\n\"We've got to transform our movement into a positive and creative power,\" he said when asked his opinion of Carmichael. To black militants, King was viewed as a sellout. But to Democratic liberals, worried by the influence of black nationalist ideas and widespread black rebellions in Northern cities, King's position seemed a virtual endorsement of Black Power.\n\nKing recognized that he was trying to bridge an ever-widening gap. \"The government has got to give me some victories if I'm going to keep people nonviolent,\" he said. In fact, King would soon confront the Northern Democrats as an open enemy. Since the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had formally abolished the last of the Southern Jim Crow segregation laws, King and SCLC turned their attention to the increasingly militant Northern blacks.\n\nKing's final break with Johnson came in April 1967 when King called for the US to pull out of its \"colonial\" war in Vietnam.\n\nWhile a number of important Democratic senators had already turned against the war, most top civil rights leaders continued to support the administration. Liberal newspapers such as the New York Times and Washington Post , which had usually been sympathetic to King during the civil rights struggles in the South, attacked him for his antiwar stand.\n\nA vengeful Johnson allowed the FBI to step up its long-term harassment of King and other SCLC leaders. The president was outraged when he learned of King's plans to lead a Poor People's March on Washington to close down the US Capitol.\n\nJohnson and the Democrats had come to rely on King's nonviolent tactics and his support for their party as an important counterweight to the growing numbers of radicals in the rising Black Power revolt. When King denounced the war in 1967, the Democrats regarded him as a traitor.\n\nYet King's break with the Democrats did not earn him the support of blacks in the North, where street rebellions swept every major city in the country. The politics of the more radical black nationalists - particularly their advocacy of self-defense in the face of racist violence - seemed to speak more to the struggle in these circumstances.\n\nAttacked from both left and right, King was forced to rethink his career and the organization he led, the SCLC. \"We must admit there was a limitation of our achievement in the South,\" he told a meeting of the SCLC board in 1967. SCLC would have to call for a \"radical redistribution of wealth and power.\" On several occasions, King told his aides that the US needed a democratic socialism that would guarantee jobs and income for all.\n\nOther SCLC leaders, such as Andrew Young, Jesse Jackson, and Ralph Abernathy, were hostile to plans for the Poor People's March. The SCLC's Southern field offices had been neglected during an ill-fated attempt to organize against housing segregation in Chicago, and the group's Northern offices were even weaker.\n\nMoreover, the plan clashed with the black capitalist orientation of SCLC's Operation Breadbasket , directed by Jackson. \"If you are so interested in doing your own thing that you can't do what the organization is structured to do, go ahead,\" King said in response to Jackson's criticism of the march. \"If you want to carve out your own niche in society, go ahead, but for God's sake, don't bother me!\"\n\nStill, the Democrats saw betrayal in King's Poor People's Campaign - while the right wing declared it proved their longtime claim that King was a Communist. These elements, encouraged by the presidential campaign of segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace, publicly threatened King's life.\n\nFaced with hostility from the Johnson administration, criticism from both black nationalists and the black establishment, and a divided staff, King was politically isolated as never before when he was assassinated in Memphis on April 4, 1968 - less than three weeks before the Poor People's Campaign was to begin. King had travelled to Memphis to support a strike by black sanitation workers - he was the only national civil rights leader to do so.\n\nYet it wasn't long after his death that the media hacks of the ruling class began to convert King into a harmless saint.\n\nTo do this, however, they had to bury the real legacy of Martin Luther King - both the leader of the critical early struggles of the civil rights movement who refused to accept pleas for patience and moderation from his liberal Democratic allies, and the more radical black leader of the late 1960s whose vision of what needed to be changed in society had widened enormously.\n\nLee Sustar is a writer and activist in Chicago.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

In those days only these workers were physically bound to their place of employment - the Negro to his plantation by guards, and the seaman by the watery isolation of his ship. Yours was never as humiliating a condition as chattel slavery, but the abuse of your freedom, and dignity of personality, were corrosive and destructive.\n\nThe sailors wrote a luminous page of history when they used their mighty strength and unity to civilize their work conditions. Everyone benefitted - other labor groups as well as employers because the violence and instability of the sea life of old could not be a basis for a great commerce. Nor could maltreated, brutalized men be entrusted with the multimillion-dollar ships of the modern era; nor with the safety of millions of passengers who now make the seas a highway.\n\nAnd so you and your industry have come a long way from great depths to great heights in your journey, achieving democratic practices which put you above many other segments of American life.\n\nWhat do I mean by this? I believe there is more simple nobility in your work than in almost any other. First, in the progress toward integration you are matchless because an integrated ship is a flower of democracy. On the sea, workers not only toil side by side, but they eat, sleep, and relax on an integrated basis. You are not divided by color, religion, or other distinctions. The men of a department work and sleep and eat without artificially imposed barriers between them. Mastering nature's giant seas requires unity, brotherhood, and in moments of peril, the color of a man's skin is of no importance, but the quality of his courage and resourcefulness is all important.\n\nSailors are unique workers possessing noble qualities because in time of war they assume risks many soldiers never experience, even though they remain civilians.\n\nLastly, every sailor is expected in the tradition of the sea to be willing to risk his life in order to save the life of another.\n\nSome years ago I read a newspaper story of an American liner which altered its course and stood by in a storm because a single man had been sighted floating on a raft. Thousands of passengers, many of them leaders of industry and eminent statesmen, were compelled to wait - perhaps altering a thousand appointments and conferences. The delivery of cargo and mail were delayed until one man was rescued from death. For me this incident had overwhelming spiritual and moral meaning because the multitude of distinguished people, who were inconvenienced, and the fortune in wealth which waited upon one man, dramatized the importance of a single human being in an age when we too easily forget people. But this incident was multiplied in meaning because that one man, whose life hung in the balance, was discovered to be a Negro when the lifeboat brought him to safety.\n\nIt is not often that everything stops and holds its breath for an ordinary Negro. I am happy to say that a similar situation finally did occur on land only recently when the governor of Mississippi tried to reverse history and victimize one Negro, only to find hundreds of millions lining up with James Meredith and an army mobilized at his side, for the sole purpose of ensuring his rights as an American citizen.\n\nReaching far back into the past, it is interesting that the brutal practice of flogging on ships was fought and abolished by a member of another minority group in the eighteenth century when Commodore Uriah Levy, a Jew, ended this barbaric practice in the US Navy.\n\nAll of your progress in humanism spread to other sectors of American life, making you pioneers of the human spirit.\n\nSo it is a natural extension of your tradition, it is consistent with your sense of brotherhood, that in celebrating your twenty-fifth anniversary, that with your deserved enjoyment and delight in the event, you also use it to make financial aid available to a people still fighting to realize their elementary rights and still seeking the long-promised pursuit of happiness. [The National Maritime Union, like other progressive unions, was a strong financial supporter of the civil rights movement .] Your twenty-fifth anniversary arranged in this constructive fashion honors you even beyond the achievement of twenty-five years of organized life. You sum up thousands of years of man's struggle to be human, decent, and honorable.\n\nOur nation is facing severe trials in these turbulent days because one region of our country still holds itself above law, as if it were cut adrift from constitutional obligations, and insurrection and mutiny against the government is still possible. They not only abuse persons, but they debase the democratic traditions of the nation in their defiant resort to anarchy and storm troop rule.\n\nAgainst this force, which has the power of states at its command, Negroes have searched for effective weapons. We believe we have found them. Emulating the labor movement , we in the South have embraced mass actions - boycotts, sit-ins and, more recently, a widespread utilization of the ballot.\n\nEmulating Biblical teachers and Mahatma Gandhi, we have seized the unique weapon of nonviolent resistance . It is a pleasure to tell you that our weapons work. They do not draw the blood of our adversary, but they do defeat the unjust system.\n\nA remarkably effective method has evolved and become a source of splendid strength in recent months. The secret ballot is our secret weapon.\n\nIn the state of Georgia a quiet revolution is taking place. My organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , has been persistently carrying on a voting and registration drive in concert with other groups. First in Atlanta, the Negro vote joined with white allies casting our ballots in secret, and together we crushed a rabid segregationist and put into the mayoralty seat a white moderate, who has already with us broken more walls of segregation in a year than were destroyed in decades. . . . [King went on to cite political victories in his home state of Georgia based on registering black voters, leading to the election of more moderate candidates for governor and Congress.]\n\nIt is heartwarming to share your successes, and gratifying to tell you of ours. We still have a long way to go and if we forget how great the sacrifices will be, there are always arsonists, lunatics, and rampaging bigots to remind us that death lurks nearby. But if physical death is the price that we must pay to free our children and our white children from a permanent death of the spirit, we'll accept it with quiet courage . . .\n\nOur lives are an endless concert of tensions, struggle, and pain. Many who would speak are silent. I have often looked at the imposing, segregated churches, which the religious South has in profusion, and asked the troubling question, \"What kind of people worship there? Who is their God?\"\n\nI don't know what kind of church you worship in. Perhaps many of you worship in none. Yet I know what kind of people you are and I know what God you worship.\n\nIn your long struggle for humanity and justice, you are religious in the deepest sense, whether you have realized it or not.\n\nWith all our problems we are optimistic. We are presiding over a dying order, one which has long deserved to die. We operate in stormy seas, but I often remember some beautiful words of Eugene Debs to the court which imprisoned him for his pacifism:\n\nI can see the dawn of a better humanity. The people are awakening. In due course of time they will come to their own.\n\nWhen the mariner, sailing over tropic seas, looks for relief from his weary watch, he turns his eye toward the Southern Cross, burning luridly above the tempest-vexed ocean. As the midnight approaches, the southern cross begins to bend, and the whirling-worlds change their places, and with starry finger-points the Almighty marks the passage of time upon the dial of the universe, and though no bell may bear the glad tidings, the lookout knows that the midnight is passing - that relief and rest are close at hand.\n\nLet the people take heart and hope everywhere, for the cross is bending, the midnight is passing, and joy cometh with the morning.\n\nExcerpted from All Labor Has Dignity by Martin Luther King Jr. Edited and introduced by Michael K.

Ivory Perry was one of these who waged a relentless war for racial and economic justice.\n\nIvory Perry addressing a civil rights demonstration in front of the St. Louis police headquarters on September 16, 1965. ( St. Louis Post-Dispatch / Missouri Historical Society)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAt every inflection point in social struggle, ordinary people emerge on the front lines of protests. Some are celebrated for generations as heroes, martyrs, and icons. But more often these leaders, uninsulated by economic and cultural privilege, pay an enormous price for bravery, and are forgotten by subsequent generations. Among the elderly poor, one occasionally finds a once-fearless activist, now living in modest obscurity, with only old war stories to show for it.\n\nOne forgotten fighter is Ivory Perry, who was in and out of homelessness in St. Louis over the years during which George Lipsitz interviewed him for his biography A Life in the Struggle: Ivory Perry and the Culture of Opposition .\n\nFor Lipsitz, the problem with traditional protest scholarship is that activists are required to be exemplars of bourgeois morality, \"striving to make the public realm conform to the standards of their private lives.\" In reality, organic leaders like Perry are often both politically effective and personally complex. Perry was born to a sharecropper in the Jim Crow South. Like many poor black men of Perry's background, he acquired a long arrest record - and not just for his political activism, though that too. In addition to homelessness, a dishonorable discharge, and incarceration, Perry experienced depression, drug use, and psychiatric issues that ultimately ended his life in tragedy.\n\nBut through it all, Perry waged a relentless war for racial and economic justice. For decades he could be found in the streets of St. Louis, raising hell in his signature straw hat. Perry wasn't perfect. He was an ordinary person dedicated to transforming society through racial and economic justice. Perry fought in the most dangerous parts of the South and Midwest, and his life story deserves to be remembered and learned from.\n\nPerry was born on a sharecropping farm in Desha County, Arkansas, in May of 1930. \"Perry was just two years old when his mother tied an empty twenty-five-pound flour sack for holding cotton around his neck and brought him to work alongside her in the fields,\" writes Lipsitz. The family earned around $1 per day, and no matter how many cotton bales the family picked, Ivory's mother, Pearl Perry, heard the same story: \"You almost got out of the hole this time; try again next year.\" Though organizations like the Southern Tenant Farmers Union attempted to improve the lives of black farmers, the situation remained dire. The Perry family moved to Pine Bluff, Arkansas, in 1943, seeking relief.\n\nIn Pine Bluff, Perry encountered Miss Jones of Merrill High School, who used to drive her car up and down the main street watching for students sneaking into juke joints. Miss Jones would walk right into the Strand or Vester theaters to search for students skipping school and drag them out on the spot.\n\nPerry admired Miss Jones for her honesty. She was a strong center around which community life revolved. \"If it weren't for Miss Jones,\" Perry told Lipsitz, \"I'd probably be dead now. She taught me respect for people and a respect for truth - that your word is supposed to be your bond.\" Perry would not always live up to Miss Jones's example, but he always took it seriously.\n\nPearl Perry took her son to church often, but Perry was skeptical. \"These whites doing lynchings, they were Baptists too,\" Perry remembered thinking. \"And I couldn't figure out, if they was such good Christians, why they were killing innocent people?\"\n\n\"This was a person who was born very close to slavery,\" Lipsitz told Jacobin , \"as thorough a dictatorship as you could imagine. And he was taught that there is always something you can do about that.\" Despite dire poverty and the entrenched racism that made equality seem unthinkable, the end of slavery opened utopian pathways in Perry's mind. His family and community were poor and oppressed. Instead of waiting for his eternal reward in heaven, \"I want to get my reward in this world,\" he decided.\n\nIn 1948 Perry joined the military, one of the only career paths available to him. He hoped to leave American racism behind but found that Arkansas followed him overseas. Lipsitz writes, \"Perry saw the words '[n-word] go home' scrawled on walls wherever white GIs had been, and he resented the publicity given to white units when victories by black troops went unreported.\" Black soldiers who fell asleep on sentry duty were charged with \"misconduct in the face of the enemy,\" while white soldiers faced a lesser charge of \"sleeping on duty.\"\n\nDuring the war, Perry got frostbite, and was shot twice by the enemy. On his own side, he was assaulted by white soldiers. \"I remember one night I was in Korea,\" Perry recalled, \"and a white soldier called me a [n-word]. And we got into it. . . . I got the best of him and he was bleeding like I don't know what.\" The white soldier repeated his offense over and over. \"And I said to myself then, 'Now this is a die-hard racist. He's gonna die a racist. Now he's over here fighting too and I'm trying to protect him because we're in the same outfit together.' But that kind of did something to me.\"\n\nIn interviews for A Life in the Struggle , it took time for Perry to admit that he was found guilty of insubordination and possession of drugs during service. Ivory claimed he'd purchased a coat with a small bag of heroin already in it. He was court-martialed and served time in the stockade before receiving a dishonorable discharge.\n\nIt was hardly an auspicious beginning to his decades of political activism. But Perry was not drawn to activism because it affirmed his virtue. He was drawn to it because he wanted more agency than was ordinarily afforded to a poor black man on the fringes of a racist and highly unequal society.\n\nReturning from Korea, Perry was struck by the United States' hypocrisy - a process that radicalized many black servicemen returning from World War II . His time in battle had left deep psychological wounds. \"Every now and then I still have a dream,\" Perry told Lipsitz. \"I hear kids crying, babies creaming. You know, we had some real stomp-down racists in the Korean War, officers. I done seen them burning houses up on ladies having babies. We used to tell them, 'Captain, there's a lady in there giving birth to a baby.' He still burned the house up.\" But his service in America's wars guaranteed him neither safety nor respect at home.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Amiri Baraka pointed out the fundamental connection between the Korean War and the emergence of the modern civil rights movement. Black Korean War veterans like James Foreman, Bobby Seale, and James Meredith entered activism after their experiences in the war, as did Perry when he arrived in St. Louis - a city every bit as racist as Arkansas, only less predictable.\n\n\"At least in Arkansas you knew what you could do and what you could not do,\" Perry said. In St. Louis, Perry found that the goalposts of acceptable behavior for black people moved constantly; punishment was severe, and often unexpected. But in the 1950s, the city swelled with industrial jobs, and a massive influx of black workers increased the likelihood of unrest. That friction created a new generation of activists.\n\nPerry took jobs that were typical for black St. Louis residents of the time: working in warehouses, driving taxicabs, spray painting, welding, blasting, steam cleaning, making sewer pipes at Dickey-Clay, painting electrical equipment at General Cable. And the police dogged him every step of the way. \"Ivory Perry acquired a long arrest record even though he had never been convicted of any crime,\" Lipsitz writes. \"Underpaid, harassed by police . . . those frustrations helped drive him into the Civil Rights Movement. . . . From Monday to Friday, he was just another laborer, but in the Civil Rights Movement he could take concrete actions that addressed the main hurts of his life.\"\n\nFor the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, an organic intellectual is not a \"momentary mover of feelings and passions.\" They are not supported by patrons and universities, and they are not detached from practical life. Instead, organic intellectuals represent a direct challenge to hegemonic class rule because they are rooted in, and deeply impacted by, the economic and political life of their community. Perry's community was black people, poor people, working people, the marginalized, the oppressed. He found meaning in advocacy for his neighbors. If a single mother needed her electricity turned back on, Perry would march down to the office and make it happen.\n\nLike Percy Green , another St. Louis civil rights leader, Ivory joined the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and took part in carefully planned confrontations with power including the 1963 Jefferson Bank Protest - a now-famous action against a citywide absence of black hires for white-collar jobs. The campaign \"brought large numbers of people from the black community into the Civil Rights Movement,\" says Lipsitz, and the actions won concessions from the bank.\n\nPerry moved between CORE and the more radical Action Committee to Improve Opportunities for Negroes (ACTION), which demanded jobs and improved economic prospects for black families, not just integration. Perry walked picket lines in protest of unfair hiring and chained himself to the doors of utility companies like Laclede Gas.\n\nAmid ongoing racial violence in Alabama, St. Louis activists wanted to draw attention to Martin Luther King Jr's planned protest march in Selma. Perry and another activist named Ernest Gilkey decided to disable a yellow U-Haul truck at a crucial off-ramp of a St. Louis highway. In coordination with three other actions, Perry drove the truck up the off-ramp of a major St. Louis highway, then parked it diagonally and turned off the ignition. \"He left the vehicle and locked its doors. Gilkey let the air out of the right front tire. When a taxi tried to pass the truck by driving on the grass shoulder, Perry threw himself in front of the cab, directly in front of the wheels,\" Lipsitz writes - a true Ivory Perry move. The cab driver slammed on the brakes, Ivory stayed put, and traffic backed up for hours and hours.\n\nPerry's highway protest cost him a $250 fine for disturbing the peace and thirty days in the squalid jail nicknamed \"The Workhouse.\" But as he'd hoped, the news media reported his arrest and his reasons, and the U-Haul stunt is credited with the impressive turnout on March 25, when Ivory Perry and nineteen busloads of St. Louis demonstrators traveled to Alabama to join the march. The Selma protests pressured Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nIn Bogalusa, Louisiana, Perry saw some of the most violent civil rights conflicts firsthand, battling the Ku Klux Klan and a complicit police force. Black workers and veterans formed an armed self-defense group called the Deacons for Defense and Justice. \"Bogalusa was very educational,\" Perry told Lipsitz, \"It showed me another side of America: violence and hatred that I couldn't believe could happen here. But there was also a damn good organization there - CORE people who could get the community organized and keep it organized.\"\n\nOf the Deacons for Defense and Justice , Perry said, \"I ain't never liked no guns. See I don't like killing and I don't like violence. You know, I was in Korea, and a lot of people say guns don't kill, that people kill. But guns do kill, because if you don't have a gun you wouldn't be able to kill nobody. I know it takes a person to pull the trigger, but I just don't like to spill no blood.\"\n\nPerry returned to St. Louis after the summer of '65 to a charged political atmosphere. St. Louis was just beginning an economic free fall that would last decades and impact the St. Louis working-class black community first and foremost. As the decline set in, Perry lent his efforts to neighborhood improvement associations and anti-poverty programs like the Human Development Corporation.\n\nThe Watts Riots dialed up tensions with police, and on September 13, 1965, a St. Louis officer put a bullet in fifteen-year-old Melvin Childs's back. The boy was fleeing the general area of a reported burglary. Four days later, police killed nineteen-year-old Robert Robinson when he fled questioning, and defended their right to shoot fleeing suspects. Wielding the slogan \"Police Brutality Must Go,\" Ivory Perry organized thousands to march on the St. Louis police station and City Hall that year, protesting the murder of black youths. All of this took place not far from Ferguson, Missouri, where the police killing of Michael Brown sparked the first wave of Black Lives Matter protests in 2014.\n\nIn time, just like Miss Jones, Perry became a pillar of the North St. Louis community. On the Northside, it was known that Ivory could help with a deadbeat landlord or an eviction notice. And he always kept a watchful eye on the police, unafraid to take them to task for harassment and violence.\n\nIn 1966, police shot and killed a nineteen-year-old black youth named Russell Hayes. Hayes was suspected of burglary, and the police said he was reaching into his back pocket for a gun - testimony that was obviously contradicted by the fact that the shooting took place in the courtyard of the police station where Hayes sat handcuffed in the back seat of a squad car. A few weeks later, a sixteen-year-old white youth named Timothy Walsh was shot and killed under similarly suspicious circumstances. Perry organized a joint confrontation with the St. Louis mayor on behalf of poor white and black families. Both communities were being terrorized by police.\n\nThe stress of organizing impoverished people in a dangerous city built up throughout the '60s. \"People in power blamed him for calling attention to social problems,\" Lipsitz writes. And despite his popularity in the community and centrality to its political life, he was also at times controversial among his own people. \"Poor people held him responsible when his tactics failed.\"\n\nMalcolm X's assassination had affected Perry deeply. When Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated, Perry underwent a nervous collapse. He feared a race war would engulf America, and experienced auditory hallucinations of King and Malcolm X encouraging him to keep the struggle alive. In an episode of mania, Perry was detained and assigned hospital bed rest. He was diagnosed with nervous depression.\n\nFrom 1968 onward, despite his mental health troubles, Ivory Perry continued as a foot soldier for civil rights. He could be found lying down in front of cars during demonstrations, or mounting the hood with a bull horn in his straw hat, or organizing tenant strikes for buildings that violated code. His greatest strength was his ability to organize people on front stoops and in living rooms, convincing them to fight back.\n\n\"He wasn't an orator,\" Lipsitz told Jacobin . \"He wasn't a role model like the figure of the black preacher. Perry's role in the community centered on action.\" That included both protest and advocacy. \"I don't know how many times I was interviewing Perry, and someone would come up and say, 'You don't remember me, but my mother was raising us, and we were about to have our lights turned off, and you went down to the utility company and got them turned on.'\" That was how Perry established trust as an independent radical, tied to his community organically.\n\nWhile out in the community Perry observed sickly children, often with skin rashes, runny noses, and frequent recurring colds. He noted that sometimes the children would eat chips of paint, which were sweet to the taste - and contained lead. Perry brought samples to a Washington University biologist, and it was confirmed that 95 percent of buildings in a surveyed area of North St. Louis contained lead-based paint and plaster, despite lead paint being banned in the 1950s.\n\nIvory Perry's longest and most successful organizing campaign was combating the hazards of lead poisoning in St. Louis. At first he was insulted and ignored by doctors and politicians, and spent his own money - what little he had - on testing and campaigning. Ivory was trusted by the community, and was allowed to enter houses to assess the hazard. He petitioned landlords to strip and repaint, and helped prosecute for negligence when they inevitably failed to comply. The unknown blight of child sickness and brain damage in St. Louis was given a name and a cause because Perry agitated, set up testing sites, and published the names of slumlords who refused to address the problem.\n\nThough a pivotal figure at the beginning of this campaign, Ivory would never see the full fruit of his efforts. Throughout the '80s, the reality of Perry's situation set in. He was a larger-than-life community activist - but he was also working-class black man in a deindustrialized city with a long arrest record and a lot of trauma, not least from squaring off against white racists and brutal police.\n\nThe organizations he championed, like ACTION, were harassed and broken up by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's COINTEL program. He was beset by legal trouble due to organizing - both in voter-registration campaigns and in organizing unions. Perry's mental health deteriorated further, and he was intermittently homeless. \"He began to see visions of what he took to be future events,\" Lipsitz writes, \"and to hear voices warning him about the dangers facing black people in America.\" Perry's family deteriorated, too.\n\nIn 1989, Ivory's son Reginald had been living with his father for three years. Ivory had secured his son's release from a group home in California, but Reginald was very ill. He had been committed to a psychiatric ward previously, and had threatened suicide.\n\nIvory himself was experiencing continued hallucinations while trying to remain active in local politics, but the situation was a powder keg. On February 15, it came to a brutal head. \"Twenty-four-year-old Reginald Perry walked into the Union Boulevard Seventh District Police Station two blocks from his home,\" writes Lipsitz, \"and told Officer Willie Mae Anderson at the front desk, 'I just murdered my father,' He placed a blood-stained thirteen-inch-long brown butcher's knife on the counter and started to cry.\"\n\nReginald Perry was convicted of first-degree murder. Ivory Perry died of his wounds.\n\n\"Ivory walked the hell zone of the decimated inner city to detoxify a building here, to place a family in substantial shelter there,\" wrote Otis L. Bolden, assistant dean at Forest Park Community College, after his death. \"Many black parents and more black children were touched in life sustaining ways by him.\"\n\nPerry hoped George Lipsitz's book, A Life in the Struggle, would cement his legacy as an activist and organizer, despite the chaos of his life. \"What he wanted from me was a bougie, coat-and-tie, glasses-wearing Jewish intellectual who could write a book that could go places he couldn't go,\" Liptiz told Jacobin . \"Be in college classrooms, be taken seriously by someone reviewing it in the newspaper, and that would pass along these lessons for someone who could find them.\"\n\n\"When I spoke at his funeral, I said he was the most connected, collective person I had ever known. It wasn't just that he had a lot of associates and friends,\" Lipsitz continued. It was that Perry was connected to the to the world and to life through collective struggle. For Perry, \"survival depended upon finding value in circumstances that others would find hopeless.\"\n\nDevin Thomas O'Shea's writing has appeared in the Nation , Protean , Current Affairs , Boulevard , and elsewhere.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

In those days only these workers were physically bound to their place of employment - the Negro to his plantation by guards, and the seaman by the watery isolation of his ship. Yours was never as humiliating a condition as chattel slavery, but the abuse of your freedom, and dignity of personality, were corrosive and destructive.\n\nThe sailors wrote a luminous page of history when they used their mighty strength and unity to civilize their work conditions. Everyone benefitted - other labor groups as well as employers because the violence and instability of the sea life of old could not be a basis for a great commerce. Nor could maltreated, brutalized men be entrusted with the multimillion-dollar ships of the modern era; nor with the safety of millions of passengers who now make the seas a highway.\n\nAnd so you and your industry have come a long way from great depths to great heights in your journey, achieving democratic practices which put you above many other segments of American life.\n\nWhat do I mean by this? I believe there is more simple nobility in your work than in almost any other. First, in the progress toward integration you are matchless because an integrated ship is a flower of democracy. On the sea, workers not only toil side by side, but they eat, sleep, and relax on an integrated basis. You are not divided by color, religion, or other distinctions. The men of a department work and sleep and eat without artificially imposed barriers between them. Mastering nature's giant seas requires unity, brotherhood, and in moments of peril, the color of a man's skin is of no importance, but the quality of his courage and resourcefulness is all important.\n\nSailors are unique workers possessing noble qualities because in time of war they assume risks many soldiers never experience, even though they remain civilians.\n\nLastly, every sailor is expected in the tradition of the sea to be willing to risk his life in order to save the life of another.\n\nSome years ago I read a newspaper story of an American liner which altered its course and stood by in a storm because a single man had been sighted floating on a raft. Thousands of passengers, many of them leaders of industry and eminent statesmen, were compelled to wait - perhaps altering a thousand appointments and conferences. The delivery of cargo and mail were delayed until one man was rescued from death. For me this incident had overwhelming spiritual and moral meaning because the multitude of distinguished people, who were inconvenienced, and the fortune in wealth which waited upon one man, dramatized the importance of a single human being in an age when we too easily forget people. But this incident was multiplied in meaning because that one man, whose life hung in the balance, was discovered to be a Negro when the lifeboat brought him to safety.\n\nIt is not often that everything stops and holds its breath for an ordinary Negro. I am happy to say that a similar situation finally did occur on land only recently when the governor of Mississippi tried to reverse history and victimize one Negro, only to find hundreds of millions lining up with James Meredith and an army mobilized at his side, for the sole purpose of ensuring his rights as an American citizen.\n\nReaching far back into the past, it is interesting that the brutal practice of flogging on ships was fought and abolished by a member of another minority group in the eighteenth century when Commodore Uriah Levy, a Jew, ended this barbaric practice in the US Navy.\n\nAll of your progress in humanism spread to other sectors of American life, making you pioneers of the human spirit.\n\nSo it is a natural extension of your tradition, it is consistent with your sense of brotherhood, that in celebrating your twenty-fifth anniversary, that with your deserved enjoyment and delight in the event, you also use it to make financial aid available to a people still fighting to realize their elementary rights and still seeking the long-promised pursuit of happiness. [The National Maritime Union, like other progressive unions, was a strong financial supporter of the civil rights movement .] Your twenty-fifth anniversary arranged in this constructive fashion honors you even beyond the achievement of twenty-five years of organized life. You sum up thousands of years of man's struggle to be human, decent, and honorable.\n\nOur nation is facing severe trials in these turbulent days because one region of our country still holds itself above law, as if it were cut adrift from constitutional obligations, and insurrection and mutiny against the government is still possible. They not only abuse persons, but they debase the democratic traditions of the nation in their defiant resort to anarchy and storm troop rule.\n\nAgainst this force, which has the power of states at its command, Negroes have searched for effective weapons. We believe we have found them. Emulating the labor movement , we in the South have embraced mass actions - boycotts, sit-ins and, more recently, a widespread utilization of the ballot.\n\nEmulating Biblical teachers and Mahatma Gandhi, we have seized the unique weapon of nonviolent resistance . It is a pleasure to tell you that our weapons work. They do not draw the blood of our adversary, but they do defeat the unjust system.\n\nA remarkably effective method has evolved and become a source of splendid strength in recent months. The secret ballot is our secret weapon.\n\nIn the state of Georgia a quiet revolution is taking place. My organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , has been persistently carrying on a voting and registration drive in concert with other groups. First in Atlanta, the Negro vote joined with white allies casting our ballots in secret, and together we crushed a rabid segregationist and put into the mayoralty seat a white moderate, who has already with us broken more walls of segregation in a year than were destroyed in decades. . . . [King went on to cite political victories in his home state of Georgia based on registering black voters, leading to the election of more moderate candidates for governor and Congress.]\n\nIt is heartwarming to share your successes, and gratifying to tell you of ours. We still have a long way to go and if we forget how great the sacrifices will be, there are always arsonists, lunatics, and rampaging bigots to remind us that death lurks nearby. But if physical death is the price that we must pay to free our children and our white children from a permanent death of the spirit, we'll accept it with quiet courage . . .\n\nOur lives are an endless concert of tensions, struggle, and pain. Many who would speak are silent. I have often looked at the imposing, segregated churches, which the religious South has in profusion, and asked the troubling question, \"What kind of people worship there? Who is their God?\"\n\nI don't know what kind of church you worship in. Perhaps many of you worship in none. Yet I know what kind of people you are and I know what God you worship.\n\nIn your long struggle for humanity and justice, you are religious in the deepest sense, whether you have realized it or not.\n\nWith all our problems we are optimistic. We are presiding over a dying order, one which has long deserved to die. We operate in stormy seas, but I often remember some beautiful words of Eugene Debs to the court which imprisoned him for his pacifism:\n\nI can see the dawn of a better humanity. The people are awakening. In due course of time they will come to their own.\n\nWhen the mariner, sailing over tropic seas, looks for relief from his weary watch, he turns his eye toward the Southern Cross, burning luridly above the tempest-vexed ocean. As the midnight approaches, the southern cross begins to bend, and the whirling-worlds change their places, and with starry finger-points the Almighty marks the passage of time upon the dial of the universe, and though no bell may bear the glad tidings, the lookout knows that the midnight is passing - that relief and rest are close at hand.\n\nLet the people take heart and hope everywhere, for the cross is bending, the midnight is passing, and joy cometh with the morning.\n\nExcerpted from All Labor Has Dignity by Martin Luther King Jr. Edited and introduced by Michael K.

Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nVirtually every Democratic Party politician, black or white, claims the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nConveniently forgotten is the fact that in the final years of his life, before his assassination in 1968, King broke with Democratic President Lyndon Johnson over the Vietnam War and the administration's failure to enforce civil rights legislation in the South. That's something no Democrats of national stature have been willing to do today.\n\nWhile the reforms advocated by King for most of his life were mild compared to the demands of the more radical black nationalists, they were nevertheless condemned by the same Democrats who have since tried to turn King into a heroic icon and a symbol of black accommodation to the system.\n\nIn order to understand King's eventual shift to the left, it's necessary to look at the class struggles that underpinned the civil rights movement and the nature of King's organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC).\n\nWhen King emerged as a leader of the Montgomery Bus Boycott in the 1950s, he was at the forefront of a local movement whose example was followed in dozens of other Southern cities in subsequent years. The organization he helped found, SCLC, established several field offices, but it was essentially a group of professional organizers who typically moved from city to city to be involved in struggles initiated by local black students, workers, and farmers.\n\nSCLC's aim was not to help these activists develop independently, but rather to lead them into nonviolent confrontation with segregationists and the brutal cops and state police who backed up Jim Crow law. According to SCLC leaders such as Hosea Williams and Wyatt T. Walker , the federal government would then be forced to intervene to support civil rights activists in order to stop the mayhem.\n\nAt first, the strategy seemed to work. A Supreme Court decision supported the Montgomery Bus Boycott. President Kennedy introduced civil rights legislation after Birmingham, AL cops repeatedly attacked SCLC-organized marches in 1963, and the bill became law a year later. Bloody confrontations in St Augustine, FL and Selma, AL prodded Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson, to push the Voting Rights Act of 1965 through Congress.\n\nKennedy and Johnson supported civil rights only when they believed it was necessary to stave off more militant black rebellion. They had no wish to alienate the powerful Southern Dixiecrat wing of their party. King and the SCLC 's protests could be tolerated as long as they remained \"nonviolent,\" were limited to fighting segregation in the South, and did not challenge racist economic discrimination rooted in US capitalism.\n\nBut by 1965, King's credibility among Southern activists was waning. The SCLC's habit of arriving in town in the midst of a struggle, grabbing the media spotlight, and negotiating a settlement irritated both local blacks and the increasingly radical members of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), who were trying to help Southern blacks develop their own leadership.\n\nMeanwhile, black nationalist Malcolm X rightly argued that the nonviolence advocated by King and the SCLC exposed blacks to attack by police and racist thugs.\n\nCriticism of King reached a new peak in Selma in 1965, where police tear-gassed and clubbed activists who were attempting to march to the state capital in Montgomery. When a second march was organized, police didn't block it. But King led marchers back into Selma rather than defy a court injunction. This retreat, along with King' s acceptance of token concessions from Selma politicians, was denounced as a sellout by radicals.\n\nDifferences spilled into the open a year later after James Meredith , the first black student to attend the University of Mississippi, was gunned down during his solo protest march across the state. King and SNCC leader Stokely Carmichael (later known as Kwame Ture) were among the civil rights leaders who joined several hundred activists to complete Meredith's march in the summer of 1966.\n\nHounded by racist thugs and brutal cops every step of the way, angry marchers eagerly joined Carmichael's impromptu chant of \"Black Power\" and listened intently to his nationalist ideas. While King refused to join more conservative black civil rights leaders in attacking the Black Power slogan as racist, he refused to support it on the grounds that it implied violence and would alienate potential white support.\n\n\"We've got to transform our movement into a positive and creative power,\" he said when asked his opinion of Carmichael. To black militants, King was viewed as a sellout. But to Democratic liberals, worried by the influence of black nationalist ideas and widespread black rebellions in Northern cities, King's position seemed a virtual endorsement of Black Power.\n\nKing recognized that he was trying to bridge an ever-widening gap. \"The government has got to give me some victories if I'm going to keep people nonviolent,\" he said. In fact, King would soon confront the Northern Democrats as an open enemy. Since the Voting Rights Act of 1965 had formally abolished the last of the Southern Jim Crow segregation laws, King and SCLC turned their attention to the increasingly militant Northern blacks.\n\nKing's final break with Johnson came in April 1967 when King called for the US to pull out of its \"colonial\" war in Vietnam.\n\nWhile a number of important Democratic senators had already turned against the war, most top civil rights leaders continued to support the administration. Liberal newspapers such as the New York Times and Washington Post , which had usually been sympathetic to King during the civil rights struggles in the South, attacked him for his antiwar stand.\n\nA vengeful Johnson allowed the FBI to step up its long-term harassment of King and other SCLC leaders. The president was outraged when he learned of King's plans to lead a Poor People's March on Washington to close down the US Capitol.\n\nJohnson and the Democrats had come to rely on King's nonviolent tactics and his support for their party as an important counterweight to the growing numbers of radicals in the rising Black Power revolt. When King denounced the war in 1967, the Democrats regarded him as a traitor.\n\nYet King's break with the Democrats did not earn him the support of blacks in the North, where street rebellions swept every major city in the country. The politics of the more radical black nationalists - particularly their advocacy of self-defense in the face of racist violence - seemed to speak more to the struggle in these circumstances.\n\nAttacked from both left and right, King was forced to rethink his career and the organization he led, the SCLC. \"We must admit there was a limitation of our achievement in the South,\" he told a meeting of the SCLC board in 1967. SCLC would have to call for a \"radical redistribution of wealth and power.\" On several occasions, King told his aides that the US needed a democratic socialism that would guarantee jobs and income for all.\n\nOther SCLC leaders, such as Andrew Young, Jesse Jackson, and Ralph Abernathy, were hostile to plans for the Poor People's March. The SCLC's Southern field offices had been neglected during an ill-fated attempt to organize against housing segregation in Chicago, and the group's Northern offices were even weaker.\n\nMoreover, the plan clashed with the black capitalist orientation of SCLC's Operation Breadbasket , directed by Jackson. \"If you are so interested in doing your own thing that you can't do what the organization is structured to do, go ahead,\" King said in response to Jackson's criticism of the march. \"If you want to carve out your own niche in society, go ahead, but for God's sake, don't bother me!\"\n\nStill, the Democrats saw betrayal in King's Poor People's Campaign - while the right wing declared it proved their longtime claim that King was a Communist. These elements, encouraged by the presidential campaign of segregationist Alabama Gov. George Wallace, publicly threatened King's life.\n\nFaced with hostility from the Johnson administration, criticism from both black nationalists and the black establishment, and a divided staff, King was politically isolated as never before when he was assassinated in Memphis on April 4, 1968 - less than three weeks before the Poor People's Campaign was to begin. King had travelled to Memphis to support a strike by black sanitation workers - he was the only national civil rights leader to do so.\n\nYet it wasn't long after his death that the media hacks of the ruling class began to convert King into a harmless saint.\n\nTo do this, however, they had to bury the real legacy of Martin Luther King - both the leader of the critical early struggles of the civil rights movement who refused to accept pleas for patience and moderation from his liberal Democratic allies, and the more radical black leader of the late 1960s whose vision of what needed to be changed in society had widened enormously.\n\nLee Sustar is a writer and activist in Chicago.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

In those days only these workers were physically bound to their place of employment - the Negro to his plantation by guards, and the seaman by the watery isolation of his ship. Yours was never as humiliating a condition as chattel slavery, but the abuse of your freedom, and dignity of personality, were corrosive and destructive.\n\nThe sailors wrote a luminous page of history when they used their mighty strength and unity to civilize their work conditions. Everyone benefitted - other labor groups as well as employers because the violence and instability of the sea life of old could not be a basis for a great commerce. Nor could maltreated, brutalized men be entrusted with the multimillion-dollar ships of the modern era; nor with the safety of millions of passengers who now make the seas a highway.\n\nAnd so you and your industry have come a long way from great depths to great heights in your journey, achieving democratic practices which put you above many other segments of American life.\n\nWhat do I mean by this? I believe there is more simple nobility in your work than in almost any other. First, in the progress toward integration you are matchless because an integrated ship is a flower of democracy. On the sea, workers not only toil side by side, but they eat, sleep, and relax on an integrated basis. You are not divided by color, religion, or other distinctions. The men of a department work and sleep and eat without artificially imposed barriers between them. Mastering nature's giant seas requires unity, brotherhood, and in moments of peril, the color of a man's skin is of no importance, but the quality of his courage and resourcefulness is all important.\n\nSailors are unique workers possessing noble qualities because in time of war they assume risks many soldiers never experience, even though they remain civilians.\n\nLastly, every sailor is expected in the tradition of the sea to be willing to risk his life in order to save the life of another.\n\nSome years ago I read a newspaper story of an American liner which altered its course and stood by in a storm because a single man had been sighted floating on a raft. Thousands of passengers, many of them leaders of industry and eminent statesmen, were compelled to wait - perhaps altering a thousand appointments and conferences. The delivery of cargo and mail were delayed until one man was rescued from death. For me this incident had overwhelming spiritual and moral meaning because the multitude of distinguished people, who were inconvenienced, and the fortune in wealth which waited upon one man, dramatized the importance of a single human being in an age when we too easily forget people. But this incident was multiplied in meaning because that one man, whose life hung in the balance, was discovered to be a Negro when the lifeboat brought him to safety.\n\nIt is not often that everything stops and holds its breath for an ordinary Negro. I am happy to say that a similar situation finally did occur on land only recently when the governor of Mississippi tried to reverse history and victimize one Negro, only to find hundreds of millions lining up with James Meredith and an army mobilized at his side, for the sole purpose of ensuring his rights as an American citizen.\n\nReaching far back into the past, it is interesting that the brutal practice of flogging on ships was fought and abolished by a member of another minority group in the eighteenth century when Commodore Uriah Levy, a Jew, ended this barbaric practice in the US Navy.\n\nAll of your progress in humanism spread to other sectors of American life, making you pioneers of the human spirit.\n\nSo it is a natural extension of your tradition, it is consistent with your sense of brotherhood, that in celebrating your twenty-fifth anniversary, that with your deserved enjoyment and delight in the event, you also use it to make financial aid available to a people still fighting to realize their elementary rights and still seeking the long-promised pursuit of happiness. [The National Maritime Union, like other progressive unions, was a strong financial supporter of the civil rights movement .] Your twenty-fifth anniversary arranged in this constructive fashion honors you even beyond the achievement of twenty-five years of organized life. You sum up thousands of years of man's struggle to be human, decent, and honorable.\n\nOur nation is facing severe trials in these turbulent days because one region of our country still holds itself above law, as if it were cut adrift from constitutional obligations, and insurrection and mutiny against the government is still possible. They not only abuse persons, but they debase the democratic traditions of the nation in their defiant resort to anarchy and storm troop rule.\n\nAgainst this force, which has the power of states at its command, Negroes have searched for effective weapons. We believe we have found them. Emulating the labor movement , we in the South have embraced mass actions - boycotts, sit-ins and, more recently, a widespread utilization of the ballot.\n\nEmulating Biblical teachers and Mahatma Gandhi, we have seized the unique weapon of nonviolent resistance . It is a pleasure to tell you that our weapons work. They do not draw the blood of our adversary, but they do defeat the unjust system.\n\nA remarkably effective method has evolved and become a source of splendid strength in recent months. The secret ballot is our secret weapon.\n\nIn the state of Georgia a quiet revolution is taking place. My organization, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference , has been persistently carrying on a voting and registration drive in concert with other groups. First in Atlanta, the Negro vote joined with white allies casting our ballots in secret, and together we crushed a rabid segregationist and put into the mayoralty seat a white moderate, who has already with us broken more walls of segregation in a year than were destroyed in decades. . . . [King went on to cite political victories in his home state of Georgia based on registering black voters, leading to the election of more moderate candidates for governor and Congress.]\n\nIt is heartwarming to share your successes, and gratifying to tell you of ours. We still have a long way to go and if we forget how great the sacrifices will be, there are always arsonists, lunatics, and rampaging bigots to remind us that death lurks nearby. But if physical death is the price that we must pay to free our children and our white children from a permanent death of the spirit, we'll accept it with quiet courage . . .\n\nOur lives are an endless concert of tensions, struggle, and pain. Many who would speak are silent. I have often looked at the imposing, segregated churches, which the religious South has in profusion, and asked the troubling question, \"What kind of people worship there? Who is their God?\"\n\nI don't know what kind of church you worship in. Perhaps many of you worship in none. Yet I know what kind of people you are and I know what God you worship.\n\nIn your long struggle for humanity and justice, you are religious in the deepest sense, whether you have realized it or not.\n\nWith all our problems we are optimistic. We are presiding over a dying order, one which has long deserved to die. We operate in stormy seas, but I often remember some beautiful words of Eugene Debs to the court which imprisoned him for his pacifism:\n\nI can see the dawn of a better humanity. The people are awakening. In due course of time they will come to their own.\n\nWhen the mariner, sailing over tropic seas, looks for relief from his weary watch, he turns his eye toward the Southern Cross, burning luridly above the tempest-vexed ocean. As the midnight approaches, the southern cross begins to bend, and the whirling-worlds change their places, and with starry finger-points the Almighty marks the passage of time upon the dial of the universe, and though no bell may bear the glad tidings, the lookout knows that the midnight is passing - that relief and rest are close at hand.\n\nLet the people take heart and hope everywhere, for the cross is bending, the midnight is passing, and joy cometh with the morning.\n\nExcerpted from All Labor Has Dignity by Martin Luther King Jr. Edited and introduced by Michael K.

      "text": "Jacobin\n\nLogin\n\nActivists are often held up as exemplars of personal morality - but in every social struggle, ordinary people with complex lives rise up as leaders. Ivory Perry was one of these who waged a relentless war for racial and economic justice.\n\nIvory Perry addressing a civil rights demonstration in front of the St. Louis police headquarters on September 16, 1965. ( St. Louis Post-Dispatch / Missouri Historical Society)\n\nOur new issue, \"Progress,\" is out now. Subscribe to our print edition at a discounted rate today.\n\nAt every inflection point in social struggle, ordinary people emerge on the front lines of protests. Some are celebrated for generations as heroes, martyrs, and icons. But more often these leaders, uninsulated by economic and cultural privilege, pay an enormous price for bravery, and are forgotten by subsequent generations. Among the elderly poor, one occasionally finds a once-fearless activist, now living in modest obscurity, with only old war stories to show for it.\n\nOne forgotten fighter is Ivory Perry, who was in and out of homelessness in St. Louis over the years during which George Lipsitz interviewed him for his biography A Life in the Struggle: Ivory Perry and the Culture of Opposition .\n\nFor Lipsitz, the problem with traditional protest scholarship is that activists are required to be exemplars of bourgeois morality, \"striving to make the public realm conform to the standards of their private lives.\" In reality, organic leaders like Perry are often both politically effective and personally complex. Perry was born to a sharecropper in the Jim Crow South. Like many poor black men of Perry's background, he acquired a long arrest record - and not just for his political activism, though that too. In addition to homelessness, a dishonorable discharge, and incarceration, Perry experienced depression, drug use, and psychiatric issues that ultimately ended his life in tragedy.\n\nBut through it all, Perry waged a relentless war for racial and economic justice. For decades he could be found in the streets of St. Louis, raising hell in his signature straw hat. Perry wasn't perfect. He was an ordinary person dedicated to transforming society through racial and economic justice. Perry fought in the most dangerous parts of the South and Midwest, and his life story deserves to be remembered and learned from.\n\nPerry was born on a sharecropping farm in Desha County, Arkansas, in May of 1930. \"Perry was just two years old when his mother tied an empty twenty-five-pound flour sack for holding cotton around his neck and brought him to work alongside her in the fields,\" writes Lipsitz. The family earned around $1 per day, and no matter how many cotton bales the family picked, Ivory's mother, Pearl Perry, heard the same story: \"You almost got out of the hole this time; try again next year.\" Though organizations like the Southern Tenant Farmers Union attempted to improve the lives of black farmers, the situation remained dire. The Perry family moved to Pine Bluff, Arkansas, in 1943, seeking relief.\n\nIn Pine Bluff, Perry encountered Miss Jones of Merrill High School, who used to drive her car up and down the main street watching for students sneaking into juke joints. Miss Jones would walk right into the Strand or Vester theaters to search for students skipping school and drag them out on the spot.\n\nPerry admired Miss Jones for her honesty. She was a strong center around which community life revolved. \"If it weren't for Miss Jones,\" Perry told Lipsitz, \"I'd probably be dead now. She taught me respect for people and a respect for truth - that your word is supposed to be your bond.\" Perry would not always live up to Miss Jones's example, but he always took it seriously.\n\nPearl Perry took her son to church often, but Perry was skeptical. \"These whites doing lynchings, they were Baptists too,\" Perry remembered thinking. \"And I couldn't figure out, if they was such good Christians, why they were killing innocent people?\"\n\n\"This was a person who was born very close to slavery,\" Lipsitz told Jacobin , \"as thorough a dictatorship as you could imagine. And he was taught that there is always something you can do about that.\" Despite dire poverty and the entrenched racism that made equality seem unthinkable, the end of slavery opened utopian pathways in Perry's mind. His family and community were poor and oppressed. Instead of waiting for his eternal reward in heaven, \"I want to get my reward in this world,\" he decided.\n\nIn 1948 Perry joined the military, one of the only career paths available to him. He hoped to leave American racism behind but found that Arkansas followed him overseas. Lipsitz writes, \"Perry saw the words '[n-word] go home' scrawled on walls wherever white GIs had been, and he resented the publicity given to white units when victories by black troops went unreported.\" Black soldiers who fell asleep on sentry duty were charged with \"misconduct in the face of the enemy,\" while white soldiers faced a lesser charge of \"sleeping on duty.\"\n\nDuring the war, Perry got frostbite, and was shot twice by the enemy. On his own side, he was assaulted by white soldiers. \"I remember one night I was in Korea,\" Perry recalled, \"and a white soldier called me a [n-word]. And we got into it. . . . I got the best of him and he was bleeding like I don't know what.\" The white soldier repeated his offense over and over. \"And I said to myself then, 'Now this is a die-hard racist. He's gonna die a racist. Now he's over here fighting too and I'm trying to protect him because we're in the same outfit together.' But that kind of did something to me.\"\n\nIn interviews for A Life in the Struggle , it took time for Perry to admit that he was found guilty of insubordination and possession of drugs during service. Ivory claimed he'd purchased a coat with a small bag of heroin already in it. He was court-martialed and served time in the stockade before receiving a dishonorable discharge.\n\nIt was hardly an auspicious beginning to his decades of political activism. But Perry was not drawn to activism because it affirmed his virtue. He was drawn to it because he wanted more agency than was ordinarily afforded to a poor black man on the fringes of a racist and highly unequal society.\n\nReturning from Korea, Perry was struck by the United States' hypocrisy - a process that radicalized many black servicemen returning from World War II . His time in battle had left deep psychological wounds. \"Every now and then I still have a dream,\" Perry told Lipsitz. \"I hear kids crying, babies creaming. You know, we had some real stomp-down racists in the Korean War, officers. I done seen them burning houses up on ladies having babies. We used to tell them, 'Captain, there's a lady in there giving birth to a baby.' He still burned the house up.\" But his service in America's wars guaranteed him neither safety nor respect at home.\n\nIn the early 1960s, Amiri Baraka pointed out the fundamental connection between the Korean War and the emergence of the modern civil rights movement. Black Korean War veterans like James Foreman, Bobby Seale, and James Meredith entered activism after their experiences in the war, as did Perry when he arrived in St. Louis - a city every bit as racist as Arkansas, only less predictable.\n\n\"At least in Arkansas you knew what you could do and what you could not do,\" Perry said. In St. Louis, Perry found that the goalposts of acceptable behavior for black people moved constantly; punishment was severe, and often unexpected. But in the 1950s, the city swelled with industrial jobs, and a massive influx of black workers increased the likelihood of unrest. That friction created a new generation of activists.\n\nPerry took jobs that were typical for black St. Louis residents of the time: working in warehouses, driving taxicabs, spray painting, welding, blasting, steam cleaning, making sewer pipes at Dickey-Clay, painting electrical equipment at General Cable. And the police dogged him every step of the way. \"Ivory Perry acquired a long arrest record even though he had never been convicted of any crime,\" Lipsitz writes. \"Underpaid, harassed by police . . . those frustrations helped drive him into the Civil Rights Movement. . . . From Monday to Friday, he was just another laborer, but in the Civil Rights Movement he could take concrete actions that addressed the main hurts of his life.\"\n\nFor the Italian Marxist Antonio Gramsci, an organic intellectual is not a \"momentary mover of feelings and passions.\" They are not supported by patrons and universities, and they are not detached from practical life. Instead, organic intellectuals represent a direct challenge to hegemonic class rule because they are rooted in, and deeply impacted by, the economic and political life of their community. Perry's community was black people, poor people, working people, the marginalized, the oppressed. He found meaning in advocacy for his neighbors. If a single mother needed her electricity turned back on, Perry would march down to the office and make it happen.\n\nLike Percy Green , another St. Louis civil rights leader, Ivory joined the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and took part in carefully planned confrontations with power including the 1963 Jefferson Bank Protest - a now-famous action against a citywide absence of black hires for white-collar jobs. The campaign \"brought large numbers of people from the black community into the Civil Rights Movement,\" says Lipsitz, and the actions won concessions from the bank.\n\nPerry moved between CORE and the more radical Action Committee to Improve Opportunities for Negroes (ACTION), which demanded jobs and improved economic prospects for black families, not just integration. Perry walked picket lines in protest of unfair hiring and chained himself to the doors of utility companies like Laclede Gas.\n\nAmid ongoing racial violence in Alabama, St. Louis activists wanted to draw attention to Martin Luther King Jr's planned protest march in Selma. Perry and another activist named Ernest Gilkey decided to disable a yellow U-Haul truck at a crucial off-ramp of a St. Louis highway. In coordination with three other actions, Perry drove the truck up the off-ramp of a major St. Louis highway, then parked it diagonally and turned off the ignition. \"He left the vehicle and locked its doors. Gilkey let the air out of the right front tire. When a taxi tried to pass the truck by driving on the grass shoulder, Perry threw himself in front of the cab, directly in front of the wheels,\" Lipsitz writes - a true Ivory Perry move. The cab driver slammed on the brakes, Ivory stayed put, and traffic backed up for hours and hours.\n\nPerry's highway protest cost him a $250 fine for disturbing the peace and thirty days in the squalid jail nicknamed \"The Workhouse.\" But as he'd hoped, the news media reported his arrest and his reasons, and the U-Haul stunt is credited with the impressive turnout on March 25, when Ivory Perry and nineteen busloads of St. Louis demonstrators traveled to Alabama to join the march. The Selma protests pressured Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nIn Bogalusa, Louisiana, Perry saw some of the most violent civil rights conflicts firsthand, battling the Ku Klux Klan and a complicit police force. Black workers and veterans formed an armed self-defense group called the Deacons for Defense and Justice. \"Bogalusa was very educational,\" Perry told Lipsitz, \"It showed me another side of America: violence and hatred that I couldn't believe could happen here. But there was also a damn good organization there - CORE people who could get the community organized and keep it organized.\"\n\nOf the Deacons for Defense and Justice , Perry said, \"I ain't never liked no guns. See I don't like killing and I don't like violence. You know, I was in Korea, and a lot of people say guns don't kill, that people kill. But guns do kill, because if you don't have a gun you wouldn't be able to kill nobody. I know it takes a person to pull the trigger, but I just don't like to spill no blood.\"\n\nPerry returned to St. Louis after the summer of '65 to a charged political atmosphere. St. Louis was just beginning an economic free fall that would last decades and impact the St. Louis working-class black community first and foremost. As the decline set in, Perry lent his efforts to neighborhood improvement associations and anti-poverty programs like the Human Development Corporation.\n\nThe Watts Riots dialed up tensions with police, and on September 13, 1965, a St. Louis officer put a bullet in fifteen-year-old Melvin Childs's back. The boy was fleeing the general area of a reported burglary. Four days later, police killed nineteen-year-old Robert Robinson when he fled questioning, and defended their right to shoot fleeing suspects. Wielding the slogan \"Police Brutality Must Go,\" Ivory Perry organized thousands to march on the St. Louis police station and City Hall that year, protesting the murder of black youths. All of this took place not far from Ferguson, Missouri, where the police killing of Michael Brown sparked the first wave of Black Lives Matter protests in 2014.\n\nIn time, just like Miss Jones, Perry became a pillar of the North St. Louis community. On the Northside, it was known that Ivory could help with a deadbeat landlord or an eviction notice. And he always kept a watchful eye on the police, unafraid to take them to task for harassment and violence.\n\nIn 1966, police shot and killed a nineteen-year-old black youth named Russell Hayes. Hayes was suspected of burglary, and the police said he was reaching into his back pocket for a gun - testimony that was obviously contradicted by the fact that the shooting took place in the courtyard of the police station where Hayes sat handcuffed in the back seat of a squad car. A few weeks later, a sixteen-year-old white youth named Timothy Walsh was shot and killed under similarly suspicious circumstances. Perry organized a joint confrontation with the St. Louis mayor on behalf of poor white and black families. Both communities were being terrorized by police.\n\nThe stress of organizing impoverished people in a dangerous city built up throughout the '60s. \"People in power blamed him for calling attention to social problems,\" Lipsitz writes. And despite his popularity in the community and centrality to its political life, he was also at times controversial among his own people. \"Poor people held him responsible when his tactics failed.\"\n\nMalcolm X's assassination had affected Perry deeply. When Martin Luther King Jr was assassinated, Perry underwent a nervous collapse. He feared a race war would engulf America, and experienced auditory hallucinations of King and Malcolm X encouraging him to keep the struggle alive. In an episode of mania, Perry was detained and assigned hospital bed rest. He was diagnosed with nervous depression.\n\nFrom 1968 onward, despite his mental health troubles, Ivory Perry continued as a foot soldier for civil rights. He could be found lying down in front of cars during demonstrations, or mounting the hood with a bull horn in his straw hat, or organizing tenant strikes for buildings that violated code. His greatest strength was his ability to organize people on front stoops and in living rooms, convincing them to fight back.\n\n\"He wasn't an orator,\" Lipsitz told Jacobin . \"He wasn't a role model like the figure of the black preacher. Perry's role in the community centered on action.\" That included both protest and advocacy. \"I don't know how many times I was interviewing Perry, and someone would come up and say, 'You don't remember me, but my mother was raising us, and we were about to have our lights turned off, and you went down to the utility company and got them turned on.'\" That was how Perry established trust as an independent radical, tied to his community organically.\n\nWhile out in the community Perry observed sickly children, often with skin rashes, runny noses, and frequent recurring colds. He noted that sometimes the children would eat chips of paint, which were sweet to the taste - and contained lead. Perry brought samples to a Washington University biologist, and it was confirmed that 95 percent of buildings in a surveyed area of North St. Louis contained lead-based paint and plaster, despite lead paint being banned in the 1950s.\n\nIvory Perry's longest and most successful organizing campaign was combating the hazards of lead poisoning in St. Louis. At first he was insulted and ignored by doctors and politicians, and spent his own money - what little he had - on testing and campaigning. Ivory was trusted by the community, and was allowed to enter houses to assess the hazard. He petitioned landlords to strip and repaint, and helped prosecute for negligence when they inevitably failed to comply. The unknown blight of child sickness and brain damage in St. Louis was given a name and a cause because Perry agitated, set up testing sites, and published the names of slumlords who refused to address the problem.\n\nThough a pivotal figure at the beginning of this campaign, Ivory would never see the full fruit of his efforts. Throughout the '80s, the reality of Perry's situation set in. He was a larger-than-life community activist - but he was also working-class black man in a deindustrialized city with a long arrest record and a lot of trauma, not least from squaring off against white racists and brutal police.\n\nThe organizations he championed, like ACTION, were harassed and broken up by the Federal Bureau of Investigation's COINTEL program. He was beset by legal trouble due to organizing - both in voter-registration campaigns and in organizing unions. Perry's mental health deteriorated further, and he was intermittently homeless. \"He began to see visions of what he took to be future events,\" Lipsitz writes, \"and to hear voices warning him about the dangers facing black people in America.\" Perry's family deteriorated, too.\n\nIn 1989, Ivory's son Reginald had been living with his father for three years. Ivory had secured his son's release from a group home in California, but Reginald was very ill. He had been committed to a psychiatric ward previously, and had threatened suicide.\n\nIvory himself was experiencing continued hallucinations while trying to remain active in local politics, but the situation was a powder keg. On February 15, it came to a brutal head. \"Twenty-four-year-old Reginald Perry walked into the Union Boulevard Seventh District Police Station two blocks from his home,\" writes Lipsitz, \"and told Officer Willie Mae Anderson at the front desk, 'I just murdered my father,' He placed a blood-stained thirteen-inch-long brown butcher's knife on the counter and started to cry.\"\n\nReginald Perry was convicted of first-degree murder. Ivory Perry died of his wounds.\n\n\"Ivory walked the hell zone of the decimated inner city to detoxify a building here, to place a family in substantial shelter there,\" wrote Otis L. Bolden, assistant dean at Forest Park Community College, after his death. \"Many black parents and more black children were touched in life sustaining ways by him.\"\n\nPerry hoped George Lipsitz's book, A Life in the Struggle, would cement his legacy as an activist and organizer, despite the chaos of his life. \"What he wanted from me was a bougie, coat-and-tie, glasses-wearing Jewish intellectual who could write a book that could go places he couldn't go,\" Liptiz told Jacobin . \"Be in college classrooms, be taken seriously by someone reviewing it in the newspaper, and that would pass along these lessons for someone who could find them.\"\n\n\"When I spoke at his funeral, I said he was the most connected, collective person I had ever known. It wasn't just that he had a lot of associates and friends,\" Lipsitz continued. It was that Perry was connected to the to the world and to life through collective struggle. For Perry, \"survival depended upon finding value in circumstances that others would find hopeless.\"\n\nDevin Thomas O'Shea's writing has appeared in the Nation , Protean , Current Affairs , Boulevard , and elsewhere.\n\n{{ message }}\n\nThanks for signing up! →\n\nAlready on our list?

      "text": "The Racism of \"Ole Miss\" Is Hiding in Plain Sight\n\nBecca Andrews July 1, 2020\n\nMother Jones illustration; Bettmann/Getty\n\nMother Jones illustration; Bettmann/Getty\n\nAt the entrance of the University of Mississippi campus in Oxford, the statue of a white marble man sits among the magnolia and oak trees. The gift from the Daughters of the Confederacy, a soldier, his arm in salute, a rifle at his side, has presided over passersby entering the university since 1906. He is perched atop a matching white marble spire so that the tip of his hat reaches toward the treetops. A plaque at the base of the monument, revised in 2016 as part of a historical contextualization project , allows that the statue was one in a series of memorials that \"were often used to promote an ideology known as the ' Lost Cause ,' which claimed that the Confederacy had been established to defend states' rights and that slavery was not the principal cause of the Civil War.\"\n\nStill, it stands.\n\nBut now, after more than a century, the anonymous soldier will finally be ousted from his premier spot -a move that's the direct result of a sustained campaign led by University of Mississippi students . \"We still have a long way to go, but it's still a victory, and I think we are allowed to celebrate it,\" Arielle Hudson, a recent graduate and the university's first Black female Rhodes scholar, tells me.\n\nBut it wasn't easy to get here. More than a year ago, the Associated Student Body Senate for inclusion and cross-cultural engagement unanimously passed a resolution that stated, \"Confederate ideology directly violates the tenets of the university creed that supports fairness, civility, and respect for the dignity of each person.\" While plans were made with the university to move the statue, the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning stepped in, declaring that the marble soldier falls under its purview and putting the plans on indefinite pause.\n\nBut in this moment of broader racial reckoning spurred by the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd, the already thinning tolerance for hand-wringing over such symbols has largely evaporated. In mid-June, the IHL agreed to move the statue to a less-prestigious placement, keeping watch over the dead in a Confederate cemetery in an area with less foot traffic, behind an old coliseum that's no longer in regular use.\n\nUndoubtedly the ultra-conservative IHL relaxing its grip is an important step. Persuading the university five years ago to discontinue the use of the Mississippi state flag-which, until Gov. Tate Reeves signed a law to retire it this week, was the last state flag to feature the Confederate battle flag design-was a similarly important one. And so was the university's pledge , just last month, to review its \"admissions and judicial review policies and protocols\" to deal with prospective students whose social media pages include racist posts.\n\nEven so, each step away from the school's \"Old South\" image ultimately seems marked by ambivalence. Soon after the announcement that the entrance's Confederate statue would be moved, plans surfaced to renovate the cemetery to create a sort of \"shrine\" effect (though the university says the design is not final). And while it is unclear what exactly will change for its admissions and judicial review policies, the university's stance has long been that it is unwilling to court costly First Amendment lawsuits, even as schools like the University of Alabama have expelled students over racist social media posts.\n\nAnd, crucially, no matter what happens with these measures, there remains an implicit tribute to white supremacy on campus that has proven tougher to exorcise, one many people don't even realize is there. The \"Ole Miss\" moniker has long informed the core of the institution's identity and the surrounding community, not to mention its powerful brand. But this is not merely a convenient abbreviation of the long official name. It's a phrase that's long haunted Black students, faculty, and staff as a lingering nod to the days when it seemed unthinkable that a place like the university would ever accept them only because of their skin.\n\nWhile statues all over the country come down, and the United States reckons with its racist past, it is time to confront the more insidious forms of white supremacy-especially those so easy to take for granted that it becomes harder and harder to recognize them for what they really are. They are not monuments or flags, but they are hidden in our language and our customs, their origins masked by time and intent.\n\nWhen Zaire Love was accepted into the University of Mississippi's documentary program to pursue her MFA, she was thrilled. In July 2018, she posted a photo to share the news that she would attend her dream school on full scholarship, no less; she looks uncertain but triumphant. Under a camo jacket draped perfectly off her shoulders, her white T-shirt is one she made herself: navy blue scripted letters sing \"Ole Miss Mane.\"\n\n\"I thought I was putting my Blackness and my Black flavor on it,\" she says. She didn't know just what it meant at the time, but she remembers her bitter disappointment the day she found out.\n\nThat summer, Love left her home in Memphis to mentor teenagers on campus through the William Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation. She was eager to get involved in a new community, and the program seemed like the perfect way to jumpstart a new chapter in her life. While she was there, the origin story of the name \"Ole Miss\" came up.\n\nLove learned that a student, Elma Meek, proposed the name in 1896 for a new yearbook that was being created by an interfraternity group. Her inspiration reportedly came \"from the language of the Ante-bellum 'Darkey,ʼ who knew the wife of his owner by no other title than 'Ole Miss,ʼ\" according to the student newspaper, then called The Mississippian. In an interview with that paper in the 1930s, Meek said she felt the name \"connoted all the admiration and reverence accorded the womanhood of the Old South.\" This intervention afforded Meek herself a vaunted spot in Oxford mythology; long after she had stopped attending classes at the university, Meek lived in a house near the campus that was built by a Confederate general. (For a while, William Faulkner and his wife lived with her there; it's actually where he wrote much of As I Lay Dying and \"A Rose for Emily.\") Today, the house is fiercely protected from any attempts at change, down to its air ducts, by the local Historic Preservation Commission. But more than Meek's sentimental history, the name she proposed has stuck, so wildly outliving its origins that many, many people who pass through the Oxford campus or tailgate in the Grove or simply follow the sports teams with mild interest are unaware of the horrors hidden therein.\n\n(The university did not respond to multiple interview requests from Mother Jones , but sent a statement from Chancellor Glenn Boyce: \"Ole Miss is a term of affinity for many of our people that is intrinsic to the university's identity and carries strong, positive national and international recognition. We understand the complex history of its origins...at the same time, it is a term whose meaning has changed over time, and we are committed to living by what it means today to our students and alumni who embrace it as an expression of caring and community.\" The email also included a chapter from a book titled, The Other Mississippi: A State in Conflict with Itself ; written by David Sansing, the University of Mississippi's late historian, the selection emphasizes that the term \"Ole Miss\" was one of \"respect and endearment\" used by slaves, and twice says that Meek's intention was not to \"reminisce or regale\" slavery, rather she only meant to \"link her alma mater to those grand women of the antebellum South.\")\n\nUpon learning this history, Love was determined not to use the casual nickname again. \"I'm going to stand up and say this is not what I want to use,\" she says. But, she admits, it's not exactly easy to just remove yourself from something so wrapped up in campus culture-\"It's also the lay of the land. It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't-type situation.\"\n\nThere are so many people-not all of them white-who do not know the university as anything other than \"Ole Miss.\" It's everywhere around you in Oxford; on billboards that advertise the university as you drive into town, on signs and on campus, on T-shirts, ball caps, stickers, school supplies, tacked onto the end of every student's and faculty member's email address. There is no University of Mississippi; there is only \"Ole Miss.\"\n\nFor most of my life, I was among the oblivious. The historical context of \"Ole Miss\" was news to me when late last year a former high school classmate of mine posted a 2019 Chronicle of Higher Ed article on Facebook detailing origins of the university's hoary nickname. I am a Southern white woman who has always spoken those words, \"Ole Miss,\" in the context of a dearly held rivalry between the university in Oxford and Mississippi State University, where most of my family has attended school for generations. It once vaguely connoted home to me, recalling Thanksgivings at my grandmother's house in Tupelo, the television in the living room blaring the Egg Bowl, the annual football faceoff between the schools, as we cleaned up the kitchen and carefully put away the leftovers.\n\nCheerleaders carry \"Ole Miss\" flags during a game against the Memphis Tigers at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium on October 1, 2016, in Oxford, Mississippi. Jonathan Bachman/Getty I'm not sure I've ever heard anyone refer to it as the University of Mississippi until recently, but the discovery that words that I once regarded as neutral, even charming, contain a bitter connotation has changed that. For weeks, I couldn't stop thinking about this new context. I quizzed everyone I encountered about the once-beloved nickname; in bars, at work, on the phone with folks back home-no one knew. That racism often hides in language is not a new concept to me; I grew up as a white girl in the South. But that also means I hid from those realities behind my privilege and youth for an unforgivably long time. Even as a child, I often sensed some lingering evil when racism was dressed up as something innocuous-yet in the name \"Ole Miss,\" for nearly three decades, I heard only a folksy alternative to an unwieldy school name. \"If you talk to students, they will say that it weighs on their everyday experiences on this campus.\" A few weeks after reading the article, I wandered the campus with my cousin, struck by the depth of the school's commitment to the branding-wondering how I went so long without knowing, becoming fixated on how the name that literally looms over everyone's heads affects life for students and staff of color. The student population is 76 percent white and only 13 percent Black; similarly, the faculty is 78 percent white and only 6 percent Black. \"If you talk to students-and this is both students in general, Black, white, and otherwise, but especially with students of color-they will say that it weighs on their everyday experiences on this campus-the 'it' being the racial history of the campus,\" says Brian Foster, an assistant professor in the sociology department, who is Black. Interviews with students add further dimensions to Foster's assessment. While Love is careful to point out that as a graduate student she is not on campus as often as undergraduates are, she notes, \"Our ancestors already paid the price. We don't need to add tax by continuing to have those symbols of oppression at the University of Mississippi.\" For her part, Yasmine Malone, a rising senior at the university, likes the nickname itself, stripped of its origins, but it bothers her that she feels like the school is less than clear about where it comes from. A classmate, Isabel Spafford, says she heard the claim on a campus tour that the name is taken from a train that supposedly ran through the state from Memphis. Malone notes that despite efforts to move forward, there is also still an undeniable pattern of racism in behavior at the University of Mississippi-whether it's the Black fraternity house that was burned to the ground in 1988 or the Confederate rally held on campus in February 2019 or the powerful old Southern families who donate to the university on the condition that the Confederate imagery remain intact and undisturbed. \"I would like for us to adopt a mindset that we no longer want this to represent who we are,\" Malone says. \"But the fact of it is, that is exactly who we are. The political, economic, and social forces that guide decisions around Ole Miss are all very much still racist.\" She clarifies that she's being more candid with me than she feels she can generally be in her life on campus. While the University of Mississippi has grappled with its Confederate history for decades, wrestling with these demons never makes for a straightforward fight. And in the broader context of the state of Mississippi, where strains of white supremacy persist from the not-so-distant past, it has been even more fraught. In 1848, the university was \"very explicitly founded as an institution where slaveholder sons can attend rather than going to those fanatical colleges and universities in the north where they might imbibe anti-slavery ideology, and come back hostile to the institution,\" says Anne Twitty, an associate history professor at the University of Mississippi. \"The overwhelming majority of the University of Mississippi's first students came from slaveholding families.\" As Twitty points out in a recent piece for the Atlantic , when the various monuments and memorials to the Confederacy began to appear on campus in the late 1800s and early 1900s, they were constructed not in grief for lives that had been lost, but rather in celebration for the power structure preserved through Jim Crow. The university did not accept its first Black student, James Meredith, until 1962, and Meredith's acceptance came only after a lengthy legal battle. Violent protests ensued ; two died and some 300 more were injured. \"Why would we expect this to be a habitable place? Why would we expect this to be a welcoming and vibrant place?\" \"It's a practical matter,\" Foster says. \"If Black folks have only been allowed to be here, either as students, as faculty, as administrators, for a fraction of the university's history, it only follows that they will be underrepresented in those spaces to which they haven't historically had access.\" He adds, \"Why would we expect this to be a habitable place? Why would we expect this to be a welcoming and vibrant place?\" In 2006, a statue of Meredith was erected on campus. In 2014, three fraternity brothers flung a noose over its neck. The university has made attempts to tackle some of the most glaring representations of this racism, but its official actions don't always translate to the broader culture on campus. For the better part of the 20th century , for instance, the school's mascot was Colonel Reb, a mustachioed caricature of a plantation owner who wears a haughty expression, leaning heavily on a cane. He is sometimes depicted against a backdrop of a Confederate flag. The university officially retired him in 2003-but the image is far from defunct. Independent groups attend sporting events with stuffed Colonel Rebs for children; men dress as the former mascot and pose with sorority girls and fraternity boys. University of Mississippi senior Chris Baxley wears the costume of school mascot Colonel Reb during the Kentucky-Mississippi basketball game in Memphis on March 8, 1997. Mark Humphrey/AP In 2009, former Chancellor Dan Jones asked the university's band, known as the Pride of the South, to stop playing \"From Dixie With Love,\" which blended the Battle Hymn of the Republic with Dixie that builds toward a chant: \"The South will rise again.\" In 2016, they were asked to stop playing any variation on the unofficial anthem of the Confederate States of America. Like the mascot, both songs have disappeared officially, but that does not stop tailgaters from blaring the anthem from booming speakers in oversize pickups anyway. Even though the school banned the Mississippi flag on campus because of the Confederate symbolism prominently displayed therein, there's still the Our State Flag Foundation, a group of people pissed that the university no longer flies it. The Facebook group, which hovers around 25,000 members, is a forum where angry white people bemoan diversity and inclusion efforts on their best days and attack specific people of color in the university community on their worst. They have a booth in the Grove on game days. The way the university has dealt with the name has been even more opaque. In 2014, a Sensitivity and Respect Committee, comprised of administrators and other faculty, and a handful of students, aimed to make the campus more diverse and inclusive, releasing a report that alludes to the moniker but avoids addressing its racist history directly. While the official recommendation is, the University of Mississippi should \"consider the implications of calling itself 'Ole Miss' in various contexts,\" most of that section of the report appears to brush the roots of the name aside: \"Regardless of its origin, the vast majority of those associated with our university has a strong affection for 'Ole Miss' and do not associate its use with race in any way. And the vast majority of those who view us from a distance associate the term 'Ole Miss' with a strong, vibrant, modern university - and the Manning family, The Blind Side , The [sic] 2008 Presidential Debate, and great sports teams.\" If the University of Mississippi is a formal name, \"Ole Miss\" conveys a powerful emotion. In June 2017, another report , this one from the Chancellor's Advisory Committee on History and Contextualization, was released. It held specific instructions for clarifying the history of the Confederate iconography on campus-everything from the names of buildings to the 12-foot-tall Tiffany stained-glass window depicting the University Greys, the students who fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War (all of whom were killed or wounded in combat). It was, in many ways, a massive victory for the Black students and faculty who had long been fighting for a more inclusive, reflective campus. \"Ole Miss,\" though, was not even mentioned in this report. \"Those efforts for change have always registered to me as symbolism, surface level, more than tangible, material, structural,\" Foster says. Part of this may be because if the University of Mississippi is a formal name, \"Ole Miss\" conveys a powerful emotion-and a lucrative brand. As Hudson put it to me, \"We have not moved on from [Ole Miss] because of capitalism...they're making money off of that.\" Forbes estimates that the annual revenue-over an average of three years-brought in from the \"Ole Miss\" football program alone is $84 million, making it one of the top 25 most lucrative college teams in the country. In 2016, the school expanded Vaught-Hemingway Stadium to hold 64,038 football fans; it is now the largest stadium in Mississippi. Still, grassroots efforts to change the name have come in small fits and starts over the years, though the overall conversation has lacked the urgency that has toppled other Confederate symbols. And when it has come up, it has typically inspired only lukewarm response. Torie Marion White, who serves as an assistant director at the Ole Miss Alumni Association, overseeing alumni relations for the School of Applied Science and the School of Engineering, as well as the Black Alumni Advisory Council and the Grove Society, tells Mother Jones that several of her fellow Black alums have taken to referring to the school as \"New Miss,\" she says, creating T-shirts and tumblers with their moniker featured in place of the old. Nevertheless, such swag is hard to come by; when I searched for anything like that online, I came up only with beauty pageant references. Just this year, Zach Borenstein, a white graduate student, wrote an op-ed in the student newspaper, the Daily Mississippian , calling for the death of \"Ole Miss.\" \"Language matters, but we often get used to saying things that normalize harm,\" he wrote in early February. \"Certain phrases diminish or denigrate groups of people, and if not addressed, these phrases become so commonplace that those using them do not even consider their origins and effects.\" (At the end of May, Borenstein was arrested for defacing the Confederate statue at the campus entrance. He slashed his hand with a knife to cast bloody handprints upon the white marble, framing the words \"spiritual genocide,\" spray-painted in black.) A week after Borenstein's op-ed published, another appeared, this one by a white then-junior named Lauren Moses. It was headlined \"Let's keep saying 'Ole Miss. ' \" : \"My friends and I recently discussed the waning respect for tradition on our campus. From changing the school mascot to governing bodies voting to move the Confederate statue to contextualizing many buildings on campus, Ole Miss has lost its identity.\" The core of her argument is that history fades, and that those symbols are not celebrated for their origins, but in spite of them. Her point isn't particularly novel; it is in fact all too familiar. It ripples through the campus and an extended community of (mostly white) fans and alumni in all sorts of forms. Alumnus Jon Rawl, co-founder of the Colonel Reb Foundation, lobbies the university to bring back the mascot from the early aughts. I asked him what he'd say to Black students and faculty who are disturbed by the Confederate imagery on campus, including the mascot. He replied simply, \"Well, the Confederate stuff was there before they were.\" Over the past few weeks in particular, I've considered what it means to love the South, as I deeply do. What once was partially buried under decades of careful erasure is now stark and exposed. I cannot look away from racism, especially where it flourishes in my home. Harm is difficult to quantify, which in turn makes it a tricky defense against the thing that harms. When people who have been actively disempowered are those being harmed, it makes those voices harder to hear, or maybe easier for those in power to ignore. As I talked to more and more people in the campus community-most of them Black-I couldn't help but feel the magnitude of all they are up against. Before Foster was a sociology professor, he came to study at the University of Mississippi as a student. He tells me it was the first time he feared for his safety based on his identity. Oxford was the first place he was ever called the n-word by a white person. It was the first place where two white boys pulled up next to him at a stoplight, rolled down the window, and asked, \"Where you boys going tonight?\" like they were entitled to know. While scrolling through the Our State Flag Foundation's Facebook page, I came across a screenshot of Foster's staff page, and my stomach churned, alongside a photo of two Black female graduates. They had drawn the ire of the group for their activism to remove the state flag from campus. There are 69 comments below. \"You really do have to have a lot of strength and a lot of energy to continuously put your Black or Brown body in these spaces and fight for those things, because it is not for the faint of heart.\" Similarly, Marion White, who runs the Black Alumni Advisory Council, says she's \"been the only minority in a room my entire life,\" and still, the day came when she was manhandled by a campus police officer because she was in the parking area for elite alumni on game day. When she told him she worked for the university, he wouldn't believe her. (Marion White says the officer remains on the force.) My conversations with students echo these experiences. Malone, the senior, tells me that while she's found a vibrant Black community at the university, she has stepped back from activism and fighting back against the university's Confederate symbols. It's become too much for her emotionally; she has to focus on her studies, which is a tall order in itself when attending classes means passing former slave quarters and hearing her university referred to in antebellum language. Love is still committed to getting her MFA, but concludes, \"You really do have to have a lot of strength and a lot of energy to continuously put your Black or Brown body in these spaces and fight for those things, because it is not for the faint of heart.\" Most of the men and women I interviewed also mentioned a photo that went viral in July 2019 of three white fraternity brothers, wearing broad smiles and posing in front of the bullet-ridden sign memorializing Emmett Till, the Black 14-year-old who was tortured and lynched in 1955 after a white woman falsely accused him of whistling at her. Two of the boys in the photo held guns. The sign itself is so often vandalized, so frequently shot at, that it's impossible to know if the bullet holes are from the guns clutched in the hands of the Kappa Alpha brothers. They were suspended from their fraternity, but ultimately allowed to remain enrolled as students. \"I just feel like if those boys were Black men who shot up a Confederate sign, there would probably be way more consequences, way more outrage, way more punishment for them,\" Love tells me. \"You understand that the underlining thing about it is this deeply entrenched white privilege and to me, being a woman of color, a Black woman, particularly...it just makes you feel powerless.\" This incident reveals a bright line for these individuals on campus, where all the changes made so far seem to stumble short of addressing a larger cultural problem. The university has put a significant amount of time and money into trying to leave the past behind, but it cannot truly overcome its legacy when it chooses to retain an identity that romanticizes a time when Black people were considered so subhuman that they could not address a white woman directly. Language provides all sorts of nook and crannies for white supremacy to hide; can it be truly overthrown without addressing what's really in a name? A name that is so intertwined with the identity of a place is tough to disentangle. Some of the students who make a conscious effort to use the full name of the university would slip up in our conversations; I have promised myself to make the same effort and sometimes my tongue still catches on it. To stay vigilant enough to thwart the connection between your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your mind requires a kind of prickly awareness that feels uncomfortable at first, but soon, it dissolves into normalcy. It is difficult to imagine the University of Mississippi as anything but \"Ole Miss.\" It is also impossible to completely divorce the school from the values held in its Confederate past without going all-in on moving forward and making the change. Moving statues, contextualizing symbols, building committees, and scheduling programming toward a more inclusive and diverse campus are all good and important. But that work feels dwarfed by the name of the place, when the words on the lips of everyone in that community are an homage to the antebellum South. Language provides all sorts of nook and crannies for white supremacy to hide; can it be truly overthrown without addressing what's really in a name? James Meredith, the first Black man to attend the University of Mississippi, wears his \"New Miss\" hat, a gift from Pastor Robert West. West said, \"The day James Meredith stepped onto the campus of The University of Mississippi, it was no longer 'Ole Miss.'\" Suzi Altman/Zuma Names, though, even the ones so tied up in a community, in its identity, can change. Look around. This reckoning over what's in a name, which has played out time and time again, and time again, is once again doing so in the names of schools and parks and military bases and even country music bands. With time, few will remember what they once were. Once, the University of Mississippi was simply that. It could be that again; it could also be reborn as something better. It may not happen today or tomorrow. But it will. It must. Of course changing the name will not magically dissipate centuries of systemic racism and inequality, but it is a simple step forward. Until then I feel somewhat heartened thinking about the fight itself-which, Love says, \"is important because it shows that we are here, it shows that we belong, and it does not validate our worth, but it does validate us being here.\" \"It shows that hey, we're here, we're staying. We acknowledge that these things, these symbols, hurt.\" Correction: An earlier version of this article applied a term for the original Confederate States flag, in use 1861-1863, to a later version formerly displayed in the state flag of Mississippi.\n\nI'm not sure I've ever heard anyone refer to it as the University of Mississippi until recently, but the discovery that words that I once regarded as neutral, even charming, contain a bitter connotation has changed that. For weeks, I couldn't stop thinking about this new context. I quizzed everyone I encountered about the once-beloved nickname; in bars, at work, on the phone with folks back home-no one knew. That racism often hides in language is not a new concept to me; I grew up as a white girl in the South. But that also means I hid from those realities behind my privilege and youth for an unforgivably long time. Even as a child, I often sensed some lingering evil when racism was dressed up as something innocuous-yet in the name \"Ole Miss,\" for nearly three decades, I heard only a folksy alternative to an unwieldy school name.\n\nA few weeks after reading the article, I wandered the campus with my cousin, struck by the depth of the school's commitment to the branding-wondering how I went so long without knowing, becoming fixated on how the name that literally looms over everyone's heads affects life for students and staff of color. The student population is 76 percent white and only 13 percent Black; similarly, the faculty is 78 percent white and only 6 percent Black. \"If you talk to students-and this is both students in general, Black, white, and otherwise, but especially with students of color-they will say that it weighs on their everyday experiences on this campus-the 'it' being the racial history of the campus,\" says Brian Foster, an assistant professor in the sociology department, who is Black.\n\nInterviews with students add further dimensions to Foster's assessment. While Love is careful to point out that as a graduate student she is not on campus as often as undergraduates are, she notes, \"Our ancestors already paid the price. We don't need to add tax by continuing to have those symbols of oppression at the University of Mississippi.\"\n\nFor her part, Yasmine Malone, a rising senior at the university, likes the nickname itself, stripped of its origins, but it bothers her that she feels like the school is less than clear about where it comes from. A classmate, Isabel Spafford, says she heard the claim on a campus tour that the name is taken from a train that supposedly ran through the state from Memphis.\n\nMalone notes that despite efforts to move forward, there is also still an undeniable pattern of racism in behavior at the University of Mississippi-whether it's the Black fraternity house that was burned to the ground in 1988 or the Confederate rally held on campus in February 2019 or the powerful old Southern families who donate to the university on the condition that the Confederate imagery remain intact and undisturbed. \"I would like for us to adopt a mindset that we no longer want this to represent who we are,\" Malone says. \"But the fact of it is, that is exactly who we are. The political, economic, and social forces that guide decisions around Ole Miss are all very much still racist.\"\n\nShe clarifies that she's being more candid with me than she feels she can generally be in her life on campus.\n\nWhile the University of Mississippi has grappled with its Confederate history for decades, wrestling with these demons never makes for a straightforward fight. And in the broader context of the state of Mississippi, where strains of white supremacy persist from the not-so-distant past, it has been even more fraught.\n\nIn 1848, the university was \"very explicitly founded as an institution where slaveholder sons can attend rather than going to those fanatical colleges and universities in the north where they might imbibe anti-slavery ideology, and come back hostile to the institution,\" says Anne Twitty, an associate history professor at the University of Mississippi. \"The overwhelming majority of the University of Mississippi's first students came from slaveholding families.\"\n\nAs Twitty points out in a recent piece for the Atlantic , when the various monuments and memorials to the Confederacy began to appear on campus in the late 1800s and early 1900s, they were constructed not in grief for lives that had been lost, but rather in celebration for the power structure preserved through Jim Crow.\n\nThe university did not accept its first Black student, James Meredith, until 1962, and Meredith's acceptance came only after a lengthy legal battle. Violent protests ensued ; two died and some 300 more were injured.\n\n\"It's a practical matter,\" Foster says. \"If Black folks have only been allowed to be here, either as students, as faculty, as administrators, for a fraction of the university's history, it only follows that they will be underrepresented in those spaces to which they haven't historically had access.\"\n\nHe adds, \"Why would we expect this to be a habitable place? Why would we expect this to be a welcoming and vibrant place?\"\n\nIn 2006, a statue of Meredith was erected on campus. In 2014, three fraternity brothers flung a noose over its neck.\n\nThe university has made attempts to tackle some of the most glaring representations of this racism, but its official actions don't always translate to the broader culture on campus. For the better part of the 20th century , for instance, the school's mascot was Colonel Reb, a mustachioed caricature of a plantation owner who wears a haughty expression, leaning heavily on a cane. He is sometimes depicted against a backdrop of a Confederate flag. The university officially retired him in 2003-but the image is far from defunct. Independent groups attend sporting events with stuffed Colonel Rebs for children; men dress as the former mascot and pose with sorority girls and fraternity boys.\n\nUniversity of Mississippi senior Chris Baxley wears the costume of school mascot Colonel Reb during the Kentucky-Mississippi basketball game in Memphis on March 8, 1997. Mark Humphrey/AP In 2009, former Chancellor Dan Jones asked the university's band, known as the Pride of the South, to stop playing \"From Dixie With Love,\" which blended the Battle Hymn of the Republic with Dixie that builds toward a chant: \"The South will rise again.\" In 2016, they were asked to stop playing any variation on the unofficial anthem of the Confederate States of America. Like the mascot, both songs have disappeared officially, but that does not stop tailgaters from blaring the anthem from booming speakers in oversize pickups anyway. Even though the school banned the Mississippi flag on campus because of the Confederate symbolism prominently displayed therein, there's still the Our State Flag Foundation, a group of people pissed that the university no longer flies it. The Facebook group, which hovers around 25,000 members, is a forum where angry white people bemoan diversity and inclusion efforts on their best days and attack specific people of color in the university community on their worst. They have a booth in the Grove on game days. The way the university has dealt with the name has been even more opaque. In 2014, a Sensitivity and Respect Committee, comprised of administrators and other faculty, and a handful of students, aimed to make the campus more diverse and inclusive, releasing a report that alludes to the moniker but avoids addressing its racist history directly. While the official recommendation is, the University of Mississippi should \"consider the implications of calling itself 'Ole Miss' in various contexts,\" most of that section of the report appears to brush the roots of the name aside: \"Regardless of its origin, the vast majority of those associated with our university has a strong affection for 'Ole Miss' and do not associate its use with race in any way. And the vast majority of those who view us from a distance associate the term 'Ole Miss' with a strong, vibrant, modern university - and the Manning family, The Blind Side , The [sic] 2008 Presidential Debate, and great sports teams.\" If the University of Mississippi is a formal name, \"Ole Miss\" conveys a powerful emotion. In June 2017, another report , this one from the Chancellor's Advisory Committee on History and Contextualization, was released. It held specific instructions for clarifying the history of the Confederate iconography on campus-everything from the names of buildings to the 12-foot-tall Tiffany stained-glass window depicting the University Greys, the students who fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War (all of whom were killed or wounded in combat). It was, in many ways, a massive victory for the Black students and faculty who had long been fighting for a more inclusive, reflective campus. \"Ole Miss,\" though, was not even mentioned in this report. \"Those efforts for change have always registered to me as symbolism, surface level, more than tangible, material, structural,\" Foster says. Part of this may be because if the University of Mississippi is a formal name, \"Ole Miss\" conveys a powerful emotion-and a lucrative brand. As Hudson put it to me, \"We have not moved on from [Ole Miss] because of capitalism...they're making money off of that.\" Forbes estimates that the annual revenue-over an average of three years-brought in from the \"Ole Miss\" football program alone is $84 million, making it one of the top 25 most lucrative college teams in the country. In 2016, the school expanded Vaught-Hemingway Stadium to hold 64,038 football fans; it is now the largest stadium in Mississippi. Still, grassroots efforts to change the name have come in small fits and starts over the years, though the overall conversation has lacked the urgency that has toppled other Confederate symbols. And when it has come up, it has typically inspired only lukewarm response. Torie Marion White, who serves as an assistant director at the Ole Miss Alumni Association, overseeing alumni relations for the School of Applied Science and the School of Engineering, as well as the Black Alumni Advisory Council and the Grove Society, tells Mother Jones that several of her fellow Black alums have taken to referring to the school as \"New Miss,\" she says, creating T-shirts and tumblers with their moniker featured in place of the old. Nevertheless, such swag is hard to come by; when I searched for anything like that online, I came up only with beauty pageant references. Just this year, Zach Borenstein, a white graduate student, wrote an op-ed in the student newspaper, the Daily Mississippian , calling for the death of \"Ole Miss.\" \"Language matters, but we often get used to saying things that normalize harm,\" he wrote in early February. \"Certain phrases diminish or denigrate groups of people, and if not addressed, these phrases become so commonplace that those using them do not even consider their origins and effects.\" (At the end of May, Borenstein was arrested for defacing the Confederate statue at the campus entrance.

It's become too much for her emotionally; she has to focus on her studies, which is a tall order in itself when attending classes means passing former slave quarters and hearing her university referred to in antebellum language.\n\nLove is still committed to getting her MFA, but concludes, \"You really do have to have a lot of strength and a lot of energy to continuously put your Black or Brown body in these spaces and fight for those things, because it is not for the faint of heart.\"\n\nMost of the men and women I interviewed also mentioned a photo that went viral in July 2019 of three white fraternity brothers, wearing broad smiles and posing in front of the bullet-ridden sign memorializing Emmett Till, the Black 14-year-old who was tortured and lynched in 1955 after a white woman falsely accused him of whistling at her. Two of the boys in the photo held guns. The sign itself is so often vandalized, so frequently shot at, that it's impossible to know if the bullet holes are from the guns clutched in the hands of the Kappa Alpha brothers. They were suspended from their fraternity, but ultimately allowed to remain enrolled as students.\n\n\"I just feel like if those boys were Black men who shot up a Confederate sign, there would probably be way more consequences, way more outrage, way more punishment for them,\" Love tells me. \"You understand that the underlining thing about it is this deeply entrenched white privilege and to me, being a woman of color, a Black woman, particularly...it just makes you feel powerless.\"\n\nThis incident reveals a bright line for these individuals on campus, where all the changes made so far seem to stumble short of addressing a larger cultural problem. The university has put a significant amount of time and money into trying to leave the past behind, but it cannot truly overcome its legacy when it chooses to retain an identity that romanticizes a time when Black people were considered so subhuman that they could not address a white woman directly.\n\nA name that is so intertwined with the identity of a place is tough to disentangle. Some of the students who make a conscious effort to use the full name of the university would slip up in our conversations; I have promised myself to make the same effort and sometimes my tongue still catches on it. To stay vigilant enough to thwart the connection between your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your mind requires a kind of prickly awareness that feels uncomfortable at first, but soon, it dissolves into normalcy.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine the University of Mississippi as anything but \"Ole Miss.\" It is also impossible to completely divorce the school from the values held in its Confederate past without going all-in on moving forward and making the change. Moving statues, contextualizing symbols, building committees, and scheduling programming toward a more inclusive and diverse campus are all good and important. But that work feels dwarfed by the name of the place, when the words on the lips of everyone in that community are an homage to the antebellum South. Language provides all sorts of nook and crannies for white supremacy to hide; can it be truly overthrown without addressing what's really in a name?\n\nJames Meredith, the first Black man to attend the University of Mississippi, wears his \"New Miss\" hat, a gift from Pastor Robert West. West said, \"The day James Meredith stepped onto the campus of The University of Mississippi, it was no longer 'Ole Miss.'\" Suzi Altman/Zuma Names, though, even the ones so tied up in a community, in its identity, can change. Look around. This reckoning over what's in a name, which has played out time and time again, and time again, is once again doing so in the names of schools and parks and military bases and even country music bands. With time, few will remember what they once were. Once, the University of Mississippi was simply that. It could be that again; it could also be reborn as something better. It may not happen today or tomorrow. But it will. It must. Of course changing the name will not magically dissipate centuries of systemic racism and inequality, but it is a simple step forward. Until then I feel somewhat heartened thinking about the fight itself-which, Love says, \"is important because it shows that we are here, it shows that we belong, and it does not validate our worth, but it does validate us being here.\" \"It shows that hey, we're here, we're staying. We acknowledge that these things, these symbols, hurt.\" Correction: An earlier version of this article applied a term for the original Confederate States flag, in use 1861-1863, to a later version formerly displayed in the state flag of Mississippi.\n\nNames, though, even the ones so tied up in a community, in its identity, can change.

      "text": "Light in Oxford\n\nA photograph of Oxford, Mississippi, catches the town on the gloomiest day in its postwar history. It shows the courthouse square, Oxford's literal and symbolic heart. A couple of young white men, facing away from the camera, are hurling glass bottles at some unseen target; around them, others mill about, gazing in the direction taken by the missiles.\n\nThis was a moment in the 1962 riot aimed at preventing James Meredith from registering at the University of Mississippi. The riot itself, one of the more traumatic incidents in the long march toward desegregation in the South, had occurred on the Ole Miss campus, almost a mile away, where two people were killed and scores wounded. Afterward, federal troops pushed the crowd into town, where its more hotheaded members harried the soldiers. In the background of the photograph, you can see Blaylock's Drug Store, with its oval \"Fortune's Famous Ice Cream\" sign seeming to hang, incongruously, over the heads of the bottle throwers.\n\nIt is startling to see the photograph these days - you might have come across it in the January/February 2000 issue of The Oxford American - because of how much is still recognizable, and how much has changed. The square looks the same: You can stand where those rioters stood, and instantly identify both the ornate commercial facade of the building in front of you, and the Fortune's sign. But the business inside is no longer Blaylock's. It is now a bookstore. And if over the last decade Oxford has become a signal destination for travelers to the Deep South, having overcome the trauma of the 1962 riots and what outsiders mistakenly took them to mean about the town, that would be in some measure due to that store, Square Books, and its owner, Richard Howorth.\n\nHoworth is perhaps best known these days as the president of the American Booksellers Association (ABA), the scrappy organization of independent bookstores that has sought to prevent chain stores and online booksellers from sweeping them into the dustbin of history. Tall, bespectacled, and, on the surface, disarmingly earnest - \"Richard looks like your algebra teacher\" is how one young novelist puts it - he is also fervid about his cause. During Howorth's tenure, which ends in June, the ABA helped deep-six the proposed merger between Barnes & Noble and Ingram, the national book distributor; pursued a lawsuit by a group of its members against Barnes & Noble and Borders Books for seeking and receiving unfair terms from publishers and distributors; and undertook an ambitious - and so far unrealized - effort to unify some 1,200 independent bookstores through a bookselling website.\n\nThe ABA has gotten a fair amount of sympathetic publicity for all of this. For those who value books and writing, the difficulties faced by the independent bookstores are troubling, and not just because they're pleasant places. As Howorth puts it, \"When the independent bookselling market was thriving in the '70s and '80s, more books were being published, more people were reading books, the sales of books were higher, and publishers' profit margins were much greater. With the rise of the corporate retailing powers and the consolidation in publishing, all of those things have declined.\" At their best, independents play a bedrock role in sustaining the village of readers and writers, bringing the one together with the other and esteeming the thoughts, tastes, and quirks of both.\n\nBut what tends to get lost in the arguments over the future of retailing is that independents don't just belong to that fanciful village; they belong to real towns and cities, too. The dangers posed to them by superstores and online sellers don't just threaten some quaint form of distributing goods, they imperil the fabric of neighborhoods and towns. For good or ill, stores - their bearing on the street, the people they draw in, the presence they cast in the community at large - help define their neighborhoods, which is why the changes buffeting traditional retailers are not solely fodder for the business pages. As Oxford's experience with Square Books suggests, the quality of our daily lives, and of the places we choose to live, is up for grabs as well.\n\nOf all the faint ripples cast by the events caught in that 1962 photograph, Square Books must be one of the least likely. Howorth, now 49, was 11 at the time, and he remembers his mother's anguish upon reading about the riots (his family was living in Memphis, though it moved to Oxford the following year). Howorth's mother had grown up in Oxford, the daughter and granddaughter of Ole Miss professors, and most of her family was still there. \"She knew,\" Howorth says, \"that it meant ruin for the town and the university.\" Oxford and its environs were hardly free of the cramped assumptions about race that marked the rest of Mississippi - this was, after all, the community that William Faulkner wrote about - but the townspeople also felt a deep faith in it, a sense that Oxford was both of and apart from the rest of the state, a place where the children of farmers could begin to escape the ancestral shackles of their culture.\n\n\"There was a shared belief that one of these days, it would be a great university and great community,\" Howorth says, \"which was my parents' view and came to be my own view.\" But the riots shook Oxford's idea of itself. \"We reached bottom, commercially and emotionally, with the Meredith riot,\" says Will Lewis, who co-owns Neilson's department store, which has anchored the square since 1839.\n\nAnd so in 1979, when Howorth and his wife, Lisa, left their apprenticeship as managers of the Savile Book Shop in Washington, D.C., and returned to Oxford to open their own store, they had more in mind than simply serving a market for good literature that - curiously, for Faulkner's hometown - had until then gone largely unserved. They also wanted the store to help Oxford cast itself in a different light, as a place of culture and literacy and broad-mindedness. It was Howorth's belief, as he says, \"that we've been wrongly viewed so many times, at so many different historic junctures, and that maybe this will help compensate.\"\n\nSquare Books was born on the second floor of a building owned by Howorth's aunt, next to Neilson's, with $10,000 that Richard and Lisa had saved, and another $10,000 borrowed from the bank next to where the bookstore now sits. It was not an instant success - in fact, Lisa had to get a job at the university library, since one of them needed to bring in some income - but their business quickly made an impact. \"It was a bookstore, so it was a cultural focal point,\" says Tom Freeland, a local lawyer. \"It was certainly the first cultural focal point that wasn't university connected.\" And even the university hadn't paid much attention to writers other than Faulkner, so when Square Books began holding readings and signings - including a jammed, electrifying event in 1980 with Willie Morris, who was teaching at Ole Miss, and William Styron, then on the hustings for Sophie's Choice - it became clear that here was a force capable of transforming Oxford's cultural life.\n\nAs it happened, the Howorths had arrived in town at about the same time as a young Yale professor, William Ferris, who had come to set up the Center for the Study of Southern Culture at Ole Miss. The three became friends and allies. The bookstore promoted the center's work and the writers and scholars it attracted. Eventually, Square Books joined forces with the center to put on the Oxford Conference for the Book, a three-day gathering of writers, poets, editors, and publishers that since the early 1990s has helped cement Oxford's reputation as a literary center of the South. For his part, Ferris, who is now chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities, helped Howorth bring in such writers as Alex Haley, Toni Morrison, Alice Walker, and Allen Ginsberg, not only adding to Square Books' growing reputation as the engine of Oxford's growing cultural allure but also attracting a steady flow of customers. \"I saw it as part of my mission to support Square Books in everything it sought to do,\" Ferris explains. \"At that time, our problem in Oxford was the increasingly insecure future of the square as an economic unit. And Square Books represented a small, modest investment in the future of the square.\"\n\nIt is hard these days, when so much of the commercial life of our communities takes place in malls well outside the center of town, to understand just how deeply a town square can be embedded in the gut of a place. On one wall of the courthouse in Oxford is a plaque bearing Faulkner's words from Requiem for a Nun, \"Above all, the courthouse, the center, the focus, the hub sitting looming in the center of the county's circumference, like a single cloud in the ring of the horizon.\" The words are attached to the building, but Faulkner might as well have been writing about the square itself.\n\nIn its heyday, as Tom Freeland puts it, \"it wasn't just that the square was the center of commerce; it was all of commerce.\" It had a dry-goods store in every quadrant, drugstores, hardware stores; even Oxford's car dealerships and auto-parts supply stores sat just off it. On Saturdays, it was where everyone in town and in the surrounding county came to get a haircut, buy their produce from the farmers who set up their trucks around the courthouse, listen to preachers - white preachers in one corner, black in the other - and simply spend the day. It was, in short, the center of Oxford life.\n\nAs chain retailers and others began arriving in town, though, the square's life began to ebb, as it did in most other Southern and Midwestern towns. Many of the merchants closed up or moved, though a few, like Will Lewis, made it clear they weren't budging. \"If we'd had to reach the point of moving,\" says Lewis, \"I'd just have gone back to practicing law. Leaving the square wasn't for me.\" There were others like him, but even so, by the late 1960s it looked like the square's best days were over.\n\nThen two things happened. One was that Oxford passed liquor-by-the-drink (Mississippi had been dry until the late 1960s), and bars, restaurants, and nightclubs began setting up around the square. The other was the arrival of Square Books.\n\nNo one in town, least of all Richard Howorth, would say the bookstore saved the square, but it certainly helped change the ambience of the town's center, especially after Howorth bought the Blaylock's building and renovated it. Square Books became a destination - a well-lighted, comfortable refuge on one of the square's main corners where townspeople could meet. They thronged to readings and signings, and could hang out at the café upstairs - even the daily conclave of Oxford old-timers that has met for three decades at Smitty's, the no-frills café just behind Square Books, will sometimes repair to the bookstore if Smitty's gets too crowded with Ole Miss football fans in town for a game - and where they felt not just welcomed, but understood. \"If I get interested in a subject,\" says Tom Freeland, \"I tend to read a lot of books on it. I've sometimes felt there were sections expanding in the store, that Richard had picked up that I was interested in something and suddenly there'd be a bunch more books on it.\"\n\nIt is hard to pick apart the precise alchemy by which a bookseller turns good business practices into a vital community presence, but it is clear that in Square Books' case, its success as a store is inseparable from its impact on Oxford. With its shelves crowded with books by Eudora Welty, Willie Morris, Walker Percy, Larry Brown, Barry Hannah, Richard Ford, John Grisham, Ellen Gilchrist, Donna Tartt, and other writers with a Mississippi connection, it's a place where Mississippians can take instant pride in the state's literary strengths. Howorth's eclectic approach toward buying books makes it a place where a wide range of readers can feel comfortable. \"If people come in and they want a book by David Duke or even something like The Southern Dog (a new book of photographs that Howorth recently ordered) and I don't have that book, or I appear to be condescending, then I don't think those people should have much respect for me,\" he says. Its readings and its weekly radio show featuring visiting authors and local musicians have made it a hometown cultural institution. And Howorth's willingness to champion writers he or his staff admire has made the store a national literary magnet, a fact that gives the townspeople pride. \"Square Books really is an anchor in the soul of Oxford,\" says William Ferris. \"If anything can be seen as the legacy of Faulkner and the wonderful literary traditions of the community, it's the store.\"\n\nAnd so, with Square Books as a model and an anchor, others have followed: furniture sellers, restaurateurs, clothiers, a record store, art galleries. The square is not the egalitarian gathering place it was in Faulkner's day - on the whole, its stores are too upscale for that now - but it is still the center of town, and it is still vibrant, night and day. \"There's always life here,\" says architect Tom Howorth, Richard's younger brother. \"Physically, the square has a wonderful scale, a sense of enclosure with abundant activity at the same time. One day I was looking out the window and saw John Berendt (the author of Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil ) on one bench, and looked across and there goes Barry Hannah into the bookstore. So part of it is physical, part is that there are smart, interesting people that you might bump into on the street, and part of it is that there's still this old-fashioned, county-courthouse culture going on.\"\n\nThanks in part to the ambience Square Books helped bring into being, the center of Oxford is a wonderful place, vital and at the same time somehow unhurried. And over the past decade, the rest of the world has taken notice. These days, a simple search can find a raft of travel articles about Oxford, all of which comment on its easy charm and cultural riches. Most of them prominently mention Square Books. The town is perennially on lists of desirable places to retire, with a reputation as \"a surprisingly urbane and energetic place,\" as the Chicago Tribune put it a few years back. \"We wound up on everyone's hot button,\" says Max Hipp, the town chamber of commerce's executive director.\n\nAnd so Oxford has been growing, booming, in fact, at least by Southern small-town standards. Out on the edge of town new retail establishments are popping up at a dizzying pace. Real estate prices are climbing, nowhere more rapidly than around the square; most of Howorth's employees can no longer afford to live within walking distance of the store. Developers are scurrying to snap up available parcels, including sites just off the square that are slated for condo projects; one will replace the last independently owned grocery in town. It is possible to get quite gloomy about all of this. A while back, the town council created a historic preservation committee to look into what ought to be done about the courthouse square. When word got out that the committee was planning to recommend the creation of a historic preservation district around the square, thus shutting off development, Oxford's property owners and developers besieged town hall. As a result, the council rescinded its preservation statute and disbanded the committee. People who like Oxford as it is fear the recent developments. \"If growth is unrestricted and uncontrolled,\" says Ferris, \"it essentially destroys the very heart of the place that made people want to move there.\"\n\nThis is pretty much where Howorth finds himself. \"The town was built on a scale,\" he says, \"and for the first 150 years of its life, it existed at that scale. The store itself fit well within that scale. But that's what's falling from our grasp. There was a time when I was sort of in control of my destiny, and I had a hand in the destiny of the community. Now I'm just not sure. The community's becoming something different.\" Still, it's worth remembering that the community has been in the process of becoming something different for decades - indeed, as Tom Freeland points out, \"You can find Faulkner writing letters to the editor of the Oxford Eagle about the decline of the square in the 1940s.\"\n\nCommunities are constantly reinventing themselves; sometimes they do it with grace and imagination, as Oxford has demonstrated with its courthouse square. So just as Square Books is, in a fashion, part of Oxford's problem - having helped create the atmosphere that makes the town so attractive - it may also be part of the answer. Even now, Howorth has his eye on a piece of nearby property, into which he might move his main store, while keeping his current location to specialize in books about the South. Typically, he has mixed feelings about expanding: \"In fear of the next wave of development,\" he recently wrote to another bookseller, \"I become what I fear.\" But vital neighborhoods need vital stores to anchor them, and even a larger Square Books will still stand for the importance of ideas and reading and writing and lively discourse to a community's quality of life. Even as Oxford becomes a busier, more crowded place, that's an encouraging set of values to have sitting at its heart.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Racism of \"Ole Miss\" Is Hiding in Plain Sight\n\nBecca Andrews July 1, 2020\n\nMother Jones illustration; Bettmann/Getty\n\nMother Jones illustration; Bettmann/Getty\n\nAt the entrance of the University of Mississippi campus in Oxford, the statue of a white marble man sits among the magnolia and oak trees. The gift from the Daughters of the Confederacy, a soldier, his arm in salute, a rifle at his side, has presided over passersby entering the university since 1906. He is perched atop a matching white marble spire so that the tip of his hat reaches toward the treetops. A plaque at the base of the monument, revised in 2016 as part of a historical contextualization project , allows that the statue was one in a series of memorials that \"were often used to promote an ideology known as the ' Lost Cause ,' which claimed that the Confederacy had been established to defend states' rights and that slavery was not the principal cause of the Civil War.\"\n\nStill, it stands.\n\nBut now, after more than a century, the anonymous soldier will finally be ousted from his premier spot -a move that's the direct result of a sustained campaign led by University of Mississippi students . \"We still have a long way to go, but it's still a victory, and I think we are allowed to celebrate it,\" Arielle Hudson, a recent graduate and the university's first Black female Rhodes scholar, tells me.\n\nBut it wasn't easy to get here. More than a year ago, the Associated Student Body Senate for inclusion and cross-cultural engagement unanimously passed a resolution that stated, \"Confederate ideology directly violates the tenets of the university creed that supports fairness, civility, and respect for the dignity of each person.\" While plans were made with the university to move the statue, the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning stepped in, declaring that the marble soldier falls under its purview and putting the plans on indefinite pause.\n\nBut in this moment of broader racial reckoning spurred by the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd, the already thinning tolerance for hand-wringing over such symbols has largely evaporated. In mid-June, the IHL agreed to move the statue to a less-prestigious placement, keeping watch over the dead in a Confederate cemetery in an area with less foot traffic, behind an old coliseum that's no longer in regular use.\n\nUndoubtedly the ultra-conservative IHL relaxing its grip is an important step. Persuading the university five years ago to discontinue the use of the Mississippi state flag-which, until Gov. Tate Reeves signed a law to retire it this week, was the last state flag to feature the Confederate battle flag design-was a similarly important one. And so was the university's pledge , just last month, to review its \"admissions and judicial review policies and protocols\" to deal with prospective students whose social media pages include racist posts.\n\nEven so, each step away from the school's \"Old South\" image ultimately seems marked by ambivalence. Soon after the announcement that the entrance's Confederate statue would be moved, plans surfaced to renovate the cemetery to create a sort of \"shrine\" effect (though the university says the design is not final). And while it is unclear what exactly will change for its admissions and judicial review policies, the university's stance has long been that it is unwilling to court costly First Amendment lawsuits, even as schools like the University of Alabama have expelled students over racist social media posts.\n\nAnd, crucially, no matter what happens with these measures, there remains an implicit tribute to white supremacy on campus that has proven tougher to exorcise, one many people don't even realize is there. The \"Ole Miss\" moniker has long informed the core of the institution's identity and the surrounding community, not to mention its powerful brand. But this is not merely a convenient abbreviation of the long official name. It's a phrase that's long haunted Black students, faculty, and staff as a lingering nod to the days when it seemed unthinkable that a place like the university would ever accept them only because of their skin.\n\nWhile statues all over the country come down, and the United States reckons with its racist past, it is time to confront the more insidious forms of white supremacy-especially those so easy to take for granted that it becomes harder and harder to recognize them for what they really are. They are not monuments or flags, but they are hidden in our language and our customs, their origins masked by time and intent.\n\nWhen Zaire Love was accepted into the University of Mississippi's documentary program to pursue her MFA, she was thrilled. In July 2018, she posted a photo to share the news that she would attend her dream school on full scholarship, no less; she looks uncertain but triumphant. Under a camo jacket draped perfectly off her shoulders, her white T-shirt is one she made herself: navy blue scripted letters sing \"Ole Miss Mane.\"\n\n\"I thought I was putting my Blackness and my Black flavor on it,\" she says. She didn't know just what it meant at the time, but she remembers her bitter disappointment the day she found out.\n\nThat summer, Love left her home in Memphis to mentor teenagers on campus through the William Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation. She was eager to get involved in a new community, and the program seemed like the perfect way to jumpstart a new chapter in her life. While she was there, the origin story of the name \"Ole Miss\" came up.\n\nLove learned that a student, Elma Meek, proposed the name in 1896 for a new yearbook that was being created by an interfraternity group. Her inspiration reportedly came \"from the language of the Ante-bellum 'Darkey,ʼ who knew the wife of his owner by no other title than 'Ole Miss,ʼ\" according to the student newspaper, then called The Mississippian. In an interview with that paper in the 1930s, Meek said she felt the name \"connoted all the admiration and reverence accorded the womanhood of the Old South.\" This intervention afforded Meek herself a vaunted spot in Oxford mythology; long after she had stopped attending classes at the university, Meek lived in a house near the campus that was built by a Confederate general. (For a while, William Faulkner and his wife lived with her there; it's actually where he wrote much of As I Lay Dying and \"A Rose for Emily.\") Today, the house is fiercely protected from any attempts at change, down to its air ducts, by the local Historic Preservation Commission. But more than Meek's sentimental history, the name she proposed has stuck, so wildly outliving its origins that many, many people who pass through the Oxford campus or tailgate in the Grove or simply follow the sports teams with mild interest are unaware of the horrors hidden therein.\n\n(The university did not respond to multiple interview requests from Mother Jones , but sent a statement from Chancellor Glenn Boyce: \"Ole Miss is a term of affinity for many of our people that is intrinsic to the university's identity and carries strong, positive national and international recognition. We understand the complex history of its origins...at the same time, it is a term whose meaning has changed over time, and we are committed to living by what it means today to our students and alumni who embrace it as an expression of caring and community.\" The email also included a chapter from a book titled, The Other Mississippi: A State in Conflict with Itself ; written by David Sansing, the University of Mississippi's late historian, the selection emphasizes that the term \"Ole Miss\" was one of \"respect and endearment\" used by slaves, and twice says that Meek's intention was not to \"reminisce or regale\" slavery, rather she only meant to \"link her alma mater to those grand women of the antebellum South.\")\n\nUpon learning this history, Love was determined not to use the casual nickname again. \"I'm going to stand up and say this is not what I want to use,\" she says. But, she admits, it's not exactly easy to just remove yourself from something so wrapped up in campus culture-\"It's also the lay of the land. It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't-type situation.\"\n\nThere are so many people-not all of them white-who do not know the university as anything other than \"Ole Miss.\" It's everywhere around you in Oxford; on billboards that advertise the university as you drive into town, on signs and on campus, on T-shirts, ball caps, stickers, school supplies, tacked onto the end of every student's and faculty member's email address. There is no University of Mississippi; there is only \"Ole Miss.\"\n\nFor most of my life, I was among the oblivious. The historical context of \"Ole Miss\" was news to me when late last year a former high school classmate of mine posted a 2019 Chronicle of Higher Ed article on Facebook detailing origins of the university's hoary nickname. I am a Southern white woman who has always spoken those words, \"Ole Miss,\" in the context of a dearly held rivalry between the university in Oxford and Mississippi State University, where most of my family has attended school for generations. It once vaguely connoted home to me, recalling Thanksgivings at my grandmother's house in Tupelo, the television in the living room blaring the Egg Bowl, the annual football faceoff between the schools, as we cleaned up the kitchen and carefully put away the leftovers.\n\nCheerleaders carry \"Ole Miss\" flags during a game against the Memphis Tigers at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium on October 1, 2016, in Oxford, Mississippi. Jonathan Bachman/Getty I'm not sure I've ever heard anyone refer to it as the University of Mississippi until recently, but the discovery that words that I once regarded as neutral, even charming, contain a bitter connotation has changed that. For weeks, I couldn't stop thinking about this new context. I quizzed everyone I encountered about the once-beloved nickname; in bars, at work, on the phone with folks back home-no one knew. That racism often hides in language is not a new concept to me; I grew up as a white girl in the South. But that also means I hid from those realities behind my privilege and youth for an unforgivably long time. Even as a child, I often sensed some lingering evil when racism was dressed up as something innocuous-yet in the name \"Ole Miss,\" for nearly three decades, I heard only a folksy alternative to an unwieldy school name. \"If you talk to students, they will say that it weighs on their everyday experiences on this campus.\" A few weeks after reading the article, I wandered the campus with my cousin, struck by the depth of the school's commitment to the branding-wondering how I went so long without knowing, becoming fixated on how the name that literally looms over everyone's heads affects life for students and staff of color. The student population is 76 percent white and only 13 percent Black; similarly, the faculty is 78 percent white and only 6 percent Black. \"If you talk to students-and this is both students in general, Black, white, and otherwise, but especially with students of color-they will say that it weighs on their everyday experiences on this campus-the 'it' being the racial history of the campus,\" says Brian Foster, an assistant professor in the sociology department, who is Black. Interviews with students add further dimensions to Foster's assessment. While Love is careful to point out that as a graduate student she is not on campus as often as undergraduates are, she notes, \"Our ancestors already paid the price. We don't need to add tax by continuing to have those symbols of oppression at the University of Mississippi.\" For her part, Yasmine Malone, a rising senior at the university, likes the nickname itself, stripped of its origins, but it bothers her that she feels like the school is less than clear about where it comes from. A classmate, Isabel Spafford, says she heard the claim on a campus tour that the name is taken from a train that supposedly ran through the state from Memphis. Malone notes that despite efforts to move forward, there is also still an undeniable pattern of racism in behavior at the University of Mississippi-whether it's the Black fraternity house that was burned to the ground in 1988 or the Confederate rally held on campus in February 2019 or the powerful old Southern families who donate to the university on the condition that the Confederate imagery remain intact and undisturbed. \"I would like for us to adopt a mindset that we no longer want this to represent who we are,\" Malone says. \"But the fact of it is, that is exactly who we are. The political, economic, and social forces that guide decisions around Ole Miss are all very much still racist.\" She clarifies that she's being more candid with me than she feels she can generally be in her life on campus. While the University of Mississippi has grappled with its Confederate history for decades, wrestling with these demons never makes for a straightforward fight. And in the broader context of the state of Mississippi, where strains of white supremacy persist from the not-so-distant past, it has been even more fraught. In 1848, the university was \"very explicitly founded as an institution where slaveholder sons can attend rather than going to those fanatical colleges and universities in the north where they might imbibe anti-slavery ideology, and come back hostile to the institution,\" says Anne Twitty, an associate history professor at the University of Mississippi. \"The overwhelming majority of the University of Mississippi's first students came from slaveholding families.\" As Twitty points out in a recent piece for the Atlantic , when the various monuments and memorials to the Confederacy began to appear on campus in the late 1800s and early 1900s, they were constructed not in grief for lives that had been lost, but rather in celebration for the power structure preserved through Jim Crow. The university did not accept its first Black student, James Meredith, until 1962, and Meredith's acceptance came only after a lengthy legal battle. Violent protests ensued ; two died and some 300 more were injured. \"Why would we expect this to be a habitable place? Why would we expect this to be a welcoming and vibrant place?\" \"It's a practical matter,\" Foster says. \"If Black folks have only been allowed to be here, either as students, as faculty, as administrators, for a fraction of the university's history, it only follows that they will be underrepresented in those spaces to which they haven't historically had access.\" He adds, \"Why would we expect this to be a habitable place? Why would we expect this to be a welcoming and vibrant place?\" In 2006, a statue of Meredith was erected on campus. In 2014, three fraternity brothers flung a noose over its neck. The university has made attempts to tackle some of the most glaring representations of this racism, but its official actions don't always translate to the broader culture on campus. For the better part of the 20th century , for instance, the school's mascot was Colonel Reb, a mustachioed caricature of a plantation owner who wears a haughty expression, leaning heavily on a cane. He is sometimes depicted against a backdrop of a Confederate flag. The university officially retired him in 2003-but the image is far from defunct. Independent groups attend sporting events with stuffed Colonel Rebs for children; men dress as the former mascot and pose with sorority girls and fraternity boys. University of Mississippi senior Chris Baxley wears the costume of school mascot Colonel Reb during the Kentucky-Mississippi basketball game in Memphis on March 8, 1997. Mark Humphrey/AP In 2009, former Chancellor Dan Jones asked the university's band, known as the Pride of the South, to stop playing \"From Dixie With Love,\" which blended the Battle Hymn of the Republic with Dixie that builds toward a chant: \"The South will rise again.\" In 2016, they were asked to stop playing any variation on the unofficial anthem of the Confederate States of America. Like the mascot, both songs have disappeared officially, but that does not stop tailgaters from blaring the anthem from booming speakers in oversize pickups anyway. Even though the school banned the Mississippi flag on campus because of the Confederate symbolism prominently displayed therein, there's still the Our State Flag Foundation, a group of people pissed that the university no longer flies it. The Facebook group, which hovers around 25,000 members, is a forum where angry white people bemoan diversity and inclusion efforts on their best days and attack specific people of color in the university community on their worst. They have a booth in the Grove on game days. The way the university has dealt with the name has been even more opaque. In 2014, a Sensitivity and Respect Committee, comprised of administrators and other faculty, and a handful of students, aimed to make the campus more diverse and inclusive, releasing a report that alludes to the moniker but avoids addressing its racist history directly. While the official recommendation is, the University of Mississippi should \"consider the implications of calling itself 'Ole Miss' in various contexts,\" most of that section of the report appears to brush the roots of the name aside: \"Regardless of its origin, the vast majority of those associated with our university has a strong affection for 'Ole Miss' and do not associate its use with race in any way. And the vast majority of those who view us from a distance associate the term 'Ole Miss' with a strong, vibrant, modern university - and the Manning family, The Blind Side , The [sic] 2008 Presidential Debate, and great sports teams.\" If the University of Mississippi is a formal name, \"Ole Miss\" conveys a powerful emotion. In June 2017, another report , this one from the Chancellor's Advisory Committee on History and Contextualization, was released. It held specific instructions for clarifying the history of the Confederate iconography on campus-everything from the names of buildings to the 12-foot-tall Tiffany stained-glass window depicting the University Greys, the students who fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War (all of whom were killed or wounded in combat). It was, in many ways, a massive victory for the Black students and faculty who had long been fighting for a more inclusive, reflective campus. \"Ole Miss,\" though, was not even mentioned in this report. \"Those efforts for change have always registered to me as symbolism, surface level, more than tangible, material, structural,\" Foster says. Part of this may be because if the University of Mississippi is a formal name, \"Ole Miss\" conveys a powerful emotion-and a lucrative brand. As Hudson put it to me, \"We have not moved on from [Ole Miss] because of capitalism...they're making money off of that.\" Forbes estimates that the annual revenue-over an average of three years-brought in from the \"Ole Miss\" football program alone is $84 million, making it one of the top 25 most lucrative college teams in the country. In 2016, the school expanded Vaught-Hemingway Stadium to hold 64,038 football fans; it is now the largest stadium in Mississippi. Still, grassroots efforts to change the name have come in small fits and starts over the years, though the overall conversation has lacked the urgency that has toppled other Confederate symbols. And when it has come up, it has typically inspired only lukewarm response. Torie Marion White, who serves as an assistant director at the Ole Miss Alumni Association, overseeing alumni relations for the School of Applied Science and the School of Engineering, as well as the Black Alumni Advisory Council and the Grove Society, tells Mother Jones that several of her fellow Black alums have taken to referring to the school as \"New Miss,\" she says, creating T-shirts and tumblers with their moniker featured in place of the old. Nevertheless, such swag is hard to come by; when I searched for anything like that online, I came up only with beauty pageant references. Just this year, Zach Borenstein, a white graduate student, wrote an op-ed in the student newspaper, the Daily Mississippian , calling for the death of \"Ole Miss.\" \"Language matters, but we often get used to saying things that normalize harm,\" he wrote in early February. \"Certain phrases diminish or denigrate groups of people, and if not addressed, these phrases become so commonplace that those using them do not even consider their origins and effects.\" (At the end of May, Borenstein was arrested for defacing the Confederate statue at the campus entrance. He slashed his hand with a knife to cast bloody handprints upon the white marble, framing the words \"spiritual genocide,\" spray-painted in black.) A week after Borenstein's op-ed published, another appeared, this one by a white then-junior named Lauren Moses. It was headlined \"Let's keep saying 'Ole Miss. ' \" : \"My friends and I recently discussed the waning respect for tradition on our campus. From changing the school mascot to governing bodies voting to move the Confederate statue to contextualizing many buildings on campus, Ole Miss has lost its identity.\" The core of her argument is that history fades, and that those symbols are not celebrated for their origins, but in spite of them. Her point isn't particularly novel; it is in fact all too familiar. It ripples through the campus and an extended community of (mostly white) fans and alumni in all sorts of forms. Alumnus Jon Rawl, co-founder of the Colonel Reb Foundation, lobbies the university to bring back the mascot from the early aughts. I asked him what he'd say to Black students and faculty who are disturbed by the Confederate imagery on campus, including the mascot. He replied simply, \"Well, the Confederate stuff was there before they were.\" Over the past few weeks in particular, I've considered what it means to love the South, as I deeply do. What once was partially buried under decades of careful erasure is now stark and exposed. I cannot look away from racism, especially where it flourishes in my home. Harm is difficult to quantify, which in turn makes it a tricky defense against the thing that harms. When people who have been actively disempowered are those being harmed, it makes those voices harder to hear, or maybe easier for those in power to ignore. As I talked to more and more people in the campus community-most of them Black-I couldn't help but feel the magnitude of all they are up against. Before Foster was a sociology professor, he came to study at the University of Mississippi as a student. He tells me it was the first time he feared for his safety based on his identity. Oxford was the first place he was ever called the n-word by a white person. It was the first place where two white boys pulled up next to him at a stoplight, rolled down the window, and asked, \"Where you boys going tonight?\" like they were entitled to know. While scrolling through the Our State Flag Foundation's Facebook page, I came across a screenshot of Foster's staff page, and my stomach churned, alongside a photo of two Black female graduates. They had drawn the ire of the group for their activism to remove the state flag from campus. There are 69 comments below. \"You really do have to have a lot of strength and a lot of energy to continuously put your Black or Brown body in these spaces and fight for those things, because it is not for the faint of heart.\" Similarly, Marion White, who runs the Black Alumni Advisory Council, says she's \"been the only minority in a room my entire life,\" and still, the day came when she was manhandled by a campus police officer because she was in the parking area for elite alumni on game day. When she told him she worked for the university, he wouldn't believe her. (Marion White says the officer remains on the force.) My conversations with students echo these experiences. Malone, the senior, tells me that while she's found a vibrant Black community at the university, she has stepped back from activism and fighting back against the university's Confederate symbols. It's become too much for her emotionally; she has to focus on her studies, which is a tall order in itself when attending classes means passing former slave quarters and hearing her university referred to in antebellum language. Love is still committed to getting her MFA, but concludes, \"You really do have to have a lot of strength and a lot of energy to continuously put your Black or Brown body in these spaces and fight for those things, because it is not for the faint of heart.\" Most of the men and women I interviewed also mentioned a photo that went viral in July 2019 of three white fraternity brothers, wearing broad smiles and posing in front of the bullet-ridden sign memorializing Emmett Till, the Black 14-year-old who was tortured and lynched in 1955 after a white woman falsely accused him of whistling at her. Two of the boys in the photo held guns. The sign itself is so often vandalized, so frequently shot at, that it's impossible to know if the bullet holes are from the guns clutched in the hands of the Kappa Alpha brothers. They were suspended from their fraternity, but ultimately allowed to remain enrolled as students. \"I just feel like if those boys were Black men who shot up a Confederate sign, there would probably be way more consequences, way more outrage, way more punishment for them,\" Love tells me. \"You understand that the underlining thing about it is this deeply entrenched white privilege and to me, being a woman of color, a Black woman, particularly...it just makes you feel powerless.\" This incident reveals a bright line for these individuals on campus, where all the changes made so far seem to stumble short of addressing a larger cultural problem. The university has put a significant amount of time and money into trying to leave the past behind, but it cannot truly overcome its legacy when it chooses to retain an identity that romanticizes a time when Black people were considered so subhuman that they could not address a white woman directly. Language provides all sorts of nook and crannies for white supremacy to hide; can it be truly overthrown without addressing what's really in a name? A name that is so intertwined with the identity of a place is tough to disentangle. Some of the students who make a conscious effort to use the full name of the university would slip up in our conversations; I have promised myself to make the same effort and sometimes my tongue still catches on it. To stay vigilant enough to thwart the connection between your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your mind requires a kind of prickly awareness that feels uncomfortable at first, but soon, it dissolves into normalcy. It is difficult to imagine the University of Mississippi as anything but \"Ole Miss.\" It is also impossible to completely divorce the school from the values held in its Confederate past without going all-in on moving forward and making the change. Moving statues, contextualizing symbols, building committees, and scheduling programming toward a more inclusive and diverse campus are all good and important. But that work feels dwarfed by the name of the place, when the words on the lips of everyone in that community are an homage to the antebellum South. Language provides all sorts of nook and crannies for white supremacy to hide; can it be truly overthrown without addressing what's really in a name? James Meredith, the first Black man to attend the University of Mississippi, wears his \"New Miss\" hat, a gift from Pastor Robert West. West said, \"The day James Meredith stepped onto the campus of The University of Mississippi, it was no longer 'Ole Miss.'\" Suzi Altman/Zuma Names, though, even the ones so tied up in a community, in its identity, can change. Look around. This reckoning over what's in a name, which has played out time and time again, and time again, is once again doing so in the names of schools and parks and military bases and even country music bands. With time, few will remember what they once were. Once, the University of Mississippi was simply that. It could be that again; it could also be reborn as something better. It may not happen today or tomorrow. But it will. It must. Of course changing the name will not magically dissipate centuries of systemic racism and inequality, but it is a simple step forward. Until then I feel somewhat heartened thinking about the fight itself-which, Love says, \"is important because it shows that we are here, it shows that we belong, and it does not validate our worth, but it does validate us being here.\" \"It shows that hey, we're here, we're staying. We acknowledge that these things, these symbols, hurt.\" Correction: An earlier version of this article applied a term for the original Confederate States flag, in use 1861-1863, to a later version formerly displayed in the state flag of Mississippi.\n\nI'm not sure I've ever heard anyone refer to it as the University of Mississippi until recently, but the discovery that words that I once regarded as neutral, even charming, contain a bitter connotation has changed that.

Just this year, Zach Borenstein, a white graduate student, wrote an op-ed in the student newspaper, the Daily Mississippian , calling for the death of \"Ole Miss.\" \"Language matters, but we often get used to saying things that normalize harm,\" he wrote in early February. \"Certain phrases diminish or denigrate groups of people, and if not addressed, these phrases become so commonplace that those using them do not even consider their origins and effects.\" (At the end of May, Borenstein was arrested for defacing the Confederate statue at the campus entrance. He slashed his hand with a knife to cast bloody handprints upon the white marble, framing the words \"spiritual genocide,\" spray-painted in black.) A week after Borenstein's op-ed published, another appeared, this one by a white then-junior named Lauren Moses. It was headlined \"Let's keep saying 'Ole Miss. ' \" : \"My friends and I recently discussed the waning respect for tradition on our campus. From changing the school mascot to governing bodies voting to move the Confederate statue to contextualizing many buildings on campus, Ole Miss has lost its identity.\" The core of her argument is that history fades, and that those symbols are not celebrated for their origins, but in spite of them. Her point isn't particularly novel; it is in fact all too familiar. It ripples through the campus and an extended community of (mostly white) fans and alumni in all sorts of forms. Alumnus Jon Rawl, co-founder of the Colonel Reb Foundation, lobbies the university to bring back the mascot from the early aughts. I asked him what he'd say to Black students and faculty who are disturbed by the Confederate imagery on campus, including the mascot. He replied simply, \"Well, the Confederate stuff was there before they were.\" Over the past few weeks in particular, I've considered what it means to love the South, as I deeply do. What once was partially buried under decades of careful erasure is now stark and exposed. I cannot look away from racism, especially where it flourishes in my home. Harm is difficult to quantify, which in turn makes it a tricky defense against the thing that harms. When people who have been actively disempowered are those being harmed, it makes those voices harder to hear, or maybe easier for those in power to ignore. As I talked to more and more people in the campus community-most of them Black-I couldn't help but feel the magnitude of all they are up against. Before Foster was a sociology professor, he came to study at the University of Mississippi as a student. He tells me it was the first time he feared for his safety based on his identity. Oxford was the first place he was ever called the n-word by a white person. It was the first place where two white boys pulled up next to him at a stoplight, rolled down the window, and asked, \"Where you boys going tonight?\" like they were entitled to know. While scrolling through the Our State Flag Foundation's Facebook page, I came across a screenshot of Foster's staff page, and my stomach churned, alongside a photo of two Black female graduates. They had drawn the ire of the group for their activism to remove the state flag from campus. There are 69 comments below. \"You really do have to have a lot of strength and a lot of energy to continuously put your Black or Brown body in these spaces and fight for those things, because it is not for the faint of heart.\" Similarly, Marion White, who runs the Black Alumni Advisory Council, says she's \"been the only minority in a room my entire life,\" and still, the day came when she was manhandled by a campus police officer because she was in the parking area for elite alumni on game day. When she told him she worked for the university, he wouldn't believe her. (Marion White says the officer remains on the force.) My conversations with students echo these experiences. Malone, the senior, tells me that while she's found a vibrant Black community at the university, she has stepped back from activism and fighting back against the university's Confederate symbols. It's become too much for her emotionally; she has to focus on her studies, which is a tall order in itself when attending classes means passing former slave quarters and hearing her university referred to in antebellum language. Love is still committed to getting her MFA, but concludes, \"You really do have to have a lot of strength and a lot of energy to continuously put your Black or Brown body in these spaces and fight for those things, because it is not for the faint of heart.\" Most of the men and women I interviewed also mentioned a photo that went viral in July 2019 of three white fraternity brothers, wearing broad smiles and posing in front of the bullet-ridden sign memorializing Emmett Till, the Black 14-year-old who was tortured and lynched in 1955 after a white woman falsely accused him of whistling at her. Two of the boys in the photo held guns. The sign itself is so often vandalized, so frequently shot at, that it's impossible to know if the bullet holes are from the guns clutched in the hands of the Kappa Alpha brothers. They were suspended from their fraternity, but ultimately allowed to remain enrolled as students. \"I just feel like if those boys were Black men who shot up a Confederate sign, there would probably be way more consequences, way more outrage, way more punishment for them,\" Love tells me. \"You understand that the underlining thing about it is this deeply entrenched white privilege and to me, being a woman of color, a Black woman, particularly...it just makes you feel powerless.\" This incident reveals a bright line for these individuals on campus, where all the changes made so far seem to stumble short of addressing a larger cultural problem. The university has put a significant amount of time and money into trying to leave the past behind, but it cannot truly overcome its legacy when it chooses to retain an identity that romanticizes a time when Black people were considered so subhuman that they could not address a white woman directly. Language provides all sorts of nook and crannies for white supremacy to hide; can it be truly overthrown without addressing what's really in a name? A name that is so intertwined with the identity of a place is tough to disentangle. Some of the students who make a conscious effort to use the full name of the university would slip up in our conversations; I have promised myself to make the same effort and sometimes my tongue still catches on it. To stay vigilant enough to thwart the connection between your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your mind requires a kind of prickly awareness that feels uncomfortable at first, but soon, it dissolves into normalcy. It is difficult to imagine the University of Mississippi as anything but \"Ole Miss.\" It is also impossible to completely divorce the school from the values held in its Confederate past without going all-in on moving forward and making the change. Moving statues, contextualizing symbols, building committees, and scheduling programming toward a more inclusive and diverse campus are all good and important. But that work feels dwarfed by the name of the place, when the words on the lips of everyone in that community are an homage to the antebellum South. Language provides all sorts of nook and crannies for white supremacy to hide; can it be truly overthrown without addressing what's really in a name? James Meredith, the first Black man to attend the University of Mississippi, wears his \"New Miss\" hat, a gift from Pastor Robert West. West said, \"The day James Meredith stepped onto the campus of The University of Mississippi, it was no longer 'Ole Miss.'\" Suzi Altman/Zuma Names, though, even the ones so tied up in a community, in its identity, can change. Look around. This reckoning over what's in a name, which has played out time and time again, and time again, is once again doing so in the names of schools and parks and military bases and even country music bands. With time, few will remember what they once were. Once, the University of Mississippi was simply that. It could be that again; it could also be reborn as something better. It may not happen today or tomorrow. But it will. It must. Of course changing the name will not magically dissipate centuries of systemic racism and inequality, but it is a simple step forward. Until then I feel somewhat heartened thinking about the fight itself-which, Love says, \"is important because it shows that we are here, it shows that we belong, and it does not validate our worth, but it does validate us being here.\" \"It shows that hey, we're here, we're staying. We acknowledge that these things, these symbols, hurt.\" Correction: An earlier version of this article applied a term for the original Confederate States flag, in use 1861-1863, to a later version formerly displayed in the state flag of Mississippi.\n\nIn 2009, former Chancellor Dan Jones asked the university's band, known as the Pride of the South, to stop playing \"From Dixie With Love,\" which blended the Battle Hymn of the Republic with Dixie that builds toward a chant: \"The South will rise again.\" In 2016, they were asked to stop playing any variation on the unofficial anthem of the Confederate States of America. Like the mascot, both songs have disappeared officially, but that does not stop tailgaters from blaring the anthem from booming speakers in oversize pickups anyway.\n\nEven though the school banned the Mississippi flag on campus because of the Confederate symbolism prominently displayed therein, there's still the Our State Flag Foundation, a group of people pissed that the university no longer flies it. The Facebook group, which hovers around 25,000 members, is a forum where angry white people bemoan diversity and inclusion efforts on their best days and attack specific people of color in the university community on their worst. They have a booth in the Grove on game days.\n\nThe way the university has dealt with the name has been even more opaque. In 2014, a Sensitivity and Respect Committee, comprised of administrators and other faculty, and a handful of students, aimed to make the campus more diverse and inclusive, releasing a report that alludes to the moniker but avoids addressing its racist history directly. While the official recommendation is, the University of Mississippi should \"consider the implications of calling itself 'Ole Miss' in various contexts,\" most of that section of the report appears to brush the roots of the name aside: \"Regardless of its origin, the vast majority of those associated with our university has a strong affection for 'Ole Miss' and do not associate its use with race in any way. And the vast majority of those who view us from a distance associate the term 'Ole Miss' with a strong, vibrant, modern university - and the Manning family, The Blind Side , The [sic] 2008 Presidential Debate, and great sports teams.\"\n\nIn June 2017, another report , this one from the Chancellor's Advisory Committee on History and Contextualization, was released. It held specific instructions for clarifying the history of the Confederate iconography on campus-everything from the names of buildings to the 12-foot-tall Tiffany stained-glass window depicting the University Greys, the students who fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War (all of whom were killed or wounded in combat). It was, in many ways, a massive victory for the Black students and faculty who had long been fighting for a more inclusive, reflective campus. \"Ole Miss,\" though, was not even mentioned in this report.\n\n\"Those efforts for change have always registered to me as symbolism, surface level, more than tangible, material, structural,\" Foster says.\n\nPart of this may be because if the University of Mississippi is a formal name, \"Ole Miss\" conveys a powerful emotion-and a lucrative brand. As Hudson put it to me, \"We have not moved on from [Ole Miss] because of capitalism...they're making money off of that.\" Forbes estimates that the annual revenue-over an average of three years-brought in from the \"Ole Miss\" football program alone is $84 million, making it one of the top 25 most lucrative college teams in the country. In 2016, the school expanded Vaught-Hemingway Stadium to hold 64,038 football fans; it is now the largest stadium in Mississippi.\n\nStill, grassroots efforts to change the name have come in small fits and starts over the years, though the overall conversation has lacked the urgency that has toppled other Confederate symbols. And when it has come up, it has typically inspired only lukewarm response. Torie Marion White, who serves as an assistant director at the Ole Miss Alumni Association, overseeing alumni relations for the School of Applied Science and the School of Engineering, as well as the Black Alumni Advisory Council and the Grove Society, tells Mother Jones that several of her fellow Black alums have taken to referring to the school as \"New Miss,\" she says, creating T-shirts and tumblers with their moniker featured in place of the old.

      "text": "This Is What the FBI Really Thought About LBJ's Top Civil Rights Lawyer\n\nJohn Doar (right) escorts James Meredith to his first class as the first black student at the University of Mississippi in 1962. The Commercial Appeal/ZUMA\n\nFew people in the federal government did as much for the civil rights movement as John Doar. As a lawyer in the Department of Justice, he rode through the South with the Freedom Riders in 1961, investigated the murders of three civil rights workers in 1964, and at one point in Jackson, Mississippi, put himself between police and demonstrators to defuse a violent situation using only his reputation. As the New York Times recounted in his obituary last year:\n\n\"My name is John Doar-D-O-A-R,\" he shouted to the crowd. \"I'm from the Justice Department, and anybody here knows what I stand for is right.\" That qualified as a full-length speech from the laconic Mr. Doar. At his continued urging, the crowd slowly melted away.\n\nThe FBI's files on Doar, which was released to Mother Jones this week under the Freedom of Information Act, included a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse of how J. Edgar Hoover's FBI viewed this civil rights crusader. When he was promoted to head the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice by President Lyndon Johnson in 1964, for instance, agents noted that Doar had been \"straightened out\" after complaining about the bureau's slow response to civil rights violations in the Deep South:\n\nView note\n\nHis file also contained an interview with a former colleague of Doar's which revealed a persistent character flaw-he cared way too much about civil rights and prioritized such cases over other issues:\n\nView note\n\nAll was not forgiven, despite what the memo to Hoover suggested. In 1967, after Doar had resigned from the Civil Rights Division and taken a new job in Brooklyn, an agent proposed using the former adversary as a liaison in handling racial unrest in Bedford-Stuyvesant. Hoover and his deputy, Clyde Tolson, gave the proposal an emphatic rejection:\n\nView note\n\nYou can read the FBI's full file on Doar here .\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Read the whole package here .\n\nThe National Border Patrol Museum , which sits inside a squat building on a decommissioned bombing range on the edge of El Paso's Franklin Mountains, has a musty and scattershot feel, as if one of America's most troubled law enforcement agencies has just emptied its pockets at the end of a long, hard century.\n\nSeized and donated artifacts fill every available nook-a hang glider and DIY motorcycles used to haul drugs; a collection of ladders and climbing ropes for scaling fences. There is riot gear belonging to the Border Patrol agents who, deputized as US Marshals, helped James Meredith integrate the University of Mississippi. Near the entrance, looking a little lost, is a miniature Statue of Liberty that once belonged to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The museum, which is privately operated but enjoys a close relationship with the agency, is the final resting place of both Rocky, the drug-sniffing dog, and a remote-controlled robot called \"R.A.D.\"-short for \" Robot Against Drugs \"-that was introduced to schools in 1988. R.A.D. carried a squirt gun in its holster \"to teach children not to play with guns\"; it could also turn into a walk signal.\n\nTaken together, the museum's exhibits and ephemera tell a simple story-of rugged, honorable men holding the line against disorder. Here, border security and immigration have been flattened into a binary of perps and heroes, and the agency absorbed into a kind of law-and-order monoculture. At the gift shop, alongside shot glasses embedded with bullets, you can buy a T-shirt with the \"Thin Green Line\" motif overlaid on the logo of Punisher -the serial-killing Marvel vigilante-or emblazoned on a Star Wars stormtrooper.\n\nOn the day I visited, an ex-agent-turned-influencer had stopped by to show off a new, promotional gun. The line of \" 100th anniversary Tribute edition \" rifles, available to active-duty or retired members for as little as $800, were a \"token of support,\" according to the Henry firearms company, for an agency on the front lines of an \"ongoing national security border crisis.\"\n\nThe story of the Border Patrol's founding offers a lesson for the century that followed, and a rejoinder to the agency's modern myth: Chaos is not just the absence of a border; it is also the consequence of trying to maintain one.\n\nThis image of the Border Patrol as a bulwark against anarchy is central to its identity. \"If you don't have a border, you don't have a country,\" former President Donald Trump often tells supporters. But we have not always had a Border Patrol. For much of the country's existence, the southwestern border was guarded sporadically. Well into the 20th century it was hardly demarcated at all. Almost no one was searching for unauthorized immigrants because relatively few people were barred from entering. That dearth of rules at the federal level instilled a certain kind of order-when you can cross at a port, there is no need to die in the desert. It took nearly 100 years for the United States to pass its first major federal immigration restrictions. It was another half-century before there was a permanent force dedicated to policing them on the international boundary. Someone had to create it. His name was Claude Benton Hudspeth.\n\nThe efforts of a mostly forgotten rancher-turned-congressman from West Texas are worth reckoning with today because the debates on immigration and border policing from a century ago never ended. The Border Patrol was born out of migrant panics, drug wars, and clashes between saber-rattling states and the federal government. It was an era of mass deportations, suspensions of civil liberties, vigilante murders, and calls for an invasion of Mexico. The agency, and the landmark immigration-reform bill that nudged it into existence in May 1924, were backed by eugenicist politicians who feared a Great Replacement by \"undesirable\" immigrants. The story of the Border Patrol's founding offers a lesson for the century that followed, and a rejoinder to the agency's modern myth: Chaos is not just the absence of a border; it is also the consequence of trying to maintain one.\n\nTo his contemporaries, Hudspeth was a kind of living relic, a \" cowboy statesman \" with less than a year of formal schooling who walked with a limp for most of his life on account of a steer-roping accident in his youth. He campaigned for office atop a pony named Sitting Bull and once took leave from Congress to lead a herd of Herefords several hundred miles across West Texas to a newly acquired ranch. As he rose to become one of the most powerful men in the state, that background served as more than political window dressing. It formed the backbone of his politics.\n\nThe son of a county sheriff, Hudspeth spent his formative years running sheep and cattle on South and West Texas ranches that had, in recent memory, been violently wrested from Mexicans and Indigenous peoples. A sense of deadly disorder lurking across the line was instilled early. During a 1919 floor speech calling for a military occupation of Mexico, Hudspeth described riding across the Rio Grande with \"peace officers\" as a boy to retrieve stolen livestock. When he was 19, in 1896, in an episode that seems ripped from a John Ford movie, he and a brother assembled a crew and rode hundreds of miles to Ciudad Juarez to spring their half brother from jail. They claimed he was unjustly imprisoned; the evidence suggests he had a penchant for cattle rustling.\n\nAt the time, crossing the river to stage a jailbreak was just a thing you could do. The border of Hudspeth's youth bore little resemblance to the militarized surveillance state of today. The federal government had only begun to seriously restrict voluntary immigration in 1875, when it barred Chinese contract laborers and women \"imported for the purposes of prostitution\" from entering the country. As late as 1891, Harvard University professor Erika Lee writes in her history of Chinese exclusion, At America's Gates , the California-Mexico border was patrolled by exactly three customs agents , whose primary focus was livestock. Alcohol was legal, and the federal government interfered little in the day-to-day comings and goings of many borderlands residents. There was no such thing as unlawful entry. Except for the Chinese, who were forced to present detailed paperwork upon their arrival, no one even needed passports.\n\nAs late as 1891, the California-Mexico border was patrolled by exactly three customs agents, whose primary focus was livestock.\n\nThis border was permeable, but the idea that it was \"open\" is also a myth, says University of Virginia historian S. Deborah Kang . In the absence of a large federal immigration bureaucracy, Kang notes, states and territories imposed their own rules, deporting undesirable Irish and restricting the movement of African Americans; the 1881 Chinese Exclusion Act-which banned almost all Chinese, not just contract laborers and \"immoral\" women-was passed only after California spent years attempting to accomplish the same thing. The US Army, whose far-flung units were sometimes referred to as a \"border patrol,\" powered white expansion by invading Mexico (on the pretext of defending a disputed boundary) and waging genocide against Native Americans. \"And then on top of that, you have a lot of private violence or vigilante violence being deployed by settlers in that region,\" Kang says. \"Today, historians all see those forms of policing, whether public or private, as forms of border policing.\"\n\nIn Texas, complaints that the federal government wasn't doing enough to secure its border were foundational. The state had even cited Washington's failure to secure the border \"against the Indian savages\" and \"the murderous forays of banditti from neighboring Mexico\" in its 1861 articles of secession. By the time Hudspeth arrived in Austin in 1906, as a state senator representing 800 miles of the Rio Grande, a few dozen of the state's most infamous lawmen had assumed much of the responsibility for patrolling the boundary. The Texas Rangers had been formed to keep enslaved people in and Indigenous peoples out. Hudspeth had briefly served with the Rangers, and he saw its members as the embodiment of what a border police force could be.\n\nHudspeth spent his first years in office on matters of hyperlocal concern, pushing a bounty on wolf pelts and a ban on competitive cattle-roping. But the start of the Mexican Revolution in 1910 brought the interests of fellow ranchers and white borderlands residents to the forefront of state and national politics. At first, the dynamic on the border was inverted-federal troops tried to prevent Mexicans from leaving the United States to foment insurrection back home. But as refugees and raiding parties began heading north, white Texans demanded a more militant defense of their property.\n\nJust like their antebellum predecessors, Democrats in the state now rewrote their platform to demand the government protect them from \"depredations by marauders from Mexico.\" And much like Gov. Greg Abbott today, Texas' actions were openly belligerent-feuding with Washington and threatening violence against Mexicans on both sides of the river. Hudspeth called for military intervention against the \" lawless, howling mob \" running Mexico and more funding for the men patrolling the border. Texas pushed to triple the size of the Ranger force and demanded President William Howard Taft pay for it . At one point after the state mobilized its National Guard, according to the historians Charles Harris and Louis Sadler, the War Department feared that Texas was actually going to invade Mexico.\n\n\"If the federal government does not protect the border with troops,\" Gov. Oscar Colquitt said in 1913, \"the state of Texas will.\"\n\nMexican revolutionary Pancho Villa's 1916 attack on Columbus, New Mexico, followed a year later by the United States' entry into World War I, injected urgency and resources into the situation. Fearing a Mexican alliance with Germany, and a full-scale invasion of the Southwest, President Woodrow Wilson's administration sent more than 100,000 soldiers to the border and dispatched scores of immigration agents and intelligence officers to watch for subversives-namely, German spies, Bolsheviks, and anarchists. In Arizona, a sheriff conducted a mass deportation of 1,000 striking mineworkers-many of them Mexican nationals-citing their support from the International Workers of the World and fears that they were allied with Villa. Meanwhile, Texas' state government decided to build the border force it always wanted. In April 1917, Hudspeth pushed through a bill allocating $250,000 for 1,000 new Rangers, and an expanded National Guard. At his request, the state even created a special Ranger company, composed of ranch hands in his district. They were called the Hudspeth Scouts.\n\nThis was border policing as Texas had always practiced it, less a matter of a line on a map than of identity and power.\n\nFor Hudspeth, by now one of the state's biggest ranchers, the unrest on the border was personal. Several of his constituents had been killed during \"bandit\" raids, including an old friend from his cowboy days. Rangers had been posted to his land. It was, undeniably, a dangerous time to run a ranch in the borderlands. But the Rangers protected the livestock and lives of white Texans by killing a lot of people and trampling the rights of those of Mexican descent. This was border policing as Texas had always practiced it , less a matter of a line on a map than of identity and power. Rangers seized firearms from Hispanic citizens. They shut down newspapers. In 1918 at Porvenir , a remote Rio Grande village in Hudspeth's district, a force of Rangers, local ranchers, and U.S Cavalry, lined up 15 men and boys in the middle of the night and shot them.\n\nWhen the legislature convened hearings on the Rangers' brutality in 1919, Hudspeth, who was about to go to Washington as a newly elected member of Congress, stopped in Austin to defend the force.\n\n\"You cannot handle those Mexicans with kid gloves, not when they come 12 miles below El Paso and steal a milch cow every night or two,\" he said. His prescription was simple : \"You have got to kill those Mexicans where you find them.\" The Porvenir massacre, he claimed-in defiance of the facts-was the work of honest lawmen and \"good citizens\" who were simply protecting their property.\n\nHudspeth was playing a familiar part. He was, in a sense, the original Beleaguered Rancher of contemporary newscasts-sunburnt and sober, defending not just his property but, he intimated, the civilization that people like him had clawed out of the brush. (How they had clawed it away was not a matter to dwell on.) His constituents talked of moving their ranches 100 miles inland and sending their families away for safety. Without the Rangers, Hudspeth argued, the entire region might as well be ceded to the Mexicans. Increasingly, he and many others with far different backgrounds were starting to insist that if you didn't have a patrol, you couldn't really have a border.\n\nWhile Texas was taking matters into its own hands, Hudspeth arrived that spring at a Capitol that was preparing to tackle the border crisis head-on. In response to the Mexican Revolution and the Great War, Washington had shifted into overdrive to protect itself against the threat of an actual invading army. Now, a group of Democrats and Republicans wanted to go much further. The \"invasion\" they feared wasn't from soldiers or cattle thieves. It was from immigrants.\n\nThere had long been rumblings that the federal system for detecting the \"surreptitious\" entry of people was insufficient. Difficulties enforcing the Chinese Exclusion Act had led to the creation, in 1904, of a small Mounted Guard whose members were known as \"Chinese Inspectors.\" By 1914, the US Immigration Service argued that \"contraband traffic and illegal entry of aliens can only be broken up by a general and complete organization of border patrol.\" A few years later, Frank Berkshire, a Chinese Inspector in El Paso, suggested an official \"Border Patrol\" agency modeled on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\nThe problem that Berkshire-and Congress-faced was one they have struggled with ever since: New legal regimes create new illegal ones. In the runup to World War I, the government began imposing literacy tests on new arrivals, and raised the mandatory head tax. It caved to nativist pressures and began subjecting Mexicans who came across at certain ports of entry to invasive and degrading fumigations. Excluded people (a growing list that now included, among others, the entire \"Asiatic Zone,\" anarchists, prostitutes, people who were \"likely to become a public charge,\" and people who were illiterate), or those who wanted to avoid the hassle, began circumventing ports of entry in increasing numbers, often with the help of professional smugglers.\n\nThe problem that Berkshire-and now Congress-faced was one they have struggled with ever since: New legal regimes create new illegal ones.\n\nIn DC, Hudspeth hit the ground running. Along with a Democratic senator from Texas, he proposed an appropriation of about $250,000 to create a \"division of border patrol\" within the Immigration Service.\n\nThe new wartime immigration inspectors had been furloughed after the end of the war. Now, \"Chinese, Japanese, Mexican outlaws and immoral women are coming across the border by the dozens,\" he said at an immigration committee hearing in 1919. Hudspeth claimed that between \"3,000 and 5,000 undesirables\" had crossed in just three months. \"Mexico does not cooperate with the United States to keep out the undesirables but secretly connives with them to come into this country.\" They're not sending their best , it turns out, is not an original talking point either.\n\nThe effort was tabled, but he kept at it. \"I have a resolution before this committee, as you gentlemen know, to establish and to reinforce the border patrol in Texas,\" Hudspeth told the committee in 1920. \"Why? To keep out the Jap and to keep out the Chinaman...I stand here today ready to urge that resolution, because, Mr. Chairman, I stand for law and order and I have stood for it all my life.\" He would do everything he could, he said, \"to keep the 'wetback'...from coming across.\"\n\nA colleague asked Hudspeth if the Rangers who currently served on the border could pass a civil service exam.\n\n\"If the test was right in shooting, I know they could stand it,\" he said. \"They would get 100 percent.\"\n\nHudspeth, who decried the federal government's plan to roll back its troop presence on the border, was not the only one talking seriously about a more robust operation. In the Senate, another border lawmaker, Sen. Henry Ashurst (D-Ariz.), pushed a proposal for increased Army patrols, while at the same time calling for parts of Mexico to be annexed . Sen. James Phelan (D-Calif.) led a more pointed charge for increased funding for an immigration border guard. A former mayor of San Francisco who had run for office on the slogan \" Keep California White ,\" Phelan believed the country faced demographic death.\n\n\"If we can stop Japanese immigration absolutely and guard our borders...the white man will have a chance to regather his strength and occupy the soil,\" he declared at a 1919 hearing.\n\nHis colleagues were largely sympathetic to Hudspeth's efforts. \"We realize the menace that exists in permitting the Texas-Mexico border to be free to radicals and Reds and we intend to protect this border,\" a committee member reassured the Texan in 1919. But the proposal languished. Budgets were tight and provincialism was strong. Some congressmen wanted to focus on Ellis Island instead-most immigrants, after all, arrived at ports. Even proponents of the idea acknowledged that trying to stop everyone might prove impossible.\n\n\"I do not want to be understood as assuming that we can make that border watertight,\" Anthony Caminetti, the US immigration commissioner-and a former member, Lee notes in At America's Gate s, of a California white supremacist group that was later known as the Order of Caucasians- testified in 1919 , while asking for money for more immigration agents. \"We cannot do it. It would cost too much money.\"\n\nFor Hudspeth's dream to become a reality, Congress would have to settle a larger debate, about whom a Border Patrol should stop.\n\nAt the same time Hudspeth was beating his Border Patrol drum, he was pushing to ease restrictions on a particular group of border crossers. His constituents may have been fed up with Mexican smugglers and bandits, but in 1919 they were desperate for cheap labor. Hudspeth, who spent much of his time in Washington micromanaging his livestock and pecan operations, considered the head tax and literacy test too onerous for Mexican farmhands. He repeatedly pushed Congress and the White House to suspend its regulations. To Hudspeth, this was a matter of simple economic sense-even if he considered Mexicans \" an inferior race .\"\n\nBut when Hudspeth appeared before the immigration committee to make his case, he faced serious resistance. Republican Rep. Hays White of Kansas warned that Mexicans would bring an \"evil philosophy against capital and property\"-that is, communism. Another Republican, Colorado Rep. William Vaile, worried that the move would sacrifice \" race integrity .\" \"They are wretched, lawless, poor criminal devils that do not know how to keep within the law,\" said John Box , an East Texas Democrat, who argued that politicians were using Mexican and noncitizen voters to rig elections.\n\nThe committee's Republican chairman, Albert Johnson of Washington, captured the spirit of the House: \"Is it not time for the United States to look upon every outsider with suspicion?\" he asked Hudspeth.\n\nJohnson and many of his peers believed the answer was yes. Rather than relaxing rules, they wanted to tighten them. There was no secret about why: Johnson, like many of his colleagues, despised Southern and Eastern Europeans and was deeply antisemitic . He and his allies proposed a new quota system to restrict immigration by tying the number of people admitted from each country to that nationality's representation in the 1890 Census-before the surge in migration from the targeted areas. His immigration committee even hired an in-house Eugenics Expert Agent -a proponent of mass sterilization who believed that Jews were \"filthy, un-American, and often dangerous in their habits.\"\n\n\"Is it not time for the United States to look upon every outsider with suspicion?\" asked the immigration committee's Republican chairman.\n\nWhile Johnson had resisted Hudspeth's efforts to loosen restrictions on Mexicans entering the country for seasonal work, it was the chairman's 1924 National Origins Act that finally pushed the Border Patrol over the finish line. The law slashed non-Western European migration and practically zeroed out emigration from Asia but exempted the Western Hemisphere. The interests of farmers and ranchers like Hudspeth ultimately prevailed over the wishes of people like Box and West Virginia Democratic Sen. Matthew Neely (who stated that \"we shall have delivered all of our priceless heritage to foreign invaders\"). Agribusiness wouldn't stand for a restriction that would threaten their labor supply, and politicians argued that extending the quotas would jeopardize diplomatic relationships. Even some of the eugenicists had to admit that attempting to keep out people who share a border would be too big of a lift.\n\nNativists \"were absolutely livid that Congress didn't pass any outright restrictions on Mexicans,\" says Kang, the UVA professor. \"Congress compromised and said, 'Look, we'll create the Border Patrol so we can control Mexican migration and make sure their migration is a temporary one.'\"\n\nThe National Origins Act included a clause specifically authorizing the appropriation of funds for its enforcement, and with that in hand, Johnson and Hudspeth introduced competing Border Patrol appropriations into an omnibus spending package working its way through the House. This time they found an ally in Box, who argued in a brief speech defending the measure that a new force was needed to keep \" vicious and undesirable \" immigrants from crossing the Mexican border-and falsely asserted that the previously deported anarchist Emma Goldman had recently \"entered in that way.\" Hudspeth's amendment, which asked for more money, ultimately prevailed. But in a reminder of the history of exclusion underpinning the effort, the chairman first had to amend the bill's language to say \"aliens\" instead of just \"Chinese.\"\n\nIn the runup to the final passage, media accounts depicted a crisis. Mexicans were \" massing on the border ,\" one Texas newspaper reported. A wire service story in late May 1924 read like early border agitprop, featuring photos of immigration inspectors in action, hiding in the brush with their weapons ready. \"Two aliens were found under the pile of sacks in this wagon after it crossed the American border,\" one caption read. Another photo featured what looked like staged footage of \"federal authorities\" engaged in a shootout with \"Chinese smugglers\" on the Arizona border.\n\nIn the run-up to the final passage, media accounts depicted a crisis. Mexicans were \"massing on the border,\" one Texas newspaper reported.\n\n\"They are doing what they can,\" the story announced. \"But the job is too big. Passage of the Hudspeth appropriation bill, now pending in Congress, is their only hope.\" The package became law the next day, on May 28, 1924.\n\nThe Border Patrol was a new idea that bore the distinct imprint of the past. To fill its roster, the force relied on the institutions that had been policing the color line for years. In Migra! A History of the U.S. Border Patrol , historian Kelly Lytle Hernández found that many of the first recruits were drawn from the Texas Rangers. The director of the sector that included Laredo, William Hanson , was an ex-Ranger captain who had spied on Black political dissidents, smuggled guns to Mexican counterrevolutionaries, and fanned fears of an armed invasion of Texas. For its part, the Border Patrol today considers Berkshire its \" Father \"-the unit's early ranks were filled, too, with ex-Chinese Inspectors like him.\n\nBut in their haste to authorize the force, Hudspeth and his colleagues had neglected to give it anything to do. At first, agents didn't even have the authority to arrest anyone. No sooner had the first agents donned their forest green uniforms than the calls began again. The border guard needed more power, more men, and more funding. Congress meant to solve a problem. It only created bigger ones.\n\nFor someone whose handiwork is foundational to American politics today, Hudspeth is largely anonymous. The Border Patrol Museum makes no mention of the force's first political patron, just as it steers clear of the period of state violence that preceded the unit's creation and the eugenicist nature of the debates from which it finally emerged. Hudspeth's obituaries upon his death in 1941 skipped right over his role in creating the agency. It is possible he simply never envisioned its full significance; his papers at the University of Texas at El Paso-another institution he helped found-include nary a reference to his role in establishing what is now a sprawling force of nearly 20,000 people.\n\nBut there is one monument to his legacy. When Hudspeth was only 39, in the middle of his push for the Ranger bill, his colleagues honored him with a gift: They named a county for him-a remote patch of West Texas that today is home to some 3,400 people in an area more than twice the size of Delaware. The county is a destination not just for millions of dollars of state and federal funds, but for right-wing border cosplayers . In 2011, Steven Seagal was sworn in as a sheriff's deputy. Hudspeth's historic marker sits on a sunbaked rest area off I-10. You can't miss it; it's the last stop before the Border Patrol checkpoint.\n\nHudspeth's obituaries upon his death in 1941 skipped right over his role in creating the Border Patrol. It is possible he simply never envisioned its full significance.\n\nIn recent years, as walls and patrol strategies pushed migrants into ever more hostile corridors, Hudspeth County has seen an unprecedented surge in apprehensions and deaths. One of the biggest employers outside the BP is the West Texas Detention Center, part of the region's booming migrant-jail economy. In 2022, the now-former warden at one of those detention centers was released on bond with his brother after allegedly killing a man from Mexico who stopped to drink from a small pond. \" They are good guys ,\" the sheriff told the New York Times .\n\nHudspeth did not begin this process; he merely did his part to keep it going. The work could never be finished. Which was why, in February 1925, less than a year after his force was established, Hudspeth returned to the House Appropriations Committee with another proposal. He began, in earnest, to discuss a new problem facing the ranchers and lawmen of his district. East of El Paso, the river had jumped its channel years ago and left pockets of Mexican territory north of the Rio Grande. Now, with Prohibition in effect, the area was overrun by smugglers. The Border Patrol was outgunned. \"In the last two years we have had something like 20 government officials murdered there,\" he testified. Hudspeth was asking for $30,000 to settle the problem.\n\n\"What is it you want?\" a committee member asked.\n\n\"I want a fence,\" Hudspeth replied.\n\nRead the rest of our Border Patrol investigation here .\n\nCredits from left: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty,  Lennox McLendon/AP, Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty , Library of Congress/Wikimedia\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Racism of \"Ole Miss\" Is Hiding in Plain Sight\n\nBecca Andrews July 1, 2020\n\nMother Jones illustration; Bettmann/Getty\n\nMother Jones illustration; Bettmann/Getty\n\nAt the entrance of the University of Mississippi campus in Oxford, the statue of a white marble man sits among the magnolia and oak trees. The gift from the Daughters of the Confederacy, a soldier, his arm in salute, a rifle at his side, has presided over passersby entering the university since 1906. He is perched atop a matching white marble spire so that the tip of his hat reaches toward the treetops. A plaque at the base of the monument, revised in 2016 as part of a historical contextualization project , allows that the statue was one in a series of memorials that \"were often used to promote an ideology known as the ' Lost Cause ,' which claimed that the Confederacy had been established to defend states' rights and that slavery was not the principal cause of the Civil War.\"\n\nStill, it stands.\n\nBut now, after more than a century, the anonymous soldier will finally be ousted from his premier spot -a move that's the direct result of a sustained campaign led by University of Mississippi students . \"We still have a long way to go, but it's still a victory, and I think we are allowed to celebrate it,\" Arielle Hudson, a recent graduate and the university's first Black female Rhodes scholar, tells me.\n\nBut it wasn't easy to get here. More than a year ago, the Associated Student Body Senate for inclusion and cross-cultural engagement unanimously passed a resolution that stated, \"Confederate ideology directly violates the tenets of the university creed that supports fairness, civility, and respect for the dignity of each person.\" While plans were made with the university to move the statue, the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning stepped in, declaring that the marble soldier falls under its purview and putting the plans on indefinite pause.\n\nBut in this moment of broader racial reckoning spurred by the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd, the already thinning tolerance for hand-wringing over such symbols has largely evaporated. In mid-June, the IHL agreed to move the statue to a less-prestigious placement, keeping watch over the dead in a Confederate cemetery in an area with less foot traffic, behind an old coliseum that's no longer in regular use.\n\nUndoubtedly the ultra-conservative IHL relaxing its grip is an important step. Persuading the university five years ago to discontinue the use of the Mississippi state flag-which, until Gov. Tate Reeves signed a law to retire it this week, was the last state flag to feature the Confederate battle flag design-was a similarly important one. And so was the university's pledge , just last month, to review its \"admissions and judicial review policies and protocols\" to deal with prospective students whose social media pages include racist posts.\n\nEven so, each step away from the school's \"Old South\" image ultimately seems marked by ambivalence. Soon after the announcement that the entrance's Confederate statue would be moved, plans surfaced to renovate the cemetery to create a sort of \"shrine\" effect (though the university says the design is not final). And while it is unclear what exactly will change for its admissions and judicial review policies, the university's stance has long been that it is unwilling to court costly First Amendment lawsuits, even as schools like the University of Alabama have expelled students over racist social media posts.\n\nAnd, crucially, no matter what happens with these measures, there remains an implicit tribute to white supremacy on campus that has proven tougher to exorcise, one many people don't even realize is there. The \"Ole Miss\" moniker has long informed the core of the institution's identity and the surrounding community, not to mention its powerful brand. But this is not merely a convenient abbreviation of the long official name. It's a phrase that's long haunted Black students, faculty, and staff as a lingering nod to the days when it seemed unthinkable that a place like the university would ever accept them only because of their skin.\n\nWhile statues all over the country come down, and the United States reckons with its racist past, it is time to confront the more insidious forms of white supremacy-especially those so easy to take for granted that it becomes harder and harder to recognize them for what they really are. They are not monuments or flags, but they are hidden in our language and our customs, their origins masked by time and intent.\n\nWhen Zaire Love was accepted into the University of Mississippi's documentary program to pursue her MFA, she was thrilled. In July 2018, she posted a photo to share the news that she would attend her dream school on full scholarship, no less; she looks uncertain but triumphant. Under a camo jacket draped perfectly off her shoulders, her white T-shirt is one she made herself: navy blue scripted letters sing \"Ole Miss Mane.\"\n\n\"I thought I was putting my Blackness and my Black flavor on it,\" she says. She didn't know just what it meant at the time, but she remembers her bitter disappointment the day she found out.\n\nThat summer, Love left her home in Memphis to mentor teenagers on campus through the William Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation. She was eager to get involved in a new community, and the program seemed like the perfect way to jumpstart a new chapter in her life. While she was there, the origin story of the name \"Ole Miss\" came up.\n\nLove learned that a student, Elma Meek, proposed the name in 1896 for a new yearbook that was being created by an interfraternity group. Her inspiration reportedly came \"from the language of the Ante-bellum 'Darkey,ʼ who knew the wife of his owner by no other title than 'Ole Miss,ʼ\" according to the student newspaper, then called The Mississippian. In an interview with that paper in the 1930s, Meek said she felt the name \"connoted all the admiration and reverence accorded the womanhood of the Old South.\" This intervention afforded Meek herself a vaunted spot in Oxford mythology; long after she had stopped attending classes at the university, Meek lived in a house near the campus that was built by a Confederate general. (For a while, William Faulkner and his wife lived with her there; it's actually where he wrote much of As I Lay Dying and \"A Rose for Emily.\") Today, the house is fiercely protected from any attempts at change, down to its air ducts, by the local Historic Preservation Commission. But more than Meek's sentimental history, the name she proposed has stuck, so wildly outliving its origins that many, many people who pass through the Oxford campus or tailgate in the Grove or simply follow the sports teams with mild interest are unaware of the horrors hidden therein.\n\n(The university did not respond to multiple interview requests from Mother Jones , but sent a statement from Chancellor Glenn Boyce: \"Ole Miss is a term of affinity for many of our people that is intrinsic to the university's identity and carries strong, positive national and international recognition. We understand the complex history of its origins...at the same time, it is a term whose meaning has changed over time, and we are committed to living by what it means today to our students and alumni who embrace it as an expression of caring and community.\" The email also included a chapter from a book titled, The Other Mississippi: A State in Conflict with Itself ; written by David Sansing, the University of Mississippi's late historian, the selection emphasizes that the term \"Ole Miss\" was one of \"respect and endearment\" used by slaves, and twice says that Meek's intention was not to \"reminisce or regale\" slavery, rather she only meant to \"link her alma mater to those grand women of the antebellum South.\")\n\nUpon learning this history, Love was determined not to use the casual nickname again. \"I'm going to stand up and say this is not what I want to use,\" she says. But, she admits, it's not exactly easy to just remove yourself from something so wrapped up in campus culture-\"It's also the lay of the land. It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't-type situation.\"\n\nThere are so many people-not all of them white-who do not know the university as anything other than \"Ole Miss.\" It's everywhere around you in Oxford; on billboards that advertise the university as you drive into town, on signs and on campus, on T-shirts, ball caps, stickers, school supplies, tacked onto the end of every student's and faculty member's email address. There is no University of Mississippi; there is only \"Ole Miss.\"\n\nFor most of my life, I was among the oblivious. The historical context of \"Ole Miss\" was news to me when late last year a former high school classmate of mine posted a 2019 Chronicle of Higher Ed article on Facebook detailing origins of the university's hoary nickname. I am a Southern white woman who has always spoken those words, \"Ole Miss,\" in the context of a dearly held rivalry between the university in Oxford and Mississippi State University, where most of my family has attended school for generations. It once vaguely connoted home to me, recalling Thanksgivings at my grandmother's house in Tupelo, the television in the living room blaring the Egg Bowl, the annual football faceoff between the schools, as we cleaned up the kitchen and carefully put away the leftovers.\n\nCheerleaders carry \"Ole Miss\" flags during a game against the Memphis Tigers at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium on October 1, 2016, in Oxford, Mississippi. Jonathan Bachman/Getty I'm not sure I've ever heard anyone refer to it as the University of Mississippi until recently, but the discovery that words that I once regarded as neutral, even charming, contain a bitter connotation has changed that. For weeks, I couldn't stop thinking about this new context. I quizzed everyone I encountered about the once-beloved nickname; in bars, at work, on the phone with folks back home-no one knew. That racism often hides in language is not a new concept to me; I grew up as a white girl in the South. But that also means I hid from those realities behind my privilege and youth for an unforgivably long time. Even as a child, I often sensed some lingering evil when racism was dressed up as something innocuous-yet in the name \"Ole Miss,\" for nearly three decades, I heard only a folksy alternative to an unwieldy school name. \"If you talk to students, they will say that it weighs on their everyday experiences on this campus.\" A few weeks after reading the article, I wandered the campus with my cousin, struck by the depth of the school's commitment to the branding-wondering how I went so long without knowing, becoming fixated on how the name that literally looms over everyone's heads affects life for students and staff of color. The student population is 76 percent white and only 13 percent Black; similarly, the faculty is 78 percent white and only 6 percent Black. \"If you talk to students-and this is both students in general, Black, white, and otherwise, but especially with students of color-they will say that it weighs on their everyday experiences on this campus-the 'it' being the racial history of the campus,\" says Brian Foster, an assistant professor in the sociology department, who is Black. Interviews with students add further dimensions to Foster's assessment. While Love is careful to point out that as a graduate student she is not on campus as often as undergraduates are, she notes, \"Our ancestors already paid the price. We don't need to add tax by continuing to have those symbols of oppression at the University of Mississippi.\" For her part, Yasmine Malone, a rising senior at the university, likes the nickname itself, stripped of its origins, but it bothers her that she feels like the school is less than clear about where it comes from. A classmate, Isabel Spafford, says she heard the claim on a campus tour that the name is taken from a train that supposedly ran through the state from Memphis. Malone notes that despite efforts to move forward, there is also still an undeniable pattern of racism in behavior at the University of Mississippi-whether it's the Black fraternity house that was burned to the ground in 1988 or the Confederate rally held on campus in February 2019 or the powerful old Southern families who donate to the university on the condition that the Confederate imagery remain intact and undisturbed. \"I would like for us to adopt a mindset that we no longer want this to represent who we are,\" Malone says. \"But the fact of it is, that is exactly who we are. The political, economic, and social forces that guide decisions around Ole Miss are all very much still racist.\" She clarifies that she's being more candid with me than she feels she can generally be in her life on campus. While the University of Mississippi has grappled with its Confederate history for decades, wrestling with these demons never makes for a straightforward fight. And in the broader context of the state of Mississippi, where strains of white supremacy persist from the not-so-distant past, it has been even more fraught. In 1848, the university was \"very explicitly founded as an institution where slaveholder sons can attend rather than going to those fanatical colleges and universities in the north where they might imbibe anti-slavery ideology, and come back hostile to the institution,\" says Anne Twitty, an associate history professor at the University of Mississippi. \"The overwhelming majority of the University of Mississippi's first students came from slaveholding families.\" As Twitty points out in a recent piece for the Atlantic , when the various monuments and memorials to the Confederacy began to appear on campus in the late 1800s and early 1900s, they were constructed not in grief for lives that had been lost, but rather in celebration for the power structure preserved through Jim Crow. The university did not accept its first Black student, James Meredith, until 1962, and Meredith's acceptance came only after a lengthy legal battle. Violent protests ensued ; two died and some 300 more were injured. \"Why would we expect this to be a habitable place? Why would we expect this to be a welcoming and vibrant place?\" \"It's a practical matter,\" Foster says. \"If Black folks have only been allowed to be here, either as students, as faculty, as administrators, for a fraction of the university's history, it only follows that they will be underrepresented in those spaces to which they haven't historically had access.\" He adds, \"Why would we expect this to be a habitable place? Why would we expect this to be a welcoming and vibrant place?\" In 2006, a statue of Meredith was erected on campus. In 2014, three fraternity brothers flung a noose over its neck. The university has made attempts to tackle some of the most glaring representations of this racism, but its official actions don't always translate to the broader culture on campus. For the better part of the 20th century , for instance, the school's mascot was Colonel Reb, a mustachioed caricature of a plantation owner who wears a haughty expression, leaning heavily on a cane. He is sometimes depicted against a backdrop of a Confederate flag. The university officially retired him in 2003-but the image is far from defunct. Independent groups attend sporting events with stuffed Colonel Rebs for children; men dress as the former mascot and pose with sorority girls and fraternity boys. University of Mississippi senior Chris Baxley wears the costume of school mascot Colonel Reb during the Kentucky-Mississippi basketball game in Memphis on March 8, 1997. Mark Humphrey/AP In 2009, former Chancellor Dan Jones asked the university's band, known as the Pride of the South, to stop playing \"From Dixie With Love,\" which blended the Battle Hymn of the Republic with Dixie that builds toward a chant: \"The South will rise again.\" In 2016, they were asked to stop playing any variation on the unofficial anthem of the Confederate States of America. Like the mascot, both songs have disappeared officially, but that does not stop tailgaters from blaring the anthem from booming speakers in oversize pickups anyway. Even though the school banned the Mississippi flag on campus because of the Confederate symbolism prominently displayed therein, there's still the Our State Flag Foundation, a group of people pissed that the university no longer flies it. The Facebook group, which hovers around 25,000 members, is a forum where angry white people bemoan diversity and inclusion efforts on their best days and attack specific people of color in the university community on their worst. They have a booth in the Grove on game days. The way the university has dealt with the name has been even more opaque. In 2014, a Sensitivity and Respect Committee, comprised of administrators and other faculty, and a handful of students, aimed to make the campus more diverse and inclusive, releasing a report that alludes to the moniker but avoids addressing its racist history directly. While the official recommendation is, the University of Mississippi should \"consider the implications of calling itself 'Ole Miss' in various contexts,\" most of that section of the report appears to brush the roots of the name aside: \"Regardless of its origin, the vast majority of those associated with our university has a strong affection for 'Ole Miss' and do not associate its use with race in any way. And the vast majority of those who view us from a distance associate the term 'Ole Miss' with a strong, vibrant, modern university - and the Manning family, The Blind Side , The [sic] 2008 Presidential Debate, and great sports teams.\" If the University of Mississippi is a formal name, \"Ole Miss\" conveys a powerful emotion. In June 2017, another report , this one from the Chancellor's Advisory Committee on History and Contextualization, was released. It held specific instructions for clarifying the history of the Confederate iconography on campus-everything from the names of buildings to the 12-foot-tall Tiffany stained-glass window depicting the University Greys, the students who fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War (all of whom were killed or wounded in combat). It was, in many ways, a massive victory for the Black students and faculty who had long been fighting for a more inclusive, reflective campus. \"Ole Miss,\" though, was not even mentioned in this report. \"Those efforts for change have always registered to me as symbolism, surface level, more than tangible, material, structural,\" Foster says. Part of this may be because if the University of Mississippi is a formal name, \"Ole Miss\" conveys a powerful emotion-and a lucrative brand. As Hudson put it to me, \"We have not moved on from [Ole Miss] because of capitalism...they're making money off of that.\" Forbes estimates that the annual revenue-over an average of three years-brought in from the \"Ole Miss\" football program alone is $84 million, making it one of the top 25 most lucrative college teams in the country. In 2016, the school expanded Vaught-Hemingway Stadium to hold 64,038 football fans; it is now the largest stadium in Mississippi. Still, grassroots efforts to change the name have come in small fits and starts over the years, though the overall conversation has lacked the urgency that has toppled other Confederate symbols. And when it has come up, it has typically inspired only lukewarm response. Torie Marion White, who serves as an assistant director at the Ole Miss Alumni Association, overseeing alumni relations for the School of Applied Science and the School of Engineering, as well as the Black Alumni Advisory Council and the Grove Society, tells Mother Jones that several of her fellow Black alums have taken to referring to the school as \"New Miss,\" she says, creating T-shirts and tumblers with their moniker featured in place of the old. Nevertheless, such swag is hard to come by; when I searched for anything like that online, I came up only with beauty pageant references. Just this year, Zach Borenstein, a white graduate student, wrote an op-ed in the student newspaper, the Daily Mississippian , calling for the death of \"Ole Miss.\" \"Language matters, but we often get used to saying things that normalize harm,\" he wrote in early February. \"Certain phrases diminish or denigrate groups of people, and if not addressed, these phrases become so commonplace that those using them do not even consider their origins and effects.\" (At the end of May, Borenstein was arrested for defacing the Confederate statue at the campus entrance. He slashed his hand with a knife to cast bloody handprints upon the white marble, framing the words \"spiritual genocide,\" spray-painted in black.) A week after Borenstein's op-ed published, another appeared, this one by a white then-junior named Lauren Moses. It was headlined \"Let's keep saying 'Ole Miss. ' \" : \"My friends and I recently discussed the waning respect for tradition on our campus. From changing the school mascot to governing bodies voting to move the Confederate statue to contextualizing many buildings on campus, Ole Miss has lost its identity.\" The core of her argument is that history fades, and that those symbols are not celebrated for their origins, but in spite of them. Her point isn't particularly novel; it is in fact all too familiar. It ripples through the campus and an extended community of (mostly white) fans and alumni in all sorts of forms. Alumnus Jon Rawl, co-founder of the Colonel Reb Foundation, lobbies the university to bring back the mascot from the early aughts. I asked him what he'd say to Black students and faculty who are disturbed by the Confederate imagery on campus, including the mascot. He replied simply, \"Well, the Confederate stuff was there before they were.\" Over the past few weeks in particular, I've considered what it means to love the South, as I deeply do. What once was partially buried under decades of careful erasure is now stark and exposed. I cannot look away from racism, especially where it flourishes in my home. Harm is difficult to quantify, which in turn makes it a tricky defense against the thing that harms. When people who have been actively disempowered are those being harmed, it makes those voices harder to hear, or maybe easier for those in power to ignore. As I talked to more and more people in the campus community-most of them Black-I couldn't help but feel the magnitude of all they are up against. Before Foster was a sociology professor, he came to study at the University of Mississippi as a student. He tells me it was the first time he feared for his safety based on his identity. Oxford was the first place he was ever called the n-word by a white person. It was the first place where two white boys pulled up next to him at a stoplight, rolled down the window, and asked, \"Where you boys going tonight?\" like they were entitled to know. While scrolling through the Our State Flag Foundation's Facebook page, I came across a screenshot of Foster's staff page, and my stomach churned, alongside a photo of two Black female graduates. They had drawn the ire of the group for their activism to remove the state flag from campus. There are 69 comments below. \"You really do have to have a lot of strength and a lot of energy to continuously put your Black or Brown body in these spaces and fight for those things, because it is not for the faint of heart.\" Similarly, Marion White, who runs the Black Alumni Advisory Council, says she's \"been the only minority in a room my entire life,\" and still, the day came when she was manhandled by a campus police officer because she was in the parking area for elite alumni on game day. When she told him she worked for the university, he wouldn't believe her. (Marion White says the officer remains on the force.) My conversations with students echo these experiences. Malone, the senior, tells me that while she's found a vibrant Black community at the university, she has stepped back from activism and fighting back against the university's Confederate symbols. It's become too much for her emotionally; she has to focus on her studies, which is a tall order in itself when attending classes means passing former slave quarters and hearing her university referred to in antebellum language. Love is still committed to getting her MFA, but concludes, \"You really do have to have a lot of strength and a lot of energy to continuously put your Black or Brown body in these spaces and fight for those things, because it is not for the faint of heart.\" Most of the men and women I interviewed also mentioned a photo that went viral in July 2019 of three white fraternity brothers, wearing broad smiles and posing in front of the bullet-ridden sign memorializing Emmett Till, the Black 14-year-old who was tortured and lynched in 1955 after a white woman falsely accused him of whistling at her. Two of the boys in the photo held guns. The sign itself is so often vandalized, so frequently shot at, that it's impossible to know if the bullet holes are from the guns clutched in the hands of the Kappa Alpha brothers. They were suspended from their fraternity, but ultimately allowed to remain enrolled as students. \"I just feel like if those boys were Black men who shot up a Confederate sign, there would probably be way more consequences, way more outrage, way more punishment for them,\" Love tells me. \"You understand that the underlining thing about it is this deeply entrenched white privilege and to me, being a woman of color, a Black woman, particularly...it just makes you feel powerless.\" This incident reveals a bright line for these individuals on campus, where all the changes made so far seem to stumble short of addressing a larger cultural problem. The university has put a significant amount of time and money into trying to leave the past behind, but it cannot truly overcome its legacy when it chooses to retain an identity that romanticizes a time when Black people were considered so subhuman that they could not address a white woman directly. Language provides all sorts of nook and crannies for white supremacy to hide; can it be truly overthrown without addressing what's really in a name? A name that is so intertwined with the identity of a place is tough to disentangle. Some of the students who make a conscious effort to use the full name of the university would slip up in our conversations; I have promised myself to make the same effort and sometimes my tongue still catches on it. To stay vigilant enough to thwart the connection between your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your mind requires a kind of prickly awareness that feels uncomfortable at first, but soon, it dissolves into normalcy. It is difficult to imagine the University of Mississippi as anything but \"Ole Miss.\" It is also impossible to completely divorce the school from the values held in its Confederate past without going all-in on moving forward and making the change. Moving statues, contextualizing symbols, building committees, and scheduling programming toward a more inclusive and diverse campus are all good and important. But that work feels dwarfed by the name of the place, when the words on the lips of everyone in that community are an homage to the antebellum South. Language provides all sorts of nook and crannies for white supremacy to hide; can it be truly overthrown without addressing what's really in a name? James Meredith, the first Black man to attend the University of Mississippi, wears his \"New Miss\" hat, a gift from Pastor Robert West. West said, \"The day James Meredith stepped onto the campus of The University of Mississippi, it was no longer 'Ole Miss.'\" Suzi Altman/Zuma Names, though, even the ones so tied up in a community, in its identity, can change. Look around. This reckoning over what's in a name, which has played out time and time again, and time again, is once again doing so in the names of schools and parks and military bases and even country music bands. With time, few will remember what they once were. Once, the University of Mississippi was simply that. It could be that again; it could also be reborn as something better. It may not happen today or tomorrow. But it will. It must. Of course changing the name will not magically dissipate centuries of systemic racism and inequality, but it is a simple step forward. Until then I feel somewhat heartened thinking about the fight itself-which, Love says, \"is important because it shows that we are here, it shows that we belong, and it does not validate our worth, but it does validate us being here.\" \"It shows that hey, we're here, we're staying. We acknowledge that these things, these symbols, hurt.\" Correction: An earlier version of this article applied a term for the original Confederate States flag, in use 1861-1863, to a later version formerly displayed in the state flag of Mississippi.\n\nI'm not sure I've ever heard anyone refer to it as the University of Mississippi until recently, but the discovery that words that I once regarded as neutral, even charming, contain a bitter connotation has changed that.

Just this year, Zach Borenstein, a white graduate student, wrote an op-ed in the student newspaper, the Daily Mississippian , calling for the death of \"Ole Miss.\" \"Language matters, but we often get used to saying things that normalize harm,\" he wrote in early February. \"Certain phrases diminish or denigrate groups of people, and if not addressed, these phrases become so commonplace that those using them do not even consider their origins and effects.\" (At the end of May, Borenstein was arrested for defacing the Confederate statue at the campus entrance. He slashed his hand with a knife to cast bloody handprints upon the white marble, framing the words \"spiritual genocide,\" spray-painted in black.) A week after Borenstein's op-ed published, another appeared, this one by a white then-junior named Lauren Moses. It was headlined \"Let's keep saying 'Ole Miss. ' \" : \"My friends and I recently discussed the waning respect for tradition on our campus. From changing the school mascot to governing bodies voting to move the Confederate statue to contextualizing many buildings on campus, Ole Miss has lost its identity.\" The core of her argument is that history fades, and that those symbols are not celebrated for their origins, but in spite of them. Her point isn't particularly novel; it is in fact all too familiar. It ripples through the campus and an extended community of (mostly white) fans and alumni in all sorts of forms. Alumnus Jon Rawl, co-founder of the Colonel Reb Foundation, lobbies the university to bring back the mascot from the early aughts. I asked him what he'd say to Black students and faculty who are disturbed by the Confederate imagery on campus, including the mascot. He replied simply, \"Well, the Confederate stuff was there before they were.\" Over the past few weeks in particular, I've considered what it means to love the South, as I deeply do. What once was partially buried under decades of careful erasure is now stark and exposed. I cannot look away from racism, especially where it flourishes in my home. Harm is difficult to quantify, which in turn makes it a tricky defense against the thing that harms. When people who have been actively disempowered are those being harmed, it makes those voices harder to hear, or maybe easier for those in power to ignore. As I talked to more and more people in the campus community-most of them Black-I couldn't help but feel the magnitude of all they are up against. Before Foster was a sociology professor, he came to study at the University of Mississippi as a student. He tells me it was the first time he feared for his safety based on his identity. Oxford was the first place he was ever called the n-word by a white person. It was the first place where two white boys pulled up next to him at a stoplight, rolled down the window, and asked, \"Where you boys going tonight?\" like they were entitled to know. While scrolling through the Our State Flag Foundation's Facebook page, I came across a screenshot of Foster's staff page, and my stomach churned, alongside a photo of two Black female graduates. They had drawn the ire of the group for their activism to remove the state flag from campus. There are 69 comments below. \"You really do have to have a lot of strength and a lot of energy to continuously put your Black or Brown body in these spaces and fight for those things, because it is not for the faint of heart.\" Similarly, Marion White, who runs the Black Alumni Advisory Council, says she's \"been the only minority in a room my entire life,\" and still, the day came when she was manhandled by a campus police officer because she was in the parking area for elite alumni on game day. When she told him she worked for the university, he wouldn't believe her. (Marion White says the officer remains on the force.) My conversations with students echo these experiences. Malone, the senior, tells me that while she's found a vibrant Black community at the university, she has stepped back from activism and fighting back against the university's Confederate symbols. It's become too much for her emotionally; she has to focus on her studies, which is a tall order in itself when attending classes means passing former slave quarters and hearing her university referred to in antebellum language. Love is still committed to getting her MFA, but concludes, \"You really do have to have a lot of strength and a lot of energy to continuously put your Black or Brown body in these spaces and fight for those things, because it is not for the faint of heart.\" Most of the men and women I interviewed also mentioned a photo that went viral in July 2019 of three white fraternity brothers, wearing broad smiles and posing in front of the bullet-ridden sign memorializing Emmett Till, the Black 14-year-old who was tortured and lynched in 1955 after a white woman falsely accused him of whistling at her. Two of the boys in the photo held guns. The sign itself is so often vandalized, so frequently shot at, that it's impossible to know if the bullet holes are from the guns clutched in the hands of the Kappa Alpha brothers. They were suspended from their fraternity, but ultimately allowed to remain enrolled as students. \"I just feel like if those boys were Black men who shot up a Confederate sign, there would probably be way more consequences, way more outrage, way more punishment for them,\" Love tells me. \"You understand that the underlining thing about it is this deeply entrenched white privilege and to me, being a woman of color, a Black woman, particularly...it just makes you feel powerless.\" This incident reveals a bright line for these individuals on campus, where all the changes made so far seem to stumble short of addressing a larger cultural problem. The university has put a significant amount of time and money into trying to leave the past behind, but it cannot truly overcome its legacy when it chooses to retain an identity that romanticizes a time when Black people were considered so subhuman that they could not address a white woman directly. Language provides all sorts of nook and crannies for white supremacy to hide; can it be truly overthrown without addressing what's really in a name? A name that is so intertwined with the identity of a place is tough to disentangle. Some of the students who make a conscious effort to use the full name of the university would slip up in our conversations; I have promised myself to make the same effort and sometimes my tongue still catches on it. To stay vigilant enough to thwart the connection between your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your mind requires a kind of prickly awareness that feels uncomfortable at first, but soon, it dissolves into normalcy. It is difficult to imagine the University of Mississippi as anything but \"Ole Miss.\" It is also impossible to completely divorce the school from the values held in its Confederate past without going all-in on moving forward and making the change. Moving statues, contextualizing symbols, building committees, and scheduling programming toward a more inclusive and diverse campus are all good and important. But that work feels dwarfed by the name of the place, when the words on the lips of everyone in that community are an homage to the antebellum South. Language provides all sorts of nook and crannies for white supremacy to hide; can it be truly overthrown without addressing what's really in a name? James Meredith, the first Black man to attend the University of Mississippi, wears his \"New Miss\" hat, a gift from Pastor Robert West. West said, \"The day James Meredith stepped onto the campus of The University of Mississippi, it was no longer 'Ole Miss.'\" Suzi Altman/Zuma Names, though, even the ones so tied up in a community, in its identity, can change. Look around. This reckoning over what's in a name, which has played out time and time again, and time again, is once again doing so in the names of schools and parks and military bases and even country music bands. With time, few will remember what they once were. Once, the University of Mississippi was simply that. It could be that again; it could also be reborn as something better. It may not happen today or tomorrow. But it will. It must. Of course changing the name will not magically dissipate centuries of systemic racism and inequality, but it is a simple step forward. Until then I feel somewhat heartened thinking about the fight itself-which, Love says, \"is important because it shows that we are here, it shows that we belong, and it does not validate our worth, but it does validate us being here.\" \"It shows that hey, we're here, we're staying. We acknowledge that these things, these symbols, hurt.\" Correction: An earlier version of this article applied a term for the original Confederate States flag, in use 1861-1863, to a later version formerly displayed in the state flag of Mississippi.\n\nIn 2009, former Chancellor Dan Jones asked the university's band, known as the Pride of the South, to stop playing \"From Dixie With Love,\" which blended the Battle Hymn of the Republic with Dixie that builds toward a chant: \"The South will rise again.\" In 2016, they were asked to stop playing any variation on the unofficial anthem of the Confederate States of America. Like the mascot, both songs have disappeared officially, but that does not stop tailgaters from blaring the anthem from booming speakers in oversize pickups anyway.\n\nEven though the school banned the Mississippi flag on campus because of the Confederate symbolism prominently displayed therein, there's still the Our State Flag Foundation, a group of people pissed that the university no longer flies it. The Facebook group, which hovers around 25,000 members, is a forum where angry white people bemoan diversity and inclusion efforts on their best days and attack specific people of color in the university community on their worst. They have a booth in the Grove on game days.\n\nThe way the university has dealt with the name has been even more opaque. In 2014, a Sensitivity and Respect Committee, comprised of administrators and other faculty, and a handful of students, aimed to make the campus more diverse and inclusive, releasing a report that alludes to the moniker but avoids addressing its racist history directly. While the official recommendation is, the University of Mississippi should \"consider the implications of calling itself 'Ole Miss' in various contexts,\" most of that section of the report appears to brush the roots of the name aside: \"Regardless of its origin, the vast majority of those associated with our university has a strong affection for 'Ole Miss' and do not associate its use with race in any way. And the vast majority of those who view us from a distance associate the term 'Ole Miss' with a strong, vibrant, modern university - and the Manning family, The Blind Side , The [sic] 2008 Presidential Debate, and great sports teams.\"\n\nIn June 2017, another report , this one from the Chancellor's Advisory Committee on History and Contextualization, was released. It held specific instructions for clarifying the history of the Confederate iconography on campus-everything from the names of buildings to the 12-foot-tall Tiffany stained-glass window depicting the University Greys, the students who fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War (all of whom were killed or wounded in combat). It was, in many ways, a massive victory for the Black students and faculty who had long been fighting for a more inclusive, reflective campus. \"Ole Miss,\" though, was not even mentioned in this report.\n\n\"Those efforts for change have always registered to me as symbolism, surface level, more than tangible, material, structural,\" Foster says.\n\nPart of this may be because if the University of Mississippi is a formal name, \"Ole Miss\" conveys a powerful emotion-and a lucrative brand. As Hudson put it to me, \"We have not moved on from [Ole Miss] because of capitalism...they're making money off of that.\" Forbes estimates that the annual revenue-over an average of three years-brought in from the \"Ole Miss\" football program alone is $84 million, making it one of the top 25 most lucrative college teams in the country. In 2016, the school expanded Vaught-Hemingway Stadium to hold 64,038 football fans; it is now the largest stadium in Mississippi.\n\nStill, grassroots efforts to change the name have come in small fits and starts over the years, though the overall conversation has lacked the urgency that has toppled other Confederate symbols. And when it has come up, it has typically inspired only lukewarm response. Torie Marion White, who serves as an assistant director at the Ole Miss Alumni Association, overseeing alumni relations for the School of Applied Science and the School of Engineering, as well as the Black Alumni Advisory Council and the Grove Society, tells Mother Jones that several of her fellow Black alums have taken to referring to the school as \"New Miss,\" she says, creating T-shirts and tumblers with their moniker featured in place of the old.

      "text": "The Border Patrol Is an Engine of Crisis-and Has Been Since the Beginning\n\nTim Murphy May 28, 2024\n\nIt took 100 years for Congress to enact major immigration restrictions. It took another 50 to create the Border Patrol. Lennox McLendon/AP\n\nIt took 100 years for Congress to enact major immigration restrictions. It took another 50 to create the Border Patrol. Lennox McLendon/AP\n\nFor our September+October issue , we investigated the Border Patrol's sharp growth, its troubling record on civil liberties, its culture of impunity, and its role in shaping the current political moment-one that echoes the anti-immigrant fever that led to the agency's creation a century ago. Read the whole package here .\n\nThe National Border Patrol Museum , which sits inside a squat building on a decommissioned bombing range on the edge of El Paso's Franklin Mountains, has a musty and scattershot feel, as if one of America's most troubled law enforcement agencies has just emptied its pockets at the end of a long, hard century.\n\nSeized and donated artifacts fill every available nook-a hang glider and DIY motorcycles used to haul drugs; a collection of ladders and climbing ropes for scaling fences. There is riot gear belonging to the Border Patrol agents who, deputized as US Marshals, helped James Meredith integrate the University of Mississippi. Near the entrance, looking a little lost, is a miniature Statue of Liberty that once belonged to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The museum, which is privately operated but enjoys a close relationship with the agency, is the final resting place of both Rocky, the drug-sniffing dog, and a remote-controlled robot called \"R.A.D.\"-short for \" Robot Against Drugs \"-that was introduced to schools in 1988. R.A.D. carried a squirt gun in its holster \"to teach children not to play with guns\"; it could also turn into a walk signal.\n\nTaken together, the museum's exhibits and ephemera tell a simple story-of rugged, honorable men holding the line against disorder. Here, border security and immigration have been flattened into a binary of perps and heroes, and the agency absorbed into a kind of law-and-order monoculture. At the gift shop, alongside shot glasses embedded with bullets, you can buy a T-shirt with the \"Thin Green Line\" motif overlaid on the logo of Punisher -the serial-killing Marvel vigilante-or emblazoned on a Star Wars stormtrooper.\n\nOn the day I visited, an ex-agent-turned-influencer had stopped by to show off a new, promotional gun. The line of \" 100th anniversary Tribute edition \" rifles, available to active-duty or retired members for as little as $800, were a \"token of support,\" according to the Henry firearms company, for an agency on the front lines of an \"ongoing national security border crisis.\"\n\nThe story of the Border Patrol's founding offers a lesson for the century that followed, and a rejoinder to the agency's modern myth: Chaos is not just the absence of a border; it is also the consequence of trying to maintain one.\n\nThis image of the Border Patrol as a bulwark against anarchy is central to its identity. \"If you don't have a border, you don't have a country,\" former President Donald Trump often tells supporters. But we have not always had a Border Patrol. For much of the country's existence, the southwestern border was guarded sporadically. Well into the 20th century it was hardly demarcated at all. Almost no one was searching for unauthorized immigrants because relatively few people were barred from entering. That dearth of rules at the federal level instilled a certain kind of order-when you can cross at a port, there is no need to die in the desert. It took nearly 100 years for the United States to pass its first major federal immigration restrictions. It was another half-century before there was a permanent force dedicated to policing them on the international boundary. Someone had to create it. His name was Claude Benton Hudspeth.\n\nThe efforts of a mostly forgotten rancher-turned-congressman from West Texas are worth reckoning with today because the debates on immigration and border policing from a century ago never ended. The Border Patrol was born out of migrant panics, drug wars, and clashes between saber-rattling states and the federal government. It was an era of mass deportations, suspensions of civil liberties, vigilante murders, and calls for an invasion of Mexico. The agency, and the landmark immigration-reform bill that nudged it into existence in May 1924, were backed by eugenicist politicians who feared a Great Replacement by \"undesirable\" immigrants. The story of the Border Patrol's founding offers a lesson for the century that followed, and a rejoinder to the agency's modern myth: Chaos is not just the absence of a border; it is also the consequence of trying to maintain one.\n\nTo his contemporaries, Hudspeth was a kind of living relic, a \" cowboy statesman \" with less than a year of formal schooling who walked with a limp for most of his life on account of a steer-roping accident in his youth. He campaigned for office atop a pony named Sitting Bull and once took leave from Congress to lead a herd of Herefords several hundred miles across West Texas to a newly acquired ranch. As he rose to become one of the most powerful men in the state, that background served as more than political window dressing. It formed the backbone of his politics.\n\nThe son of a county sheriff, Hudspeth spent his formative years running sheep and cattle on South and West Texas ranches that had, in recent memory, been violently wrested from Mexicans and Indigenous peoples. A sense of deadly disorder lurking across the line was instilled early. During a 1919 floor speech calling for a military occupation of Mexico, Hudspeth described riding across the Rio Grande with \"peace officers\" as a boy to retrieve stolen livestock. When he was 19, in 1896, in an episode that seems ripped from a John Ford movie, he and a brother assembled a crew and rode hundreds of miles to Ciudad Juarez to spring their half brother from jail. They claimed he was unjustly imprisoned; the evidence suggests he had a penchant for cattle rustling.\n\nAt the time, crossing the river to stage a jailbreak was just a thing you could do. The border of Hudspeth's youth bore little resemblance to the militarized surveillance state of today. The federal government had only begun to seriously restrict voluntary immigration in 1875, when it barred Chinese contract laborers and women \"imported for the purposes of prostitution\" from entering the country. As late as 1891, Harvard University professor Erika Lee writes in her history of Chinese exclusion, At America's Gates , the California-Mexico border was patrolled by exactly three customs agents , whose primary focus was livestock. Alcohol was legal, and the federal government interfered little in the day-to-day comings and goings of many borderlands residents. There was no such thing as unlawful entry. Except for the Chinese, who were forced to present detailed paperwork upon their arrival, no one even needed passports.\n\nAs late as 1891, the California-Mexico border was patrolled by exactly three customs agents, whose primary focus was livestock.\n\nThis border was permeable, but the idea that it was \"open\" is also a myth, says University of Virginia historian S. Deborah Kang . In the absence of a large federal immigration bureaucracy, Kang notes, states and territories imposed their own rules, deporting undesirable Irish and restricting the movement of African Americans; the 1881 Chinese Exclusion Act-which banned almost all Chinese, not just contract laborers and \"immoral\" women-was passed only after California spent years attempting to accomplish the same thing. The US Army, whose far-flung units were sometimes referred to as a \"border patrol,\" powered white expansion by invading Mexico (on the pretext of defending a disputed boundary) and waging genocide against Native Americans. \"And then on top of that, you have a lot of private violence or vigilante violence being deployed by settlers in that region,\" Kang says. \"Today, historians all see those forms of policing, whether public or private, as forms of border policing.\"\n\nIn Texas, complaints that the federal government wasn't doing enough to secure its border were foundational. The state had even cited Washington's failure to secure the border \"against the Indian savages\" and \"the murderous forays of banditti from neighboring Mexico\" in its 1861 articles of secession. By the time Hudspeth arrived in Austin in 1906, as a state senator representing 800 miles of the Rio Grande, a few dozen of the state's most infamous lawmen had assumed much of the responsibility for patrolling the boundary. The Texas Rangers had been formed to keep enslaved people in and Indigenous peoples out. Hudspeth had briefly served with the Rangers, and he saw its members as the embodiment of what a border police force could be.\n\nHudspeth spent his first years in office on matters of hyperlocal concern, pushing a bounty on wolf pelts and a ban on competitive cattle-roping. But the start of the Mexican Revolution in 1910 brought the interests of fellow ranchers and white borderlands residents to the forefront of state and national politics. At first, the dynamic on the border was inverted-federal troops tried to prevent Mexicans from leaving the United States to foment insurrection back home. But as refugees and raiding parties began heading north, white Texans demanded a more militant defense of their property.\n\nJust like their antebellum predecessors, Democrats in the state now rewrote their platform to demand the government protect them from \"depredations by marauders from Mexico.\" And much like Gov. Greg Abbott today, Texas' actions were openly belligerent-feuding with Washington and threatening violence against Mexicans on both sides of the river. Hudspeth called for military intervention against the \" lawless, howling mob \" running Mexico and more funding for the men patrolling the border. Texas pushed to triple the size of the Ranger force and demanded President William Howard Taft pay for it . At one point after the state mobilized its National Guard, according to the historians Charles Harris and Louis Sadler, the War Department feared that Texas was actually going to invade Mexico.\n\n\"If the federal government does not protect the border with troops,\" Gov. Oscar Colquitt said in 1913, \"the state of Texas will.\"\n\nMexican revolutionary Pancho Villa's 1916 attack on Columbus, New Mexico, followed a year later by the United States' entry into World War I, injected urgency and resources into the situation. Fearing a Mexican alliance with Germany, and a full-scale invasion of the Southwest, President Woodrow Wilson's administration sent more than 100,000 soldiers to the border and dispatched scores of immigration agents and intelligence officers to watch for subversives-namely, German spies, Bolsheviks, and anarchists. In Arizona, a sheriff conducted a mass deportation of 1,000 striking mineworkers-many of them Mexican nationals-citing their support from the International Workers of the World and fears that they were allied with Villa. Meanwhile, Texas' state government decided to build the border force it always wanted. In April 1917, Hudspeth pushed through a bill allocating $250,000 for 1,000 new Rangers, and an expanded National Guard. At his request, the state even created a special Ranger company, composed of ranch hands in his district. They were called the Hudspeth Scouts.\n\nThis was border policing as Texas had always practiced it, less a matter of a line on a map than of identity and power.\n\nFor Hudspeth, by now one of the state's biggest ranchers, the unrest on the border was personal. Several of his constituents had been killed during \"bandit\" raids, including an old friend from his cowboy days. Rangers had been posted to his land. It was, undeniably, a dangerous time to run a ranch in the borderlands. But the Rangers protected the livestock and lives of white Texans by killing a lot of people and trampling the rights of those of Mexican descent. This was border policing as Texas had always practiced it , less a matter of a line on a map than of identity and power. Rangers seized firearms from Hispanic citizens. They shut down newspapers. In 1918 at Porvenir , a remote Rio Grande village in Hudspeth's district, a force of Rangers, local ranchers, and U.S Cavalry, lined up 15 men and boys in the middle of the night and shot them.\n\nWhen the legislature convened hearings on the Rangers' brutality in 1919, Hudspeth, who was about to go to Washington as a newly elected member of Congress, stopped in Austin to defend the force.\n\n\"You cannot handle those Mexicans with kid gloves, not when they come 12 miles below El Paso and steal a milch cow every night or two,\" he said. His prescription was simple : \"You have got to kill those Mexicans where you find them.\" The Porvenir massacre, he claimed-in defiance of the facts-was the work of honest lawmen and \"good citizens\" who were simply protecting their property.\n\nHudspeth was playing a familiar part. He was, in a sense, the original Beleaguered Rancher of contemporary newscasts-sunburnt and sober, defending not just his property but, he intimated, the civilization that people like him had clawed out of the brush. (How they had clawed it away was not a matter to dwell on.) His constituents talked of moving their ranches 100 miles inland and sending their families away for safety. Without the Rangers, Hudspeth argued, the entire region might as well be ceded to the Mexicans. Increasingly, he and many others with far different backgrounds were starting to insist that if you didn't have a patrol, you couldn't really have a border.\n\nWhile Texas was taking matters into its own hands, Hudspeth arrived that spring at a Capitol that was preparing to tackle the border crisis head-on. In response to the Mexican Revolution and the Great War, Washington had shifted into overdrive to protect itself against the threat of an actual invading army. Now, a group of Democrats and Republicans wanted to go much further. The \"invasion\" they feared wasn't from soldiers or cattle thieves. It was from immigrants.\n\nThere had long been rumblings that the federal system for detecting the \"surreptitious\" entry of people was insufficient. Difficulties enforcing the Chinese Exclusion Act had led to the creation, in 1904, of a small Mounted Guard whose members were known as \"Chinese Inspectors.\" By 1914, the US Immigration Service argued that \"contraband traffic and illegal entry of aliens can only be broken up by a general and complete organization of border patrol.\" A few years later, Frank Berkshire, a Chinese Inspector in El Paso, suggested an official \"Border Patrol\" agency modeled on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\nThe problem that Berkshire-and Congress-faced was one they have struggled with ever since: New legal regimes create new illegal ones. In the runup to World War I, the government began imposing literacy tests on new arrivals, and raised the mandatory head tax. It caved to nativist pressures and began subjecting Mexicans who came across at certain ports of entry to invasive and degrading fumigations. Excluded people (a growing list that now included, among others, the entire \"Asiatic Zone,\" anarchists, prostitutes, people who were \"likely to become a public charge,\" and people who were illiterate), or those who wanted to avoid the hassle, began circumventing ports of entry in increasing numbers, often with the help of professional smugglers.\n\nThe problem that Berkshire-and now Congress-faced was one they have struggled with ever since: New legal regimes create new illegal ones.\n\nIn DC, Hudspeth hit the ground running. Along with a Democratic senator from Texas, he proposed an appropriation of about $250,000 to create a \"division of border patrol\" within the Immigration Service.\n\nThe new wartime immigration inspectors had been furloughed after the end of the war. Now, \"Chinese, Japanese, Mexican outlaws and immoral women are coming across the border by the dozens,\" he said at an immigration committee hearing in 1919. Hudspeth claimed that between \"3,000 and 5,000 undesirables\" had crossed in just three months. \"Mexico does not cooperate with the United States to keep out the undesirables but secretly connives with them to come into this country.\" They're not sending their best , it turns out, is not an original talking point either.\n\nThe effort was tabled, but he kept at it. \"I have a resolution before this committee, as you gentlemen know, to establish and to reinforce the border patrol in Texas,\" Hudspeth told the committee in 1920. \"Why? To keep out the Jap and to keep out the Chinaman...I stand here today ready to urge that resolution, because, Mr. Chairman, I stand for law and order and I have stood for it all my life.\" He would do everything he could, he said, \"to keep the 'wetback'...from coming across.\"\n\nA colleague asked Hudspeth if the Rangers who currently served on the border could pass a civil service exam.\n\n\"If the test was right in shooting, I know they could stand it,\" he said. \"They would get 100 percent.\"\n\nHudspeth, who decried the federal government's plan to roll back its troop presence on the border, was not the only one talking seriously about a more robust operation. In the Senate, another border lawmaker, Sen. Henry Ashurst (D-Ariz.), pushed a proposal for increased Army patrols, while at the same time calling for parts of Mexico to be annexed . Sen. James Phelan (D-Calif.) led a more pointed charge for increased funding for an immigration border guard. A former mayor of San Francisco who had run for office on the slogan \" Keep California White ,\" Phelan believed the country faced demographic death.\n\n\"If we can stop Japanese immigration absolutely and guard our borders...the white man will have a chance to regather his strength and occupy the soil,\" he declared at a 1919 hearing.\n\nHis colleagues were largely sympathetic to Hudspeth's efforts. \"We realize the menace that exists in permitting the Texas-Mexico border to be free to radicals and Reds and we intend to protect this border,\" a committee member reassured the Texan in 1919. But the proposal languished. Budgets were tight and provincialism was strong. Some congressmen wanted to focus on Ellis Island instead-most immigrants, after all, arrived at ports. Even proponents of the idea acknowledged that trying to stop everyone might prove impossible.\n\n\"I do not want to be understood as assuming that we can make that border watertight,\" Anthony Caminetti, the US immigration commissioner-and a former member, Lee notes in At America's Gate s, of a California white supremacist group that was later known as the Order of Caucasians- testified in 1919 , while asking for money for more immigration agents. \"We cannot do it. It would cost too much money.\"\n\nFor Hudspeth's dream to become a reality, Congress would have to settle a larger debate, about whom a Border Patrol should stop.\n\nAt the same time Hudspeth was beating his Border Patrol drum, he was pushing to ease restrictions on a particular group of border crossers. His constituents may have been fed up with Mexican smugglers and bandits, but in 1919 they were desperate for cheap labor. Hudspeth, who spent much of his time in Washington micromanaging his livestock and pecan operations, considered the head tax and literacy test too onerous for Mexican farmhands. He repeatedly pushed Congress and the White House to suspend its regulations. To Hudspeth, this was a matter of simple economic sense-even if he considered Mexicans \" an inferior race .\"\n\nBut when Hudspeth appeared before the immigration committee to make his case, he faced serious resistance. Republican Rep. Hays White of Kansas warned that Mexicans would bring an \"evil philosophy against capital and property\"-that is, communism. Another Republican, Colorado Rep. William Vaile, worried that the move would sacrifice \" race integrity .\" \"They are wretched, lawless, poor criminal devils that do not know how to keep within the law,\" said John Box , an East Texas Democrat, who argued that politicians were using Mexican and noncitizen voters to rig elections.\n\nThe committee's Republican chairman, Albert Johnson of Washington, captured the spirit of the House: \"Is it not time for the United States to look upon every outsider with suspicion?\" he asked Hudspeth.\n\nJohnson and many of his peers believed the answer was yes. Rather than relaxing rules, they wanted to tighten them. There was no secret about why: Johnson, like many of his colleagues, despised Southern and Eastern Europeans and was deeply antisemitic . He and his allies proposed a new quota system to restrict immigration by tying the number of people admitted from each country to that nationality's representation in the 1890 Census-before the surge in migration from the targeted areas. His immigration committee even hired an in-house Eugenics Expert Agent -a proponent of mass sterilization who believed that Jews were \"filthy, un-American, and often dangerous in their habits.\"\n\n\"Is it not time for the United States to look upon every outsider with suspicion?\" asked the immigration committee's Republican chairman.\n\nWhile Johnson had resisted Hudspeth's efforts to loosen restrictions on Mexicans entering the country for seasonal work, it was the chairman's 1924 National Origins Act that finally pushed the Border Patrol over the finish line. The law slashed non-Western European migration and practically zeroed out emigration from Asia but exempted the Western Hemisphere. The interests of farmers and ranchers like Hudspeth ultimately prevailed over the wishes of people like Box and West Virginia Democratic Sen. Matthew Neely (who stated that \"we shall have delivered all of our priceless heritage to foreign invaders\"). Agribusiness wouldn't stand for a restriction that would threaten their labor supply, and politicians argued that extending the quotas would jeopardize diplomatic relationships. Even some of the eugenicists had to admit that attempting to keep out people who share a border would be too big of a lift.\n\nNativists \"were absolutely livid that Congress didn't pass any outright restrictions on Mexicans,\" says Kang, the UVA professor. \"Congress compromised and said, 'Look, we'll create the Border Patrol so we can control Mexican migration and make sure their migration is a temporary one.'\"\n\nThe National Origins Act included a clause specifically authorizing the appropriation of funds for its enforcement, and with that in hand, Johnson and Hudspeth introduced competing Border Patrol appropriations into an omnibus spending package working its way through the House. This time they found an ally in Box, who argued in a brief speech defending the measure that a new force was needed to keep \" vicious and undesirable \" immigrants from crossing the Mexican border-and falsely asserted that the previously deported anarchist Emma Goldman had recently \"entered in that way.\" Hudspeth's amendment, which asked for more money, ultimately prevailed. But in a reminder of the history of exclusion underpinning the effort, the chairman first had to amend the bill's language to say \"aliens\" instead of just \"Chinese.\"\n\nIn the runup to the final passage, media accounts depicted a crisis. Mexicans were \" massing on the border ,\" one Texas newspaper reported. A wire service story in late May 1924 read like early border agitprop, featuring photos of immigration inspectors in action, hiding in the brush with their weapons ready. \"Two aliens were found under the pile of sacks in this wagon after it crossed the American border,\" one caption read. Another photo featured what looked like staged footage of \"federal authorities\" engaged in a shootout with \"Chinese smugglers\" on the Arizona border.\n\nIn the run-up to the final passage, media accounts depicted a crisis. Mexicans were \"massing on the border,\" one Texas newspaper reported.\n\n\"They are doing what they can,\" the story announced. \"But the job is too big. Passage of the Hudspeth appropriation bill, now pending in Congress, is their only hope.\" The package became law the next day, on May 28, 1924.\n\nThe Border Patrol was a new idea that bore the distinct imprint of the past. To fill its roster, the force relied on the institutions that had been policing the color line for years. In Migra! A History of the U.S. Border Patrol , historian Kelly Lytle Hernández found that many of the first recruits were drawn from the Texas Rangers. The director of the sector that included Laredo, William Hanson , was an ex-Ranger captain who had spied on Black political dissidents, smuggled guns to Mexican counterrevolutionaries, and fanned fears of an armed invasion of Texas. For its part, the Border Patrol today considers Berkshire its \" Father \"-the unit's early ranks were filled, too, with ex-Chinese Inspectors like him.\n\nBut in their haste to authorize the force, Hudspeth and his colleagues had neglected to give it anything to do. At first, agents didn't even have the authority to arrest anyone. No sooner had the first agents donned their forest green uniforms than the calls began again. The border guard needed more power, more men, and more funding. Congress meant to solve a problem. It only created bigger ones.\n\nFor someone whose handiwork is foundational to American politics today, Hudspeth is largely anonymous. The Border Patrol Museum makes no mention of the force's first political patron, just as it steers clear of the period of state violence that preceded the unit's creation and the eugenicist nature of the debates from which it finally emerged. Hudspeth's obituaries upon his death in 1941 skipped right over his role in creating the agency. It is possible he simply never envisioned its full significance; his papers at the University of Texas at El Paso-another institution he helped found-include nary a reference to his role in establishing what is now a sprawling force of nearly 20,000 people.\n\nBut there is one monument to his legacy. When Hudspeth was only 39, in the middle of his push for the Ranger bill, his colleagues honored him with a gift: They named a county for him-a remote patch of West Texas that today is home to some 3,400 people in an area more than twice the size of Delaware. The county is a destination not just for millions of dollars of state and federal funds, but for right-wing border cosplayers . In 2011, Steven Seagal was sworn in as a sheriff's deputy. Hudspeth's historic marker sits on a sunbaked rest area off I-10. You can't miss it; it's the last stop before the Border Patrol checkpoint.\n\nHudspeth's obituaries upon his death in 1941 skipped right over his role in creating the Border Patrol. It is possible he simply never envisioned its full significance.\n\nIn recent years, as walls and patrol strategies pushed migrants into ever more hostile corridors, Hudspeth County has seen an unprecedented surge in apprehensions and deaths. One of the biggest employers outside the BP is the West Texas Detention Center, part of the region's booming migrant-jail economy. In 2022, the now-former warden at one of those detention centers was released on bond with his brother after allegedly killing a man from Mexico who stopped to drink from a small pond. \" They are good guys ,\" the sheriff told the New York Times .\n\nHudspeth did not begin this process; he merely did his part to keep it going. The work could never be finished. Which was why, in February 1925, less than a year after his force was established, Hudspeth returned to the House Appropriations Committee with another proposal. He began, in earnest, to discuss a new problem facing the ranchers and lawmen of his district. East of El Paso, the river had jumped its channel years ago and left pockets of Mexican territory north of the Rio Grande. Now, with Prohibition in effect, the area was overrun by smugglers. The Border Patrol was outgunned. \"In the last two years we have had something like 20 government officials murdered there,\" he testified. Hudspeth was asking for $30,000 to settle the problem.\n\n\"What is it you want?\" a committee member asked.\n\n\"I want a fence,\" Hudspeth replied.\n\nRead the rest of our Border Patrol investigation here .\n\nCredits from left: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty,  Lennox McLendon/AP, Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty , Library of Congress/Wikimedia\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Border Patrol Is an Engine of Crisis-and Has Been Since the Beginning\n\nTim Murphy May 28, 2024\n\nIt took 100 years for Congress to enact major immigration restrictions. It took another 50 to create the Border Patrol. Lennox McLendon/AP\n\nIt took 100 years for Congress to enact major immigration restrictions. It took another 50 to create the Border Patrol. Lennox McLendon/AP\n\nFor our September+October issue , we investigated the Border Patrol's sharp growth, its troubling record on civil liberties, its culture of impunity, and its role in shaping the current political moment-one that echoes the anti-immigrant fever that led to the agency's creation a century ago. Read the whole package here .\n\nThe National Border Patrol Museum , which sits inside a squat building on a decommissioned bombing range on the edge of El Paso's Franklin Mountains, has a musty and scattershot feel, as if one of America's most troubled law enforcement agencies has just emptied its pockets at the end of a long, hard century.\n\nSeized and donated artifacts fill every available nook-a hang glider and DIY motorcycles used to haul drugs; a collection of ladders and climbing ropes for scaling fences. There is riot gear belonging to the Border Patrol agents who, deputized as US Marshals, helped James Meredith integrate the University of Mississippi. Near the entrance, looking a little lost, is a miniature Statue of Liberty that once belonged to the Immigration and Naturalization Service. The museum, which is privately operated but enjoys a close relationship with the agency, is the final resting place of both Rocky, the drug-sniffing dog, and a remote-controlled robot called \"R.A.D.\"-short for \" Robot Against Drugs \"-that was introduced to schools in 1988. R.A.D. carried a squirt gun in its holster \"to teach children not to play with guns\"; it could also turn into a walk signal.\n\nTaken together, the museum's exhibits and ephemera tell a simple story-of rugged, honorable men holding the line against disorder. Here, border security and immigration have been flattened into a binary of perps and heroes, and the agency absorbed into a kind of law-and-order monoculture. At the gift shop, alongside shot glasses embedded with bullets, you can buy a T-shirt with the \"Thin Green Line\" motif overlaid on the logo of Punisher -the serial-killing Marvel vigilante-or emblazoned on a Star Wars stormtrooper.\n\nOn the day I visited, an ex-agent-turned-influencer had stopped by to show off a new, promotional gun. The line of \" 100th anniversary Tribute edition \" rifles, available to active-duty or retired members for as little as $800, were a \"token of support,\" according to the Henry firearms company, for an agency on the front lines of an \"ongoing national security border crisis.\"\n\nThe story of the Border Patrol's founding offers a lesson for the century that followed, and a rejoinder to the agency's modern myth: Chaos is not just the absence of a border; it is also the consequence of trying to maintain one.\n\nThis image of the Border Patrol as a bulwark against anarchy is central to its identity. \"If you don't have a border, you don't have a country,\" former President Donald Trump often tells supporters. But we have not always had a Border Patrol. For much of the country's existence, the southwestern border was guarded sporadically. Well into the 20th century it was hardly demarcated at all. Almost no one was searching for unauthorized immigrants because relatively few people were barred from entering. That dearth of rules at the federal level instilled a certain kind of order-when you can cross at a port, there is no need to die in the desert. It took nearly 100 years for the United States to pass its first major federal immigration restrictions. It was another half-century before there was a permanent force dedicated to policing them on the international boundary. Someone had to create it. His name was Claude Benton Hudspeth.\n\nThe efforts of a mostly forgotten rancher-turned-congressman from West Texas are worth reckoning with today because the debates on immigration and border policing from a century ago never ended. The Border Patrol was born out of migrant panics, drug wars, and clashes between saber-rattling states and the federal government. It was an era of mass deportations, suspensions of civil liberties, vigilante murders, and calls for an invasion of Mexico. The agency, and the landmark immigration-reform bill that nudged it into existence in May 1924, were backed by eugenicist politicians who feared a Great Replacement by \"undesirable\" immigrants. The story of the Border Patrol's founding offers a lesson for the century that followed, and a rejoinder to the agency's modern myth: Chaos is not just the absence of a border; it is also the consequence of trying to maintain one.\n\nTo his contemporaries, Hudspeth was a kind of living relic, a \" cowboy statesman \" with less than a year of formal schooling who walked with a limp for most of his life on account of a steer-roping accident in his youth. He campaigned for office atop a pony named Sitting Bull and once took leave from Congress to lead a herd of Herefords several hundred miles across West Texas to a newly acquired ranch. As he rose to become one of the most powerful men in the state, that background served as more than political window dressing. It formed the backbone of his politics.\n\nThe son of a county sheriff, Hudspeth spent his formative years running sheep and cattle on South and West Texas ranches that had, in recent memory, been violently wrested from Mexicans and Indigenous peoples. A sense of deadly disorder lurking across the line was instilled early. During a 1919 floor speech calling for a military occupation of Mexico, Hudspeth described riding across the Rio Grande with \"peace officers\" as a boy to retrieve stolen livestock. When he was 19, in 1896, in an episode that seems ripped from a John Ford movie, he and a brother assembled a crew and rode hundreds of miles to Ciudad Juarez to spring their half brother from jail. They claimed he was unjustly imprisoned; the evidence suggests he had a penchant for cattle rustling.\n\nAt the time, crossing the river to stage a jailbreak was just a thing you could do. The border of Hudspeth's youth bore little resemblance to the militarized surveillance state of today. The federal government had only begun to seriously restrict voluntary immigration in 1875, when it barred Chinese contract laborers and women \"imported for the purposes of prostitution\" from entering the country. As late as 1891, Harvard University professor Erika Lee writes in her history of Chinese exclusion, At America's Gates , the California-Mexico border was patrolled by exactly three customs agents , whose primary focus was livestock. Alcohol was legal, and the federal government interfered little in the day-to-day comings and goings of many borderlands residents. There was no such thing as unlawful entry. Except for the Chinese, who were forced to present detailed paperwork upon their arrival, no one even needed passports.\n\nAs late as 1891, the California-Mexico border was patrolled by exactly three customs agents, whose primary focus was livestock.\n\nThis border was permeable, but the idea that it was \"open\" is also a myth, says University of Virginia historian S. Deborah Kang . In the absence of a large federal immigration bureaucracy, Kang notes, states and territories imposed their own rules, deporting undesirable Irish and restricting the movement of African Americans; the 1881 Chinese Exclusion Act-which banned almost all Chinese, not just contract laborers and \"immoral\" women-was passed only after California spent years attempting to accomplish the same thing. The US Army, whose far-flung units were sometimes referred to as a \"border patrol,\" powered white expansion by invading Mexico (on the pretext of defending a disputed boundary) and waging genocide against Native Americans. \"And then on top of that, you have a lot of private violence or vigilante violence being deployed by settlers in that region,\" Kang says. \"Today, historians all see those forms of policing, whether public or private, as forms of border policing.\"\n\nIn Texas, complaints that the federal government wasn't doing enough to secure its border were foundational. The state had even cited Washington's failure to secure the border \"against the Indian savages\" and \"the murderous forays of banditti from neighboring Mexico\" in its 1861 articles of secession. By the time Hudspeth arrived in Austin in 1906, as a state senator representing 800 miles of the Rio Grande, a few dozen of the state's most infamous lawmen had assumed much of the responsibility for patrolling the boundary. The Texas Rangers had been formed to keep enslaved people in and Indigenous peoples out. Hudspeth had briefly served with the Rangers, and he saw its members as the embodiment of what a border police force could be.\n\nHudspeth spent his first years in office on matters of hyperlocal concern, pushing a bounty on wolf pelts and a ban on competitive cattle-roping. But the start of the Mexican Revolution in 1910 brought the interests of fellow ranchers and white borderlands residents to the forefront of state and national politics. At first, the dynamic on the border was inverted-federal troops tried to prevent Mexicans from leaving the United States to foment insurrection back home. But as refugees and raiding parties began heading north, white Texans demanded a more militant defense of their property.\n\nJust like their antebellum predecessors, Democrats in the state now rewrote their platform to demand the government protect them from \"depredations by marauders from Mexico.\" And much like Gov. Greg Abbott today, Texas' actions were openly belligerent-feuding with Washington and threatening violence against Mexicans on both sides of the river. Hudspeth called for military intervention against the \" lawless, howling mob \" running Mexico and more funding for the men patrolling the border. Texas pushed to triple the size of the Ranger force and demanded President William Howard Taft pay for it . At one point after the state mobilized its National Guard, according to the historians Charles Harris and Louis Sadler, the War Department feared that Texas was actually going to invade Mexico.\n\n\"If the federal government does not protect the border with troops,\" Gov. Oscar Colquitt said in 1913, \"the state of Texas will.\"\n\nMexican revolutionary Pancho Villa's 1916 attack on Columbus, New Mexico, followed a year later by the United States' entry into World War I, injected urgency and resources into the situation. Fearing a Mexican alliance with Germany, and a full-scale invasion of the Southwest, President Woodrow Wilson's administration sent more than 100,000 soldiers to the border and dispatched scores of immigration agents and intelligence officers to watch for subversives-namely, German spies, Bolsheviks, and anarchists. In Arizona, a sheriff conducted a mass deportation of 1,000 striking mineworkers-many of them Mexican nationals-citing their support from the International Workers of the World and fears that they were allied with Villa. Meanwhile, Texas' state government decided to build the border force it always wanted. In April 1917, Hudspeth pushed through a bill allocating $250,000 for 1,000 new Rangers, and an expanded National Guard. At his request, the state even created a special Ranger company, composed of ranch hands in his district. They were called the Hudspeth Scouts.\n\nThis was border policing as Texas had always practiced it, less a matter of a line on a map than of identity and power.\n\nFor Hudspeth, by now one of the state's biggest ranchers, the unrest on the border was personal. Several of his constituents had been killed during \"bandit\" raids, including an old friend from his cowboy days. Rangers had been posted to his land. It was, undeniably, a dangerous time to run a ranch in the borderlands. But the Rangers protected the livestock and lives of white Texans by killing a lot of people and trampling the rights of those of Mexican descent. This was border policing as Texas had always practiced it , less a matter of a line on a map than of identity and power. Rangers seized firearms from Hispanic citizens. They shut down newspapers. In 1918 at Porvenir , a remote Rio Grande village in Hudspeth's district, a force of Rangers, local ranchers, and U.S Cavalry, lined up 15 men and boys in the middle of the night and shot them.\n\nWhen the legislature convened hearings on the Rangers' brutality in 1919, Hudspeth, who was about to go to Washington as a newly elected member of Congress, stopped in Austin to defend the force.\n\n\"You cannot handle those Mexicans with kid gloves, not when they come 12 miles below El Paso and steal a milch cow every night or two,\" he said. His prescription was simple : \"You have got to kill those Mexicans where you find them.\" The Porvenir massacre, he claimed-in defiance of the facts-was the work of honest lawmen and \"good citizens\" who were simply protecting their property.\n\nHudspeth was playing a familiar part. He was, in a sense, the original Beleaguered Rancher of contemporary newscasts-sunburnt and sober, defending not just his property but, he intimated, the civilization that people like him had clawed out of the brush. (How they had clawed it away was not a matter to dwell on.) His constituents talked of moving their ranches 100 miles inland and sending their families away for safety. Without the Rangers, Hudspeth argued, the entire region might as well be ceded to the Mexicans. Increasingly, he and many others with far different backgrounds were starting to insist that if you didn't have a patrol, you couldn't really have a border.\n\nWhile Texas was taking matters into its own hands, Hudspeth arrived that spring at a Capitol that was preparing to tackle the border crisis head-on. In response to the Mexican Revolution and the Great War, Washington had shifted into overdrive to protect itself against the threat of an actual invading army. Now, a group of Democrats and Republicans wanted to go much further. The \"invasion\" they feared wasn't from soldiers or cattle thieves. It was from immigrants.\n\nThere had long been rumblings that the federal system for detecting the \"surreptitious\" entry of people was insufficient. Difficulties enforcing the Chinese Exclusion Act had led to the creation, in 1904, of a small Mounted Guard whose members were known as \"Chinese Inspectors.\" By 1914, the US Immigration Service argued that \"contraband traffic and illegal entry of aliens can only be broken up by a general and complete organization of border patrol.\" A few years later, Frank Berkshire, a Chinese Inspector in El Paso, suggested an official \"Border Patrol\" agency modeled on the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.\n\nThe problem that Berkshire-and Congress-faced was one they have struggled with ever since: New legal regimes create new illegal ones. In the runup to World War I, the government began imposing literacy tests on new arrivals, and raised the mandatory head tax. It caved to nativist pressures and began subjecting Mexicans who came across at certain ports of entry to invasive and degrading fumigations. Excluded people (a growing list that now included, among others, the entire \"Asiatic Zone,\" anarchists, prostitutes, people who were \"likely to become a public charge,\" and people who were illiterate), or those who wanted to avoid the hassle, began circumventing ports of entry in increasing numbers, often with the help of professional smugglers.\n\nThe problem that Berkshire-and now Congress-faced was one they have struggled with ever since: New legal regimes create new illegal ones.\n\nIn DC, Hudspeth hit the ground running. Along with a Democratic senator from Texas, he proposed an appropriation of about $250,000 to create a \"division of border patrol\" within the Immigration Service.\n\nThe new wartime immigration inspectors had been furloughed after the end of the war. Now, \"Chinese, Japanese, Mexican outlaws and immoral women are coming across the border by the dozens,\" he said at an immigration committee hearing in 1919. Hudspeth claimed that between \"3,000 and 5,000 undesirables\" had crossed in just three months. \"Mexico does not cooperate with the United States to keep out the undesirables but secretly connives with them to come into this country.\" They're not sending their best , it turns out, is not an original talking point either.\n\nThe effort was tabled, but he kept at it. \"I have a resolution before this committee, as you gentlemen know, to establish and to reinforce the border patrol in Texas,\" Hudspeth told the committee in 1920. \"Why? To keep out the Jap and to keep out the Chinaman...I stand here today ready to urge that resolution, because, Mr. Chairman, I stand for law and order and I have stood for it all my life.\" He would do everything he could, he said, \"to keep the 'wetback'...from coming across.\"\n\nA colleague asked Hudspeth if the Rangers who currently served on the border could pass a civil service exam.\n\n\"If the test was right in shooting, I know they could stand it,\" he said. \"They would get 100 percent.\"\n\nHudspeth, who decried the federal government's plan to roll back its troop presence on the border, was not the only one talking seriously about a more robust operation. In the Senate, another border lawmaker, Sen. Henry Ashurst (D-Ariz.), pushed a proposal for increased Army patrols, while at the same time calling for parts of Mexico to be annexed . Sen. James Phelan (D-Calif.) led a more pointed charge for increased funding for an immigration border guard. A former mayor of San Francisco who had run for office on the slogan \" Keep California White ,\" Phelan believed the country faced demographic death.\n\n\"If we can stop Japanese immigration absolutely and guard our borders...the white man will have a chance to regather his strength and occupy the soil,\" he declared at a 1919 hearing.\n\nHis colleagues were largely sympathetic to Hudspeth's efforts. \"We realize the menace that exists in permitting the Texas-Mexico border to be free to radicals and Reds and we intend to protect this border,\" a committee member reassured the Texan in 1919. But the proposal languished. Budgets were tight and provincialism was strong. Some congressmen wanted to focus on Ellis Island instead-most immigrants, after all, arrived at ports. Even proponents of the idea acknowledged that trying to stop everyone might prove impossible.\n\n\"I do not want to be understood as assuming that we can make that border watertight,\" Anthony Caminetti, the US immigration commissioner-and a former member, Lee notes in At America's Gate s, of a California white supremacist group that was later known as the Order of Caucasians- testified in 1919 , while asking for money for more immigration agents. \"We cannot do it. It would cost too much money.\"\n\nFor Hudspeth's dream to become a reality, Congress would have to settle a larger debate, about whom a Border Patrol should stop.\n\nAt the same time Hudspeth was beating his Border Patrol drum, he was pushing to ease restrictions on a particular group of border crossers. His constituents may have been fed up with Mexican smugglers and bandits, but in 1919 they were desperate for cheap labor. Hudspeth, who spent much of his time in Washington micromanaging his livestock and pecan operations, considered the head tax and literacy test too onerous for Mexican farmhands. He repeatedly pushed Congress and the White House to suspend its regulations. To Hudspeth, this was a matter of simple economic sense-even if he considered Mexicans \" an inferior race .\"\n\nBut when Hudspeth appeared before the immigration committee to make his case, he faced serious resistance. Republican Rep. Hays White of Kansas warned that Mexicans would bring an \"evil philosophy against capital and property\"-that is, communism. Another Republican, Colorado Rep. William Vaile, worried that the move would sacrifice \" race integrity .\" \"They are wretched, lawless, poor criminal devils that do not know how to keep within the law,\" said John Box , an East Texas Democrat, who argued that politicians were using Mexican and noncitizen voters to rig elections.\n\nThe committee's Republican chairman, Albert Johnson of Washington, captured the spirit of the House: \"Is it not time for the United States to look upon every outsider with suspicion?\" he asked Hudspeth.\n\nJohnson and many of his peers believed the answer was yes. Rather than relaxing rules, they wanted to tighten them. There was no secret about why: Johnson, like many of his colleagues, despised Southern and Eastern Europeans and was deeply antisemitic . He and his allies proposed a new quota system to restrict immigration by tying the number of people admitted from each country to that nationality's representation in the 1890 Census-before the surge in migration from the targeted areas. His immigration committee even hired an in-house Eugenics Expert Agent -a proponent of mass sterilization who believed that Jews were \"filthy, un-American, and often dangerous in their habits.\"\n\n\"Is it not time for the United States to look upon every outsider with suspicion?\" asked the immigration committee's Republican chairman.\n\nWhile Johnson had resisted Hudspeth's efforts to loosen restrictions on Mexicans entering the country for seasonal work, it was the chairman's 1924 National Origins Act that finally pushed the Border Patrol over the finish line. The law slashed non-Western European migration and practically zeroed out emigration from Asia but exempted the Western Hemisphere. The interests of farmers and ranchers like Hudspeth ultimately prevailed over the wishes of people like Box and West Virginia Democratic Sen. Matthew Neely (who stated that \"we shall have delivered all of our priceless heritage to foreign invaders\"). Agribusiness wouldn't stand for a restriction that would threaten their labor supply, and politicians argued that extending the quotas would jeopardize diplomatic relationships. Even some of the eugenicists had to admit that attempting to keep out people who share a border would be too big of a lift.\n\nNativists \"were absolutely livid that Congress didn't pass any outright restrictions on Mexicans,\" says Kang, the UVA professor. \"Congress compromised and said, 'Look, we'll create the Border Patrol so we can control Mexican migration and make sure their migration is a temporary one.'\"\n\nThe National Origins Act included a clause specifically authorizing the appropriation of funds for its enforcement, and with that in hand, Johnson and Hudspeth introduced competing Border Patrol appropriations into an omnibus spending package working its way through the House. This time they found an ally in Box, who argued in a brief speech defending the measure that a new force was needed to keep \" vicious and undesirable \" immigrants from crossing the Mexican border-and falsely asserted that the previously deported anarchist Emma Goldman had recently \"entered in that way.\" Hudspeth's amendment, which asked for more money, ultimately prevailed. But in a reminder of the history of exclusion underpinning the effort, the chairman first had to amend the bill's language to say \"aliens\" instead of just \"Chinese.\"\n\nIn the runup to the final passage, media accounts depicted a crisis. Mexicans were \" massing on the border ,\" one Texas newspaper reported. A wire service story in late May 1924 read like early border agitprop, featuring photos of immigration inspectors in action, hiding in the brush with their weapons ready. \"Two aliens were found under the pile of sacks in this wagon after it crossed the American border,\" one caption read. Another photo featured what looked like staged footage of \"federal authorities\" engaged in a shootout with \"Chinese smugglers\" on the Arizona border.\n\nIn the run-up to the final passage, media accounts depicted a crisis. Mexicans were \"massing on the border,\" one Texas newspaper reported.\n\n\"They are doing what they can,\" the story announced. \"But the job is too big. Passage of the Hudspeth appropriation bill, now pending in Congress, is their only hope.\" The package became law the next day, on May 28, 1924.\n\nThe Border Patrol was a new idea that bore the distinct imprint of the past. To fill its roster, the force relied on the institutions that had been policing the color line for years. In Migra! A History of the U.S. Border Patrol , historian Kelly Lytle Hernández found that many of the first recruits were drawn from the Texas Rangers. The director of the sector that included Laredo, William Hanson , was an ex-Ranger captain who had spied on Black political dissidents, smuggled guns to Mexican counterrevolutionaries, and fanned fears of an armed invasion of Texas. For its part, the Border Patrol today considers Berkshire its \" Father \"-the unit's early ranks were filled, too, with ex-Chinese Inspectors like him.\n\nBut in their haste to authorize the force, Hudspeth and his colleagues had neglected to give it anything to do. At first, agents didn't even have the authority to arrest anyone. No sooner had the first agents donned their forest green uniforms than the calls began again. The border guard needed more power, more men, and more funding. Congress meant to solve a problem. It only created bigger ones.\n\nFor someone whose handiwork is foundational to American politics today, Hudspeth is largely anonymous. The Border Patrol Museum makes no mention of the force's first political patron, just as it steers clear of the period of state violence that preceded the unit's creation and the eugenicist nature of the debates from which it finally emerged. Hudspeth's obituaries upon his death in 1941 skipped right over his role in creating the agency. It is possible he simply never envisioned its full significance; his papers at the University of Texas at El Paso-another institution he helped found-include nary a reference to his role in establishing what is now a sprawling force of nearly 20,000 people.\n\nBut there is one monument to his legacy. When Hudspeth was only 39, in the middle of his push for the Ranger bill, his colleagues honored him with a gift: They named a county for him-a remote patch of West Texas that today is home to some 3,400 people in an area more than twice the size of Delaware. The county is a destination not just for millions of dollars of state and federal funds, but for right-wing border cosplayers . In 2011, Steven Seagal was sworn in as a sheriff's deputy. Hudspeth's historic marker sits on a sunbaked rest area off I-10. You can't miss it; it's the last stop before the Border Patrol checkpoint.\n\nHudspeth's obituaries upon his death in 1941 skipped right over his role in creating the Border Patrol. It is possible he simply never envisioned its full significance.\n\nIn recent years, as walls and patrol strategies pushed migrants into ever more hostile corridors, Hudspeth County has seen an unprecedented surge in apprehensions and deaths. One of the biggest employers outside the BP is the West Texas Detention Center, part of the region's booming migrant-jail economy. In 2022, the now-former warden at one of those detention centers was released on bond with his brother after allegedly killing a man from Mexico who stopped to drink from a small pond. \" They are good guys ,\" the sheriff told the New York Times .\n\nHudspeth did not begin this process; he merely did his part to keep it going. The work could never be finished. Which was why, in February 1925, less than a year after his force was established, Hudspeth returned to the House Appropriations Committee with another proposal. He began, in earnest, to discuss a new problem facing the ranchers and lawmen of his district. East of El Paso, the river had jumped its channel years ago and left pockets of Mexican territory north of the Rio Grande. Now, with Prohibition in effect, the area was overrun by smugglers. The Border Patrol was outgunned. \"In the last two years we have had something like 20 government officials murdered there,\" he testified. Hudspeth was asking for $30,000 to settle the problem.\n\n\"What is it you want?\" a committee member asked.\n\n\"I want a fence,\" Hudspeth replied.\n\nRead the rest of our Border Patrol investigation here .\n\nCredits from left: Universal History Archive/Universal Images Group/Getty,  Lennox McLendon/AP, Keystone-France/Gamma-Keystone/Getty , Library of Congress/Wikimedia\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "The Racism of \"Ole Miss\" Is Hiding in Plain Sight\n\nBecca Andrews July 1, 2020\n\nMother Jones illustration; Bettmann/Getty\n\nMother Jones illustration; Bettmann/Getty\n\nAt the entrance of the University of Mississippi campus in Oxford, the statue of a white marble man sits among the magnolia and oak trees. The gift from the Daughters of the Confederacy, a soldier, his arm in salute, a rifle at his side, has presided over passersby entering the university since 1906. He is perched atop a matching white marble spire so that the tip of his hat reaches toward the treetops. A plaque at the base of the monument, revised in 2016 as part of a historical contextualization project , allows that the statue was one in a series of memorials that \"were often used to promote an ideology known as the ' Lost Cause ,' which claimed that the Confederacy had been established to defend states' rights and that slavery was not the principal cause of the Civil War.\"\n\nStill, it stands.\n\nBut now, after more than a century, the anonymous soldier will finally be ousted from his premier spot -a move that's the direct result of a sustained campaign led by University of Mississippi students . \"We still have a long way to go, but it's still a victory, and I think we are allowed to celebrate it,\" Arielle Hudson, a recent graduate and the university's first Black female Rhodes scholar, tells me.\n\nBut it wasn't easy to get here. More than a year ago, the Associated Student Body Senate for inclusion and cross-cultural engagement unanimously passed a resolution that stated, \"Confederate ideology directly violates the tenets of the university creed that supports fairness, civility, and respect for the dignity of each person.\" While plans were made with the university to move the statue, the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning stepped in, declaring that the marble soldier falls under its purview and putting the plans on indefinite pause.\n\nBut in this moment of broader racial reckoning spurred by the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd, the already thinning tolerance for hand-wringing over such symbols has largely evaporated. In mid-June, the IHL agreed to move the statue to a less-prestigious placement, keeping watch over the dead in a Confederate cemetery in an area with less foot traffic, behind an old coliseum that's no longer in regular use.\n\nUndoubtedly the ultra-conservative IHL relaxing its grip is an important step. Persuading the university five years ago to discontinue the use of the Mississippi state flag-which, until Gov. Tate Reeves signed a law to retire it this week, was the last state flag to feature the Confederate battle flag design-was a similarly important one. And so was the university's pledge , just last month, to review its \"admissions and judicial review policies and protocols\" to deal with prospective students whose social media pages include racist posts.\n\nEven so, each step away from the school's \"Old South\" image ultimately seems marked by ambivalence. Soon after the announcement that the entrance's Confederate statue would be moved, plans surfaced to renovate the cemetery to create a sort of \"shrine\" effect (though the university says the design is not final). And while it is unclear what exactly will change for its admissions and judicial review policies, the university's stance has long been that it is unwilling to court costly First Amendment lawsuits, even as schools like the University of Alabama have expelled students over racist social media posts.\n\nAnd, crucially, no matter what happens with these measures, there remains an implicit tribute to white supremacy on campus that has proven tougher to exorcise, one many people don't even realize is there. The \"Ole Miss\" moniker has long informed the core of the institution's identity and the surrounding community, not to mention its powerful brand. But this is not merely a convenient abbreviation of the long official name. It's a phrase that's long haunted Black students, faculty, and staff as a lingering nod to the days when it seemed unthinkable that a place like the university would ever accept them only because of their skin.\n\nWhile statues all over the country come down, and the United States reckons with its racist past, it is time to confront the more insidious forms of white supremacy-especially those so easy to take for granted that it becomes harder and harder to recognize them for what they really are. They are not monuments or flags, but they are hidden in our language and our customs, their origins masked by time and intent.\n\nWhen Zaire Love was accepted into the University of Mississippi's documentary program to pursue her MFA, she was thrilled. In July 2018, she posted a photo to share the news that she would attend her dream school on full scholarship, no less; she looks uncertain but triumphant. Under a camo jacket draped perfectly off her shoulders, her white T-shirt is one she made herself: navy blue scripted letters sing \"Ole Miss Mane.\"\n\n\"I thought I was putting my Blackness and my Black flavor on it,\" she says. She didn't know just what it meant at the time, but she remembers her bitter disappointment the day she found out.\n\nThat summer, Love left her home in Memphis to mentor teenagers on campus through the William Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation. She was eager to get involved in a new community, and the program seemed like the perfect way to jumpstart a new chapter in her life. While she was there, the origin story of the name \"Ole Miss\" came up.\n\nLove learned that a student, Elma Meek, proposed the name in 1896 for a new yearbook that was being created by an interfraternity group. Her inspiration reportedly came \"from the language of the Ante-bellum 'Darkey,ʼ who knew the wife of his owner by no other title than 'Ole Miss,ʼ\" according to the student newspaper, then called The Mississippian. In an interview with that paper in the 1930s, Meek said she felt the name \"connoted all the admiration and reverence accorded the womanhood of the Old South.\" This intervention afforded Meek herself a vaunted spot in Oxford mythology; long after she had stopped attending classes at the university, Meek lived in a house near the campus that was built by a Confederate general. (For a while, William Faulkner and his wife lived with her there; it's actually where he wrote much of As I Lay Dying and \"A Rose for Emily.\") Today, the house is fiercely protected from any attempts at change, down to its air ducts, by the local Historic Preservation Commission. But more than Meek's sentimental history, the name she proposed has stuck, so wildly outliving its origins that many, many people who pass through the Oxford campus or tailgate in the Grove or simply follow the sports teams with mild interest are unaware of the horrors hidden therein.\n\n(The university did not respond to multiple interview requests from Mother Jones , but sent a statement from Chancellor Glenn Boyce: \"Ole Miss is a term of affinity for many of our people that is intrinsic to the university's identity and carries strong, positive national and international recognition. We understand the complex history of its origins...at the same time, it is a term whose meaning has changed over time, and we are committed to living by what it means today to our students and alumni who embrace it as an expression of caring and community.\" The email also included a chapter from a book titled, The Other Mississippi: A State in Conflict with Itself ; written by David Sansing, the University of Mississippi's late historian, the selection emphasizes that the term \"Ole Miss\" was one of \"respect and endearment\" used by slaves, and twice says that Meek's intention was not to \"reminisce or regale\" slavery, rather she only meant to \"link her alma mater to those grand women of the antebellum South.\")\n\nUpon learning this history, Love was determined not to use the casual nickname again. \"I'm going to stand up and say this is not what I want to use,\" she says. But, she admits, it's not exactly easy to just remove yourself from something so wrapped up in campus culture-\"It's also the lay of the land. It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't-type situation.\"\n\nThere are so many people-not all of them white-who do not know the university as anything other than \"Ole Miss.\" It's everywhere around you in Oxford; on billboards that advertise the university as you drive into town, on signs and on campus, on T-shirts, ball caps, stickers, school supplies, tacked onto the end of every student's and faculty member's email address. There is no University of Mississippi; there is only \"Ole Miss.\"\n\nFor most of my life, I was among the oblivious. The historical context of \"Ole Miss\" was news to me when late last year a former high school classmate of mine posted a 2019 Chronicle of Higher Ed article on Facebook detailing origins of the university's hoary nickname. I am a Southern white woman who has always spoken those words, \"Ole Miss,\" in the context of a dearly held rivalry between the university in Oxford and Mississippi State University, where most of my family has attended school for generations. It once vaguely connoted home to me, recalling Thanksgivings at my grandmother's house in Tupelo, the television in the living room blaring the Egg Bowl, the annual football faceoff between the schools, as we cleaned up the kitchen and carefully put away the leftovers.\n\nCheerleaders carry \"Ole Miss\" flags during a game against the Memphis Tigers at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium on October 1, 2016, in Oxford, Mississippi. Jonathan Bachman/Getty I'm not sure I've ever heard anyone refer to it as the University of Mississippi until recently, but the discovery that words that I once regarded as neutral, even charming, contain a bitter connotation has changed that. For weeks, I couldn't stop thinking about this new context. I quizzed everyone I encountered about the once-beloved nickname; in bars, at work, on the phone with folks back home-no one knew. That racism often hides in language is not a new concept to me; I grew up as a white girl in the South. But that also means I hid from those realities behind my privilege and youth for an unforgivably long time. Even as a child, I often sensed some lingering evil when racism was dressed up as something innocuous-yet in the name \"Ole Miss,\" for nearly three decades, I heard only a folksy alternative to an unwieldy school name. \"If you talk to students, they will say that it weighs on their everyday experiences on this campus.\" A few weeks after reading the article, I wandered the campus with my cousin, struck by the depth of the school's commitment to the branding-wondering how I went so long without knowing, becoming fixated on how the name that literally looms over everyone's heads affects life for students and staff of color. The student population is 76 percent white and only 13 percent Black; similarly, the faculty is 78 percent white and only 6 percent Black. \"If you talk to students-and this is both students in general, Black, white, and otherwise, but especially with students of color-they will say that it weighs on their everyday experiences on this campus-the 'it' being the racial history of the campus,\" says Brian Foster, an assistant professor in the sociology department, who is Black. Interviews with students add further dimensions to Foster's assessment. While Love is careful to point out that as a graduate student she is not on campus as often as undergraduates are, she notes, \"Our ancestors already paid the price. We don't need to add tax by continuing to have those symbols of oppression at the University of Mississippi.\" For her part, Yasmine Malone, a rising senior at the university, likes the nickname itself, stripped of its origins, but it bothers her that she feels like the school is less than clear about where it comes from. A classmate, Isabel Spafford, says she heard the claim on a campus tour that the name is taken from a train that supposedly ran through the state from Memphis. Malone notes that despite efforts to move forward, there is also still an undeniable pattern of racism in behavior at the University of Mississippi-whether it's the Black fraternity house that was burned to the ground in 1988 or the Confederate rally held on campus in February 2019 or the powerful old Southern families who donate to the university on the condition that the Confederate imagery remain intact and undisturbed. \"I would like for us to adopt a mindset that we no longer want this to represent who we are,\" Malone says. \"But the fact of it is, that is exactly who we are. The political, economic, and social forces that guide decisions around Ole Miss are all very much still racist.\" She clarifies that she's being more candid with me than she feels she can generally be in her life on campus. While the University of Mississippi has grappled with its Confederate history for decades, wrestling with these demons never makes for a straightforward fight. And in the broader context of the state of Mississippi, where strains of white supremacy persist from the not-so-distant past, it has been even more fraught. In 1848, the university was \"very explicitly founded as an institution where slaveholder sons can attend rather than going to those fanatical colleges and universities in the north where they might imbibe anti-slavery ideology, and come back hostile to the institution,\" says Anne Twitty, an associate history professor at the University of Mississippi. \"The overwhelming majority of the University of Mississippi's first students came from slaveholding families.\" As Twitty points out in a recent piece for the Atlantic , when the various monuments and memorials to the Confederacy began to appear on campus in the late 1800s and early 1900s, they were constructed not in grief for lives that had been lost, but rather in celebration for the power structure preserved through Jim Crow. The university did not accept its first Black student, James Meredith, until 1962, and Meredith's acceptance came only after a lengthy legal battle. Violent protests ensued ; two died and some 300 more were injured. \"Why would we expect this to be a habitable place? Why would we expect this to be a welcoming and vibrant place?\" \"It's a practical matter,\" Foster says. \"If Black folks have only been allowed to be here, either as students, as faculty, as administrators, for a fraction of the university's history, it only follows that they will be underrepresented in those spaces to which they haven't historically had access.\" He adds, \"Why would we expect this to be a habitable place? Why would we expect this to be a welcoming and vibrant place?\" In 2006, a statue of Meredith was erected on campus. In 2014, three fraternity brothers flung a noose over its neck. The university has made attempts to tackle some of the most glaring representations of this racism, but its official actions don't always translate to the broader culture on campus. For the better part of the 20th century , for instance, the school's mascot was Colonel Reb, a mustachioed caricature of a plantation owner who wears a haughty expression, leaning heavily on a cane. He is sometimes depicted against a backdrop of a Confederate flag. The university officially retired him in 2003-but the image is far from defunct. Independent groups attend sporting events with stuffed Colonel Rebs for children; men dress as the former mascot and pose with sorority girls and fraternity boys. University of Mississippi senior Chris Baxley wears the costume of school mascot Colonel Reb during the Kentucky-Mississippi basketball game in Memphis on March 8, 1997. Mark Humphrey/AP In 2009, former Chancellor Dan Jones asked the university's band, known as the Pride of the South, to stop playing \"From Dixie With Love,\" which blended the Battle Hymn of the Republic with Dixie that builds toward a chant: \"The South will rise again.\" In 2016, they were asked to stop playing any variation on the unofficial anthem of the Confederate States of America. Like the mascot, both songs have disappeared officially, but that does not stop tailgaters from blaring the anthem from booming speakers in oversize pickups anyway. Even though the school banned the Mississippi flag on campus because of the Confederate symbolism prominently displayed therein, there's still the Our State Flag Foundation, a group of people pissed that the university no longer flies it. The Facebook group, which hovers around 25,000 members, is a forum where angry white people bemoan diversity and inclusion efforts on their best days and attack specific people of color in the university community on their worst. They have a booth in the Grove on game days. The way the university has dealt with the name has been even more opaque. In 2014, a Sensitivity and Respect Committee, comprised of administrators and other faculty, and a handful of students, aimed to make the campus more diverse and inclusive, releasing a report that alludes to the moniker but avoids addressing its racist history directly. While the official recommendation is, the University of Mississippi should \"consider the implications of calling itself 'Ole Miss' in various contexts,\" most of that section of the report appears to brush the roots of the name aside: \"Regardless of its origin, the vast majority of those associated with our university has a strong affection for 'Ole Miss' and do not associate its use with race in any way. And the vast majority of those who view us from a distance associate the term 'Ole Miss' with a strong, vibrant, modern university - and the Manning family, The Blind Side , The [sic] 2008 Presidential Debate, and great sports teams.\" If the University of Mississippi is a formal name, \"Ole Miss\" conveys a powerful emotion. In June 2017, another report , this one from the Chancellor's Advisory Committee on History and Contextualization, was released. It held specific instructions for clarifying the history of the Confederate iconography on campus-everything from the names of buildings to the 12-foot-tall Tiffany stained-glass window depicting the University Greys, the students who fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War (all of whom were killed or wounded in combat). It was, in many ways, a massive victory for the Black students and faculty who had long been fighting for a more inclusive, reflective campus. \"Ole Miss,\" though, was not even mentioned in this report. \"Those efforts for change have always registered to me as symbolism, surface level, more than tangible, material, structural,\" Foster says. Part of this may be because if the University of Mississippi is a formal name, \"Ole Miss\" conveys a powerful emotion-and a lucrative brand. As Hudson put it to me, \"We have not moved on from [Ole Miss] because of capitalism...they're making money off of that.\" Forbes estimates that the annual revenue-over an average of three years-brought in from the \"Ole Miss\" football program alone is $84 million, making it one of the top 25 most lucrative college teams in the country. In 2016, the school expanded Vaught-Hemingway Stadium to hold 64,038 football fans; it is now the largest stadium in Mississippi. Still, grassroots efforts to change the name have come in small fits and starts over the years, though the overall conversation has lacked the urgency that has toppled other Confederate symbols. And when it has come up, it has typically inspired only lukewarm response. Torie Marion White, who serves as an assistant director at the Ole Miss Alumni Association, overseeing alumni relations for the School of Applied Science and the School of Engineering, as well as the Black Alumni Advisory Council and the Grove Society, tells Mother Jones that several of her fellow Black alums have taken to referring to the school as \"New Miss,\" she says, creating T-shirts and tumblers with their moniker featured in place of the old. Nevertheless, such swag is hard to come by; when I searched for anything like that online, I came up only with beauty pageant references. Just this year, Zach Borenstein, a white graduate student, wrote an op-ed in the student newspaper, the Daily Mississippian , calling for the death of \"Ole Miss.\" \"Language matters, but we often get used to saying things that normalize harm,\" he wrote in early February. \"Certain phrases diminish or denigrate groups of people, and if not addressed, these phrases become so commonplace that those using them do not even consider their origins and effects.\" (At the end of May, Borenstein was arrested for defacing the Confederate statue at the campus entrance. He slashed his hand with a knife to cast bloody handprints upon the white marble, framing the words \"spiritual genocide,\" spray-painted in black.) A week after Borenstein's op-ed published, another appeared, this one by a white then-junior named Lauren Moses. It was headlined \"Let's keep saying 'Ole Miss. ' \" : \"My friends and I recently discussed the waning respect for tradition on our campus. From changing the school mascot to governing bodies voting to move the Confederate statue to contextualizing many buildings on campus, Ole Miss has lost its identity.\" The core of her argument is that history fades, and that those symbols are not celebrated for their origins, but in spite of them. Her point isn't particularly novel; it is in fact all too familiar. It ripples through the campus and an extended community of (mostly white) fans and alumni in all sorts of forms. Alumnus Jon Rawl, co-founder of the Colonel Reb Foundation, lobbies the university to bring back the mascot from the early aughts. I asked him what he'd say to Black students and faculty who are disturbed by the Confederate imagery on campus, including the mascot. He replied simply, \"Well, the Confederate stuff was there before they were.\" Over the past few weeks in particular, I've considered what it means to love the South, as I deeply do. What once was partially buried under decades of careful erasure is now stark and exposed. I cannot look away from racism, especially where it flourishes in my home. Harm is difficult to quantify, which in turn makes it a tricky defense against the thing that harms. When people who have been actively disempowered are those being harmed, it makes those voices harder to hear, or maybe easier for those in power to ignore. As I talked to more and more people in the campus community-most of them Black-I couldn't help but feel the magnitude of all they are up against. Before Foster was a sociology professor, he came to study at the University of Mississippi as a student. He tells me it was the first time he feared for his safety based on his identity. Oxford was the first place he was ever called the n-word by a white person. It was the first place where two white boys pulled up next to him at a stoplight, rolled down the window, and asked, \"Where you boys going tonight?\" like they were entitled to know. While scrolling through the Our State Flag Foundation's Facebook page, I came across a screenshot of Foster's staff page, and my stomach churned, alongside a photo of two Black female graduates. They had drawn the ire of the group for their activism to remove the state flag from campus. There are 69 comments below. \"You really do have to have a lot of strength and a lot of energy to continuously put your Black or Brown body in these spaces and fight for those things, because it is not for the faint of heart.\" Similarly, Marion White, who runs the Black Alumni Advisory Council, says she's \"been the only minority in a room my entire life,\" and still, the day came when she was manhandled by a campus police officer because she was in the parking area for elite alumni on game day. When she told him she worked for the university, he wouldn't believe her. (Marion White says the officer remains on the force.) My conversations with students echo these experiences. Malone, the senior, tells me that while she's found a vibrant Black community at the university, she has stepped back from activism and fighting back against the university's Confederate symbols. It's become too much for her emotionally; she has to focus on her studies, which is a tall order in itself when attending classes means passing former slave quarters and hearing her university referred to in antebellum language. Love is still committed to getting her MFA, but concludes, \"You really do have to have a lot of strength and a lot of energy to continuously put your Black or Brown body in these spaces and fight for those things, because it is not for the faint of heart.\" Most of the men and women I interviewed also mentioned a photo that went viral in July 2019 of three white fraternity brothers, wearing broad smiles and posing in front of the bullet-ridden sign memorializing Emmett Till, the Black 14-year-old who was tortured and lynched in 1955 after a white woman falsely accused him of whistling at her. Two of the boys in the photo held guns. The sign itself is so often vandalized, so frequently shot at, that it's impossible to know if the bullet holes are from the guns clutched in the hands of the Kappa Alpha brothers. They were suspended from their fraternity, but ultimately allowed to remain enrolled as students. \"I just feel like if those boys were Black men who shot up a Confederate sign, there would probably be way more consequences, way more outrage, way more punishment for them,\" Love tells me. \"You understand that the underlining thing about it is this deeply entrenched white privilege and to me, being a woman of color, a Black woman, particularly...it just makes you feel powerless.\" This incident reveals a bright line for these individuals on campus, where all the changes made so far seem to stumble short of addressing a larger cultural problem. The university has put a significant amount of time and money into trying to leave the past behind, but it cannot truly overcome its legacy when it chooses to retain an identity that romanticizes a time when Black people were considered so subhuman that they could not address a white woman directly. Language provides all sorts of nook and crannies for white supremacy to hide; can it be truly overthrown without addressing what's really in a name? A name that is so intertwined with the identity of a place is tough to disentangle. Some of the students who make a conscious effort to use the full name of the university would slip up in our conversations; I have promised myself to make the same effort and sometimes my tongue still catches on it. To stay vigilant enough to thwart the connection between your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your mind requires a kind of prickly awareness that feels uncomfortable at first, but soon, it dissolves into normalcy. It is difficult to imagine the University of Mississippi as anything but \"Ole Miss.\" It is also impossible to completely divorce the school from the values held in its Confederate past without going all-in on moving forward and making the change. Moving statues, contextualizing symbols, building committees, and scheduling programming toward a more inclusive and diverse campus are all good and important. But that work feels dwarfed by the name of the place, when the words on the lips of everyone in that community are an homage to the antebellum South. Language provides all sorts of nook and crannies for white supremacy to hide; can it be truly overthrown without addressing what's really in a name? James Meredith, the first Black man to attend the University of Mississippi, wears his \"New Miss\" hat, a gift from Pastor Robert West. West said, \"The day James Meredith stepped onto the campus of The University of Mississippi, it was no longer 'Ole Miss.'\" Suzi Altman/Zuma Names, though, even the ones so tied up in a community, in its identity, can change. Look around. This reckoning over what's in a name, which has played out time and time again, and time again, is once again doing so in the names of schools and parks and military bases and even country music bands. With time, few will remember what they once were. Once, the University of Mississippi was simply that. It could be that again; it could also be reborn as something better. It may not happen today or tomorrow. But it will. It must. Of course changing the name will not magically dissipate centuries of systemic racism and inequality, but it is a simple step forward. Until then I feel somewhat heartened thinking about the fight itself-which, Love says, \"is important because it shows that we are here, it shows that we belong, and it does not validate our worth, but it does validate us being here.\" \"It shows that hey, we're here, we're staying. We acknowledge that these things, these symbols, hurt.\" Correction: An earlier version of this article applied a term for the original Confederate States flag, in use 1861-1863, to a later version formerly displayed in the state flag of Mississippi.\n\nI'm not sure I've ever heard anyone refer to it as the University of Mississippi until recently, but the discovery that words that I once regarded as neutral, even charming, contain a bitter connotation has changed that. For weeks, I couldn't stop thinking about this new context. I quizzed everyone I encountered about the once-beloved nickname; in bars, at work, on the phone with folks back home-no one knew. That racism often hides in language is not a new concept to me; I grew up as a white girl in the South. But that also means I hid from those realities behind my privilege and youth for an unforgivably long time. Even as a child, I often sensed some lingering evil when racism was dressed up as something innocuous-yet in the name \"Ole Miss,\" for nearly three decades, I heard only a folksy alternative to an unwieldy school name.\n\nA few weeks after reading the article, I wandered the campus with my cousin, struck by the depth of the school's commitment to the branding-wondering how I went so long without knowing, becoming fixated on how the name that literally looms over everyone's heads affects life for students and staff of color. The student population is 76 percent white and only 13 percent Black; similarly, the faculty is 78 percent white and only 6 percent Black. \"If you talk to students-and this is both students in general, Black, white, and otherwise, but especially with students of color-they will say that it weighs on their everyday experiences on this campus-the 'it' being the racial history of the campus,\" says Brian Foster, an assistant professor in the sociology department, who is Black.\n\nInterviews with students add further dimensions to Foster's assessment. While Love is careful to point out that as a graduate student she is not on campus as often as undergraduates are, she notes, \"Our ancestors already paid the price. We don't need to add tax by continuing to have those symbols of oppression at the University of Mississippi.\"\n\nFor her part, Yasmine Malone, a rising senior at the university, likes the nickname itself, stripped of its origins, but it bothers her that she feels like the school is less than clear about where it comes from.

Like the mascot, both songs have disappeared officially, but that does not stop tailgaters from blaring the anthem from booming speakers in oversize pickups anyway.\n\nEven though the school banned the Mississippi flag on campus because of the Confederate symbolism prominently displayed therein, there's still the Our State Flag Foundation, a group of people pissed that the university no longer flies it. The Facebook group, which hovers around 25,000 members, is a forum where angry white people bemoan diversity and inclusion efforts on their best days and attack specific people of color in the university community on their worst. They have a booth in the Grove on game days.\n\nThe way the university has dealt with the name has been even more opaque. In 2014, a Sensitivity and Respect Committee, comprised of administrators and other faculty, and a handful of students, aimed to make the campus more diverse and inclusive, releasing a report that alludes to the moniker but avoids addressing its racist history directly. While the official recommendation is, the University of Mississippi should \"consider the implications of calling itself 'Ole Miss' in various contexts,\" most of that section of the report appears to brush the roots of the name aside: \"Regardless of its origin, the vast majority of those associated with our university has a strong affection for 'Ole Miss' and do not associate its use with race in any way. And the vast majority of those who view us from a distance associate the term 'Ole Miss' with a strong, vibrant, modern university - and the Manning family, The Blind Side , The [sic] 2008 Presidential Debate, and great sports teams.\"\n\nIn June 2017, another report , this one from the Chancellor's Advisory Committee on History and Contextualization, was released. It held specific instructions for clarifying the history of the Confederate iconography on campus-everything from the names of buildings to the 12-foot-tall Tiffany stained-glass window depicting the University Greys, the students who fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War (all of whom were killed or wounded in combat). It was, in many ways, a massive victory for the Black students and faculty who had long been fighting for a more inclusive, reflective campus. \"Ole Miss,\" though, was not even mentioned in this report.\n\n\"Those efforts for change have always registered to me as symbolism, surface level, more than tangible, material, structural,\" Foster says.\n\nPart of this may be because if the University of Mississippi is a formal name, \"Ole Miss\" conveys a powerful emotion-and a lucrative brand. As Hudson put it to me, \"We have not moved on from [Ole Miss] because of capitalism...they're making money off of that.\" Forbes estimates that the annual revenue-over an average of three years-brought in from the \"Ole Miss\" football program alone is $84 million, making it one of the top 25 most lucrative college teams in the country. In 2016, the school expanded Vaught-Hemingway Stadium to hold 64,038 football fans; it is now the largest stadium in Mississippi.\n\nStill, grassroots efforts to change the name have come in small fits and starts over the years, though the overall conversation has lacked the urgency that has toppled other Confederate symbols. And when it has come up, it has typically inspired only lukewarm response. Torie Marion White, who serves as an assistant director at the Ole Miss Alumni Association, overseeing alumni relations for the School of Applied Science and the School of Engineering, as well as the Black Alumni Advisory Council and the Grove Society, tells Mother Jones that several of her fellow Black alums have taken to referring to the school as \"New Miss,\" she says, creating T-shirts and tumblers with their moniker featured in place of the old. Nevertheless, such swag is hard to come by; when I searched for anything like that online, I came up only with beauty pageant references.\n\nJust this year, Zach Borenstein, a white graduate student, wrote an op-ed in the student newspaper, the Daily Mississippian , calling for the death of \"Ole Miss.\" \"Language matters, but we often get used to saying things that normalize harm,\" he wrote in early February. \"Certain phrases diminish or denigrate groups of people, and if not addressed, these phrases become so commonplace that those using them do not even consider their origins and effects.\" (At the end of May, Borenstein was arrested for defacing the Confederate statue at the campus entrance. He slashed his hand with a knife to cast bloody handprints upon the white marble, framing the words \"spiritual genocide,\" spray-painted in black.)\n\nA week after Borenstein's op-ed published, another appeared, this one by a white then-junior named Lauren Moses. It was headlined \"Let's keep saying 'Ole Miss. ' \" : \"My friends and I recently discussed the waning respect for tradition on our campus. From changing the school mascot to governing bodies voting to move the Confederate statue to contextualizing many buildings on campus, Ole Miss has lost its identity.\" The core of her argument is that history fades, and that those symbols are not celebrated for their origins, but in spite of them.\n\nHer point isn't particularly novel; it is in fact all too familiar. It ripples through the campus and an extended community of (mostly white) fans and alumni in all sorts of forms. Alumnus Jon Rawl, co-founder of the Colonel Reb Foundation, lobbies the university to bring back the mascot from the early aughts. I asked him what he'd say to Black students and faculty who are disturbed by the Confederate imagery on campus, including the mascot. He replied simply, \"Well, the Confederate stuff was there before they were.\"\n\nOver the past few weeks in particular, I've considered what it means to love the South, as I deeply do. What once was partially buried under decades of careful erasure is now stark and exposed. I cannot look away from racism, especially where it flourishes in my home.\n\nHarm is difficult to quantify, which in turn makes it a tricky defense against the thing that harms. When people who have been actively disempowered are those being harmed, it makes those voices harder to hear, or maybe easier for those in power to ignore.\n\nAs I talked to more and more people in the campus community-most of them Black-I couldn't help but feel the magnitude of all they are up against. Before Foster was a sociology professor, he came to study at the University of Mississippi as a student. He tells me it was the first time he feared for his safety based on his identity. Oxford was the first place he was ever called the n-word by a white person. It was the first place where two white boys pulled up next to him at a stoplight, rolled down the window, and asked, \"Where you boys going tonight?\" like they were entitled to know. While scrolling through the Our State Flag Foundation's Facebook page, I came across a screenshot of Foster's staff page, and my stomach churned, alongside a photo of two Black female graduates. They had drawn the ire of the group for their activism to remove the state flag from campus. There are 69 comments below.\n\nSimilarly, Marion White, who runs the Black Alumni Advisory Council, says she's \"been the only minority in a room my entire life,\" and still, the day came when she was manhandled by a campus police officer because she was in the parking area for elite alumni on game day. When she told him she worked for the university, he wouldn't believe her. (Marion White says the officer remains on the force.)\n\nMy conversations with students echo these experiences. Malone, the senior, tells me that while she's found a vibrant Black community at the university, she has stepped back from activism and fighting back against the university's Confederate symbols. It's become too much for her emotionally; she has to focus on her studies, which is a tall order in itself when attending classes means passing former slave quarters and hearing her university referred to in antebellum language.\n\nLove is still committed to getting her MFA, but concludes, \"You really do have to have a lot of strength and a lot of energy to continuously put your Black or Brown body in these spaces and fight for those things, because it is not for the faint of heart.\"\n\nMost of the men and women I interviewed also mentioned a photo that went viral in July 2019 of three white fraternity brothers, wearing broad smiles and posing in front of the bullet-ridden sign memorializing Emmett Till, the Black 14-year-old who was tortured and lynched in 1955 after a white woman falsely accused him of whistling at her. Two of the boys in the photo held guns. The sign itself is so often vandalized, so frequently shot at, that it's impossible to know if the bullet holes are from the guns clutched in the hands of the Kappa Alpha brothers. They were suspended from their fraternity, but ultimately allowed to remain enrolled as students.\n\n\"I just feel like if those boys were Black men who shot up a Confederate sign, there would probably be way more consequences, way more outrage, way more punishment for them,\" Love tells me. \"You understand that the underlining thing about it is this deeply entrenched white privilege and to me, being a woman of color, a Black woman, particularly...it just makes you feel powerless.\"\n\nThis incident reveals a bright line for these individuals on campus, where all the changes made so far seem to stumble short of addressing a larger cultural problem. The university has put a significant amount of time and money into trying to leave the past behind, but it cannot truly overcome its legacy when it chooses to retain an identity that romanticizes a time when Black people were considered so subhuman that they could not address a white woman directly.\n\nA name that is so intertwined with the identity of a place is tough to disentangle. Some of the students who make a conscious effort to use the full name of the university would slip up in our conversations; I have promised myself to make the same effort and sometimes my tongue still catches on it. To stay vigilant enough to thwart the connection between your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your mind requires a kind of prickly awareness that feels uncomfortable at first, but soon, it dissolves into normalcy.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine the University of Mississippi as anything but \"Ole Miss.\" It is also impossible to completely divorce the school from the values held in its Confederate past without going all-in on moving forward and making the change. Moving statues, contextualizing symbols, building committees, and scheduling programming toward a more inclusive and diverse campus are all good and important. But that work feels dwarfed by the name of the place, when the words on the lips of everyone in that community are an homage to the antebellum South. Language provides all sorts of nook and crannies for white supremacy to hide; can it be truly overthrown without addressing what's really in a name?\n\nJames Meredith, the first Black man to attend the University of Mississippi, wears his \"New Miss\" hat, a gift from Pastor Robert West. West said, \"The day James Meredith stepped onto the campus of The University of Mississippi, it was no longer 'Ole Miss.'\" Suzi Altman/Zuma Names, though, even the ones so tied up in a community, in its identity, can change. Look around. This reckoning over what's in a name, which has played out time and time again, and time again, is once again doing so in the names of schools and parks and military bases and even country music bands. With time, few will remember what they once were. Once, the University of Mississippi was simply that. It could be that again; it could also be reborn as something better. It may not happen today or tomorrow. But it will. It must. Of course changing the name will not magically dissipate centuries of systemic racism and inequality, but it is a simple step forward. Until then I feel somewhat heartened thinking about the fight itself-which, Love says, \"is important because it shows that we are here, it shows that we belong, and it does not validate our worth, but it does validate us being here.\" \"It shows that hey, we're here, we're staying. We acknowledge that these things, these symbols, hurt.\" Correction: An earlier version of this article applied a term for the original Confederate States flag, in use 1861-1863, to a later version formerly displayed in the state flag of Mississippi.\n\nNames, though, even the ones so tied up in a community, in its identity, can change.

      "text": "The Racism of \"Ole Miss\" Is Hiding in Plain Sight\n\nBecca Andrews July 1, 2020\n\nMother Jones illustration; Bettmann/Getty\n\nMother Jones illustration; Bettmann/Getty\n\nAt the entrance of the University of Mississippi campus in Oxford, the statue of a white marble man sits among the magnolia and oak trees. The gift from the Daughters of the Confederacy, a soldier, his arm in salute, a rifle at his side, has presided over passersby entering the university since 1906. He is perched atop a matching white marble spire so that the tip of his hat reaches toward the treetops. A plaque at the base of the monument, revised in 2016 as part of a historical contextualization project , allows that the statue was one in a series of memorials that \"were often used to promote an ideology known as the ' Lost Cause ,' which claimed that the Confederacy had been established to defend states' rights and that slavery was not the principal cause of the Civil War.\"\n\nStill, it stands.\n\nBut now, after more than a century, the anonymous soldier will finally be ousted from his premier spot -a move that's the direct result of a sustained campaign led by University of Mississippi students . \"We still have a long way to go, but it's still a victory, and I think we are allowed to celebrate it,\" Arielle Hudson, a recent graduate and the university's first Black female Rhodes scholar, tells me.\n\nBut it wasn't easy to get here. More than a year ago, the Associated Student Body Senate for inclusion and cross-cultural engagement unanimously passed a resolution that stated, \"Confederate ideology directly violates the tenets of the university creed that supports fairness, civility, and respect for the dignity of each person.\" While plans were made with the university to move the statue, the Mississippi Institutions of Higher Learning stepped in, declaring that the marble soldier falls under its purview and putting the plans on indefinite pause.\n\nBut in this moment of broader racial reckoning spurred by the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and George Floyd, the already thinning tolerance for hand-wringing over such symbols has largely evaporated. In mid-June, the IHL agreed to move the statue to a less-prestigious placement, keeping watch over the dead in a Confederate cemetery in an area with less foot traffic, behind an old coliseum that's no longer in regular use.\n\nUndoubtedly the ultra-conservative IHL relaxing its grip is an important step. Persuading the university five years ago to discontinue the use of the Mississippi state flag-which, until Gov. Tate Reeves signed a law to retire it this week, was the last state flag to feature the Confederate battle flag design-was a similarly important one. And so was the university's pledge , just last month, to review its \"admissions and judicial review policies and protocols\" to deal with prospective students whose social media pages include racist posts.\n\nEven so, each step away from the school's \"Old South\" image ultimately seems marked by ambivalence. Soon after the announcement that the entrance's Confederate statue would be moved, plans surfaced to renovate the cemetery to create a sort of \"shrine\" effect (though the university says the design is not final). And while it is unclear what exactly will change for its admissions and judicial review policies, the university's stance has long been that it is unwilling to court costly First Amendment lawsuits, even as schools like the University of Alabama have expelled students over racist social media posts.\n\nAnd, crucially, no matter what happens with these measures, there remains an implicit tribute to white supremacy on campus that has proven tougher to exorcise, one many people don't even realize is there. The \"Ole Miss\" moniker has long informed the core of the institution's identity and the surrounding community, not to mention its powerful brand. But this is not merely a convenient abbreviation of the long official name. It's a phrase that's long haunted Black students, faculty, and staff as a lingering nod to the days when it seemed unthinkable that a place like the university would ever accept them only because of their skin.\n\nWhile statues all over the country come down, and the United States reckons with its racist past, it is time to confront the more insidious forms of white supremacy-especially those so easy to take for granted that it becomes harder and harder to recognize them for what they really are. They are not monuments or flags, but they are hidden in our language and our customs, their origins masked by time and intent.\n\nWhen Zaire Love was accepted into the University of Mississippi's documentary program to pursue her MFA, she was thrilled. In July 2018, she posted a photo to share the news that she would attend her dream school on full scholarship, no less; she looks uncertain but triumphant. Under a camo jacket draped perfectly off her shoulders, her white T-shirt is one she made herself: navy blue scripted letters sing \"Ole Miss Mane.\"\n\n\"I thought I was putting my Blackness and my Black flavor on it,\" she says. She didn't know just what it meant at the time, but she remembers her bitter disappointment the day she found out.\n\nThat summer, Love left her home in Memphis to mentor teenagers on campus through the William Winter Institute for Racial Reconciliation. She was eager to get involved in a new community, and the program seemed like the perfect way to jumpstart a new chapter in her life. While she was there, the origin story of the name \"Ole Miss\" came up.\n\nLove learned that a student, Elma Meek, proposed the name in 1896 for a new yearbook that was being created by an interfraternity group. Her inspiration reportedly came \"from the language of the Ante-bellum 'Darkey,ʼ who knew the wife of his owner by no other title than 'Ole Miss,ʼ\" according to the student newspaper, then called The Mississippian. In an interview with that paper in the 1930s, Meek said she felt the name \"connoted all the admiration and reverence accorded the womanhood of the Old South.\" This intervention afforded Meek herself a vaunted spot in Oxford mythology; long after she had stopped attending classes at the university, Meek lived in a house near the campus that was built by a Confederate general. (For a while, William Faulkner and his wife lived with her there; it's actually where he wrote much of As I Lay Dying and \"A Rose for Emily.\") Today, the house is fiercely protected from any attempts at change, down to its air ducts, by the local Historic Preservation Commission. But more than Meek's sentimental history, the name she proposed has stuck, so wildly outliving its origins that many, many people who pass through the Oxford campus or tailgate in the Grove or simply follow the sports teams with mild interest are unaware of the horrors hidden therein.\n\n(The university did not respond to multiple interview requests from Mother Jones , but sent a statement from Chancellor Glenn Boyce: \"Ole Miss is a term of affinity for many of our people that is intrinsic to the university's identity and carries strong, positive national and international recognition. We understand the complex history of its origins...at the same time, it is a term whose meaning has changed over time, and we are committed to living by what it means today to our students and alumni who embrace it as an expression of caring and community.\" The email also included a chapter from a book titled, The Other Mississippi: A State in Conflict with Itself ; written by David Sansing, the University of Mississippi's late historian, the selection emphasizes that the term \"Ole Miss\" was one of \"respect and endearment\" used by slaves, and twice says that Meek's intention was not to \"reminisce or regale\" slavery, rather she only meant to \"link her alma mater to those grand women of the antebellum South.\")\n\nUpon learning this history, Love was determined not to use the casual nickname again. \"I'm going to stand up and say this is not what I want to use,\" she says. But, she admits, it's not exactly easy to just remove yourself from something so wrapped up in campus culture-\"It's also the lay of the land. It's a damned if you do, damned if you don't-type situation.\"\n\nThere are so many people-not all of them white-who do not know the university as anything other than \"Ole Miss.\" It's everywhere around you in Oxford; on billboards that advertise the university as you drive into town, on signs and on campus, on T-shirts, ball caps, stickers, school supplies, tacked onto the end of every student's and faculty member's email address. There is no University of Mississippi; there is only \"Ole Miss.\"\n\nFor most of my life, I was among the oblivious. The historical context of \"Ole Miss\" was news to me when late last year a former high school classmate of mine posted a 2019 Chronicle of Higher Ed article on Facebook detailing origins of the university's hoary nickname. I am a Southern white woman who has always spoken those words, \"Ole Miss,\" in the context of a dearly held rivalry between the university in Oxford and Mississippi State University, where most of my family has attended school for generations. It once vaguely connoted home to me, recalling Thanksgivings at my grandmother's house in Tupelo, the television in the living room blaring the Egg Bowl, the annual football faceoff between the schools, as we cleaned up the kitchen and carefully put away the leftovers.\n\nCheerleaders carry \"Ole Miss\" flags during a game against the Memphis Tigers at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium on October 1, 2016, in Oxford, Mississippi. Jonathan Bachman/Getty I'm not sure I've ever heard anyone refer to it as the University of Mississippi until recently, but the discovery that words that I once regarded as neutral, even charming, contain a bitter connotation has changed that. For weeks, I couldn't stop thinking about this new context. I quizzed everyone I encountered about the once-beloved nickname; in bars, at work, on the phone with folks back home-no one knew. That racism often hides in language is not a new concept to me; I grew up as a white girl in the South. But that also means I hid from those realities behind my privilege and youth for an unforgivably long time. Even as a child, I often sensed some lingering evil when racism was dressed up as something innocuous-yet in the name \"Ole Miss,\" for nearly three decades, I heard only a folksy alternative to an unwieldy school name. \"If you talk to students, they will say that it weighs on their everyday experiences on this campus.\" A few weeks after reading the article, I wandered the campus with my cousin, struck by the depth of the school's commitment to the branding-wondering how I went so long without knowing, becoming fixated on how the name that literally looms over everyone's heads affects life for students and staff of color. The student population is 76 percent white and only 13 percent Black; similarly, the faculty is 78 percent white and only 6 percent Black. \"If you talk to students-and this is both students in general, Black, white, and otherwise, but especially with students of color-they will say that it weighs on their everyday experiences on this campus-the 'it' being the racial history of the campus,\" says Brian Foster, an assistant professor in the sociology department, who is Black. Interviews with students add further dimensions to Foster's assessment. While Love is careful to point out that as a graduate student she is not on campus as often as undergraduates are, she notes, \"Our ancestors already paid the price. We don't need to add tax by continuing to have those symbols of oppression at the University of Mississippi.\" For her part, Yasmine Malone, a rising senior at the university, likes the nickname itself, stripped of its origins, but it bothers her that she feels like the school is less than clear about where it comes from. A classmate, Isabel Spafford, says she heard the claim on a campus tour that the name is taken from a train that supposedly ran through the state from Memphis. Malone notes that despite efforts to move forward, there is also still an undeniable pattern of racism in behavior at the University of Mississippi-whether it's the Black fraternity house that was burned to the ground in 1988 or the Confederate rally held on campus in February 2019 or the powerful old Southern families who donate to the university on the condition that the Confederate imagery remain intact and undisturbed. \"I would like for us to adopt a mindset that we no longer want this to represent who we are,\" Malone says. \"But the fact of it is, that is exactly who we are. The political, economic, and social forces that guide decisions around Ole Miss are all very much still racist.\" She clarifies that she's being more candid with me than she feels she can generally be in her life on campus. While the University of Mississippi has grappled with its Confederate history for decades, wrestling with these demons never makes for a straightforward fight. And in the broader context of the state of Mississippi, where strains of white supremacy persist from the not-so-distant past, it has been even more fraught. In 1848, the university was \"very explicitly founded as an institution where slaveholder sons can attend rather than going to those fanatical colleges and universities in the north where they might imbibe anti-slavery ideology, and come back hostile to the institution,\" says Anne Twitty, an associate history professor at the University of Mississippi. \"The overwhelming majority of the University of Mississippi's first students came from slaveholding families.\" As Twitty points out in a recent piece for the Atlantic , when the various monuments and memorials to the Confederacy began to appear on campus in the late 1800s and early 1900s, they were constructed not in grief for lives that had been lost, but rather in celebration for the power structure preserved through Jim Crow. The university did not accept its first Black student, James Meredith, until 1962, and Meredith's acceptance came only after a lengthy legal battle. Violent protests ensued ; two died and some 300 more were injured. \"Why would we expect this to be a habitable place? Why would we expect this to be a welcoming and vibrant place?\" \"It's a practical matter,\" Foster says. \"If Black folks have only been allowed to be here, either as students, as faculty, as administrators, for a fraction of the university's history, it only follows that they will be underrepresented in those spaces to which they haven't historically had access.\" He adds, \"Why would we expect this to be a habitable place? Why would we expect this to be a welcoming and vibrant place?\" In 2006, a statue of Meredith was erected on campus. In 2014, three fraternity brothers flung a noose over its neck. The university has made attempts to tackle some of the most glaring representations of this racism, but its official actions don't always translate to the broader culture on campus. For the better part of the 20th century , for instance, the school's mascot was Colonel Reb, a mustachioed caricature of a plantation owner who wears a haughty expression, leaning heavily on a cane. He is sometimes depicted against a backdrop of a Confederate flag. The university officially retired him in 2003-but the image is far from defunct. Independent groups attend sporting events with stuffed Colonel Rebs for children; men dress as the former mascot and pose with sorority girls and fraternity boys. University of Mississippi senior Chris Baxley wears the costume of school mascot Colonel Reb during the Kentucky-Mississippi basketball game in Memphis on March 8, 1997. Mark Humphrey/AP In 2009, former Chancellor Dan Jones asked the university's band, known as the Pride of the South, to stop playing \"From Dixie With Love,\" which blended the Battle Hymn of the Republic with Dixie that builds toward a chant: \"The South will rise again.\" In 2016, they were asked to stop playing any variation on the unofficial anthem of the Confederate States of America. Like the mascot, both songs have disappeared officially, but that does not stop tailgaters from blaring the anthem from booming speakers in oversize pickups anyway. Even though the school banned the Mississippi flag on campus because of the Confederate symbolism prominently displayed therein, there's still the Our State Flag Foundation, a group of people pissed that the university no longer flies it. The Facebook group, which hovers around 25,000 members, is a forum where angry white people bemoan diversity and inclusion efforts on their best days and attack specific people of color in the university community on their worst. They have a booth in the Grove on game days. The way the university has dealt with the name has been even more opaque. In 2014, a Sensitivity and Respect Committee, comprised of administrators and other faculty, and a handful of students, aimed to make the campus more diverse and inclusive, releasing a report that alludes to the moniker but avoids addressing its racist history directly. While the official recommendation is, the University of Mississippi should \"consider the implications of calling itself 'Ole Miss' in various contexts,\" most of that section of the report appears to brush the roots of the name aside: \"Regardless of its origin, the vast majority of those associated with our university has a strong affection for 'Ole Miss' and do not associate its use with race in any way. And the vast majority of those who view us from a distance associate the term 'Ole Miss' with a strong, vibrant, modern university - and the Manning family, The Blind Side , The [sic] 2008 Presidential Debate, and great sports teams.\" If the University of Mississippi is a formal name, \"Ole Miss\" conveys a powerful emotion. In June 2017, another report , this one from the Chancellor's Advisory Committee on History and Contextualization, was released. It held specific instructions for clarifying the history of the Confederate iconography on campus-everything from the names of buildings to the 12-foot-tall Tiffany stained-glass window depicting the University Greys, the students who fought for the Confederacy in the Civil War (all of whom were killed or wounded in combat). It was, in many ways, a massive victory for the Black students and faculty who had long been fighting for a more inclusive, reflective campus. \"Ole Miss,\" though, was not even mentioned in this report. \"Those efforts for change have always registered to me as symbolism, surface level, more than tangible, material, structural,\" Foster says. Part of this may be because if the University of Mississippi is a formal name, \"Ole Miss\" conveys a powerful emotion-and a lucrative brand. As Hudson put it to me, \"We have not moved on from [Ole Miss] because of capitalism...they're making money off of that.\" Forbes estimates that the annual revenue-over an average of three years-brought in from the \"Ole Miss\" football program alone is $84 million, making it one of the top 25 most lucrative college teams in the country. In 2016, the school expanded Vaught-Hemingway Stadium to hold 64,038 football fans; it is now the largest stadium in Mississippi. Still, grassroots efforts to change the name have come in small fits and starts over the years, though the overall conversation has lacked the urgency that has toppled other Confederate symbols. And when it has come up, it has typically inspired only lukewarm response. Torie Marion White, who serves as an assistant director at the Ole Miss Alumni Association, overseeing alumni relations for the School of Applied Science and the School of Engineering, as well as the Black Alumni Advisory Council and the Grove Society, tells Mother Jones that several of her fellow Black alums have taken to referring to the school as \"New Miss,\" she says, creating T-shirts and tumblers with their moniker featured in place of the old. Nevertheless, such swag is hard to come by; when I searched for anything like that online, I came up only with beauty pageant references. Just this year, Zach Borenstein, a white graduate student, wrote an op-ed in the student newspaper, the Daily Mississippian , calling for the death of \"Ole Miss.\" \"Language matters, but we often get used to saying things that normalize harm,\" he wrote in early February. \"Certain phrases diminish or denigrate groups of people, and if not addressed, these phrases become so commonplace that those using them do not even consider their origins and effects.\" (At the end of May, Borenstein was arrested for defacing the Confederate statue at the campus entrance. He slashed his hand with a knife to cast bloody handprints upon the white marble, framing the words \"spiritual genocide,\" spray-painted in black.) A week after Borenstein's op-ed published, another appeared, this one by a white then-junior named Lauren Moses. It was headlined \"Let's keep saying 'Ole Miss. ' \" : \"My friends and I recently discussed the waning respect for tradition on our campus. From changing the school mascot to governing bodies voting to move the Confederate statue to contextualizing many buildings on campus, Ole Miss has lost its identity.\" The core of her argument is that history fades, and that those symbols are not celebrated for their origins, but in spite of them. Her point isn't particularly novel; it is in fact all too familiar. It ripples through the campus and an extended community of (mostly white) fans and alumni in all sorts of forms. Alumnus Jon Rawl, co-founder of the Colonel Reb Foundation, lobbies the university to bring back the mascot from the early aughts. I asked him what he'd say to Black students and faculty who are disturbed by the Confederate imagery on campus, including the mascot. He replied simply, \"Well, the Confederate stuff was there before they were.\" Over the past few weeks in particular, I've considered what it means to love the South, as I deeply do. What once was partially buried under decades of careful erasure is now stark and exposed. I cannot look away from racism, especially where it flourishes in my home. Harm is difficult to quantify, which in turn makes it a tricky defense against the thing that harms. When people who have been actively disempowered are those being harmed, it makes those voices harder to hear, or maybe easier for those in power to ignore. As I talked to more and more people in the campus community-most of them Black-I couldn't help but feel the magnitude of all they are up against. Before Foster was a sociology professor, he came to study at the University of Mississippi as a student. He tells me it was the first time he feared for his safety based on his identity. Oxford was the first place he was ever called the n-word by a white person. It was the first place where two white boys pulled up next to him at a stoplight, rolled down the window, and asked, \"Where you boys going tonight?\" like they were entitled to know. While scrolling through the Our State Flag Foundation's Facebook page, I came across a screenshot of Foster's staff page, and my stomach churned, alongside a photo of two Black female graduates. They had drawn the ire of the group for their activism to remove the state flag from campus. There are 69 comments below. \"You really do have to have a lot of strength and a lot of energy to continuously put your Black or Brown body in these spaces and fight for those things, because it is not for the faint of heart.\" Similarly, Marion White, who runs the Black Alumni Advisory Council, says she's \"been the only minority in a room my entire life,\" and still, the day came when she was manhandled by a campus police officer because she was in the parking area for elite alumni on game day. When she told him she worked for the university, he wouldn't believe her. (Marion White says the officer remains on the force.) My conversations with students echo these experiences. Malone, the senior, tells me that while she's found a vibrant Black community at the university, she has stepped back from activism and fighting back against the university's Confederate symbols. It's become too much for her emotionally; she has to focus on her studies, which is a tall order in itself when attending classes means passing former slave quarters and hearing her university referred to in antebellum language. Love is still committed to getting her MFA, but concludes, \"You really do have to have a lot of strength and a lot of energy to continuously put your Black or Brown body in these spaces and fight for those things, because it is not for the faint of heart.\" Most of the men and women I interviewed also mentioned a photo that went viral in July 2019 of three white fraternity brothers, wearing broad smiles and posing in front of the bullet-ridden sign memorializing Emmett Till, the Black 14-year-old who was tortured and lynched in 1955 after a white woman falsely accused him of whistling at her. Two of the boys in the photo held guns. The sign itself is so often vandalized, so frequently shot at, that it's impossible to know if the bullet holes are from the guns clutched in the hands of the Kappa Alpha brothers. They were suspended from their fraternity, but ultimately allowed to remain enrolled as students. \"I just feel like if those boys were Black men who shot up a Confederate sign, there would probably be way more consequences, way more outrage, way more punishment for them,\" Love tells me. \"You understand that the underlining thing about it is this deeply entrenched white privilege and to me, being a woman of color, a Black woman, particularly...it just makes you feel powerless.\" This incident reveals a bright line for these individuals on campus, where all the changes made so far seem to stumble short of addressing a larger cultural problem. The university has put a significant amount of time and money into trying to leave the past behind, but it cannot truly overcome its legacy when it chooses to retain an identity that romanticizes a time when Black people were considered so subhuman that they could not address a white woman directly. Language provides all sorts of nook and crannies for white supremacy to hide; can it be truly overthrown without addressing what's really in a name? A name that is so intertwined with the identity of a place is tough to disentangle. Some of the students who make a conscious effort to use the full name of the university would slip up in our conversations; I have promised myself to make the same effort and sometimes my tongue still catches on it. To stay vigilant enough to thwart the connection between your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your mind requires a kind of prickly awareness that feels uncomfortable at first, but soon, it dissolves into normalcy. It is difficult to imagine the University of Mississippi as anything but \"Ole Miss.\" It is also impossible to completely divorce the school from the values held in its Confederate past without going all-in on moving forward and making the change. Moving statues, contextualizing symbols, building committees, and scheduling programming toward a more inclusive and diverse campus are all good and important. But that work feels dwarfed by the name of the place, when the words on the lips of everyone in that community are an homage to the antebellum South. Language provides all sorts of nook and crannies for white supremacy to hide; can it be truly overthrown without addressing what's really in a name? James Meredith, the first Black man to attend the University of Mississippi, wears his \"New Miss\" hat, a gift from Pastor Robert West. West said, \"The day James Meredith stepped onto the campus of The University of Mississippi, it was no longer 'Ole Miss.'\" Suzi Altman/Zuma Names, though, even the ones so tied up in a community, in its identity, can change. Look around. This reckoning over what's in a name, which has played out time and time again, and time again, is once again doing so in the names of schools and parks and military bases and even country music bands. With time, few will remember what they once were. Once, the University of Mississippi was simply that. It could be that again; it could also be reborn as something better. It may not happen today or tomorrow. But it will. It must. Of course changing the name will not magically dissipate centuries of systemic racism and inequality, but it is a simple step forward. Until then I feel somewhat heartened thinking about the fight itself-which, Love says, \"is important because it shows that we are here, it shows that we belong, and it does not validate our worth, but it does validate us being here.\" \"It shows that hey, we're here, we're staying. We acknowledge that these things, these symbols, hurt.\" Correction: An earlier version of this article applied a term for the original Confederate States flag, in use 1861-1863, to a later version formerly displayed in the state flag of Mississippi.\n\nI'm not sure I've ever heard anyone refer to it as the University of Mississippi until recently, but the discovery that words that I once regarded as neutral, even charming, contain a bitter connotation has changed that. For weeks, I couldn't stop thinking about this new context. I quizzed everyone I encountered about the once-beloved nickname; in bars, at work, on the phone with folks back home-no one knew. That racism often hides in language is not a new concept to me; I grew up as a white girl in the South. But that also means I hid from those realities behind my privilege and youth for an unforgivably long time. Even as a child, I often sensed some lingering evil when racism was dressed up as something innocuous-yet in the name \"Ole Miss,\" for nearly three decades, I heard only a folksy alternative to an unwieldy school name.\n\nA few weeks after reading the article, I wandered the campus with my cousin, struck by the depth of the school's commitment to the branding-wondering how I went so long without knowing, becoming fixated on how the name that literally looms over everyone's heads affects life for students and staff of color. The student population is 76 percent white and only 13 percent Black; similarly, the faculty is 78 percent white and only 6 percent Black. \"If you talk to students-and this is both students in general, Black, white, and otherwise, but especially with students of color-they will say that it weighs on their everyday experiences on this campus-the 'it' being the racial history of the campus,\" says Brian Foster, an assistant professor in the sociology department, who is Black.\n\nInterviews with students add further dimensions to Foster's assessment. While Love is careful to point out that as a graduate student she is not on campus as often as undergraduates are, she notes, \"Our ancestors already paid the price. We don't need to add tax by continuing to have those symbols of oppression at the University of Mississippi.\"\n\nFor her part, Yasmine Malone, a rising senior at the university, likes the nickname itself, stripped of its origins, but it bothers her that she feels like the school is less than clear about where it comes from. A classmate, Isabel Spafford, says she heard the claim on a campus tour that the name is taken from a train that supposedly ran through the state from Memphis.\n\nMalone notes that despite efforts to move forward, there is also still an undeniable pattern of racism in behavior at the University of Mississippi-whether it's the Black fraternity house that was burned to the ground in 1988 or the Confederate rally held on campus in February 2019 or the powerful old Southern families who donate to the university on the condition that the Confederate imagery remain intact and undisturbed. \"I would like for us to adopt a mindset that we no longer want this to represent who we are,\" Malone says. \"But the fact of it is, that is exactly who we are. The political, economic, and social forces that guide decisions around Ole Miss are all very much still racist.\"\n\nShe clarifies that she's being more candid with me than she feels she can generally be in her life on campus.\n\nWhile the University of Mississippi has grappled with its Confederate history for decades, wrestling with these demons never makes for a straightforward fight. And in the broader context of the state of Mississippi, where strains of white supremacy persist from the not-so-distant past, it has been even more fraught.\n\nIn 1848, the university was \"very explicitly founded as an institution where slaveholder sons can attend rather than going to those fanatical colleges and universities in the north where they might imbibe anti-slavery ideology, and come back hostile to the institution,\" says Anne Twitty, an associate history professor at the University of Mississippi. \"The overwhelming majority of the University of Mississippi's first students came from slaveholding families.\"\n\nAs Twitty points out in a recent piece for the Atlantic , when the various monuments and memorials to the Confederacy began to appear on campus in the late 1800s and early 1900s, they were constructed not in grief for lives that had been lost, but rather in celebration for the power structure preserved through Jim Crow.\n\nThe university did not accept its first Black student, James Meredith, until 1962, and Meredith's acceptance came only after a lengthy legal battle. Violent protests ensued ; two died and some 300 more were injured.\n\n\"It's a practical matter,\" Foster says. \"If Black folks have only been allowed to be here, either as students, as faculty, as administrators, for a fraction of the university's history, it only follows that they will be underrepresented in those spaces to which they haven't historically had access.\"\n\nHe adds, \"Why would we expect this to be a habitable place? Why would we expect this to be a welcoming and vibrant place?\"\n\nIn 2006, a statue of Meredith was erected on campus. In 2014, three fraternity brothers flung a noose over its neck.\n\nThe university has made attempts to tackle some of the most glaring representations of this racism, but its official actions don't always translate to the broader culture on campus. For the better part of the 20th century , for instance, the school's mascot was Colonel Reb, a mustachioed caricature of a plantation owner who wears a haughty expression, leaning heavily on a cane. He is sometimes depicted against a backdrop of a Confederate flag. The university officially retired him in 2003-but the image is far from defunct. Independent groups attend sporting events with stuffed Colonel Rebs for children; men dress as the former mascot and pose with sorority girls and fraternity boys.\n\nUniversity of Mississippi senior Chris Baxley wears the costume of school mascot Colonel Reb during the Kentucky-Mississippi basketball game in Memphis on March 8, 1997. Mark Humphrey/AP In 2009, former Chancellor Dan Jones asked the university's band, known as the Pride of the South, to stop playing \"From Dixie With Love,\" which blended the Battle Hymn of the Republic with Dixie that builds toward a chant: \"The South will rise again.\" In 2016, they were asked to stop playing any variation on the unofficial anthem of the Confederate States of America. Like the mascot, both songs have disappeared officially, but that does not stop tailgaters from blaring the anthem from booming speakers in oversize pickups anyway. Even though the school banned the Mississippi flag on campus because of the Confederate symbolism prominently displayed therein, there's still the Our State Flag Foundation, a group of people pissed that the university no longer flies it. The Facebook group, which hovers around 25,000 members, is a forum where angry white people bemoan diversity and inclusion efforts on their best days and attack specific people of color in the university community on their worst. They have a booth in the Grove on game days. The way the university has dealt with the name has been even more opaque. In 2014, a Sensitivity and Respect Committee, comprised of administrators and other faculty, and a handful of students, aimed to make the campus more diverse and inclusive, releasing a report that alludes to the moniker but avoids addressing its racist history directly. While the official recommendation is, the University of Mississippi should \"consider the implications of calling itself 'Ole Miss' in various contexts,\" most of that section of the report appears to brush the roots of the name aside: \"Regardless of its origin, the vast majority of those associated with our university has a strong affection for 'Ole Miss' and do not associate its use with race in any way.

Alumnus Jon Rawl, co-founder of the Colonel Reb Foundation, lobbies the university to bring back the mascot from the early aughts. I asked him what he'd say to Black students and faculty who are disturbed by the Confederate imagery on campus, including the mascot. He replied simply, \"Well, the Confederate stuff was there before they were.\"\n\nOver the past few weeks in particular, I've considered what it means to love the South, as I deeply do. What once was partially buried under decades of careful erasure is now stark and exposed. I cannot look away from racism, especially where it flourishes in my home.\n\nHarm is difficult to quantify, which in turn makes it a tricky defense against the thing that harms. When people who have been actively disempowered are those being harmed, it makes those voices harder to hear, or maybe easier for those in power to ignore.\n\nAs I talked to more and more people in the campus community-most of them Black-I couldn't help but feel the magnitude of all they are up against. Before Foster was a sociology professor, he came to study at the University of Mississippi as a student. He tells me it was the first time he feared for his safety based on his identity. Oxford was the first place he was ever called the n-word by a white person. It was the first place where two white boys pulled up next to him at a stoplight, rolled down the window, and asked, \"Where you boys going tonight?\" like they were entitled to know. While scrolling through the Our State Flag Foundation's Facebook page, I came across a screenshot of Foster's staff page, and my stomach churned, alongside a photo of two Black female graduates. They had drawn the ire of the group for their activism to remove the state flag from campus. There are 69 comments below.\n\nSimilarly, Marion White, who runs the Black Alumni Advisory Council, says she's \"been the only minority in a room my entire life,\" and still, the day came when she was manhandled by a campus police officer because she was in the parking area for elite alumni on game day. When she told him she worked for the university, he wouldn't believe her. (Marion White says the officer remains on the force.)\n\nMy conversations with students echo these experiences. Malone, the senior, tells me that while she's found a vibrant Black community at the university, she has stepped back from activism and fighting back against the university's Confederate symbols. It's become too much for her emotionally; she has to focus on her studies, which is a tall order in itself when attending classes means passing former slave quarters and hearing her university referred to in antebellum language.\n\nLove is still committed to getting her MFA, but concludes, \"You really do have to have a lot of strength and a lot of energy to continuously put your Black or Brown body in these spaces and fight for those things, because it is not for the faint of heart.\"\n\nMost of the men and women I interviewed also mentioned a photo that went viral in July 2019 of three white fraternity brothers, wearing broad smiles and posing in front of the bullet-ridden sign memorializing Emmett Till, the Black 14-year-old who was tortured and lynched in 1955 after a white woman falsely accused him of whistling at her. Two of the boys in the photo held guns. The sign itself is so often vandalized, so frequently shot at, that it's impossible to know if the bullet holes are from the guns clutched in the hands of the Kappa Alpha brothers. They were suspended from their fraternity, but ultimately allowed to remain enrolled as students.\n\n\"I just feel like if those boys were Black men who shot up a Confederate sign, there would probably be way more consequences, way more outrage, way more punishment for them,\" Love tells me. \"You understand that the underlining thing about it is this deeply entrenched white privilege and to me, being a woman of color, a Black woman, particularly...it just makes you feel powerless.\"\n\nThis incident reveals a bright line for these individuals on campus, where all the changes made so far seem to stumble short of addressing a larger cultural problem. The university has put a significant amount of time and money into trying to leave the past behind, but it cannot truly overcome its legacy when it chooses to retain an identity that romanticizes a time when Black people were considered so subhuman that they could not address a white woman directly.\n\nA name that is so intertwined with the identity of a place is tough to disentangle. Some of the students who make a conscious effort to use the full name of the university would slip up in our conversations; I have promised myself to make the same effort and sometimes my tongue still catches on it. To stay vigilant enough to thwart the connection between your eyes and your ears and your mouth and your mind requires a kind of prickly awareness that feels uncomfortable at first, but soon, it dissolves into normalcy.\n\nIt is difficult to imagine the University of Mississippi as anything but \"Ole Miss.\" It is also impossible to completely divorce the school from the values held in its Confederate past without going all-in on moving forward and making the change. Moving statues, contextualizing symbols, building committees, and scheduling programming toward a more inclusive and diverse campus are all good and important. But that work feels dwarfed by the name of the place, when the words on the lips of everyone in that community are an homage to the antebellum South. Language provides all sorts of nook and crannies for white supremacy to hide; can it be truly overthrown without addressing what's really in a name?\n\nJames Meredith, the first Black man to attend the University of Mississippi, wears his \"New Miss\" hat, a gift from Pastor Robert West. West said, \"The day James Meredith stepped onto the campus of The University of Mississippi, it was no longer 'Ole Miss.'\" Suzi Altman/Zuma Names, though, even the ones so tied up in a community, in its identity, can change. Look around. This reckoning over what's in a name, which has played out time and time again, and time again, is once again doing so in the names of schools and parks and military bases and even country music bands. With time, few will remember what they once were. Once, the University of Mississippi was simply that. It could be that again; it could also be reborn as something better. It may not happen today or tomorrow. But it will. It must. Of course changing the name will not magically dissipate centuries of systemic racism and inequality, but it is a simple step forward. Until then I feel somewhat heartened thinking about the fight itself-which, Love says, \"is important because it shows that we are here, it shows that we belong, and it does not validate our worth, but it does validate us being here.\" \"It shows that hey, we're here, we're staying. We acknowledge that these things, these symbols, hurt.\" Correction: An earlier version of this article applied a term for the original Confederate States flag, in use 1861-1863, to a later version formerly displayed in the state flag of Mississippi.\n\nNames, though, even the ones so tied up in a community, in its identity, can change.

Meredith was the first black student after the university was desegregated in 1962.\n\nRELATED: Investigation picks up in Mississippi man's hanging death\n\n\"This shameful and ignorant act is an insult to all Americans and a violation of our most strongly-held values,\" U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder said in a statement. \"No one should ever be made to feel threatened or intimidated because of what they look like or who they are.\"\n\nA spokesman for the university said Harris withdrew from Ole Miss in the spring of 2014, not long after the incident.\n\nThere were others involved, the Department of Justice said. Three members of the University of Mississippi Sigma Phi Epsilon chapter were thought to have hanged the rope and flag around the statue.\n\nThey have never been named, but the national fraternity suspended the chapter and expelled the three members from the organization a week after the incident. Sigma Phi Epsilon CEO Brian C. Warren Jr. said it was \"embarrassing\" that they were members.\n\nThe Department of Justice said the investigation is ongoing.\n\nUniversity of Mississippi Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs Brandi Hephner LaBanc said the situation is regrettable for all involved, including the student who was charged.\n\nRELATED: 'Exclusively for White People' stickers hung in Austin businesses\n\n\"I can't help but feel the pain of the student and the parents who will now feel the full weight of our justice system, but also feel the pain of our campus community and the entire Ole Miss family, which suffered greatly from the terrible act committed a year ago,\" she said. \"We're hopeful that this indictment will begin to bring closure and the next step in healing for our university.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared at NBCNews.com\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

In the video, the woman appears to be walking toward the crowd while recording them on her phone.\n\nThe woman and the two men, whose identities NBC News has not independently verified, did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nOn the right side of the frame, another man can be seen jumping up and down and appearing to make a noise to simulate an ape.

(AP) -- The University of Mississippi has removed the state flag on its Oxford campus Monday morning because the banner contains the Confederate battle emblem, which some see as a painful reminder of slavery and segregation.\n\nInterim Chancellor Morris Stocks ordered the flag lowered and said it was being sent to the university's archives.\n\nThe action came days after the student senate, the faculty senate and other groups adopted a student-led resolution calling for removal of the banner from campus.\n\nRELATED: University of Mississippi student senate votes to remove Confederate symbol\n\n\"As Mississippi's flagship university, we have a deep love and respect for our state,\" Stocks said in a statement Monday. \"Because the flag remains Mississippi's official banner, this was a hard decision. I understand the flag represents tradition and honor to some. But to others, the flag means that some members of the Ole Miss family are not welcomed or valued.\"\n\nSince 1894, the Mississippi flag has had the Confederate battle emblem in the upper left corner -- a blue X with 13 white stars, over a field of red. Residents chose to keep the flag during a 2001 statewide vote.\n\nHowever, the public display of Confederate symbols has been subject to heated debates since the June massacre of nine black worshippers at a church in Charleston, South Carolina. Police said the attack was racially motivated. The white man charged in the slayings had posed with a Confederate battle flag in photos posted online before the massacre.\n\nMore than 200 people took part in a remove-the-flag rally Oct. 16 on the Oxford campus. It was sponsored by the university chapter of the NAACP.\n\nThe University of Mississippi has struggled with Old South symbolism for decades. In 1962, deadly riots broke out when James Meredith was enrolled as the first black student, under court order. Ole Miss administrators have tried to distance the school from Confederate symbols. Sports teams are still called the Rebels, but the university several years ago retired the Colonel Rebel mascot -- a white-haired old man some thought resembled a plantation owner. The university also banned sticks in the football stadium nearly 20 years ago, which eliminated most Confederate battle flags that fans carried.\n\nRELATED: Some Virginians are resisting Confederate flag ban\n\n\"The University of Mississippi community came to the realization years ago that the Confederate battle flag did not represent many of our core values, such as civility and respect for others,\" Stocks said in the statement Monday. \"Since that time, we have become a stronger and better university. We join other leaders in our state who are calling for a change in the state flag.\"\n\nSeveral Mississippi cities and counties have stopped flying the state flag since the Charleston shootings. The state's three historically black universities had stopped flying the flag earlier, and the state's only black U.S. representative, Democrat Bennie Thompson, does not display the state flag in his offices because of the Confederate symbol.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

      "text": "I prosecuted Watergate and never feared for our democracy - but Greg Abbott has me worried\n\nFeatured Shows\n\nMSNBC TV\n\nMore\n\nFollow msnbc\n\nMore Brands\n\nMore Shows\n\nI am not an alarmist by nature. From my time as a prosecutor investigating the Watergate scandal, I have never doubted that justice would prevail or that democracy would survive. I never doubted that our union would last - until now.\n\nTexas Gov. Greg Abbott's actions at the southern border and his reaction to the Supreme Court's decision in favor of the federal government make me fear for the continued existence of the United States of America. So does his signing of an expansive new law that gives the state's law enforcement powers over immigration that rightly belong to the federal government, not to Texas or any other state. In fact, should the Supreme Court rule against the Biden administration's challenge to that law, that would have consequences for every federal policy , not just immigration policy.\n\nOn its own Abbott's statement is enough to make me fear our future as a federal republic.\n\nIt has long been accepted that the federal government controls immigration, national security, international relations and our borders. Despite the clarity of federal and state roles, in July last year, Abbott placed a 1000-foot-long string of buoys, separated by serrated saw blades and supporting a submerged mesh net, in the middle of the Rio Grande near Eagle Pass, Texas. Not only did this unconstitutional move spark protests from the Mexican government and migrant advocates , but also at least two migrants were found dead in the buoy barriers . In addition, among other incidents, a pregnant migrant was rescued but miscarried while stuck in the wire . That makes it inhumane, as well as unconstitutional.\n\nYet, while the courts forced Abbott to remove that dangerous obstacle to migrants and transportation from the Rio Grande, the Texas National Guard continued to install razor wire at the edge of the state's land border. When federal agents cut that wire last fall, Texas sued the U.S. for damage to state property . Last week, the Supreme Court ruled against Abbott and affirmed the Department of Homeland Security's right to remove the wire and to have access to the border to carry out the department's duties. Two days later, Abbott issued a statement threatening to stonewall, much as then-President Richard Nixon did when he was subpoenaed for White House tape recordings that he didn't want my team of Watergate prosecutors to have.\n\nAnd, to make matters worse, Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, advised Abbott to ignore the justices and \"tell the court to go to hell.\" Other Republican lawmakers joined in with similar sentiments. Dozens of governors from red states , many with no international borders with Mexico, signed a statement supporting Abbott. A compact between any of those states and Texas without congressional approval would directly violate Article I of the Constitution.\n\nBut even without Roy or the support of a single other Republican governor, Abbott's statement on its own is enough to make me fear our future as a federal republic. It includes misstatements of law and numerous factual errors, and its words sound like a call for a 21st century civil war. The opening sentence alone - \"The federal government has broken the compact between the United States and the States\" - would not be out of place among the declarations of secession issued nearly 165 years ago.\n\nAbbott defends his actions by citing \"Article IV, § 4, which promises that the federal government 'shall protect each [State] against invasion,' and Article I, § 10, Clause 3, which acknowledges 'the States' sovereign interest in protecting their borders.'  He goes on to claim \"The failure of the Biden Administration to fulfill the duties imposed by Article IV, § 4 has triggered Article I, § 10, Clause 3, which reserves to this State the right of self-defense.\"\n\nIn addition to his wrong-headed legal assertions, Abbott's factual claims are equally erroneous.\n\nBut neither article supports his argument. Article I does not give a state a right to self-defense; it does the opposite by setting forth what states cannot do without congressional approval \"unless actually invaded, or in such imminent Danger as will not admit of delay.\" Similarly, Section 4 of Article IV only says \"the United States ... shall protect each [State] against Invasion.\" The definition of invasion as used in those articles does not include an influx of unarmed migrants (or even drug trafficking) to justify Texas' conduct here.\n\nIn addition to his wrong-headed legal assertions, Abbott's factual claims are equally erroneous. He claims that \"President Biden has refused to enforce those laws and has even violated them. The result is that he has smashed records for illegal immigration.\" That is false. Biden has expelled a larger share of migrants than Trump did . And Congress, not the president, has the power to solve and fund the border solution. But Republicans, directed by Trump, are blocking the passage of a border deal to make it a political issue for the election.\n\nIf Abbott's statement, with the support of 25 Republican states, is not to become a prelude to secession, what can Congress and the president do?\n\nThe president might have to mobilize the state's National Guard on the federal government's behalf, as President Dwight Eisenhower did in 1957 to integrate Little Rock high schools. President John F.  Kennedy did the same in 1962 to allow students, including my law school classmate James Meredith, to enter the University of Mississippi over state opposition.\n\nOr, if the statement this week by Texas Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick is implemented, the administration could seek to hold Texas officials in contempt. Patrick said Monday that the state will continue to build razor wire on the U.S.-Mexico border, despite the Supreme Court order. \"We are putting up wire ... everywhere we can,\" he told Fox News. \"We will continue. We will not stop. If they cut it, we will replace it.\"\n\nThat would be direct defiance of the Supreme Court's order, for which action would be justified. And, as citizens, we also can take action by lobbying for passage of the soon-to-be-completed bipartisan immigration bill.\n\nAbbott had his chance to convince the Supreme Court that he was right, but he lost and he must obey that ruling. The high court has been the final arbiter of disputes like this for hundreds of years. When a unanimous court ordered Nixon to hand over the tapes that ended his presidency, he did so.\n\nI hope that is not necessary for President Joe Biden to nationalize the state guard, but it may be all that stands in the way of the end of the United States of America as then-President Barack Obama said we were, and the establishment of the Red States and the Blue States.\n\nJill Wine-Banks is an attorney, author and MSNBC legal analyst.

Trump under scrutiny in multiple investigations. Trump call NY Atty. General investigating him \"racist.\" Biden signs PACT Act into law. Russian warplanes destroyed in Crimea blasts. GOP peddles lies in effort to discredit FBI search.\n\nMERRICK GARLAND, U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL: We will follow the facts wherever they lead.\n\nLAWRENCE O`DONNELL, MSNBC HOST: Attorney General Merrick Garland gets tonight`s \"LAST WORD\", the love and power with Stephanie Ruhle starts now.\n\nSTEPHANIE RUHLE, MSNBC HOST: Tonight, the growing legal challenges for the former president, we spent hours taking the Fifth in one investigation. Just days after the FBI search at Mar-a-Lago for another. Then as Republicans rally round Trump, Democrats celebrate some big wins. We`ll fact check some of the fiction coming from the right.\n\nPlus, the brutal war on Ukraine now nearly six months old Ukrainians pushed back while fighting intensifies near a nuclear plant. A former four star general is standing by as THE 11TH HOUR gets underway on this Wednesday night.\n\nGood evening, once again, I`m Stephanie Ruhle. Tonight brand new reporting about what led the FBI to execute a search warrant Monday at Trump`s Florida home. The Wall Street Journal reporting that the feds may have gotten a tip off from an insider after officials visited Mar-a-Lago back in June to ask about government documents possibly stored there. The Journal reports this, in the following weeks, however, someone familiar with the stored papers told investigators there may still be more classified documents at the private club. After the National Archives Retrieved 15 boxes earlier in the year people familiar with the matter said.\n\nNBC News has not independently confirmed this reporting. So far, the Justice Department has not commented on the search either. But Trump and his supporters are ramping up their baseless attacks, even suggesting that the FBI could be planting incriminating evidence.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nSEN. RAND PAUL, (R) KENTUCKY: Do I know that the boxes of material they took from Mar-a-Lago that they won`t put things in those boxes to entrap him? How do we know --\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: His lawyer said they brought in backpacks, what was in those backpacks, was -- did they bring those in to fill them up? Or did they have something in there?\n\nUNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: I`m concerned that they may have planted something, you know, at this point who knows?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRUHLE: Let`s just stop there. Because the truth matters, but only if you hear it and millions of people are watching that. And there is absolutely no evidence that the FBI planted anything.\n\nWhat Donald Trump is facing is legal scrutiny like no other president before him from both federal and state officials. And today in a separate investigation, he finally showed up at the offices of New York`s Attorney General Letitia James for a deposition in her investigation into his business practices. A source tells NBC that over the course of four hours, Trump took the Fifth more than 440 times. His own lawyer tells NBC News he did answer one question, his name. He added that Trump also read a statement in which he accused the Attorney General of trying to destroy him. Trump attacked her earlier today on his social media site. And over the weekend during his CPAC speech down in Texas.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nDONALD TRUMP, (R) FORMER UNITED STATES PRESIDENT: I got a racist Attorney General in New York that`s been after me for years. She campaigned on the fact I will get Donald Trump says nothing about me, I will get, terrible people is a terrible people. I built a great company.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRUHLE: Late today Attorney General James issued a statement of our own saying the investigation will continue. With that, let`s continue this hour and get smarter with the help of our leadoff panel, Jackie Alemany, who has been scooping up story after story this week, Congressional Investigations reporter for The Washington Post and an MSNBC Contributor, Barbara McQuade joins us, a veteran, federal prosecutor and former U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Michigan. She worked with the Department of Justice during the Biden transition, and is now a professor at the University of Michigan School of Law. And Neal Katyal is here, Department of Justice veteran and former Acting Solicitor General during the Obama administration. He has argued dozens of cases before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nBarb, I want to start with you. Here is what Donald Trump the former guy has said previously about those who take the Fifth.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nTRUMP: Fifth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, Fifth Amendment, horrible. When you have your staff taking the Fifth Amendment, taking the Fifth, so they`re not prosecuted. I think it`s disgraceful. You see the mob takes the Fifth. If you`re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment?\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRUHLE: But today, Donald Trump wrote this. I once asked if you`re innocent, why are you taking the Fifth Amendment? Now I know the answer to that question. He says, it`s to protect his own interests. Barb, is that how it works?\n\n[23:05:04]\n\nBARBARA MCQUADE, FORMER U.S. ATTORNEY: Yeah, you know when you have no shame and you don`t care about hypocrisy it`s very easy to shift your position like this.\n\nI think the truth is, that all of us have a Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate ourselves. Our system is an adversarial system, not an inquisitorial system. And we have that absolute right to do that. I think where he was out of bounds was criticizing people who invoke their Fifth Amendment right not to testify.\n\nI expect that Leticia James fully expected him to invoke his Fifth Amendment right. Today was really his opportunity to tell his side of the story. If there`s an innocent explanation for inflating your assets on one occasion and deflating those same assets on another, let`s hear it. You got a good reason. Let`s hear it. That was his opportunity today. Instead, he chose to stay silent because he believed that truthful answers would incriminate him.\n\nThe other interesting thing about a civil case is that unlike a criminal case, a fact finder in the civil case is allowed to know that a person refused to answer questions, and may even draw an adverse inference from that fact.\n\nRUHLE: To that very point, we heard from former prosecutor Andrew Weissmann, about what Trump said or didn`t say and where the case goes from here. Watch this.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nANDREW WEISSMANN, FORMER SENIOR MEMBER OF MUELLER PROBE: In a civil case, once the defendant who you`re thinking of charging is taking the Fifth Amendment, you have an adverse inference. So if you`ve got some evidence, you know, all you have to do is prove the case by a preponderance. And once the jury is going to be told that there`s an adverse inference against the other side, your case is pretty well done.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRUHLE: Do you agree with that, Neal, the case is done. So now, Tish James can present this. Here`s my evidence, Trump said nothing. Here`s my evidence, Trump said nothing, and if so, that`s a bad look.\n\nNEAL KATYAL, FORMER ACTING U.S. SOLICITOR GENERAL: Exactly. Andrew is exactly right. That`s what will happen in the civil case. So Trump is basically thinking his civil case. Now, why is he doing it? Because he`s worried about the criminal allegations here. This is the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. That`s about criminal stuff. He`s worried about going to jail for these offenses, and there is no adverse inference there.\n\nNow, zooming out, Steph, I think the big issue here, you know, we saw the president`s former -- former president`s home raided on Monday, first president ever in American history to have that. Today, I think we have again, another historic thing. I`m not aware of any other former president who`s ever taken the Fifth Amendment before, our 45th President has now taken it over 420 times today. And you have to ask why. And to me, it`s because he and his lawyers, who are his lawyers, right, basically able to convince him of the herculean task of shutting up for four hours, something Donald Trump has, like never done before. And the reason is, because his attorneys and ultimately Trump knew if you answer these questions, you`d have something damaging to say, and yes, it really does seem like right now, Trump is linked to a laundry list of crimes. And that`s what the Republicans are saying that the reason why he`s linked good is because he played fast and loose with the law so much. And so now the law is catching up with them in a really powerful way, both on Mondays events, and then today`s.\n\nRUHLE: That is a good point, knowing Donald Trump the way we do, he could not have liked sitting for a total of four hours today.\n\nJackie, let`s turn to Scott Perry, a longtime Republican ally of Donald Trump. We know he got his phone seized yesterday. His lawyer says he`s been told he, Scott Perry is not a target. If he`s not what are they looking for?\n\nJACKIE ALEMANY, MSNBC CONTRIBUTOR: Yes, Stephanie. I think everything that we`re hearing from lawyers representing people who are under investigation right now are to be taken with a grain of salt. Scott Perry is, after all, someone who has repeatedly refused to comply with the January 6 Select Committee investigating the insurrection, when there`s been a mountain of evidence, showing his direct involvement in some of the efforts to overturn the election for over two years now. And it was first in the Senate Judiciary report that actually outlined his involvement in efforts specifically at the Department of Justice to overturn the election results. He was the person that made the introduction between Mark Meadows, Donald Trump and Jeffrey Clark, who ultimately did the president`s bidding at the Department of Justice. And he really was the sort of connective tissue between members of Congress and the White House and the coordination that occurred in order to try to find some ways to support the former president schemes.\n\nBut it is quite possible that Perry is ultimately not the target, but regardless, they do feel that -- investigators feel that there is evidence that he could have. We do know he was in frequent touch with Jeffrey Clark. He was in touch as well with people in the West Wing especially around that time period. And we`ve already seen some of his text messages come out as a result of Mark Meadows handing over 1000s of his messages at the beginning of the January 6 investigation. So there`s certainly a litany of things that investigators are going to want to check out even if Perry himself is not the actual target.\n\n[23:10:23]\n\nRUHLE: Mark Meadows, who we talk a lot about, who we hear from very rarely. Neal, there are some reports today, we`ve been asking for days, how did the government know why did they think there was more classified documents that they had not yet seen? And now, there`s reports that someone in Trump`s circle may have tipped them off? Does that seem likely to you?\n\nKATYAL: Yeah, I mean, Stephanie, then about an hour of the news of the search breaking, I think goes on our network, basically saying, I think the government has someone on the inside. And the reason for that is I said, it just didn`t strike me as plausible the government risks this kind of massive search with all of the attention and, you know, certainly all the backlash that Trump and his minions are going to say, unless they knew there was something there. And it does look like there`s a serious violation, not just the stealing of government property, which is itself a crime, but classified information.\n\nAnd it`s important to remember Donald Trump does not have a security clearance the way that normally presidents do, because President Biden determined you couldn`t trust Donald Trump with the nation`s secrets. So if Trump does have classified information, he`s totally unauthorized and not able to possess it, even if he`s miss -- you know, even if he everyone acknowledges, you know, you`re safe or something like that is not the way to store classified information. But he may not be able to maintain any sort of classified information, even if he put it in the right safes and the like. And Donald Trump is the guy who just a few years ago signed into law, a bill that made it a felony to do the kinds of stuff that he`s doing. And so, you know, it`s not surprising to me that the government had someone on the inside and acted accordingly.\n\nRUHLE: Barb, NBC`s reporting that some people within the Department of Justice want Merrick Garland to explain the Mar-a-Lago search. Does that surprise you?\n\nMCQUADE: Not really. But it`s a difficult call. And I`d be surprised if Merrick Garland does that, you know, he has said repeatedly that the Justice Department has certain norms. They`re designed to protect the accused from being disparaged in the press, as Hillary Clinton was by James Comey several years ago. And that it`s even more important to adhere to those norms during challenging times. And so for that reason, I`d be surprised if he does, but I can see why they might be advocating for it.\n\nYou know, you can say a lot of things, I think, by way of explaining, without disclosing details about the investigation itself, you know, just for example, how a search warrant works, the authority necessary to get it, the kinds of things that might prompt the seeking of a search warrant, the significance of classified information or the definition, this isn`t just like, you know, a laundry list that Donald Trump held on to classified information is defined as information to the disclosure of which would cause exceptionally grave damage to the national security of the United States.\n\nAnd so it may be that there`s room a middle ground for him to, as he`s done before, with updates on the January 6 investigation, to just sort of explain big picture about why the Justice Department does certain things and how it works, just to assure the public that this is on the up and up.\n\nRUHLE: Well, here`s what I want to explain Jackie, right wing media, and lawmakers are on every possible social outlet, attacking the DOJ and the FBI for the search. But is anyone defending or explaining why in the world Donald Trump had all these documents to begin with?\n\nALEMANY: No, Stephanie, they`re not. And also everything that we have reported so far, even with these lingering questions left, really undercut all of the unsubstantiated false claims being put forward right now by conservative media and people trying to claim that this is the FBI trying to, you know, weaponize this this search and trying to politically damage the former president.\n\nThis is a former president who has never adhered to the presidential records acts. Throughout his four years in office, we have documented and reported on that extensively. This is someone who has also already fessed up to taking back inappropriately 15 boxes of documents, that some of which were ultimately classified documents to Mar-a-Lago, which had already been retrieved that was -- and that was even before these new 12 boxes were retrieved by the FBI and, again, I think that in the coming days we`re going to see new information come out that supports why the FBI ultimately decided to execute this search warrant.\n\n[23:15:17]\n\nAnd while the Post hasn`t independently confirmed that there was an aide to the former president who flipped essentially and provided this information, there is something that had to have been aggravating the situation in order for the FBI, to take these measures and decide, okay, we`re going to make the calculus of going right in there and getting it ourselves. Again, if we even just look at the data points that we already know of, in those 15 boxes, that the National Archives already retrieved. There was 100 page inventory that we got to read out of the unclassified items, and a three page inventory of the classified items. And even in those classified items, if there`s just a sentence or a paragraph or a small portion of top secret information, which we`ve been told, is actually contained in some of these items that requires special handling, that can do grave harm national security at the end of the day.\n\nRUHLE: And note, it is not the overwhelming majority of Republican lawmakers out there defending Trump. It is the right wing regulars, and they`re doing it loudly. Neal, quickly before we go, what is your take? We are seeing from the right wing media, these suggestions over and over, that the FBI may have planted evidence at Mar-a-Lago on any of our reporting. There`s absolutely no evidence of that. What do you think because it is damaging to tell that to the American people? It`s like the big lie part two.\n\nKATYAL: 100%, Stephanie, I think the legal term for that is poppycock. And it`s not just, you know, Republicans in general, Donald Trump himself, went on his social media site and suggested it as well about the FBI and who put the FBI director in place, that guy named Donald Trump, Chris Wray is his appointee. He put him there. And the whole evidence planting narrative to me, smacks of desperation. The fact that these Republicans are resorting to these lies about the FBI, instead of defending Trump, we`re doing exactly what you said, Steph, explaining why Donald Trump has all these documents in his possession. They can`t do that. So they`re shifting the narrative. And the last thing I`d say is, you know, give me a break.\n\nNow, these folks want to say, oh, the FBI, law enforcement plans, evidence, you know, there are 1000s of people prosecuted, you know, day in and day out, and there`s all sorts of legitimate complaints against law enforcement against the poor and powerless. You know, if you`re rich like Donald Trump, no, I don`t think there`s a chance in the world that the FBI is planting evidence is, you know, Looney Tunes, but it does happen and other low level settings. And, you know, that`s a real thing that Americans should be thinking about.\n\nRUHLE: They should be thinking about it, but for any news organization, suggesting it or reporting it, there are no facts supporting it. Jackie Alemany, Barb McQuade Neal Katyal, thank you so much for joining us tonight.\n\nWhen we come back, President Biden signs another important bill into law as the House prepares to vote on a sweeping climate and health care bill. Why all matters for the American people now.\n\nAnd later, historian Jon Meacham is here on what has already been a very busy week of big news involving the former president. And it`s only hump day. His take on the state of the country tonight, THE 11TH HOUR just getting underway on a busy Wednesday.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n[23:23:18]\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOE BIDEN, (D) U.S. PRESIDENT: This is the most significant law our nation has ever passed to help millions of veterans who are exposed to toxic substances during the military services. You know Secretary McDonough can tell you I was going to get this done come hell or high water.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRUHLE: President Biden signed the PACT Act into law earlier today. It is just the latest in a string of wins for the President, including a recent bipartisan deal on guns and competitiveness with China.\n\nLater, this week, the House is expected to pass the Inflation Reduction Act which would represent huge investments in climate and health care. With us tonight to discuss our own Symone Sanders-Townsend, former Communications Director for Vice President Harris and hosts of the show Symone right here on Peacock, and Tim Miller Contributor to the Bulwark and former Communications Director for Jeb Bush. He wrote the new book, \"Why We Did It.\"\n\nSymone, long that you worked in this White House this week should be dominated by positive White House headlines because of all of these legislative wins. Is it getting overshadowed by the Trump headlines even though those are bad for Trump? Biden`s not getting the headlines?\n\nSYMONE SANDERS-TOWNSEND, FORMER SENIOR ADVISOR & CHIEF SPOKESPERSON FOR VP HARRIS: You know, Stephanie, I think that the White House is doing everything they can to push through. The day that the President signed. He also signed the CHIPS Act this week, right? He got a whole big thing outside on the South Lawn. And as it was starting, it wasn`t anywhere on television. None of the network`s covered it MSNBC covered it once the President started speaking but you heard very little mention of it in the lead up to it. The Chips Act is huge, Ok. The semiconductors everything from the cars to the toasters. They all need a chip, the cell phone, the laptops so a very big deal but you`re not hearing about it necessarily on the front pages if you will when you turn on the television because so many things have been happening.\n\n[23:25:10]\n\nSo the White House has to get creative. It`s just not on them, though Democrats across the board. This is something folks are at home in district this week, the Senate, the House, they should be talking about this everywhere they can on the radios on the airwaves, because it is something to celebrate.\n\nRUHLE: Does this cripple though, Tim, Republicans and their communication strategy right, weeks and weeks ago, it was all about supply chain shortages and blaming the president inflation and blaming the president, and now Republicans across the board have to go to their home districts and say, yes, I did not sign something literally called the Inflation Reduction Act, and they haven`t offered any alternative.\n\nTIM MILLER, FORMER COMMUNICATIONS DIRECTOR TO JEB BUSH: Yeah, I just feel like the Republicans settled on their midterm message in spring, and then a bunch of new stuff happened in summer, you know, these campaigns are long, you have to be nimble. And I think that they`ve struggled to be honest to settle on a message to put back and Biden in addition to what you just laid out, I think the overarching message was that this White House was feckless. You know that they were not competent, and that you have all these problems and that Biden isn`t capable of solving them.\n\nWell, now, Biden and this administration, working with Congress have directly addressed a lot of the key problems that people have, including inflation. So I think that if you watch Fox and saw Republican messaging for about a week, there was a lot of flailing. And I think over the past two days, you`ve seen one rallying to the president, former president`s defense, and I don`t know how much that`s going to help them the midterms. But that`s something that united on. And I do think on the Inflation Reduction Act, they`re going to zero in on these 87,000 new IRS agents. And that might be, you know, an area where they have a little bit of a message that might work. But I think that the Biden administration and the Democrats in Congress are in much better position having something to talk about going home it through August recess than they were a month ago.\n\nRUHLE: Symone, back to that, you know, weeks ago, when people would say, listen, voting rights are hugely, hugely important. But it`s tough to connect them with the American people. They`re not obscure, but they feel that way. Americans care about kitchen table issues. And if you think about all the things Biden has done over the last few weeks, it`s all about kitchen table issues, shortages, gun control, inflation. These are the things people talk about every single night, the fact that he`s now taking this on, can this change things come the midterms? Which last month, we thought we`re going to be shaking for Democrats?\n\nSANDERS-TOWNSEND: I mean, I absolutely think it can, Stephanie. And we are seeing the results in primary elections, right? Wisconsin, and Minnesota just yesterday, on Tuesday, we saw Kansas the special -- the primary were the ballot initiative to keep abortion in the Constitution, passed or did not pass, it was defeated because of activists and organizers. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is out with some new research basically, that basically says they see a fighting chance for themselves in the midterm.\n\nLook, I think that this idea between kitchen table issues or social issues, as some people like to say, is a bunch of malarkey. Because the reality is if you`re a woman in this country, and you live in a state right now, where abortion is now illegal, or you can`t get it after six weeks, that is a kitchen table issue for you if the health care you need is an abortion, right? If your child -- if the people in Uvalde, Texas, gun safety measures, people all across this country gun safety measure is a kitchen table issue.\n\nSo I do think that the President has put his money where his mouth is he has -- you know, I worked on the campaign, he has delivered on a number of pieces of the agenda that he said he was going to do. The question, Stephanie is out of the people sell it. And I think you can expect my Democratic friends to be out in full force come September, because let`s be honest people on vacation, trying to sell this agenda and connect with the folks across the country telling them exactly what this means for them.\n\nRUHLE: Tim, the Roe reversal, that sort of Republicans put their money where their mouth was, they talked about it forever and ever and ever. And now they got it. It hurt them in Kansas, it`s starting to hurt them in polls across the country, is that what you`re seeing?\n\nMILLER: I think so I think it remains to be seen about whether it`s going to yield a Kansas like reaction in house districts across the country. Here`s where it`s definitely going to make a difference and where the Democrats really needed presser advantage in these key swing states where the governor`s race is up, or the governorship is up. Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Arizona, it`s really important for the 2024 election security who the governor is there. And in all three of those states the Republicans have taken radical anti-abortion views like, you know, from the moment of conception, no exceptions, these things that have like only 10% support and either you even Republicans don`t support this as we saw in Kansas.\n\n[23:30:02]\n\nI think that if Democrats can look at Arizona, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, in particular and say if these folks become the governor our democracy is at risk, your ability to get an abortion, even at one week is at risk, a rapes, 10-year-old child`s ability to get an abortion is at risk, that is going to resonate in these purple states, and I think is a big opportunity for Democrats. We`ll see if it also I think, potentially could be an opportunity to other way -- in other places, but those governor`s races would I`ve looked at.\n\nRUHLE: You have got some far, far right candidates running and a whole bunch of states. We are paying attention, Symone Sanders, host of Symone right here on MSNBC and Peacock and Tim Miller, thank you so much.\n\nComing up, Ukraine on offense. General Barry McCaffrey is here on the significance of Ukraine`s latest attack, when THE 11TH HOUR continues.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n[23:35:26]\n\nRUHLE: It`s been more than a minute since we`ve had the chance to report on the now 167 day long conflict in Ukraine, and it matters, why? Because there has been no end to the destruction. For example, Ukraine`s military says nine Russian planes were just destroyed and an airbase in Crimea, which of course has been under Russian control since 2014. Russia has denied the damage or that the attack even happened at all.\n\nWith us tonight to discuss, one of the best experts. Retired four star U.S. Army General Barry McCaffrey, a decorated combat veteran of Vietnam, and a former battlefield commander in the Persian Gulf.\n\nGeneral, every time I read that introduction, I`m reminded how lucky we are to have you here. Help us understand this, this escalation how big of a deal is it? Because there`s reporting it was carried out by Ukraine Special Forces?\n\nGEN. BARRY MCCAFFREY, U.S. ARMY (RET.): Yeah, well, we don`t know exactly what the weapon delivery system was. It seems unlikely it was Ukrainian aircraft or cruise missile, you can spot those in the air. It will be on a range of U.S. supplied HIMARS rockets. It was multiple explosions. Even given secondary effects. It looked to me like a series of sabotage initiated events. And with aviation bombs, rockets fuel in the area, probably improperly stored to boot. It was a devastating strike, and it was in Crimea. And that`s not too far from the heartbeat of the Russian Navy in Sebastopol. So I think it was a significant event. Ukrainians are being pretty quiet about it. They`re leaking information, but they`re not doing a victory dance. So they understand the political sensitivity of all of this.\n\nRUHLE: I want to turn to the fighting around Ukraine`s nuclear facilities. What`s the latest? And how dangerous is that situation?\n\nMCCAFFREY: Well, it`s a level of irresponsibility on the part of the Russians that, to be honest, surprises me. They did go -- they understand the power of nuclear radiation. And the lingering effects of wind blowing fissile material back into Russia would be devastating to them also. So it`s completely irresponsible. The level of ignorance of Russian tactical units earlier in the war, up north, north of Kyiv on another power plant was simply abysmal. They were digging in and heavily contaminated Chernobyl radiation areas. So I don`t understand what they`re thinking. I think they have bad control of their tactical units. This makes no sense. That would be a strategic disaster. The Europeans would be even more outraged that they put it at risk. They`re fairly confined land area in the south of Ukraine.\n\nRUHLE: How would you assess where we are in the war right now, right? In the months, we were following it day in, day out, hour by hour, where do things stand now?\n\nMCCAFFREY: We all I think, first one, no one is quite sure. We don`t understand the level of Ukrainian casualties and the internal struggles they`re going through, their operational security has been good. That`s a right thing for them to do. They`re not trying to give vulnerabilities to the Russian forces. Having said that, the U.S. finally came out and said the Russians have suffered 80,000 killed and wounded and have lost a massive amount of their equipment. By some counts, more than a third of the modernized weapons they went into Ukraine was they`re in trouble, running their smart munitions. A lot of their military technology depends on foreign imports and chips and other sophisticated equipment. They legally, in theory, can`t send conscripts into the fight in the Ukraine special military operation. He has to declare general mobilization, which Putin is fearful to do, rightfully so.\n\nAnd then finally, there`s some great work coming out of Yale University and talking about the Russian economy is crumbling. In fact, they`re not able to pay for the war, simply through the sales of energy supplies to Western Europe, and they can`t find new customers in China or elsewhere overnight. So Putin in a disaster as the war grinds on. The question is will NATO stay with the Ukrainians? So I think they will. We`re right in the verge of having both Sweden and Finland become the 31st and 32nd nations who are part of NATO.\n\n[23:40:13]\n\nRUHLE: But even if Russia is currently losing the war and their economy is suffering, Vladimir Putin isn`t losing his will. So how scary is that desperate times call for desperate measures?\n\nMCCAFFREY: Well, I think you make a good point, you know, he`s in a corner, it`s hard to see any way out. And by the way, the notion Zelenskyy put on the table categorically that, that Russia would seize Crimea in 2014. And sees it as a Russian enclave as part of Russian, a mother Russia, Zelenskyy is saying, everything`s on the table, we`re going to regain sovereignty over all of our material, our land area. Putin will never, ever consider leaving the Crimea, among other things, never mind eastern parts of Ukraine, the Donbas and other areas.\n\nSo I think he`s desperate. There`s no limit to the potential escalation he could try. I don`t think he`s going to use nuclear weapons that would open Pandora`s Box on him. And I think his generals know that. But he`s definitely not going to give up. The question is, will the Russian military start to crumble? And we would hope to see that in the coming months, perhaps by the end of the year.\n\nRUHLE: Russia, give up on Putin. General, thank you for joining us tonight. General Barry McCaffrey.\n\nComing up, it has been a long, long week. It`s only Wednesday. One of our favorite historians Jon Meacham is here to help put some of the major news we`re covering into context, when THE 11TH HOUR continues.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n[23:46:28]\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nJOHN F. KENNEDY, U.S. FORMER PRESIDENT: For our nation is founded on the principle that observance of the law is the eternal safeguard of liberty and defiance of the law is the surest road to tyranny.\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRUHLE: The surest road to tyranny. JFK gave that warning nearly 60 years ago, after Mississippi`s Governor threatened the Feds and defied the law by refusing to allow a black man to attend classes at Ole Miss, six decades later, there are new and disturbing challenges to the rule of law in this country. But this time they are coming from a former president and his party.\n\nI want to bring in Pulitzer Prize winning historian dear friend of this show, Jon Meacham, author of, \"And There Was Light: Abraham Lincoln and the American Struggle,\" which will be out in October, occasionally advises our current president, as well.\n\nJon, you posted a portion of JFK speech on Twitter. Why did you do that?\n\nJON MEACHAM, PRESIDENTIAL HISTORIAN: I did. Well, I was doing a -- preparing a podcast for next week on the anniversary of James Meredith, the incredibly courageous black man who emigrated Ole Miss, he graduated next week. And so I was putting together an anniversary package of that, and read Kennedy speech, which had been delivered, obviously, a year before, when the, when Oxford, Mississippi was in riots, when see if any of this sounds familiar, when a huge chunk of the country, my chunk of the country largely was being defiant of the will of the federal government, which was the manifestation of the national will, about applying the principles of the declaration of independence through constitutional means to create a more perfect union.\n\nHuh, as Mark Twain is reputed to have said history may not repeat itself, but it does rhyme, right? And so what Kennedy`s speech was just this, as great oratory does, as great insights do, it resonated. And he says later, in that same address from the fall of `62, that if the rule of law collapses, then no judge can be sure of his writ, and no neighbor can be sure of his safety.\n\nAnd I think that`s the huge point here is that the rule of law is a covenant. It protects you, because you respected in protecting others. That`s the entire fuel mixture of democracy of American democracy. And we`ve been imperfect. Obviously, I come from a region where we refused -- many of us refuse to accept the verdict of the Civil War, the import of the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments for decade upon decade upon decade. But that`s -- that story, though it unfolds in some ways, is largely, I think, should be an example to us. What side do we, you and I, want to be on when people are telling the story of this time? Do you want to be on the side of the people who are breaking the rule of law? Or do you want to be on the side of the people who actually stood up and understood that the Constitution has to be preserved?\n\nRUHLE: Well, Jon, The Washington Post is reporting that historians like yourself, are actually trying to warn President Biden that democracy is teetering sort of what you were just laying out for us. So what does the President need to understand about where we`ve been historically, and where we are right now?\n\n[23:50:14]\n\nMEACHAM: Yeah. So that was a private meeting, I was there. Joe Biden is my friend, I help him when I can. And so take this for all with that context. So without revealing anything that I shouldn`t reveal, President Biden understands this in his bones. He talks about democracy versus autocracy, he sees this global struggle. You`re just talking to General McCaffrey about a hot front, in this in Ukraine. We`re seeing it in this vicious attack on the rule of law at home. The success in Republican primaries of election deniers of people who want to take away your right to vote, your right to choose your own leader.\n\nAnd so this is really an element -- what I think we all have to understand starting with President Biden, but it`s really a stress test for all citizens is, this is a great test. Democracies have not historically, in long endured, if this were easy, everybody would be doing it. America is not easy. And it`s because it requires this sense of I`m going to defer to you today, because there`s a pretty good chance that I`m going to need you to defer to me tomorrow. And the only way I`m going to do -- I`m going to defer to you is if I`m pretty sure if I have a confidence that you`re going to hold up your side of the covenant. And that`s what`s at risk.\n\nRUHLE: But Jon, a growing number of Americans don`t want it to work. You recently posted something about the word, unprecedented. And I hate that word. I used to ban it on the show. If people use it, I`d make them pay me $2. Because for four years, we gasp on TV and say it`s unprecedented. But the thing is, people want to break those norms. The former president laughed at it, he loved it. And so this idea that what`s happening is unprecedented. People don`t care, they actually like it.\n\nMEACHAM: They like it, but what the -- but the precedents we have to pay attention to is a rule of law, a love of neighbor, and a mutual respect. Otherwise, it`s not going to matter, because then we`re going to descend into a state of total warfare all the time. I`m not arguing for some sentimental past. I don`t think there`s, you know, when people talk about restoring certain things, hell, it wasn`t all that great then, right? I mean, I`m a boringly heterosexual, white, southern male Episcopalian, you know, things work out for me in this country. But if you -- but for a lot of people it doesn`t.\n\nThe story of the country is a journey toward a more perfect union, not a perfect one. And so what we have to remind ourselves, and this is hugely important, and it makes what you do so important, and is in the lived experience of a lot of people, the America doesn`t really work, right? It starts with September 11. There`s the bad intelligence with Iraq. There`s the financial crisis. There`s COVID, there`s Donald Trump is this huge force. You know, I teach students at Vanderbilt who were born after the attacks of September 11. So their political -- imagine what you were your political consciousness was shaped and where their political conscious shaped, is Donald Trump. And so therefore - let me just say this, it puts a huge weight, a huge burden, I think, to tell a story, that the rule of law, that having a constitution that can be perfected, is central otherwise, and maybe you disagree. But here`s the question, what comes next? If you tear this up, what comes next? And if you can`t answer that --\n\nRUHLE: I`m reminded of Steve Bannon who wanted to tear the system down. And in terms of a perfect union, you`ve got all sorts of Americans that do not want us to be a union. And I leave you with the reminder that the whole premise of Make America Great Again, while there`s millions of Americans who want to do that, for millions of others Americans, it wasn`t great. It wasn`t great before 2022 or 2021, for lots of us.\n\nUnfortunately, we are out of time, Jon, but please, please, please come back always. You know how much I love talking to you. Jon Meacham.\n\nMEACHAM: Thank you.\n\nComing up, a day that was a long time coming and an ovation for the man who helped make it happen, when THE 11TH HOUR continues.\n\n(COMMERCIAL BREAK)\n\n[23:59:04]\n\nRUHLE: The last thing before we go tonight, Mr. Stewart goes to Washington, Jon Stewart said it would happen and it did. Dedicated veterans and their families did not leave Capitol Hill until the PACT Act was passed last week, and he has not left their side for years. This man has devoted so much of his time and energy to help American veterans and 9/11 first responders. And Jon Stewart clearly gets results. President Biden recorded a video and FaceTime with the protesters on the Capitol steps to show his support. He also called Stewart personally to thank him for his advocacy for veterans.\n\nToday, Biden got the chance to thank Stewart in-person when he signed the bill officially into law. So here it is their moment of Zen.\n\n(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)\n\nBIDEN: And Jon, I want to thank you again. I wanted to come up and hang out in the Capitol steps into the Secret Service said I`d be a pain in the neck would let me do it. So at least we did a little video on there but what you`ve done Jon matters and you know it does. You should know it really, really matters. The refusal that anybody forget, refused to let them forget. And we owe you big man, we owe you big.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\n(END VIDEO CLIP)\n\nRUHLE: We got to love a guy from Jersey. Thank you, Jon Stewart for making us laugh, and even more importantly, for making us care. And on that note, I wish you all a very good night. From all of our colleagues across the networks of NBC News, thanks for staying up late with us. I`ll see you at the end of tomorrow.\n\n© 2025 MSNBC Cable, L.L.C."

Martin Luther King Jr. wrote annual dispatches for The Nation on the success of the civil-rights movement of the past year and its intentions for the year to come. But King also contributed at least one other article to these pages, a lead editorial in 1962 on the efforts of James Meredith to become the first African-American enrolled in the University of Mississippi at Oxford. Eventually, on October 1, with the backing of the Kennedy administration, Meredith was able to enroll at the school. Yet, as King wrote in The Nation , it was an embarrassment for the country that it required the power of the federal government for American citizens to secure their basic civil rights. The Mississippi crisis has seared the conscience of our entire nation. It has been difficult to believe what we have read in the newspapers and more difficult to believe what our television sets have hurled at our eyes. Is this America?.... It leaves one a little dazed and numb.... This sordid American tragedy has demonstrated once again the need for vigorous and firm exercise of the powers of the Presidency in seeking to engender a climate of understanding and respect for the civil and constitutional rights of Negroes. The executive heads of our nation must not wait for some great crisis to emerge before asserting forthright action, but must make it palpably clear on a day-to-day basis that their power, their moral leadership and authority, are committed to the task of removing the ugly weight of racial discrimination from the shoulders of the nation. It may well be that the many seeds sown by long periods of Executive inaction in the advancement of civil rights in America have reached the ugly harvest of lawlessness and violence we now see in Mississippi. What are we to say to the world? Oxford, Mississippi, has placed democracy on trial. As never before, the cry of the Negro for equality and justice in our nation has been muffled, at best. But the Little Rocks, the Montgomerys, the Albanys and the Oxfords place the questioning of our world leadership on the lips of the emerging African and Asian nations. We cannot stand before the judgment bar of world opinion so long as there erupts an Oxford, Mississippi. What we are doing speaks so loud they cannot hear what we say.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Tonight, the first African-American presidential candidate participates in a historic debate, Two reports from The Nation's archive shed light on those dramatic events forty six years ago and place tonight's event in context. Sidna Brower , then editor of the University of Misssissippi student newspaper, conveys the drama of James Meredith's historic role as the first black student at Ole Miss. And a 1964 report by Howard Zinn , bears witness to the thousands of civil rights workers who converged in Mississippi to be part of an historic movement. Mississippi Mud... By Sidna Brower From the Oct. 27, 1962, edition Because of the dearth of information generally about the attitude of Ole Miss students towards James Meredith and the events which preceded and followed his admission to the campus, we invited Miss Sidna Brower, editor of The Mississippian , the campus daily, to report on the subject for our readers Miss Brower's editorials on the campus rioting, printed in The Mississippian , attracted nation-wide attention. -ED. \"Students started out yesterday by shouting slogans of their pride in Mississippi and ended up with nothing to be proud of,\" read the first paragraph in the lead story of The Mississippian 's \"riot issue.\" The curiosity of hundreds of Ole Miss students changed to shock, and the bright gleam of Governor Ross Barnett's new popularity on the campus began to dim, as students witnessed violent demonstrations sweeping the university grounds. Not only students, but almost the entire State of Mississippi, had expected a miracle from a demigod-Governor Barnett. After all, he had sworn in his campaign speeches that there would not be integration as long as he was Governor. For a short while, it seemed as if he could keep his pledge. The new hero of the \"great sovereign State of Mississippi\" wrote proclamations, hired the state's leading legal minds and listened to the advice of the national president of the White Citizens Councils. After he had successfully defied federal court orders for the first time, the state's citizens put almost complete trust in his drive to keep James Meredith out of the university. Students who had formerly booed him at football games began to \"Roll with Ross.\" But while the students cheered Barnett, they never dreamed that their university would appear as a torn battlefield at dawn on October 1, 1962. True, they didn't want Ole Miss to become the first Mississippi college to be integrated. They were prepared to hurl nasty remarks, but never would there be an actual fight, much less bloodshed on their campus. There was still the sincere belief that the Governor was right. After all, he was standing up for an old Southern tradition, even if few Southerners can state exactly what that tradition is.

There was, and still is, the fear among some of the lower classes that the Negro, if educated, would be on an equal economic basis with them; thus \"the poor white trash\" would have no scapegoat. Even some members of the upper classes fear economic equality-if Negroes became educated, they would cease to be a source of cheap labor. Naturally, among many Mississippians and other Southerners is the constant fear that integrated schools will lead ultimately to intermarriages. Thus the white race would no longer be \"superior.\" Yet many of those who most fear for the \"degeneration\" of the white race are the products of the degeneration of their own fine old families. AS THE period of uncertainty lengthened, tensions mounted. The less radical segregationists said, \"I just don't care; I wish something would happen one way or the other.\" A few students transferred to other schools to escape the problem-not of integration, but of the continued campus unrest. Radicals became even more extreme, more determined to fight; some were actually willing to kill \"that damn Nigger.\" Very few students wanted Meredith to enter Ole Miss and a few more didn't really care; the vast majority, however, wanted their university to remain segregated. \"The federal government is forcing Meredith down our throats and if we let one in, they will send more Negroes down here,\" was the honest opinion of a great number of students. Now that Meredith is in, they are saying, \"They pushed him down our throats and if we don't show some disapproval, there will be several more Negroes trying to get in.\" Thus they jeer at Meredith, \"Nigger, go home,\" \"I'll kill you,\" \"Go to hell, black bastard.\" The so-called moderates on the campus were disgusted with the federal government for having imposed integration by force. Although they personally do not resent integration, they felt such extreme measures should not have been taken. They feel the whole affair has actually slowed down desegregation. Almost all the students seem to think that Meredith was selected as the guinea pig for integration in Mississippi. Hardly any twenty-nine-year-old married veteran would be easily accepted on a campus where most students are between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one-much less a Negro. Students felt that since Meredith lacked only one semester at Jackson State and, as a result of his transfer, will have to attend classes for another year, he was not sincerely interested in his education but merely in desegregating Ole Miss. Many students and Mississippians still firmly believe that Ross Barnett was right in every action; they read only Mississippi papers and thus read and hear only what they want. But some students are searching their consciences and asking questions; for them, Barnett's aura of heroism has faded. They are in doubt where to place the blame for the Sunday riots. They do not want integration, but they feel violence is not the answer. They believe the Governor incited the riots in part, but do not entirely blame the state officials. (University officials are completely out of the picture, since they were caught between state and federal governments.) Now the students look to the administration for advice-and until recently, at least were receiving little. Naturally, Mississippians tend to blame the federal courts, the government and the Justice Department. They believe that the Justice Department, after forcing the issue of integration upon the state, is attempting to make the students accept Meredith as \"one of them.\" Although most students refused to accept Meredith, they have accepted the fact that the university has been desegregated, and are attempting to settle down to normalcy. But in others the flame of hatred still burns; they continue to believe that \"the South shall rise again\" and that the \"great State of Mississippi\" will once more by sovereign. Journey to Understanding: Witness to a Mississippi Summer By Howard Zinn From the December 28, 1964 edition Neither a small army of newspaper correspondents, nor all the power of the electronic mass media, has been able to convey to the country at large the reality of Mississippi. Perhaps our senses have been bludgeoned in this century by too many images; fact and fiction have become indistinguishable, and now even the starkest horrors are only scenes in a global theatre of the absurd. So it was not only desperation, but genius that inspired the Mississippi civil rights workers a year ago to call for help from Northern ministers, lawyers, doctors, students, teachers, laborers. Their arrival last summer meant that a line of 1,000 people would begin moving back and forth across the desert of indifference (or worse: token concern) which has always separated the rest of the nation from the Deep South. Now-except for the 150 who insisted on staying-they are back North creating little circles of unrest wherever they move, trying to communicate, as only one living being can to another in the freshness of his own astonishment, what it was like to be in Mississippi. Those of us who have spent some time in that state return in turmoil and in awe. It is a place that stretches ceilings to their limits. There, in one place, you find the worst and the best of this nation: malevolence matched by courage, like confronting death. What one feels most is not despair, however, but indignation because Mississippi, unlike South Africa, is part of a nation that professes liberty. Someone returning from hell might want to convey to the world, not the nature of the Devil, which is already known, but the fact that what he endured took place within sight of God. Those home from Mississippi try to explain to their friends why it is not enough to belabor the warped officialdom of that state and its murderous deputies, and why the citizenry must press the point of moral responsibility hardest against those in the nation who have both the knowledge of right and wrong, and the power to change the situation. That means the President of the United States and the Department of Justice. There is too little outrage in the country to waste it on less than the federal government which, tomorrow, in all legality could begin to transform the state of Mississippi as a model of purposeful social change. In some ways, we ought to be grateful for Mississippi.  A nation needs to look at itself in the most revealing of mirrors, and Mississippi is just that for the United States-not an oddity in a glass case, but a particularly ugly reflection of the rest of the country. Because of this, the sojourn there of 1,000 Northerners could have a special value. Prodded by what they saw, they now might begin to look with new vision into the Mississipian crevices back home: into the back rooms of police stations, the municipal courts and the jails, the ghettoes, the factories, the unemployment offices. Rousseau once wrote \"We have physicists, geometricians, chemists, astronomers, poets, musicians, and painters in plenty, but we have no longer a citizen among us.\" Who could have dreamed up a better plan to destroy popular government than to divide us all into self-sealing occupational groups and professional societies, each diverting civic energy to its own narrow end? But last summer some uncommon purpose brought to various Negro communities in Mississippi a New York lawyer, a California carpenter, a Southern white minister, a Negro physician, a Yale philosopher. If we keep rubbing away at the traditional lines that divide us, we may yet build a body of citizens in America powerful enough to make democracy work.\n\nSidna Brower , then editor of the University of Misssissippi student newspaper, conveys the drama of James Meredith's historic role as the first black student at Ole Miss. And a 1964 report by Howard Zinn , bears witness to the thousands of civil rights workers who converged in Mississippi to be part of an historic movement. Mississippi Mud... By Sidna Brower From the Oct. 27, 1962, edition Because of the dearth of information generally about the attitude of Ole Miss students towards James Meredith and the events which preceded and followed his admission to the campus, we invited Miss Sidna Brower, editor of The Mississippian , the campus daily, to report on the subject for our readers Miss Brower's editorials on the campus rioting, printed in The Mississippian , attracted nation-wide attention. -ED. \"Students started out yesterday by shouting slogans of their pride in Mississippi and ended up with nothing to be proud of,\" read the first paragraph in the lead story of The Mississippian 's \"riot issue.\" The curiosity of hundreds of Ole Miss students changed to shock, and the bright gleam of Governor Ross Barnett's new popularity on the campus began to dim, as students witnessed violent demonstrations sweeping the university grounds. Not only students, but almost the entire State of Mississippi, had expected a miracle from a demigod-Governor Barnett. After all, he had sworn in his campaign speeches that there would not be integration as long as he was Governor. For a short while, it seemed as if he could keep his pledge. The new hero of the \"great sovereign State of Mississippi\" wrote proclamations, hired the state's leading legal minds and listened to the advice of the national president of the White Citizens Councils. After he had successfully defied federal court orders for the first time, the state's citizens put almost complete trust in his drive to keep James Meredith out of the university. Students who had formerly booed him at football games began to \"Roll with Ross.\" But while the students cheered Barnett, they never dreamed that their university would appear as a torn battlefield at dawn on October 1, 1962. True, they didn't want Ole Miss to become the first Mississippi college to be integrated. They were prepared to hurl nasty remarks, but never would there be an actual fight, much less bloodshed on their campus. There was still the sincere belief that the Governor was right. After all, he was standing up for an old Southern tradition, even if few Southerners can state exactly what that tradition is.

There was, and still is, the fear among some of the lower classes that the Negro, if educated, would be on an equal economic basis with them; thus \"the poor white trash\" would have no scapegoat. Even some members of the upper classes fear economic equality-if Negroes became educated, they would cease to be a source of cheap labor. Naturally, among many Mississippians and other Southerners is the constant fear that integrated schools will lead ultimately to intermarriages. Thus the white race would no longer be \"superior.\" Yet many of those who most fear for the \"degeneration\" of the white race are the products of the degeneration of their own fine old families. AS THE period of uncertainty lengthened, tensions mounted. The less radical segregationists said, \"I just don't care; I wish something would happen one way or the other.\" A few students transferred to other schools to escape the problem-not of integration, but of the continued campus unrest. Radicals became even more extreme, more determined to fight; some were actually willing to kill \"that damn Nigger.\" Very few students wanted Meredith to enter Ole Miss and a few more didn't really care; the vast majority, however, wanted their university to remain segregated. \"The federal government is forcing Meredith down our throats and if we let one in, they will send more Negroes down here,\" was the honest opinion of a great number of students. Now that Meredith is in, they are saying, \"They pushed him down our throats and if we don't show some disapproval, there will be several more Negroes trying to get in.\" Thus they jeer at Meredith, \"Nigger, go home,\" \"I'll kill you,\" \"Go to hell, black bastard.\" The so-called moderates on the campus were disgusted with the federal government for having imposed integration by force. Although they personally do not resent integration, they felt such extreme measures should not have been taken. They feel the whole affair has actually slowed down desegregation. Almost all the students seem to think that Meredith was selected as the guinea pig for integration in Mississippi. Hardly any twenty-nine-year-old married veteran would be easily accepted on a campus where most students are between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one-much less a Negro. Students felt that since Meredith lacked only one semester at Jackson State and, as a result of his transfer, will have to attend classes for another year, he was not sincerely interested in his education but merely in desegregating Ole Miss. Many students and Mississippians still firmly believe that Ross Barnett was right in every action; they read only Mississippi papers and thus read and hear only what they want. But some students are searching their consciences and asking questions; for them, Barnett's aura of heroism has faded. They are in doubt where to place the blame for the Sunday riots. They do not want integration, but they feel violence is not the answer. They believe the Governor incited the riots in part, but do not entirely blame the state officials. (University officials are completely out of the picture, since they were caught between state and federal governments.) Now the students look to the administration for advice-and until recently, at least were receiving little. Naturally, Mississippians tend to blame the federal courts, the government and the Justice Department. They believe that the Justice Department, after forcing the issue of integration upon the state, is attempting to make the students accept Meredith as \"one of them.\" Although most students refused to accept Meredith, they have accepted the fact that the university has been desegregated, and are attempting to settle down to normalcy. But in others the flame of hatred still burns; they continue to believe that \"the South shall rise again\" and that the \"great State of Mississippi\" will once more by sovereign. Journey to Understanding: Witness to a Mississippi Summer By Howard Zinn From the December 28, 1964 edition Neither a small army of newspaper correspondents, nor all the power of the electronic mass media, has been able to convey to the country at large the reality of Mississippi. Perhaps our senses have been bludgeoned in this century by too many images; fact and fiction have become indistinguishable, and now even the starkest horrors are only scenes in a global theatre of the absurd. So it was not only desperation, but genius that inspired the Mississippi civil rights workers a year ago to call for help from Northern ministers, lawyers, doctors, students, teachers, laborers. Their arrival last summer meant that a line of 1,000 people would begin moving back and forth across the desert of indifference (or worse: token concern) which has always separated the rest of the nation from the Deep South. Now-except for the 150 who insisted on staying-they are back North creating little circles of unrest wherever they move, trying to communicate, as only one living being can to another in the freshness of his own astonishment, what it was like to be in Mississippi. Those of us who have spent some time in that state return in turmoil and in awe. It is a place that stretches ceilings to their limits.

They were prepared to hurl nasty remarks, but never would there be an actual fight, much less bloodshed on their campus. There was still the sincere belief that the Governor was right. After all, he was standing up for an old Southern tradition, even if few Southerners can state exactly what that tradition is.

There was, and still is, the fear among some of the lower classes that the Negro, if educated, would be on an equal economic basis with them; thus \"the poor white trash\" would have no scapegoat. Even some members of the upper classes fear economic equality-if Negroes became educated, they would cease to be a source of cheap labor. Naturally, among many Mississippians and other Southerners is the constant fear that integrated schools will lead ultimately to intermarriages. Thus the white race would no longer be \"superior.\" Yet many of those who most fear for the \"degeneration\" of the white race are the products of the degeneration of their own fine old families. AS THE period of uncertainty lengthened, tensions mounted. The less radical segregationists said, \"I just don't care; I wish something would happen one way or the other.\" A few students transferred to other schools to escape the problem-not of integration, but of the continued campus unrest. Radicals became even more extreme, more determined to fight; some were actually willing to kill \"that damn Nigger.\" Very few students wanted Meredith to enter Ole Miss and a few more didn't really care; the vast majority, however, wanted their university to remain segregated. \"The federal government is forcing Meredith down our throats and if we let one in, they will send more Negroes down here,\" was the honest opinion of a great number of students. Now that Meredith is in, they are saying, \"They pushed him down our throats and if we don't show some disapproval, there will be several more Negroes trying to get in.\" Thus they jeer at Meredith, \"Nigger, go home,\" \"I'll kill you,\" \"Go to hell, black bastard.\" The so-called moderates on the campus were disgusted with the federal government for having imposed integration by force. Although they personally do not resent integration, they felt such extreme measures should not have been taken. They feel the whole affair has actually slowed down desegregation. Almost all the students seem to think that Meredith was selected as the guinea pig for integration in Mississippi. Hardly any twenty-nine-year-old married veteran would be easily accepted on a campus where most students are between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one-much less a Negro. Students felt that since Meredith lacked only one semester at Jackson State and, as a result of his transfer, will have to attend classes for another year, he was not sincerely interested in his education but merely in desegregating Ole Miss. Many students and Mississippians still firmly believe that Ross Barnett was right in every action; they read only Mississippi papers and thus read and hear only what they want. But some students are searching their consciences and asking questions; for them, Barnett's aura of heroism has faded. They are in doubt where to place the blame for the Sunday riots. They do not want integration, but they feel violence is not the answer. They believe the Governor incited the riots in part, but do not entirely blame the state officials. (University officials are completely out of the picture, since they were caught between state and federal governments.) Now the students look to the administration for advice-and until recently, at least were receiving little. Naturally, Mississippians tend to blame the federal courts, the government and the Justice Department. They believe that the Justice Department, after forcing the issue of integration upon the state, is attempting to make the students accept Meredith as \"one of them.\" Although most students refused to accept Meredith, they have accepted the fact that the university has been desegregated, and are attempting to settle down to normalcy. But in others the flame of hatred still burns; they continue to believe that \"the South shall rise again\" and that the \"great State of Mississippi\" will once more by sovereign. Journey to Understanding: Witness to a Mississippi Summer By Howard Zinn From the December 28, 1964 edition Neither a small army of newspaper correspondents, nor all the power of the electronic mass media, has been able to convey to the country at large the reality of Mississippi. Perhaps our senses have been bludgeoned in this century by too many images; fact and fiction have become indistinguishable, and now even the starkest horrors are only scenes in a global theatre of the absurd. So it was not only desperation, but genius that inspired the Mississippi civil rights workers a year ago to call for help from Northern ministers, lawyers, doctors, students, teachers, laborers. Their arrival last summer meant that a line of 1,000 people would begin moving back and forth across the desert of indifference (or worse: token concern) which has always separated the rest of the nation from the Deep South. Now-except for the 150 who insisted on staying-they are back North creating little circles of unrest wherever they move, trying to communicate, as only one living being can to another in the freshness of his own astonishment, what it was like to be in Mississippi. Those of us who have spent some time in that state return in turmoil and in awe. It is a place that stretches ceilings to their limits. There, in one place, you find the worst and the best of this nation: malevolence matched by courage, like confronting death. What one feels most is not despair, however, but indignation because Mississippi, unlike South Africa, is part of a nation that professes liberty. Someone returning from hell might want to convey to the world, not the nature of the Devil, which is already known, but the fact that what he endured took place within sight of God. Those home from Mississippi try to explain to their friends why it is not enough to belabor the warped officialdom of that state and its murderous deputies, and why the citizenry must press the point of moral responsibility hardest against those in the nation who have both the knowledge of right and wrong, and the power to change the situation. That means the President of the United States and the Department of Justice. There is too little outrage in the country to waste it on less than the federal government which, tomorrow, in all legality could begin to transform the state of Mississippi as a model of purposeful social change. In some ways, we ought to be grateful for Mississippi.  A nation needs to look at itself in the most revealing of mirrors, and Mississippi is just that for the United States-not an oddity in a glass case, but a particularly ugly reflection of the rest of the country. Because of this, the sojourn there of 1,000 Northerners could have a special value. Prodded by what they saw, they now might begin to look with new vision into the Mississipian crevices back home: into the back rooms of police stations, the municipal courts and the jails, the ghettoes, the factories, the unemployment offices. Rousseau once wrote \"We have physicists, geometricians, chemists, astronomers, poets, musicians, and painters in plenty, but we have no longer a citizen among us.\" Who could have dreamed up a better plan to destroy popular government than to divide us all into self-sealing occupational groups and professional societies, each diverting civic energy to its own narrow end? But last summer some uncommon purpose brought to various Negro communities in Mississippi a New York lawyer, a California carpenter, a Southern white minister, a Negro physician, a Yale philosopher. If we keep rubbing away at the traditional lines that divide us, we may yet build a body of citizens in America powerful enough to make democracy work.\n\nBecause of the dearth of information generally about the attitude of Ole Miss students towards James Meredith and the events which preceded and followed his admission to the campus, we invited Miss Sidna Brower, editor of The Mississippian , the campus daily, to report on the subject for our readers Miss Brower's editorials on the campus rioting, printed in The Mississippian , attracted nation-wide attention. -ED. \"Students started out yesterday by shouting slogans of their pride in Mississippi and ended up with nothing to be proud of,\" read the first paragraph in the lead story of The Mississippian 's \"riot issue.\" The curiosity of hundreds of Ole Miss students changed to shock, and the bright gleam of Governor Ross Barnett's new popularity on the campus began to dim, as students witnessed violent demonstrations sweeping the university grounds. Not only students, but almost the entire State of Mississippi, had expected a miracle from a demigod-Governor Barnett. After all, he had sworn in his campaign speeches that there would not be integration as long as he was Governor. For a short while, it seemed as if he could keep his pledge. The new hero of the \"great sovereign State of Mississippi\" wrote proclamations, hired the state's leading legal minds and listened to the advice of the national president of the White Citizens Councils. After he had successfully defied federal court orders for the first time, the state's citizens put almost complete trust in his drive to keep James Meredith out of the university. Students who had formerly booed him at football games began to \"Roll with Ross.\" But while the students cheered Barnett, they never dreamed that their university would appear as a torn battlefield at dawn on October 1, 1962. True, they didn't want Ole Miss to become the first Mississippi college to be integrated.

Perhaps our senses have been bludgeoned in this century by too many images; fact and fiction have become indistinguishable, and now even the starkest horrors are only scenes in a global theatre of the absurd. So it was not only desperation, but genius that inspired the Mississippi civil rights workers a year ago to call for help from Northern ministers, lawyers, doctors, students, teachers, laborers. Their arrival last summer meant that a line of 1,000 people would begin moving back and forth across the desert of indifference (or worse: token concern) which has always separated the rest of the nation from the Deep South. Now-except for the 150 who insisted on staying-they are back North creating little circles of unrest wherever they move, trying to communicate, as only one living being can to another in the freshness of his own astonishment, what it was like to be in Mississippi. Those of us who have spent some time in that state return in turmoil and in awe. It is a place that stretches ceilings to their limits. There, in one place, you find the worst and the best of this nation: malevolence matched by courage, like confronting death. What one feels most is not despair, however, but indignation because Mississippi, unlike South Africa, is part of a nation that professes liberty. Someone returning from hell might want to convey to the world, not the nature of the Devil, which is already known, but the fact that what he endured took place within sight of God. Those home from Mississippi try to explain to their friends why it is not enough to belabor the warped officialdom of that state and its murderous deputies, and why the citizenry must press the point of moral responsibility hardest against those in the nation who have both the knowledge of right and wrong, and the power to change the situation. That means the President of the United States and the Department of Justice. There is too little outrage in the country to waste it on less than the federal government which, tomorrow, in all legality could begin to transform the state of Mississippi as a model of purposeful social change. In some ways, we ought to be grateful for Mississippi.  A nation needs to look at itself in the most revealing of mirrors, and Mississippi is just that for the United States-not an oddity in a glass case, but a particularly ugly reflection of the rest of the country. Because of this, the sojourn there of 1,000 Northerners could have a special value. Prodded by what they saw, they now might begin to look with new vision into the Mississipian crevices back home: into the back rooms of police stations, the municipal courts and the jails, the ghettoes, the factories, the unemployment offices. Rousseau once wrote \"We have physicists, geometricians, chemists, astronomers, poets, musicians, and painters in plenty, but we have no longer a citizen among us.\" Who could have dreamed up a better plan to destroy popular government than to divide us all into self-sealing occupational groups and professional societies, each diverting civic energy to its own narrow end? But last summer some uncommon purpose brought to various Negro communities in Mississippi a New York lawyer, a California carpenter, a Southern white minister, a Negro physician, a Yale philosopher. If we keep rubbing away at the traditional lines that divide us, we may yet build a body of citizens in America powerful enough to make democracy work.\n\nNot only students, but almost the entire State of Mississippi, had expected a miracle from a demigod-Governor Barnett. After all, he had sworn in his campaign speeches that there would not be integration as long as he was Governor. For a short while, it seemed as if he could keep his pledge. The new hero of the \"great sovereign State of Mississippi\" wrote proclamations, hired the state's leading legal minds and listened to the advice of the national president of the White Citizens Councils. After he had successfully defied federal court orders for the first time, the state's citizens put almost complete trust in his drive to keep James Meredith out of the university. Students who had formerly booed him at football games began to \"Roll with Ross.\" But while the students cheered Barnett, they never dreamed that their university would appear as a torn battlefield at dawn on October 1, 1962. True, they didn't want Ole Miss to become the first Mississippi college to be integrated. They were prepared to hurl nasty remarks, but never would there be an actual fight, much less bloodshed on their campus. There was still the sincere belief that the Governor was right. After all, he was standing up for an old Southern tradition, even if few Southerners can state exactly what that tradition is.

There was, and still is, the fear among some of the lower classes that the Negro, if educated, would be on an equal economic basis with them; thus \"the poor white trash\" would have no scapegoat. Even some members of the upper classes fear economic equality-if Negroes became educated, they would cease to be a source of cheap labor. Naturally, among many Mississippians and other Southerners is the constant fear that integrated schools will lead ultimately to intermarriages. Thus the white race would no longer be \"superior.\" Yet many of those who most fear for the \"degeneration\" of the white race are the products of the degeneration of their own fine old families. AS THE period of uncertainty lengthened, tensions mounted. The less radical segregationists said, \"I just don't care; I wish something would happen one way or the other.\" A few students transferred to other schools to escape the problem-not of integration, but of the continued campus unrest. Radicals became even more extreme, more determined to fight; some were actually willing to kill \"that damn Nigger.\" Very few students wanted Meredith to enter Ole Miss and a few more didn't really care; the vast majority, however, wanted their university to remain segregated. \"The federal government is forcing Meredith down our throats and if we let one in, they will send more Negroes down here,\" was the honest opinion of a great number of students. Now that Meredith is in, they are saying, \"They pushed him down our throats and if we don't show some disapproval, there will be several more Negroes trying to get in.\" Thus they jeer at Meredith, \"Nigger, go home,\" \"I'll kill you,\" \"Go to hell, black bastard.\" The so-called moderates on the campus were disgusted with the federal government for having imposed integration by force. Although they personally do not resent integration, they felt such extreme measures should not have been taken. They feel the whole affair has actually slowed down desegregation. Almost all the students seem to think that Meredith was selected as the guinea pig for integration in Mississippi. Hardly any twenty-nine-year-old married veteran would be easily accepted on a campus where most students are between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one-much less a Negro. Students felt that since Meredith lacked only one semester at Jackson State and, as a result of his transfer, will have to attend classes for another year, he was not sincerely interested in his education but merely in desegregating Ole Miss. Many students and Mississippians still firmly believe that Ross Barnett was right in every action; they read only Mississippi papers and thus read and hear only what they want. But some students are searching their consciences and asking questions; for them, Barnett's aura of heroism has faded. They are in doubt where to place the blame for the Sunday riots. They do not want integration, but they feel violence is not the answer. They believe the Governor incited the riots in part, but do not entirely blame the state officials. (University officials are completely out of the picture, since they were caught between state and federal governments.) Now the students look to the administration for advice-and until recently, at least were receiving little. Naturally, Mississippians tend to blame the federal courts, the government and the Justice Department. They believe that the Justice Department, after forcing the issue of integration upon the state, is attempting to make the students accept Meredith as \"one of them.\" Although most students refused to accept Meredith, they have accepted the fact that the university has been desegregated, and are attempting to settle down to normalcy. But in others the flame of hatred still burns; they continue to believe that \"the South shall rise again\" and that the \"great State of Mississippi\" will once more by sovereign.

But last summer some uncommon purpose brought to various Negro communities in Mississippi a New York lawyer, a California carpenter, a Southern white minister, a Negro physician, a Yale philosopher. If we keep rubbing away at the traditional lines that divide us, we may yet build a body of citizens in America powerful enough to make democracy work.\n\nVery few students wanted Meredith to enter Ole Miss and a few more didn't really care; the vast majority, however, wanted their university to remain segregated. \"The federal government is forcing Meredith down our throats and if we let one in, they will send more Negroes down here,\" was the honest opinion of a great number of students. Now that Meredith is in, they are saying, \"They pushed him down our throats and if we don't show some disapproval, there will be several more Negroes trying to get in.\" Thus they jeer at Meredith, \"Nigger, go home,\" \"I'll kill you,\" \"Go to hell, black bastard.\" The so-called moderates on the campus were disgusted with the federal government for having imposed integration by force. Although they personally do not resent integration, they felt such extreme measures should not have been taken. They feel the whole affair has actually slowed down desegregation. Almost all the students seem to think that Meredith was selected as the guinea pig for integration in Mississippi. Hardly any twenty-nine-year-old married veteran would be easily accepted on a campus where most students are between the ages of eighteen and twenty-one-much less a Negro. Students felt that since Meredith lacked only one semester at Jackson State and, as a result of his transfer, will have to attend classes for another year, he was not sincerely interested in his education but merely in desegregating Ole Miss. Many students and Mississippians still firmly believe that Ross Barnett was right in every action; they read only Mississippi papers and thus read and hear only what they want. But some students are searching their consciences and asking questions; for them, Barnett's aura of heroism has faded. They are in doubt where to place the blame for the Sunday riots. They do not want integration, but they feel violence is not the answer. They believe the Governor incited the riots in part, but do not entirely blame the state officials. (University officials are completely out of the picture, since they were caught between state and federal governments.) Now the students look to the administration for advice-and until recently, at least were receiving little. Naturally, Mississippians tend to blame the federal courts, the government and the Justice Department. They believe that the Justice Department, after forcing the issue of integration upon the state, is attempting to make the students accept Meredith as \"one of them.\" Although most students refused to accept Meredith, they have accepted the fact that the university has been desegregated, and are attempting to settle down to normalcy. But in others the flame of hatred still burns; they continue to believe that \"the South shall rise again\" and that the \"great State of Mississippi\" will once more by sovereign. Journey to Understanding: Witness to a Mississippi Summer By Howard Zinn From the December 28, 1964 edition Neither a small army of newspaper correspondents, nor all the power of the electronic mass media, has been able to convey to the country at large the reality of Mississippi. Perhaps our senses have been bludgeoned in this century by too many images; fact and fiction have become indistinguishable, and now even the starkest horrors are only scenes in a global theatre of the absurd. So it was not only desperation, but genius that inspired the Mississippi civil rights workers a year ago to call for help from Northern ministers, lawyers, doctors, students, teachers, laborers. Their arrival last summer meant that a line of 1,000 people would begin moving back and forth across the desert of indifference (or worse: token concern) which has always separated the rest of the nation from the Deep South. Now-except for the 150 who insisted on staying-they are back North creating little circles of unrest wherever they move, trying to communicate, as only one living being can to another in the freshness of his own astonishment, what it was like to be in Mississippi. Those of us who have spent some time in that state return in turmoil and in awe. It is a place that stretches ceilings to their limits. There, in one place, you find the worst and the best of this nation: malevolence matched by courage, like confronting death. What one feels most is not despair, however, but indignation because Mississippi, unlike South Africa, is part of a nation that professes liberty. Someone returning from hell might want to convey to the world, not the nature of the Devil, which is already known, but the fact that what he endured took place within sight of God. Those home from Mississippi try to explain to their friends why it is not enough to belabor the warped officialdom of that state and its murderous deputies, and why the citizenry must press the point of moral responsibility hardest against those in the nation who have both the knowledge of right and wrong, and the power to change the situation. That means the President of the United States and the Department of Justice. There is too little outrage in the country to waste it on less than the federal government which, tomorrow, in all legality could begin to transform the state of Mississippi as a model of purposeful social change. In some ways, we ought to be grateful for Mississippi.  A nation needs to look at itself in the most revealing of mirrors, and Mississippi is just that for the United States-not an oddity in a glass case, but a particularly ugly reflection of the rest of the country. Because of this, the sojourn there of 1,000 Northerners could have a special value.

Perhaps our senses have been bludgeoned in this century by too many images; fact and fiction have become indistinguishable, and now even the starkest horrors are only scenes in a global theatre of the absurd. So it was not only desperation, but genius that inspired the Mississippi civil rights workers a year ago to call for help from Northern ministers, lawyers, doctors, students, teachers, laborers. Their arrival last summer meant that a line of 1,000 people would begin moving back and forth across the desert of indifference (or worse: token concern) which has always separated the rest of the nation from the Deep South. Now-except for the 150 who insisted on staying-they are back North creating little circles of unrest wherever they move, trying to communicate, as only one living being can to another in the freshness of his own astonishment, what it was like to be in Mississippi. Those of us who have spent some time in that state return in turmoil and in awe. It is a place that stretches ceilings to their limits. There, in one place, you find the worst and the best of this nation: malevolence matched by courage, like confronting death. What one feels most is not despair, however, but indignation because Mississippi, unlike South Africa, is part of a nation that professes liberty. Someone returning from hell might want to convey to the world, not the nature of the Devil, which is already known, but the fact that what he endured took place within sight of God. Those home from Mississippi try to explain to their friends why it is not enough to belabor the warped officialdom of that state and its murderous deputies, and why the citizenry must press the point of moral responsibility hardest against those in the nation who have both the knowledge of right and wrong, and the power to change the situation. That means the President of the United States and the Department of Justice. There is too little outrage in the country to waste it on less than the federal government which, tomorrow, in all legality could begin to transform the state of Mississippi as a model of purposeful social change.

(AP Photo)\n\nOn a glorious afternoon in August 1963, after the massive March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom wrapped up on the national mall, President John F. Kennedy, prodded by Attorney General Robert Kennedy, welcomed John Lewis, Martin Luther King Jr., Bayard Rustin, and other march organizers to the White House for a discussion of proposed civil rights legislation.  Fifty-four years later, on an afternoon in January 2017, when the even more massive Women's March on Washington wrapped up, President Donald Trump responded with a sarcastic tweet .  Just the day before, Trump's team had removed the \"civil rights\" page from the issues section of the WhiteHouse.gov website and replaced it with a new entry entitled \"Standing Up For Our Law Enforcement Community.\"  The page is still missing. This article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com . To stay on top of important articles like these, sign up to receive the latest updates from TomDispatch.com. Today, with the three branches of government controlled by men intolerant of dissent and hounded by their own dark vision of pluralism, few human rights advocates of any stripe can reasonably expect a hearing in Washington.  Our long-running, ongoing, unfinished American civil rights struggle that so often focused on pressing the federal government toward justice, is suddenly in uncharted territory.  The legacy of Reverend Martin Luther King has slammed up against the legacy of Alabama Governor George Wallace, whose snarling campaign for president in 1968 has come home to roost in the presidency of Donald Trump.  Where civil rights leaders, warriors, and foot soldiers found support in high places they will now find a void. Partners With Power Amid discussion of renewed civil rights activism, you may well ask whether we'll need to fight those fights all over again. Will black people once more have to claim their humanity?  For perspective on this moment, let's consider why the strategies of the southern liberation struggle worked as well as they did back in the day. The classic civil rights movement (1954-1965) was sparked, organized, and driven by local people and leaders (maids, teachers, farmers, cooks, janitors, students, ministers) in a hundred southern towns who, with ferocious courage, stood up and said \"No more!\"  Their victories - some temporary, some lasting - regularly depended on their ability as citizens to reach beyond local and state segregationists to faraway presidents, congressional representatives, federal circuit court judges, and Supreme Court justices in Washington, appealing to them to respond with regulations, executive orders, laws, and even armed force. Dogged organizing by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the Congress Of Racial Equality (CORE), and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), together with the NAACP's decades-long legal campaigns, Martin Luther King's rhetorical genius, and the massed moral crusade of black southerners first shamed and finally forced the latent hand of federal power.  Alert to this leapfrog tactic, Malcolm X, W.E.B. Du Bois, and others went a step further and tried unsuccessfully to appeal to the United Nations, as more recently have the parents of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Jordan Davis.

Board of Education school desegregation decision, the Supreme Court signaled to African Americans in the former Confederacy that they had a friend in Washington.  In Brown , by the sheer weight of evidence, moral suasion, and reason, a handful of African American parents, children, and their lawyers had compelled nine aging white justices (including former Ku Klux Klansman Hugo Black ) to agree that all citizens deserve equal education. In a similar manner over the next decade, one powerful judicial, congressional, and presidential ally after another would step up, willfully or grudgingly, to affirm simple justice, rights long promised but also long deferred.  Their embrace of civil rights was sometimes a matter of conscience, sometimes a savvy calculation of their constituents' electoral mood. Those actions would, in the end, help open doors and extend legal rights to ethnic minorities, women, immigrants, workers, and most recently gay, lesbian, and transgendered citizens. Major legislation - the Civil Rights Act of 1957 which established the Justice Department's civil rights division, the 1964 Act which outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, or national origin, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 - and hundreds of decisions handed down by federal district courts, circuit courts, and the Supreme Court all slowly expanded protections to African Americans and set precedents for all Americans. Unlike blacks within white-ruled South Africa who, at the time, were not citizens of their own nation and had little hope of federal protection, blacks across the deep South could succeed because they were citizens not only of their own states, but of the United States. Few in the 1960s believed that marching, demonstrating, sitting in, agitating, witnessing, disrupting, or singing could ever change the minds, much less the policies, of a half-dozen southern governors, a hundred county sheriffs, or millions of white segregationists.  The Montgomery bus boycott was successful in driving the bus company to the edge of bankruptcy, but legal bus segregation remained intact until the Supreme Court stepped in. Well-schooled in the strategies of Gandhi, civil rights leaders knew of the critical value of mass meetings, collective action, and civil disobedience for building resolve, visibility, and a powerful sense of community, but they also knew its limits: solidarity was not enough.  Coming together to raise awareness would not in itself achieve concrete results.  Birmingham leader Fred Shuttlesworth put it this way: \"Look, America, look at your promises; look how you've treated your poor Negro citizens.  But you can't shame segregation. Rattlesnakes don't commit suicide.\" Persuasion, appeals to reason, and simple justice certainly recruited northern liberals and some white southern moderates to the cause, but southern blacks could have preached the Sermon on the Mount or the U.S. Constitution daily to White Citizens' Councils to no effect.  In the end, the decisive language that spoke to white oppression was power, and the power that proved decisive often lay in Washington. While economic boycotts might sometimes force compromise on local businesses and segregationist officials, generally the trick was to vault over them to, if necessary, the president himself. In the documentary Eyes On The Prize , Burke Marshall, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division under President Kennedy explained, that, when push came to shove, no deep southern city or state could resist escalating federal force. \"I suppose,\" he commented, \"the president could have sent the United States Navy up the Mississippi River\" - which was exactly what Abraham Lincoln had done a century earlier. At the extreme, Republican and Democratic presidents deployed deputies, federal marshals, national guardsmen, and in the end even Army troops to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws and protect dissenters' rights under the First Amendment when state and local officials refused to do so.  If the attack dogs, bombings, and mass arrests of children got bad enough in Birmingham , and if it all appeared on television nationwide, local black organizers came to understand that they could usually depend on predictable moral outrage in the White House, a Congress worried about reelection, or the Supreme Court for a remedy. In 1957, faced with news bulletins of white rioters and Alabama national guardsmen blocking nine black students from entering Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower reluctantly sent in elements of the Army's 101st Airborne Division, declaring on prime-time television, \"Mob rule cannot be allowed to override the decisions of the courts.\" Five years later, President Kennedy, a convert to the civil rights cause, would similarly dispatch his Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and 200 federal marshals backed by the U.S. Army to ensure that James Meredith could enter the besieged campus of the University of Mississippi. The Revolution Will Be Televised Movement leaders patiently calculated a strategy for success that often depended on the press, in particular the new medium of television news, to haul Jim Crow's physical, social, and civic brutality out of the backwoods and into the nation's living rooms. They understood that news crews would flock not only to record Martin Luther King's oratory but also the flamboyant antics of a few southern sheriffs and the grand theater of mass non-violent resistance.  Confronted with televised attacks on peaceful demonstrators, a majority of congressmen, including dozens of Republicans, might acknowledge the searing contradictions of state racism for what they were.  Whether good will, cynicism, or electoral savvy drove politicians' actions, the strategy worked. The national media provided a direct prod that regularly stiffened spines in Washington, but such public disapproval by hectoring northern journalists also brought white southerners together in solidarity against the media elites (a phenomenon that should have a certain resonance in present-day America).  White crowds knew that network television coverage spelled trouble for legal segregation and often went for the cameras.  Those mobs understood the postmodern power of images as well as any postmodernist. When the first Freedom Riders' bus rolled into Birmingham's bus station in 1961, dozens of Klansmen attacked the waiting newsmen first before they went after the riders.  There would be no news clips of that event on TV that evening. On the horrific night when James Meredith tried to enter the University of Mississippi, the mob , flying Confederate battle flags, attacked the media, smashing cameras, beating cameramen, and killing a reporter from Agence France-Presse execution-style, before shooting 35 federal marshals. Second only to the courage of African Americans was the courage of those highly visible TV crews. They would stay miraculously calm and focused, navigating the mayhem between marchers, mobs, and lawmen. Though they were constrained by journalistic standards from partisanship in reporting, many of those crews could not escape their growing sympathy for the movement, and found themselves ready to join in the reformation of America with their pictures and words. They were televising a particularly disgusting pageant: officers, under the sanction of state and local laws, bludgeoning, fire hosing, arresting, punching, cattle prodding, whipping, tear-gassing, and even shooting defenseless, unresisting black people who had declared their commitment to nonviolence.  It happened month after month throughout the 1960s. The Selma Show Movement leaders chose their sheriffs carefully, judging their battlegrounds in part by the quality of available villains.  They favored bad actors like Chief Bull Connor, the proud bigot of Birmingham, who unleashed fire hoses on teenaged marchers with operatic fury, and Selma's increasingly unhinged arch-segregationist sheriff, Jim Clark . The 1965 battle royal in Selma, Alabama, marked a milestone in the expansion of democracy for the town's African Americans, which had begun with the emancipation of its slaves during the Civil War. Selma first came under siege by Union regulars in April 1865.  The Confederate defenders, an ill-trained muster of white militiamen, kids, and old men, were no match for the northern troops who ran them out of their hometown, then spent the night burning and looting.  Selma's slaves were officially freed, but after a fleeting window of hope, Reconstruction and Jim Crow would strip them and their immediate descendants of nearly all their constitutional rights. By 1965, almost a century after the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which unambiguously declares, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged... on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\" the percentage of registered black voters in Alabama was actually falling.  Local white voter registration clerks in Selma had allowed only 2% of the city's 14,000 black citizens to register, compared to 90% of Selma's whites.  A carefully targeted registration campaign by local organizers and SNCC (later joined by the SCLC) aimed to shine a national spotlight on local oppression and so spur congressional action that would open up voting for black citizens throughout Alabama and eventually across the entire deep South. Strategically deploying Martin Luther King (just back from accepting the Nobel Prize in Norway), the movement in Selma set out to provoke Sheriff Clark and his famously brutal posse.  As SNCC's Jim Forman said, \"We were laying a trap.\" The aim was to heighten a moral battle of Shakespearian proportions that television would then beam directly to President Lyndon Johnson. At one point, the city would have 20 times more blacks in jail than on its voting rolls. Confrontations simmered throughout the winter of 1964-1965, punctuated by sudden explosions of violence. Reason, brotherly love, massed demonstrations, and inflamed national opinion made no dent in Jim Clark's enduring pathology .  Like a man possessed, he simply couldn't stop himself from behaving badly in front of the cameras.  He delivered the gaudy media goods, week after week, exactly as movement strategists had hoped he would, exactly as Selma's few moderate whites feared. The scenes of violence flashed around the country on TV every night, and appeared in the pages of the New York Times and Washington Post . By 1965, President Johnson, a Texas Democrat, was ready to take risks on civil rights.  He had already directed his White House staff to secretly prepare sweeping voting rights legislation and even a constitutional amendment.  Now, the only thing needed was a trigger, and that finally came on March 7th,  \"Bloody Sunday,\" when John Lewis, Hosea Williams, Bob Mants, and Albert Turner, leading hundreds of locals, crested the Pettus Bridge on their way to deliver a voting rights petition to Governor George Wallace at the state capitol. All hell broke loose. Whites cheered from the roadside as Alabama state troopers and Clark's mounted posse clubbed, bullwhipped, and tear-gassed their way through 600 unarmed black men, women, and children. A trooper fractured John Lewis's skull with his billy club. Here was the massacre of the innocents for all Americans to see: southern lawmen in their pig-faced gas masks going berserk against African Americans who stood and took it. That televised attack, a crystalline icon of the era, worthy of Dante, had by evening rallied nearly all of Washington to the marchers' cause. It would one day become a sturdy staple of history texts and documentaries. That night, local whites murdered a northern Unitarian minister. Selma's young white mayor, Joe Smitherman, said, \"I didn't understand how big it was until I saw it on television... That looked like a war; that went all over the country. And then... the wrath of the nation came down on us.\" Citing television coverage, 31 Republican leaders condemned the situation in Alabama, as well as the administration's delay in proposing new federal voting legislation. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen rose to declare, \"The time is now.\" President Johnson sent 2,000 federal troops to Selma as Lincoln had done 100 years before, this time to protect peaceful citizens of Alabama from Alabama state troopers.  He went on national television to proclaim, \"Their cause must be our cause, and together we shall overcome!\" and then dispatched a sweeping voting rights bill to a willing Congress.  After it passed the House by a vote of 328 to 74 and the Senate by 79 to 18, Johnson signed the act into law with John Lewis and Dr. King at his side. By their determined organizing, marching, demonstrating, and most of all by their relentless courage, local black people had successfully appealed to Washington, finally brought legalized American apartheid to its knees. Black voting in Alabama jumped seven-fold in the next three years. Without the media slamming blunt facts in the face of sympathetic (or politically savvy) power brokers in Washington, \"Bloody Sunday\" might have left in its wake little more than a few hundred broken and bleeding marchers and the Jim Crow voting system still intact.  Without the TV coverage and a president and Congress capable of being won over, it might have been the civil rights equivalent of a tree falling silently in the forest, not the engine of sweeping change that it was. \"Freedom Is A Constant Struggle\" But that was then. Back in 1965, the charm of Selma was lost on most of us who ventured there. I've returned a few times since, first in 1985 to shoot scenes for Eyes on the Prize , including an interview with an unrepentant Jim Clark. The town was, by then, smaller, blacker, and poorer. In 2015, I returned again with producer Orlando Bagwell to work on a film for the Southern Poverty Law Center.  From a distance, nestled on a bluff above the Alabama River, Selma looked to me like a picturesque little town in southern France.  The air below the Edmund Pettus Bridge , now a national historic landmark, was alive with swallows.  Selma's lovely historic district seemed nicely parked somewhere between 1850 and 1950, but much of the rest of the once-prosperous town had, like so much of small town America, been hollowed out by recession and a changing economy.  We could find only one restaurant open for supper downtown. Many of its beautiful nineteenth-century buildings were boarded up. Gaping bullet holes pockmarked the granite tombstone of Jimmie Lee Jackson, whose murder by a state trooper had sparked the original Bloody Sunday march. The Civil War Battle of Selma is still reenacted annually on a field outside town, with the Confederates defeated again, each year. The Voting Rights Act forged in Selma had been a triumph of the classic civil rights movement, the hinge between everything that came before and so much that would come after. But we had little reason to suspect or notice when, shortly after the act's passage in 1965, conservative organizers began a methodical 40-year campaign to gut it.  As black voter rolls in rural Alabama swelled, the state's young federal prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, brought charges of voter fraud against civil rights organizer Albert Turner, a leader of the Bloody Sunday march.  His case collapsed in court, but resistance continued, culminating in a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down one of that act's key provisions (federal approval of state changes in their voting laws). Ever since, a Republican campaign to put new voting restrictions in place has only gained momentum . In 2015, however, few had noticed the most profound changes of all, even though they were stirring just below the surface of things: sweeping working class frustration; previously dormant strains of racism, misogyny, and nativism; galloping income inequality; and Democratic Party failures that went unnoticed and uncorrected.  All of these factors would help lay the groundwork for the successful candidacy of Donald J. Trump.  He was slow indeed to reject the white supremacists and nationalists who rushed to endorse his presidential bid and he was brought to office in some measure by the very forces that the civil rights movement naively thought it had largely silenced. Because the lid had been kept on overt public racism and nativism for so long, many Americans were slow to understand how deeply systemic the problem is. The citizens of Selma voted for Hillary Clinton by a wide margin, but no matter.  Trump's wave has driven from power the vital center with which mass movements had once been able to partner. Vestiges of the very ethos against which the civil rights movement fought have grown ever stronger and found a welcome place in his White House, their strength buoyed by a growing societal disapproval of media elites.  In the process, Trump has inoculated himself against appeals for justice as has no president in our lifetime. When it comes to any rights appeals in the immediate future, no one with real federal power is likely to be listening. There will be no sympathy for human rights petitioners from majority Republicans in the House of Representatives untroubled by reelection fears in their ferociously gerrymandered districts, nor from the soon-to-be-devastated civil rights division of the Department of Justice. What mechanisms will remain for the activists to activate? In a country becoming less white every day, Democrats recently stood helpless when it came to blocking the confirmation of the whitest cabinet in decades. Soon enough, the Supreme Court will have a conservative majority and then President Trump will have the run of the table, racking up a political monoculture unknown in our time. What many Americans think of as the civil rights movement - something in our black and white past, back there, back then - is, in fact, a deep running project launched long before we were born and sure to endure long after we are gone. In one now-historic decade, civil rights organizers brilliantly identified the levers of government power they could seize, but most of those levers are today out of reach. In response, will activism translate into concrete results the way it once did? Surely, a new generation of organizers now rising with a resolve and passion not seen in years, having broadened the civil rights project into a human rights one, will develop new strategies. Surely, they will discover or invent new means of stopping what threatens to be a contraction of democracy.  Surely, with the power of social media - a veritable television station in the hands of every citizen - they will find their own ways of ensuring that oppression can't dodge the spotlight.  Already, the bottom-up strategy championed by SNCC has found new fluency in the ascendance of hyper-democratic Internet organizing and the raw eloquence of #BlackLivesMatter . Does reform still demand powerful allies, and if so, who might they be?  A few centrist Republicans, courageous career attorneys in the Justice Department, billionaire Silicon Valley CEOs committed to pluralism, a mass of determined young people running for office? As organizers have discovered more than once since the early days of the republic, new levers lie waiting somewhere deep in the grand clockwork of our democracy.  The only question is: Where?\n\nThis article originally appeared at TomDispatch.com .

Our long-running, ongoing, unfinished American civil rights struggle that so often focused on pressing the federal government toward justice, is suddenly in uncharted territory.  The legacy of Reverend Martin Luther King has slammed up against the legacy of Alabama Governor George Wallace, whose snarling campaign for president in 1968 has come home to roost in the presidency of Donald Trump.  Where civil rights leaders, warriors, and foot soldiers found support in high places they will now find a void. Partners With Power Amid discussion of renewed civil rights activism, you may well ask whether we'll need to fight those fights all over again. Will black people once more have to claim their humanity?  For perspective on this moment, let's consider why the strategies of the southern liberation struggle worked as well as they did back in the day. The classic civil rights movement (1954-1965) was sparked, organized, and driven by local people and leaders (maids, teachers, farmers, cooks, janitors, students, ministers) in a hundred southern towns who, with ferocious courage, stood up and said \"No more!\"  Their victories - some temporary, some lasting - regularly depended on their ability as citizens to reach beyond local and state segregationists to faraway presidents, congressional representatives, federal circuit court judges, and Supreme Court justices in Washington, appealing to them to respond with regulations, executive orders, laws, and even armed force. Dogged organizing by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the Congress Of Racial Equality (CORE), and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), together with the NAACP's decades-long legal campaigns, Martin Luther King's rhetorical genius, and the massed moral crusade of black southerners first shamed and finally forced the latent hand of federal power.  Alert to this leapfrog tactic, Malcolm X, W.E.B. Du Bois, and others went a step further and tried unsuccessfully to appeal to the United Nations, as more recently have the parents of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Jordan Davis.

Board of Education school desegregation decision, the Supreme Court signaled to African Americans in the former Confederacy that they had a friend in Washington.  In Brown , by the sheer weight of evidence, moral suasion, and reason, a handful of African American parents, children, and their lawyers had compelled nine aging white justices (including former Ku Klux Klansman Hugo Black ) to agree that all citizens deserve equal education. In a similar manner over the next decade, one powerful judicial, congressional, and presidential ally after another would step up, willfully or grudgingly, to affirm simple justice, rights long promised but also long deferred.  Their embrace of civil rights was sometimes a matter of conscience, sometimes a savvy calculation of their constituents' electoral mood. Those actions would, in the end, help open doors and extend legal rights to ethnic minorities, women, immigrants, workers, and most recently gay, lesbian, and transgendered citizens. Major legislation - the Civil Rights Act of 1957 which established the Justice Department's civil rights division, the 1964 Act which outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, or national origin, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 - and hundreds of decisions handed down by federal district courts, circuit courts, and the Supreme Court all slowly expanded protections to African Americans and set precedents for all Americans. Unlike blacks within white-ruled South Africa who, at the time, were not citizens of their own nation and had little hope of federal protection, blacks across the deep South could succeed because they were citizens not only of their own states, but of the United States. Few in the 1960s believed that marching, demonstrating, sitting in, agitating, witnessing, disrupting, or singing could ever change the minds, much less the policies, of a half-dozen southern governors, a hundred county sheriffs, or millions of white segregationists.  The Montgomery bus boycott was successful in driving the bus company to the edge of bankruptcy, but legal bus segregation remained intact until the Supreme Court stepped in. Well-schooled in the strategies of Gandhi, civil rights leaders knew of the critical value of mass meetings, collective action, and civil disobedience for building resolve, visibility, and a powerful sense of community, but they also knew its limits: solidarity was not enough.  Coming together to raise awareness would not in itself achieve concrete results.  Birmingham leader Fred Shuttlesworth put it this way: \"Look, America, look at your promises; look how you've treated your poor Negro citizens.  But you can't shame segregation. Rattlesnakes don't commit suicide.\" Persuasion, appeals to reason, and simple justice certainly recruited northern liberals and some white southern moderates to the cause, but southern blacks could have preached the Sermon on the Mount or the U.S. Constitution daily to White Citizens' Councils to no effect.  In the end, the decisive language that spoke to white oppression was power, and the power that proved decisive often lay in Washington. While economic boycotts might sometimes force compromise on local businesses and segregationist officials, generally the trick was to vault over them to, if necessary, the president himself. In the documentary Eyes On The Prize , Burke Marshall, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division under President Kennedy explained, that, when push came to shove, no deep southern city or state could resist escalating federal force. \"I suppose,\" he commented, \"the president could have sent the United States Navy up the Mississippi River\" - which was exactly what Abraham Lincoln had done a century earlier. At the extreme, Republican and Democratic presidents deployed deputies, federal marshals, national guardsmen, and in the end even Army troops to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws and protect dissenters' rights under the First Amendment when state and local officials refused to do so.  If the attack dogs, bombings, and mass arrests of children got bad enough in Birmingham , and if it all appeared on television nationwide, local black organizers came to understand that they could usually depend on predictable moral outrage in the White House, a Congress worried about reelection, or the Supreme Court for a remedy. In 1957, faced with news bulletins of white rioters and Alabama national guardsmen blocking nine black students from entering Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower reluctantly sent in elements of the Army's 101st Airborne Division, declaring on prime-time television, \"Mob rule cannot be allowed to override the decisions of the courts.\" Five years later, President Kennedy, a convert to the civil rights cause, would similarly dispatch his Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and 200 federal marshals backed by the U.S. Army to ensure that James Meredith could enter the besieged campus of the University of Mississippi. The Revolution Will Be Televised Movement leaders patiently calculated a strategy for success that often depended on the press, in particular the new medium of television news, to haul Jim Crow's physical, social, and civic brutality out of the backwoods and into the nation's living rooms. They understood that news crews would flock not only to record Martin Luther King's oratory but also the flamboyant antics of a few southern sheriffs and the grand theater of mass non-violent resistance.  Confronted with televised attacks on peaceful demonstrators, a majority of congressmen, including dozens of Republicans, might acknowledge the searing contradictions of state racism for what they were.  Whether good will, cynicism, or electoral savvy drove politicians' actions, the strategy worked. The national media provided a direct prod that regularly stiffened spines in Washington, but such public disapproval by hectoring northern journalists also brought white southerners together in solidarity against the media elites (a phenomenon that should have a certain resonance in present-day America).  White crowds knew that network television coverage spelled trouble for legal segregation and often went for the cameras.  Those mobs understood the postmodern power of images as well as any postmodernist. When the first Freedom Riders' bus rolled into Birmingham's bus station in 1961, dozens of Klansmen attacked the waiting newsmen first before they went after the riders.  There would be no news clips of that event on TV that evening. On the horrific night when James Meredith tried to enter the University of Mississippi, the mob , flying Confederate battle flags, attacked the media, smashing cameras, beating cameramen, and killing a reporter from Agence France-Presse execution-style, before shooting 35 federal marshals. Second only to the courage of African Americans was the courage of those highly visible TV crews. They would stay miraculously calm and focused, navigating the mayhem between marchers, mobs, and lawmen. Though they were constrained by journalistic standards from partisanship in reporting, many of those crews could not escape their growing sympathy for the movement, and found themselves ready to join in the reformation of America with their pictures and words. They were televising a particularly disgusting pageant: officers, under the sanction of state and local laws, bludgeoning, fire hosing, arresting, punching, cattle prodding, whipping, tear-gassing, and even shooting defenseless, unresisting black people who had declared their commitment to nonviolence.  It happened month after month throughout the 1960s. The Selma Show Movement leaders chose their sheriffs carefully, judging their battlegrounds in part by the quality of available villains.  They favored bad actors like Chief Bull Connor, the proud bigot of Birmingham, who unleashed fire hoses on teenaged marchers with operatic fury, and Selma's increasingly unhinged arch-segregationist sheriff, Jim Clark . The 1965 battle royal in Selma, Alabama, marked a milestone in the expansion of democracy for the town's African Americans, which had begun with the emancipation of its slaves during the Civil War. Selma first came under siege by Union regulars in April 1865.  The Confederate defenders, an ill-trained muster of white militiamen, kids, and old men, were no match for the northern troops who ran them out of their hometown, then spent the night burning and looting.  Selma's slaves were officially freed, but after a fleeting window of hope, Reconstruction and Jim Crow would strip them and their immediate descendants of nearly all their constitutional rights. By 1965, almost a century after the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which unambiguously declares, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged... on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\" the percentage of registered black voters in Alabama was actually falling.  Local white voter registration clerks in Selma had allowed only 2% of the city's 14,000 black citizens to register, compared to 90% of Selma's whites.  A carefully targeted registration campaign by local organizers and SNCC (later joined by the SCLC) aimed to shine a national spotlight on local oppression and so spur congressional action that would open up voting for black citizens throughout Alabama and eventually across the entire deep South. Strategically deploying Martin Luther King (just back from accepting the Nobel Prize in Norway), the movement in Selma set out to provoke Sheriff Clark and his famously brutal posse.  As SNCC's Jim Forman said, \"We were laying a trap.\" The aim was to heighten a moral battle of Shakespearian proportions that television would then beam directly to President Lyndon Johnson. At one point, the city would have 20 times more blacks in jail than on its voting rolls. Confrontations simmered throughout the winter of 1964-1965, punctuated by sudden explosions of violence. Reason, brotherly love, massed demonstrations, and inflamed national opinion made no dent in Jim Clark's enduring pathology .  Like a man possessed, he simply couldn't stop himself from behaving badly in front of the cameras.  He delivered the gaudy media goods, week after week, exactly as movement strategists had hoped he would, exactly as Selma's few moderate whites feared. The scenes of violence flashed around the country on TV every night, and appeared in the pages of the New York Times and Washington Post . By 1965, President Johnson, a Texas Democrat, was ready to take risks on civil rights.  He had already directed his White House staff to secretly prepare sweeping voting rights legislation and even a constitutional amendment.  Now, the only thing needed was a trigger, and that finally came on March 7th,  \"Bloody Sunday,\" when John Lewis, Hosea Williams, Bob Mants, and Albert Turner, leading hundreds of locals, crested the Pettus Bridge on their way to deliver a voting rights petition to Governor George Wallace at the state capitol. All hell broke loose. Whites cheered from the roadside as Alabama state troopers and Clark's mounted posse clubbed, bullwhipped, and tear-gassed their way through 600 unarmed black men, women, and children. A trooper fractured John Lewis's skull with his billy club. Here was the massacre of the innocents for all Americans to see: southern lawmen in their pig-faced gas masks going berserk against African Americans who stood and took it. That televised attack, a crystalline icon of the era, worthy of Dante, had by evening rallied nearly all of Washington to the marchers' cause. It would one day become a sturdy staple of history texts and documentaries. That night, local whites murdered a northern Unitarian minister. Selma's young white mayor, Joe Smitherman, said, \"I didn't understand how big it was until I saw it on television... That looked like a war; that went all over the country. And then... the wrath of the nation came down on us.\" Citing television coverage, 31 Republican leaders condemned the situation in Alabama, as well as the administration's delay in proposing new federal voting legislation. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen rose to declare, \"The time is now.\" President Johnson sent 2,000 federal troops to Selma as Lincoln had done 100 years before, this time to protect peaceful citizens of Alabama from Alabama state troopers.  He went on national television to proclaim, \"Their cause must be our cause, and together we shall overcome!\" and then dispatched a sweeping voting rights bill to a willing Congress.  After it passed the House by a vote of 328 to 74 and the Senate by 79 to 18, Johnson signed the act into law with John Lewis and Dr. King at his side. By their determined organizing, marching, demonstrating, and most of all by their relentless courage, local black people had successfully appealed to Washington, finally brought legalized American apartheid to its knees. Black voting in Alabama jumped seven-fold in the next three years. Without the media slamming blunt facts in the face of sympathetic (or politically savvy) power brokers in Washington, \"Bloody Sunday\" might have left in its wake little more than a few hundred broken and bleeding marchers and the Jim Crow voting system still intact.  Without the TV coverage and a president and Congress capable of being won over, it might have been the civil rights equivalent of a tree falling silently in the forest, not the engine of sweeping change that it was. \"Freedom Is A Constant Struggle\" But that was then. Back in 1965, the charm of Selma was lost on most of us who ventured there. I've returned a few times since, first in 1985 to shoot scenes for Eyes on the Prize , including an interview with an unrepentant Jim Clark. The town was, by then, smaller, blacker, and poorer. In 2015, I returned again with producer Orlando Bagwell to work on a film for the Southern Poverty Law Center.  From a distance, nestled on a bluff above the Alabama River, Selma looked to me like a picturesque little town in southern France.  The air below the Edmund Pettus Bridge , now a national historic landmark, was alive with swallows.  Selma's lovely historic district seemed nicely parked somewhere between 1850 and 1950, but much of the rest of the once-prosperous town had, like so much of small town America, been hollowed out by recession and a changing economy.  We could find only one restaurant open for supper downtown. Many of its beautiful nineteenth-century buildings were boarded up. Gaping bullet holes pockmarked the granite tombstone of Jimmie Lee Jackson, whose murder by a state trooper had sparked the original Bloody Sunday march. The Civil War Battle of Selma is still reenacted annually on a field outside town, with the Confederates defeated again, each year. The Voting Rights Act forged in Selma had been a triumph of the classic civil rights movement, the hinge between everything that came before and so much that would come after. But we had little reason to suspect or notice when, shortly after the act's passage in 1965, conservative organizers began a methodical 40-year campaign to gut it.  As black voter rolls in rural Alabama swelled, the state's young federal prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, brought charges of voter fraud against civil rights organizer Albert Turner, a leader of the Bloody Sunday march.  His case collapsed in court, but resistance continued, culminating in a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down one of that act's key provisions (federal approval of state changes in their voting laws). Ever since, a Republican campaign to put new voting restrictions in place has only gained momentum . In 2015, however, few had noticed the most profound changes of all, even though they were stirring just below the surface of things: sweeping working class frustration; previously dormant strains of racism, misogyny, and nativism; galloping income inequality; and Democratic Party failures that went unnoticed and uncorrected.  All of these factors would help lay the groundwork for the successful candidacy of Donald J. Trump.  He was slow indeed to reject the white supremacists and nationalists who rushed to endorse his presidential bid and he was brought to office in some measure by the very forces that the civil rights movement naively thought it had largely silenced. Because the lid had been kept on overt public racism and nativism for so long, many Americans were slow to understand how deeply systemic the problem is. The citizens of Selma voted for Hillary Clinton by a wide margin, but no matter.  Trump's wave has driven from power the vital center with which mass movements had once been able to partner. Vestiges of the very ethos against which the civil rights movement fought have grown ever stronger and found a welcome place in his White House, their strength buoyed by a growing societal disapproval of media elites.  In the process, Trump has inoculated himself against appeals for justice as has no president in our lifetime. When it comes to any rights appeals in the immediate future, no one with real federal power is likely to be listening. There will be no sympathy for human rights petitioners from majority Republicans in the House of Representatives untroubled by reelection fears in their ferociously gerrymandered districts, nor from the soon-to-be-devastated civil rights division of the Department of Justice. What mechanisms will remain for the activists to activate? In a country becoming less white every day, Democrats recently stood helpless when it came to blocking the confirmation of the whitest cabinet in decades. Soon enough, the Supreme Court will have a conservative majority and then President Trump will have the run of the table, racking up a political monoculture unknown in our time. What many Americans think of as the civil rights movement - something in our black and white past, back there, back then - is, in fact, a deep running project launched long before we were born and sure to endure long after we are gone. In one now-historic decade, civil rights organizers brilliantly identified the levers of government power they could seize, but most of those levers are today out of reach. In response, will activism translate into concrete results the way it once did? Surely, a new generation of organizers now rising with a resolve and passion not seen in years, having broadened the civil rights project into a human rights one, will develop new strategies. Surely, they will discover or invent new means of stopping what threatens to be a contraction of democracy.  Surely, with the power of social media - a veritable television station in the hands of every citizen - they will find their own ways of ensuring that oppression can't dodge the spotlight.  Already, the bottom-up strategy championed by SNCC has found new fluency in the ascendance of hyper-democratic Internet organizing and the raw eloquence of #BlackLivesMatter . Does reform still demand powerful allies, and if so, who might they be?  A few centrist Republicans, courageous career attorneys in the Justice Department, billionaire Silicon Valley CEOs committed to pluralism, a mass of determined young people running for office? As organizers have discovered more than once since the early days of the republic, new levers lie waiting somewhere deep in the grand clockwork of our democracy.  The only question is: Where?\n\nAmid discussion of renewed civil rights activism, you may well ask whether we'll need to fight those fights all over again. Will black people once more have to claim their humanity?  For perspective on this moment, let's consider why the strategies of the southern liberation struggle worked as well as they did back in the day. The classic civil rights movement (1954-1965) was sparked, organized, and driven by local people and leaders (maids, teachers, farmers, cooks, janitors, students, ministers) in a hundred southern towns who, with ferocious courage, stood up and said \"No more!\"  Their victories - some temporary, some lasting - regularly depended on their ability as citizens to reach beyond local and state segregationists to faraway presidents, congressional representatives, federal circuit court judges, and Supreme Court justices in Washington, appealing to them to respond with regulations, executive orders, laws, and even armed force.

Alert to this leapfrog tactic, Malcolm X, W.E.B. Du Bois, and others went a step further and tried unsuccessfully to appeal to the United Nations, as more recently have the parents of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Jordan Davis.

In a similar manner over the next decade, one powerful judicial, congressional, and presidential ally after another would step up, willfully or grudgingly, to affirm simple justice, rights long promised but also long deferred.  Their embrace of civil rights was sometimes a matter of conscience, sometimes a savvy calculation of their constituents' electoral mood. Those actions would, in the end, help open doors and extend legal rights to ethnic minorities, women, immigrants, workers, and most recently gay, lesbian, and transgendered citizens. Major legislation - the Civil Rights Act of 1957 which established the Justice Department's civil rights division, the 1964 Act which outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, or national origin, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 - and hundreds of decisions handed down by federal district courts, circuit courts, and the Supreme Court all slowly expanded protections to African Americans and set precedents for all Americans. Unlike blacks within white-ruled South Africa who, at the time, were not citizens of their own nation and had little hope of federal protection, blacks across the deep South could succeed because they were citizens not only of their own states, but of the United States. Few in the 1960s believed that marching, demonstrating, sitting in, agitating, witnessing, disrupting, or singing could ever change the minds, much less the policies, of a half-dozen southern governors, a hundred county sheriffs, or millions of white segregationists.  The Montgomery bus boycott was successful in driving the bus company to the edge of bankruptcy, but legal bus segregation remained intact until the Supreme Court stepped in. Well-schooled in the strategies of Gandhi, civil rights leaders knew of the critical value of mass meetings, collective action, and civil disobedience for building resolve, visibility, and a powerful sense of community, but they also knew its limits: solidarity was not enough.  Coming together to raise awareness would not in itself achieve concrete results.  Birmingham leader Fred Shuttlesworth put it this way: \"Look, America, look at your promises; look how you've treated your poor Negro citizens.  But you can't shame segregation. Rattlesnakes don't commit suicide.\" Persuasion, appeals to reason, and simple justice certainly recruited northern liberals and some white southern moderates to the cause, but southern blacks could have preached the Sermon on the Mount or the U.S. Constitution daily to White Citizens' Councils to no effect.  In the end, the decisive language that spoke to white oppression was power, and the power that proved decisive often lay in Washington. While economic boycotts might sometimes force compromise on local businesses and segregationist officials, generally the trick was to vault over them to, if necessary, the president himself. In the documentary Eyes On The Prize , Burke Marshall, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division under President Kennedy explained, that, when push came to shove, no deep southern city or state could resist escalating federal force. \"I suppose,\" he commented, \"the president could have sent the United States Navy up the Mississippi River\" - which was exactly what Abraham Lincoln had done a century earlier. At the extreme, Republican and Democratic presidents deployed deputies, federal marshals, national guardsmen, and in the end even Army troops to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws and protect dissenters' rights under the First Amendment when state and local officials refused to do so.  If the attack dogs, bombings, and mass arrests of children got bad enough in Birmingham , and if it all appeared on television nationwide, local black organizers came to understand that they could usually depend on predictable moral outrage in the White House, a Congress worried about reelection, or the Supreme Court for a remedy. In 1957, faced with news bulletins of white rioters and Alabama national guardsmen blocking nine black students from entering Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower reluctantly sent in elements of the Army's 101st Airborne Division, declaring on prime-time television, \"Mob rule cannot be allowed to override the decisions of the courts.\" Five years later, President Kennedy, a convert to the civil rights cause, would similarly dispatch his Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and 200 federal marshals backed by the U.S. Army to ensure that James Meredith could enter the besieged campus of the University of Mississippi. The Revolution Will Be Televised Movement leaders patiently calculated a strategy for success that often depended on the press, in particular the new medium of television news, to haul Jim Crow's physical, social, and civic brutality out of the backwoods and into the nation's living rooms.

Whether good will, cynicism, or electoral savvy drove politicians' actions, the strategy worked. The national media provided a direct prod that regularly stiffened spines in Washington, but such public disapproval by hectoring northern journalists also brought white southerners together in solidarity against the media elites (a phenomenon that should have a certain resonance in present-day America).  White crowds knew that network television coverage spelled trouble for legal segregation and often went for the cameras.  Those mobs understood the postmodern power of images as well as any postmodernist. When the first Freedom Riders' bus rolled into Birmingham's bus station in 1961, dozens of Klansmen attacked the waiting newsmen first before they went after the riders.  There would be no news clips of that event on TV that evening. On the horrific night when James Meredith tried to enter the University of Mississippi, the mob , flying Confederate battle flags, attacked the media, smashing cameras, beating cameramen, and killing a reporter from Agence France-Presse execution-style, before shooting 35 federal marshals. Second only to the courage of African Americans was the courage of those highly visible TV crews. They would stay miraculously calm and focused, navigating the mayhem between marchers, mobs, and lawmen.

Local white voter registration clerks in Selma had allowed only 2% of the city's 14,000 black citizens to register, compared to 90% of Selma's whites.  A carefully targeted registration campaign by local organizers and SNCC (later joined by the SCLC) aimed to shine a national spotlight on local oppression and so spur congressional action that would open up voting for black citizens throughout Alabama and eventually across the entire deep South. Strategically deploying Martin Luther King (just back from accepting the Nobel Prize in Norway), the movement in Selma set out to provoke Sheriff Clark and his famously brutal posse.  As SNCC's Jim Forman said, \"We were laying a trap.\" The aim was to heighten a moral battle of Shakespearian proportions that television would then beam directly to President Lyndon Johnson. At one point, the city would have 20 times more blacks in jail than on its voting rolls. Confrontations simmered throughout the winter of 1964-1965, punctuated by sudden explosions of violence. Reason, brotherly love, massed demonstrations, and inflamed national opinion made no dent in Jim Clark's enduring pathology .  Like a man possessed, he simply couldn't stop himself from behaving badly in front of the cameras.  He delivered the gaudy media goods, week after week, exactly as movement strategists had hoped he would, exactly as Selma's few moderate whites feared. The scenes of violence flashed around the country on TV every night, and appeared in the pages of the New York Times and Washington Post . By 1965, President Johnson, a Texas Democrat, was ready to take risks on civil rights.  He had already directed his White House staff to secretly prepare sweeping voting rights legislation and even a constitutional amendment.  Now, the only thing needed was a trigger, and that finally came on March 7th,  \"Bloody Sunday,\" when John Lewis, Hosea Williams, Bob Mants, and Albert Turner, leading hundreds of locals, crested the Pettus Bridge on their way to deliver a voting rights petition to Governor George Wallace at the state capitol. All hell broke loose. Whites cheered from the roadside as Alabama state troopers and Clark's mounted posse clubbed, bullwhipped, and tear-gassed their way through 600 unarmed black men, women, and children. A trooper fractured John Lewis's skull with his billy club. Here was the massacre of the innocents for all Americans to see: southern lawmen in their pig-faced gas masks going berserk against African Americans who stood and took it. That televised attack, a crystalline icon of the era, worthy of Dante, had by evening rallied nearly all of Washington to the marchers' cause. It would one day become a sturdy staple of history texts and documentaries. That night, local whites murdered a northern Unitarian minister. Selma's young white mayor, Joe Smitherman, said, \"I didn't understand how big it was until I saw it on television... That looked like a war; that went all over the country. And then... the wrath of the nation came down on us.\" Citing television coverage, 31 Republican leaders condemned the situation in Alabama, as well as the administration's delay in proposing new federal voting legislation. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen rose to declare, \"The time is now.\" President Johnson sent 2,000 federal troops to Selma as Lincoln had done 100 years before, this time to protect peaceful citizens of Alabama from Alabama state troopers.  He went on national television to proclaim, \"Their cause must be our cause, and together we shall overcome!\" and then dispatched a sweeping voting rights bill to a willing Congress.  After it passed the House by a vote of 328 to 74 and the Senate by 79 to 18, Johnson signed the act into law with John Lewis and Dr. King at his side. By their determined organizing, marching, demonstrating, and most of all by their relentless courage, local black people had successfully appealed to Washington, finally brought legalized American apartheid to its knees. Black voting in Alabama jumped seven-fold in the next three years. Without the media slamming blunt facts in the face of sympathetic (or politically savvy) power brokers in Washington, \"Bloody Sunday\" might have left in its wake little more than a few hundred broken and bleeding marchers and the Jim Crow voting system still intact.  Without the TV coverage and a president and Congress capable of being won over, it might have been the civil rights equivalent of a tree falling silently in the forest, not the engine of sweeping change that it was. \"Freedom Is A Constant Struggle\" But that was then. Back in 1965, the charm of Selma was lost on most of us who ventured there. I've returned a few times since, first in 1985 to shoot scenes for Eyes on the Prize , including an interview with an unrepentant Jim Clark. The town was, by then, smaller, blacker, and poorer. In 2015, I returned again with producer Orlando Bagwell to work on a film for the Southern Poverty Law Center.  From a distance, nestled on a bluff above the Alabama River, Selma looked to me like a picturesque little town in southern France.  The air below the Edmund Pettus Bridge , now a national historic landmark, was alive with swallows.  Selma's lovely historic district seemed nicely parked somewhere between 1850 and 1950, but much of the rest of the once-prosperous town had, like so much of small town America, been hollowed out by recession and a changing economy.  We could find only one restaurant open for supper downtown. Many of its beautiful nineteenth-century buildings were boarded up. Gaping bullet holes pockmarked the granite tombstone of Jimmie Lee Jackson, whose murder by a state trooper had sparked the original Bloody Sunday march. The Civil War Battle of Selma is still reenacted annually on a field outside town, with the Confederates defeated again, each year. The Voting Rights Act forged in Selma had been a triumph of the classic civil rights movement, the hinge between everything that came before and so much that would come after. But we had little reason to suspect or notice when, shortly after the act's passage in 1965, conservative organizers began a methodical 40-year campaign to gut it.  As black voter rolls in rural Alabama swelled, the state's young federal prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, brought charges of voter fraud against civil rights organizer Albert Turner, a leader of the Bloody Sunday march.  His case collapsed in court, but resistance continued, culminating in a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down one of that act's key provisions (federal approval of state changes in their voting laws). Ever since, a Republican campaign to put new voting restrictions in place has only gained momentum . In 2015, however, few had noticed the most profound changes of all, even though they were stirring just below the surface of things: sweeping working class frustration; previously dormant strains of racism, misogyny, and nativism; galloping income inequality; and Democratic Party failures that went unnoticed and uncorrected.  All of these factors would help lay the groundwork for the successful candidacy of Donald J. Trump.  He was slow indeed to reject the white supremacists and nationalists who rushed to endorse his presidential bid and he was brought to office in some measure by the very forces that the civil rights movement naively thought it had largely silenced. Because the lid had been kept on overt public racism and nativism for so long, many Americans were slow to understand how deeply systemic the problem is. The citizens of Selma voted for Hillary Clinton by a wide margin, but no matter.  Trump's wave has driven from power the vital center with which mass movements had once been able to partner. Vestiges of the very ethos against which the civil rights movement fought have grown ever stronger and found a welcome place in his White House, their strength buoyed by a growing societal disapproval of media elites.  In the process, Trump has inoculated himself against appeals for justice as has no president in our lifetime. When it comes to any rights appeals in the immediate future, no one with real federal power is likely to be listening. There will be no sympathy for human rights petitioners from majority Republicans in the House of Representatives untroubled by reelection fears in their ferociously gerrymandered districts, nor from the soon-to-be-devastated civil rights division of the Department of Justice. What mechanisms will remain for the activists to activate? In a country becoming less white every day, Democrats recently stood helpless when it came to blocking the confirmation of the whitest cabinet in decades. Soon enough, the Supreme Court will have a conservative majority and then President Trump will have the run of the table, racking up a political monoculture unknown in our time. What many Americans think of as the civil rights movement - something in our black and white past, back there, back then - is, in fact, a deep running project launched long before we were born and sure to endure long after we are gone. In one now-historic decade, civil rights organizers brilliantly identified the levers of government power they could seize, but most of those levers are today out of reach. In response, will activism translate into concrete results the way it once did? Surely, a new generation of organizers now rising with a resolve and passion not seen in years, having broadened the civil rights project into a human rights one, will develop new strategies. Surely, they will discover or invent new means of stopping what threatens to be a contraction of democracy.  Surely, with the power of social media - a veritable television station in the hands of every citizen - they will find their own ways of ensuring that oppression can't dodge the spotlight.  Already, the bottom-up strategy championed by SNCC has found new fluency in the ascendance of hyper-democratic Internet organizing and the raw eloquence of #BlackLivesMatter . Does reform still demand powerful allies, and if so, who might they be?  A few centrist Republicans, courageous career attorneys in the Justice Department, billionaire Silicon Valley CEOs committed to pluralism, a mass of determined young people running for office? As organizers have discovered more than once since the early days of the republic, new levers lie waiting somewhere deep in the grand clockwork of our democracy.  The only question is: Where?\n\nThe classic civil rights movement (1954-1965) was sparked, organized, and driven by local people and leaders (maids, teachers, farmers, cooks, janitors, students, ministers) in a hundred southern towns who, with ferocious courage, stood up and said \"No more!\"  Their victories - some temporary, some lasting - regularly depended on their ability as citizens to reach beyond local and state segregationists to faraway presidents, congressional representatives, federal circuit court judges, and Supreme Court justices in Washington, appealing to them to respond with regulations, executive orders, laws, and even armed force. Dogged organizing by the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), the Congress Of Racial Equality (CORE), and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), together with the NAACP's decades-long legal campaigns, Martin Luther King's rhetorical genius, and the massed moral crusade of black southerners first shamed and finally forced the latent hand of federal power.  Alert to this leapfrog tactic, Malcolm X, W.E.B. Du Bois, and others went a step further and tried unsuccessfully to appeal to the United Nations, as more recently have the parents of Trayvon Martin, Michael Brown, and Jordan Davis.

Board of Education school desegregation decision, the Supreme Court signaled to African Americans in the former Confederacy that they had a friend in Washington.  In Brown , by the sheer weight of evidence, moral suasion, and reason, a handful of African American parents, children, and their lawyers had compelled nine aging white justices (including former Ku Klux Klansman Hugo Black ) to agree that all citizens deserve equal education. In a similar manner over the next decade, one powerful judicial, congressional, and presidential ally after another would step up, willfully or grudgingly, to affirm simple justice, rights long promised but also long deferred.  Their embrace of civil rights was sometimes a matter of conscience, sometimes a savvy calculation of their constituents' electoral mood. Those actions would, in the end, help open doors and extend legal rights to ethnic minorities, women, immigrants, workers, and most recently gay, lesbian, and transgendered citizens. Major legislation - the Civil Rights Act of 1957 which established the Justice Department's civil rights division, the 1964 Act which outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, or national origin, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 - and hundreds of decisions handed down by federal district courts, circuit courts, and the Supreme Court all slowly expanded protections to African Americans and set precedents for all Americans. Unlike blacks within white-ruled South Africa who, at the time, were not citizens of their own nation and had little hope of federal protection, blacks across the deep South could succeed because they were citizens not only of their own states, but of the United States. Few in the 1960s believed that marching, demonstrating, sitting in, agitating, witnessing, disrupting, or singing could ever change the minds, much less the policies, of a half-dozen southern governors, a hundred county sheriffs, or millions of white segregationists.  The Montgomery bus boycott was successful in driving the bus company to the edge of bankruptcy, but legal bus segregation remained intact until the Supreme Court stepped in. Well-schooled in the strategies of Gandhi, civil rights leaders knew of the critical value of mass meetings, collective action, and civil disobedience for building resolve, visibility, and a powerful sense of community, but they also knew its limits: solidarity was not enough.  Coming together to raise awareness would not in itself achieve concrete results.  Birmingham leader Fred Shuttlesworth put it this way: \"Look, America, look at your promises; look how you've treated your poor Negro citizens.  But you can't shame segregation. Rattlesnakes don't commit suicide.\" Persuasion, appeals to reason, and simple justice certainly recruited northern liberals and some white southern moderates to the cause, but southern blacks could have preached the Sermon on the Mount or the U.S. Constitution daily to White Citizens' Councils to no effect.  In the end, the decisive language that spoke to white oppression was power, and the power that proved decisive often lay in Washington. While economic boycotts might sometimes force compromise on local businesses and segregationist officials, generally the trick was to vault over them to, if necessary, the president himself. In the documentary Eyes On The Prize , Burke Marshall, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division under President Kennedy explained, that, when push came to shove, no deep southern city or state could resist escalating federal force. \"I suppose,\" he commented, \"the president could have sent the United States Navy up the Mississippi River\" - which was exactly what Abraham Lincoln had done a century earlier. At the extreme, Republican and Democratic presidents deployed deputies, federal marshals, national guardsmen, and in the end even Army troops to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws and protect dissenters' rights under the First Amendment when state and local officials refused to do so.  If the attack dogs, bombings, and mass arrests of children got bad enough in Birmingham , and if it all appeared on television nationwide, local black organizers came to understand that they could usually depend on predictable moral outrage in the White House, a Congress worried about reelection, or the Supreme Court for a remedy. In 1957, faced with news bulletins of white rioters and Alabama national guardsmen blocking nine black students from entering Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower reluctantly sent in elements of the Army's 101st Airborne Division, declaring on prime-time television, \"Mob rule cannot be allowed to override the decisions of the courts.\" Five years later, President Kennedy, a convert to the civil rights cause, would similarly dispatch his Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and 200 federal marshals backed by the U.S. Army to ensure that James Meredith could enter the besieged campus of the University of Mississippi. The Revolution Will Be Televised Movement leaders patiently calculated a strategy for success that often depended on the press, in particular the new medium of television news, to haul Jim Crow's physical, social, and civic brutality out of the backwoods and into the nation's living rooms. They understood that news crews would flock not only to record Martin Luther King's oratory but also the flamboyant antics of a few southern sheriffs and the grand theater of mass non-violent resistance.  Confronted with televised attacks on peaceful demonstrators, a majority of congressmen, including dozens of Republicans, might acknowledge the searing contradictions of state racism for what they were.  Whether good will, cynicism, or electoral savvy drove politicians' actions, the strategy worked. The national media provided a direct prod that regularly stiffened spines in Washington, but such public disapproval by hectoring northern journalists also brought white southerners together in solidarity against the media elites (a phenomenon that should have a certain resonance in present-day America).  White crowds knew that network television coverage spelled trouble for legal segregation and often went for the cameras.  Those mobs understood the postmodern power of images as well as any postmodernist. When the first Freedom Riders' bus rolled into Birmingham's bus station in 1961, dozens of Klansmen attacked the waiting newsmen first before they went after the riders.  There would be no news clips of that event on TV that evening. On the horrific night when James Meredith tried to enter the University of Mississippi, the mob , flying Confederate battle flags, attacked the media, smashing cameras, beating cameramen, and killing a reporter from Agence France-Presse execution-style, before shooting 35 federal marshals. Second only to the courage of African Americans was the courage of those highly visible TV crews. They would stay miraculously calm and focused, navigating the mayhem between marchers, mobs, and lawmen. Though they were constrained by journalistic standards from partisanship in reporting, many of those crews could not escape their growing sympathy for the movement, and found themselves ready to join in the reformation of America with their pictures and words. They were televising a particularly disgusting pageant: officers, under the sanction of state and local laws, bludgeoning, fire hosing, arresting, punching, cattle prodding, whipping, tear-gassing, and even shooting defenseless, unresisting black people who had declared their commitment to nonviolence.  It happened month after month throughout the 1960s. The Selma Show Movement leaders chose their sheriffs carefully, judging their battlegrounds in part by the quality of available villains.  They favored bad actors like Chief Bull Connor, the proud bigot of Birmingham, who unleashed fire hoses on teenaged marchers with operatic fury, and Selma's increasingly unhinged arch-segregationist sheriff, Jim Clark . The 1965 battle royal in Selma, Alabama, marked a milestone in the expansion of democracy for the town's African Americans, which had begun with the emancipation of its slaves during the Civil War. Selma first came under siege by Union regulars in April 1865.  The Confederate defenders, an ill-trained muster of white militiamen, kids, and old men, were no match for the northern troops who ran them out of their hometown, then spent the night burning and looting.  Selma's slaves were officially freed, but after a fleeting window of hope, Reconstruction and Jim Crow would strip them and their immediate descendants of nearly all their constitutional rights. By 1965, almost a century after the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which unambiguously declares, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged... on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\" the percentage of registered black voters in Alabama was actually falling.  Local white voter registration clerks in Selma had allowed only 2% of the city's 14,000 black citizens to register, compared to 90% of Selma's whites.  A carefully targeted registration campaign by local organizers and SNCC (later joined by the SCLC) aimed to shine a national spotlight on local oppression and so spur congressional action that would open up voting for black citizens throughout Alabama and eventually across the entire deep South. Strategically deploying Martin Luther King (just back from accepting the Nobel Prize in Norway), the movement in Selma set out to provoke Sheriff Clark and his famously brutal posse.  As SNCC's Jim Forman said, \"We were laying a trap.\" The aim was to heighten a moral battle of Shakespearian proportions that television would then beam directly to President Lyndon Johnson. At one point, the city would have 20 times more blacks in jail than on its voting rolls. Confrontations simmered throughout the winter of 1964-1965, punctuated by sudden explosions of violence. Reason, brotherly love, massed demonstrations, and inflamed national opinion made no dent in Jim Clark's enduring pathology .  Like a man possessed, he simply couldn't stop himself from behaving badly in front of the cameras.  He delivered the gaudy media goods, week after week, exactly as movement strategists had hoped he would, exactly as Selma's few moderate whites feared. The scenes of violence flashed around the country on TV every night, and appeared in the pages of the New York Times and Washington Post . By 1965, President Johnson, a Texas Democrat, was ready to take risks on civil rights.  He had already directed his White House staff to secretly prepare sweeping voting rights legislation and even a constitutional amendment.  Now, the only thing needed was a trigger, and that finally came on March 7th,  \"Bloody Sunday,\" when John Lewis, Hosea Williams, Bob Mants, and Albert Turner, leading hundreds of locals, crested the Pettus Bridge on their way to deliver a voting rights petition to Governor George Wallace at the state capitol.

Republican Senator Everett Dirksen rose to declare, \"The time is now.\" President Johnson sent 2,000 federal troops to Selma as Lincoln had done 100 years before, this time to protect peaceful citizens of Alabama from Alabama state troopers.  He went on national television to proclaim, \"Their cause must be our cause, and together we shall overcome!\" and then dispatched a sweeping voting rights bill to a willing Congress.  After it passed the House by a vote of 328 to 74 and the Senate by 79 to 18, Johnson signed the act into law with John Lewis and Dr. King at his side. By their determined organizing, marching, demonstrating, and most of all by their relentless courage, local black people had successfully appealed to Washington, finally brought legalized American apartheid to its knees. Black voting in Alabama jumped seven-fold in the next three years. Without the media slamming blunt facts in the face of sympathetic (or politically savvy) power brokers in Washington, \"Bloody Sunday\" might have left in its wake little more than a few hundred broken and bleeding marchers and the Jim Crow voting system still intact.  Without the TV coverage and a president and Congress capable of being won over, it might have been the civil rights equivalent of a tree falling silently in the forest, not the engine of sweeping change that it was. \"Freedom Is A Constant Struggle\" But that was then.

Whether good will, cynicism, or electoral savvy drove politicians' actions, the strategy worked. The national media provided a direct prod that regularly stiffened spines in Washington, but such public disapproval by hectoring northern journalists also brought white southerners together in solidarity against the media elites (a phenomenon that should have a certain resonance in present-day America).  White crowds knew that network television coverage spelled trouble for legal segregation and often went for the cameras.  Those mobs understood the postmodern power of images as well as any postmodernist. When the first Freedom Riders' bus rolled into Birmingham's bus station in 1961, dozens of Klansmen attacked the waiting newsmen first before they went after the riders.  There would be no news clips of that event on TV that evening. On the horrific night when James Meredith tried to enter the University of Mississippi, the mob , flying Confederate battle flags, attacked the media, smashing cameras, beating cameramen, and killing a reporter from Agence France-Presse execution-style, before shooting 35 federal marshals. Second only to the courage of African Americans was the courage of those highly visible TV crews. They would stay miraculously calm and focused, navigating the mayhem between marchers, mobs, and lawmen. Though they were constrained by journalistic standards from partisanship in reporting, many of those crews could not escape their growing sympathy for the movement, and found themselves ready to join in the reformation of America with their pictures and words. They were televising a particularly disgusting pageant: officers, under the sanction of state and local laws, bludgeoning, fire hosing, arresting, punching, cattle prodding, whipping, tear-gassing, and even shooting defenseless, unresisting black people who had declared their commitment to nonviolence.  It happened month after month throughout the 1960s. The Selma Show Movement leaders chose their sheriffs carefully, judging their battlegrounds in part by the quality of available villains.  They favored bad actors like Chief Bull Connor, the proud bigot of Birmingham, who unleashed fire hoses on teenaged marchers with operatic fury, and Selma's increasingly unhinged arch-segregationist sheriff, Jim Clark . The 1965 battle royal in Selma, Alabama, marked a milestone in the expansion of democracy for the town's African Americans, which had begun with the emancipation of its slaves during the Civil War. Selma first came under siege by Union regulars in April 1865.  The Confederate defenders, an ill-trained muster of white militiamen, kids, and old men, were no match for the northern troops who ran them out of their hometown, then spent the night burning and looting.  Selma's slaves were officially freed, but after a fleeting window of hope, Reconstruction and Jim Crow would strip them and their immediate descendants of nearly all their constitutional rights. By 1965, almost a century after the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which unambiguously declares, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged... on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\" the percentage of registered black voters in Alabama was actually falling.  Local white voter registration clerks in Selma had allowed only 2% of the city's 14,000 black citizens to register, compared to 90% of Selma's whites.  A carefully targeted registration campaign by local organizers and SNCC (later joined by the SCLC) aimed to shine a national spotlight on local oppression and so spur congressional action that would open up voting for black citizens throughout Alabama and eventually across the entire deep South. Strategically deploying Martin Luther King (just back from accepting the Nobel Prize in Norway), the movement in Selma set out to provoke Sheriff Clark and his famously brutal posse.  As SNCC's Jim Forman said, \"We were laying a trap.\" The aim was to heighten a moral battle of Shakespearian proportions that television would then beam directly to President Lyndon Johnson. At one point, the city would have 20 times more blacks in jail than on its voting rolls. Confrontations simmered throughout the winter of 1964-1965, punctuated by sudden explosions of violence. Reason, brotherly love, massed demonstrations, and inflamed national opinion made no dent in Jim Clark's enduring pathology .  Like a man possessed, he simply couldn't stop himself from behaving badly in front of the cameras.  He delivered the gaudy media goods, week after week, exactly as movement strategists had hoped he would, exactly as Selma's few moderate whites feared. The scenes of violence flashed around the country on TV every night, and appeared in the pages of the New York Times and Washington Post . By 1965, President Johnson, a Texas Democrat, was ready to take risks on civil rights.  He had already directed his White House staff to secretly prepare sweeping voting rights legislation and even a constitutional amendment.  Now, the only thing needed was a trigger, and that finally came on March 7th,  \"Bloody Sunday,\" when John Lewis, Hosea Williams, Bob Mants, and Albert Turner, leading hundreds of locals, crested the Pettus Bridge on their way to deliver a voting rights petition to Governor George Wallace at the state capitol. All hell broke loose. Whites cheered from the roadside as Alabama state troopers and Clark's mounted posse clubbed, bullwhipped, and tear-gassed their way through 600 unarmed black men, women, and children. A trooper fractured John Lewis's skull with his billy club. Here was the massacre of the innocents for all Americans to see: southern lawmen in their pig-faced gas masks going berserk against African Americans who stood and took it. That televised attack, a crystalline icon of the era, worthy of Dante, had by evening rallied nearly all of Washington to the marchers' cause. It would one day become a sturdy staple of history texts and documentaries. That night, local whites murdered a northern Unitarian minister. Selma's young white mayor, Joe Smitherman, said, \"I didn't understand how big it was until I saw it on television... That looked like a war; that went all over the country. And then... the wrath of the nation came down on us.\" Citing television coverage, 31 Republican leaders condemned the situation in Alabama, as well as the administration's delay in proposing new federal voting legislation. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen rose to declare, \"The time is now.\" President Johnson sent 2,000 federal troops to Selma as Lincoln had done 100 years before, this time to protect peaceful citizens of Alabama from Alabama state troopers.  He went on national television to proclaim, \"Their cause must be our cause, and together we shall overcome!\" and then dispatched a sweeping voting rights bill to a willing Congress.  After it passed the House by a vote of 328 to 74 and the Senate by 79 to 18, Johnson signed the act into law with John Lewis and Dr. King at his side. By their determined organizing, marching, demonstrating, and most of all by their relentless courage, local black people had successfully appealed to Washington, finally brought legalized American apartheid to its knees. Black voting in Alabama jumped seven-fold in the next three years. Without the media slamming blunt facts in the face of sympathetic (or politically savvy) power brokers in Washington, \"Bloody Sunday\" might have left in its wake little more than a few hundred broken and bleeding marchers and the Jim Crow voting system still intact.  Without the TV coverage and a president and Congress capable of being won over, it might have been the civil rights equivalent of a tree falling silently in the forest, not the engine of sweeping change that it was. \"Freedom Is A Constant Struggle\" But that was then. Back in 1965, the charm of Selma was lost on most of us who ventured there. I've returned a few times since, first in 1985 to shoot scenes for Eyes on the Prize , including an interview with an unrepentant Jim Clark. The town was, by then, smaller, blacker, and poorer. In 2015, I returned again with producer Orlando Bagwell to work on a film for the Southern Poverty Law Center.  From a distance, nestled on a bluff above the Alabama River, Selma looked to me like a picturesque little town in southern France.  The air below the Edmund Pettus Bridge , now a national historic landmark, was alive with swallows.  Selma's lovely historic district seemed nicely parked somewhere between 1850 and 1950, but much of the rest of the once-prosperous town had, like so much of small town America, been hollowed out by recession and a changing economy.  We could find only one restaurant open for supper downtown. Many of its beautiful nineteenth-century buildings were boarded up. Gaping bullet holes pockmarked the granite tombstone of Jimmie Lee Jackson, whose murder by a state trooper had sparked the original Bloody Sunday march. The Civil War Battle of Selma is still reenacted annually on a field outside town, with the Confederates defeated again, each year. The Voting Rights Act forged in Selma had been a triumph of the classic civil rights movement, the hinge between everything that came before and so much that would come after. But we had little reason to suspect or notice when, shortly after the act's passage in 1965, conservative organizers began a methodical 40-year campaign to gut it.  As black voter rolls in rural Alabama swelled, the state's young federal prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, brought charges of voter fraud against civil rights organizer Albert Turner, a leader of the Bloody Sunday march.  His case collapsed in court, but resistance continued, culminating in a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down one of that act's key provisions (federal approval of state changes in their voting laws). Ever since, a Republican campaign to put new voting restrictions in place has only gained momentum . In 2015, however, few had noticed the most profound changes of all, even though they were stirring just below the surface of things: sweeping working class frustration; previously dormant strains of racism, misogyny, and nativism; galloping income inequality; and Democratic Party failures that went unnoticed and uncorrected.  All of these factors would help lay the groundwork for the successful candidacy of Donald J. Trump.  He was slow indeed to reject the white supremacists and nationalists who rushed to endorse his presidential bid and he was brought to office in some measure by the very forces that the civil rights movement naively thought it had largely silenced. Because the lid had been kept on overt public racism and nativism for so long, many Americans were slow to understand how deeply systemic the problem is. The citizens of Selma voted for Hillary Clinton by a wide margin, but no matter.  Trump's wave has driven from power the vital center with which mass movements had once been able to partner. Vestiges of the very ethos against which the civil rights movement fought have grown ever stronger and found a welcome place in his White House, their strength buoyed by a growing societal disapproval of media elites.  In the process, Trump has inoculated himself against appeals for justice as has no president in our lifetime. When it comes to any rights appeals in the immediate future, no one with real federal power is likely to be listening. There will be no sympathy for human rights petitioners from majority Republicans in the House of Representatives untroubled by reelection fears in their ferociously gerrymandered districts, nor from the soon-to-be-devastated civil rights division of the Department of Justice. What mechanisms will remain for the activists to activate? In a country becoming less white every day, Democrats recently stood helpless when it came to blocking the confirmation of the whitest cabinet in decades. Soon enough, the Supreme Court will have a conservative majority and then President Trump will have the run of the table, racking up a political monoculture unknown in our time. What many Americans think of as the civil rights movement - something in our black and white past, back there, back then - is, in fact, a deep running project launched long before we were born and sure to endure long after we are gone. In one now-historic decade, civil rights organizers brilliantly identified the levers of government power they could seize, but most of those levers are today out of reach. In response, will activism translate into concrete results the way it once did? Surely, a new generation of organizers now rising with a resolve and passion not seen in years, having broadened the civil rights project into a human rights one, will develop new strategies. Surely, they will discover or invent new means of stopping what threatens to be a contraction of democracy.  Surely, with the power of social media - a veritable television station in the hands of every citizen - they will find their own ways of ensuring that oppression can't dodge the spotlight.  Already, the bottom-up strategy championed by SNCC has found new fluency in the ascendance of hyper-democratic Internet organizing and the raw eloquence of #BlackLivesMatter . Does reform still demand powerful allies, and if so, who might they be?  A few centrist Republicans, courageous career attorneys in the Justice Department, billionaire Silicon Valley CEOs committed to pluralism, a mass of determined young people running for office? As organizers have discovered more than once since the early days of the republic, new levers lie waiting somewhere deep in the grand clockwork of our democracy.  The only question is: Where?\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nBooks & the Arts / David Klion\n\nBooks & the Arts / Daniel Steinmetz-Jenkins\n\nElie Mystal\n\nJohn Nichols\n\nWith its unanimous 1954 Brown v. Board of Education school desegregation decision, the Supreme Court signaled to African Americans in the former Confederacy that they had a friend in Washington.  In Brown , by the sheer weight of evidence, moral suasion, and reason, a handful of African American parents, children, and their lawyers had compelled nine aging white justices (including former Ku Klux Klansman Hugo Black ) to agree that all citizens deserve equal education. In a similar manner over the next decade, one powerful judicial, congressional, and presidential ally after another would step up, willfully or grudgingly, to affirm simple justice, rights long promised but also long deferred.  Their embrace of civil rights was sometimes a matter of conscience, sometimes a savvy calculation of their constituents' electoral mood. Those actions would, in the end, help open doors and extend legal rights to ethnic minorities, women, immigrants, workers, and most recently gay, lesbian, and transgendered citizens. Major legislation - the Civil Rights Act of 1957 which established the Justice Department's civil rights division, the 1964 Act which outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, or national origin, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 - and hundreds of decisions handed down by federal district courts, circuit courts, and the Supreme Court all slowly expanded protections to African Americans and set precedents for all Americans. Unlike blacks within white-ruled South Africa who, at the time, were not citizens of their own nation and had little hope of federal protection, blacks across the deep South could succeed because they were citizens not only of their own states, but of the United States. Few in the 1960s believed that marching, demonstrating, sitting in, agitating, witnessing, disrupting, or singing could ever change the minds, much less the policies, of a half-dozen southern governors, a hundred county sheriffs, or millions of white segregationists.  The Montgomery bus boycott was successful in driving the bus company to the edge of bankruptcy, but legal bus segregation remained intact until the Supreme Court stepped in. Well-schooled in the strategies of Gandhi, civil rights leaders knew of the critical value of mass meetings, collective action, and civil disobedience for building resolve, visibility, and a powerful sense of community, but they also knew its limits: solidarity was not enough.  Coming together to raise awareness would not in itself achieve concrete results.  Birmingham leader Fred Shuttlesworth put it this way: \"Look, America, look at your promises; look how you've treated your poor Negro citizens.  But you can't shame segregation. Rattlesnakes don't commit suicide.\" Persuasion, appeals to reason, and simple justice certainly recruited northern liberals and some white southern moderates to the cause, but southern blacks could have preached the Sermon on the Mount or the U.S. Constitution daily to White Citizens' Councils to no effect.  In the end, the decisive language that spoke to white oppression was power, and the power that proved decisive often lay in Washington. While economic boycotts might sometimes force compromise on local businesses and segregationist officials, generally the trick was to vault over them to, if necessary, the president himself. In the documentary Eyes On The Prize , Burke Marshall, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division under President Kennedy explained, that, when push came to shove, no deep southern city or state could resist escalating federal force. \"I suppose,\" he commented, \"the president could have sent the United States Navy up the Mississippi River\" - which was exactly what Abraham Lincoln had done a century earlier. At the extreme, Republican and Democratic presidents deployed deputies, federal marshals, national guardsmen, and in the end even Army troops to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws and protect dissenters' rights under the First Amendment when state and local officials refused to do so.  If the attack dogs, bombings, and mass arrests of children got bad enough in Birmingham , and if it all appeared on television nationwide, local black organizers came to understand that they could usually depend on predictable moral outrage in the White House, a Congress worried about reelection, or the Supreme Court for a remedy. In 1957, faced with news bulletins of white rioters and Alabama national guardsmen blocking nine black students from entering Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower reluctantly sent in elements of the Army's 101st Airborne Division, declaring on prime-time television, \"Mob rule cannot be allowed to override the decisions of the courts.\" Five years later, President Kennedy, a convert to the civil rights cause, would similarly dispatch his Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and 200 federal marshals backed by the U.S. Army to ensure that James Meredith could enter the besieged campus of the University of Mississippi. The Revolution Will Be Televised Movement leaders patiently calculated a strategy for success that often depended on the press, in particular the new medium of television news, to haul Jim Crow's physical, social, and civic brutality out of the backwoods and into the nation's living rooms. They understood that news crews would flock not only to record Martin Luther King's oratory but also the flamboyant antics of a few southern sheriffs and the grand theater of mass non-violent resistance.  Confronted with televised attacks on peaceful demonstrators, a majority of congressmen, including dozens of Republicans, might acknowledge the searing contradictions of state racism for what they were.

In 1957, faced with news bulletins of white rioters and Alabama national guardsmen blocking nine black students from entering Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower reluctantly sent in elements of the Army's 101st Airborne Division, declaring on prime-time television, \"Mob rule cannot be allowed to override the decisions of the courts.\" Five years later, President Kennedy, a convert to the civil rights cause, would similarly dispatch his Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and 200 federal marshals backed by the U.S. Army to ensure that James Meredith could enter the besieged campus of the University of Mississippi. The Revolution Will Be Televised Movement leaders patiently calculated a strategy for success that often depended on the press, in particular the new medium of television news, to haul Jim Crow's physical, social, and civic brutality out of the backwoods and into the nation's living rooms. They understood that news crews would flock not only to record Martin Luther King's oratory but also the flamboyant antics of a few southern sheriffs and the grand theater of mass non-violent resistance.  Confronted with televised attacks on peaceful demonstrators, a majority of congressmen, including dozens of Republicans, might acknowledge the searing contradictions of state racism for what they were.  Whether good will, cynicism, or electoral savvy drove politicians' actions, the strategy worked. The national media provided a direct prod that regularly stiffened spines in Washington, but such public disapproval by hectoring northern journalists also brought white southerners together in solidarity against the media elites (a phenomenon that should have a certain resonance in present-day America).  White crowds knew that network television coverage spelled trouble for legal segregation and often went for the cameras.  Those mobs understood the postmodern power of images as well as any postmodernist. When the first Freedom Riders' bus rolled into Birmingham's bus station in 1961, dozens of Klansmen attacked the waiting newsmen first before they went after the riders.  There would be no news clips of that event on TV that evening. On the horrific night when James Meredith tried to enter the University of Mississippi, the mob , flying Confederate battle flags, attacked the media, smashing cameras, beating cameramen, and killing a reporter from Agence France-Presse execution-style, before shooting 35 federal marshals. Second only to the courage of African Americans was the courage of those highly visible TV crews. They would stay miraculously calm and focused, navigating the mayhem between marchers, mobs, and lawmen. Though they were constrained by journalistic standards from partisanship in reporting, many of those crews could not escape their growing sympathy for the movement, and found themselves ready to join in the reformation of America with their pictures and words. They were televising a particularly disgusting pageant: officers, under the sanction of state and local laws, bludgeoning, fire hosing, arresting, punching, cattle prodding, whipping, tear-gassing, and even shooting defenseless, unresisting black people who had declared their commitment to nonviolence.  It happened month after month throughout the 1960s. The Selma Show Movement leaders chose their sheriffs carefully, judging their battlegrounds in part by the quality of available villains.  They favored bad actors like Chief Bull Connor, the proud bigot of Birmingham, who unleashed fire hoses on teenaged marchers with operatic fury, and Selma's increasingly unhinged arch-segregationist sheriff, Jim Clark . The 1965 battle royal in Selma, Alabama, marked a milestone in the expansion of democracy for the town's African Americans, which had begun with the emancipation of its slaves during the Civil War. Selma first came under siege by Union regulars in April 1865.  The Confederate defenders, an ill-trained muster of white militiamen, kids, and old men, were no match for the northern troops who ran them out of their hometown, then spent the night burning and looting.  Selma's slaves were officially freed, but after a fleeting window of hope, Reconstruction and Jim Crow would strip them and their immediate descendants of nearly all their constitutional rights. By 1965, almost a century after the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which unambiguously declares, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged... on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\" the percentage of registered black voters in Alabama was actually falling.  Local white voter registration clerks in Selma had allowed only 2% of the city's 14,000 black citizens to register, compared to 90% of Selma's whites.  A carefully targeted registration campaign by local organizers and SNCC (later joined by the SCLC) aimed to shine a national spotlight on local oppression and so spur congressional action that would open up voting for black citizens throughout Alabama and eventually across the entire deep South. Strategically deploying Martin Luther King (just back from accepting the Nobel Prize in Norway), the movement in Selma set out to provoke Sheriff Clark and his famously brutal posse.  As SNCC's Jim Forman said, \"We were laying a trap.\" The aim was to heighten a moral battle of Shakespearian proportions that television would then beam directly to President Lyndon Johnson. At one point, the city would have 20 times more blacks in jail than on its voting rolls. Confrontations simmered throughout the winter of 1964-1965, punctuated by sudden explosions of violence. Reason, brotherly love, massed demonstrations, and inflamed national opinion made no dent in Jim Clark's enduring pathology .  Like a man possessed, he simply couldn't stop himself from behaving badly in front of the cameras.  He delivered the gaudy media goods, week after week, exactly as movement strategists had hoped he would, exactly as Selma's few moderate whites feared. The scenes of violence flashed around the country on TV every night, and appeared in the pages of the New York Times and Washington Post . By 1965, President Johnson, a Texas Democrat, was ready to take risks on civil rights.  He had already directed his White House staff to secretly prepare sweeping voting rights legislation and even a constitutional amendment.  Now, the only thing needed was a trigger, and that finally came on March 7th,  \"Bloody Sunday,\" when John Lewis, Hosea Williams, Bob Mants, and Albert Turner, leading hundreds of locals, crested the Pettus Bridge on their way to deliver a voting rights petition to Governor George Wallace at the state capitol. All hell broke loose. Whites cheered from the roadside as Alabama state troopers and Clark's mounted posse clubbed, bullwhipped, and tear-gassed their way through 600 unarmed black men, women, and children. A trooper fractured John Lewis's skull with his billy club. Here was the massacre of the innocents for all Americans to see: southern lawmen in their pig-faced gas masks going berserk against African Americans who stood and took it. That televised attack, a crystalline icon of the era, worthy of Dante, had by evening rallied nearly all of Washington to the marchers' cause. It would one day become a sturdy staple of history texts and documentaries. That night, local whites murdered a northern Unitarian minister. Selma's young white mayor, Joe Smitherman, said, \"I didn't understand how big it was until I saw it on television... That looked like a war; that went all over the country. And then... the wrath of the nation came down on us.\" Citing television coverage, 31 Republican leaders condemned the situation in Alabama, as well as the administration's delay in proposing new federal voting legislation. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen rose to declare, \"The time is now.\" President Johnson sent 2,000 federal troops to Selma as Lincoln had done 100 years before, this time to protect peaceful citizens of Alabama from Alabama state troopers.  He went on national television to proclaim, \"Their cause must be our cause, and together we shall overcome!\" and then dispatched a sweeping voting rights bill to a willing Congress.  After it passed the House by a vote of 328 to 74 and the Senate by 79 to 18, Johnson signed the act into law with John Lewis and Dr. King at his side. By their determined organizing, marching, demonstrating, and most of all by their relentless courage, local black people had successfully appealed to Washington, finally brought legalized American apartheid to its knees. Black voting in Alabama jumped seven-fold in the next three years. Without the media slamming blunt facts in the face of sympathetic (or politically savvy) power brokers in Washington, \"Bloody Sunday\" might have left in its wake little more than a few hundred broken and bleeding marchers and the Jim Crow voting system still intact.  Without the TV coverage and a president and Congress capable of being won over, it might have been the civil rights equivalent of a tree falling silently in the forest, not the engine of sweeping change that it was. \"Freedom Is A Constant Struggle\" But that was then. Back in 1965, the charm of Selma was lost on most of us who ventured there. I've returned a few times since, first in 1985 to shoot scenes for Eyes on the Prize , including an interview with an unrepentant Jim Clark. The town was, by then, smaller, blacker, and poorer. In 2015, I returned again with producer Orlando Bagwell to work on a film for the Southern Poverty Law Center.  From a distance, nestled on a bluff above the Alabama River, Selma looked to me like a picturesque little town in southern France.  The air below the Edmund Pettus Bridge , now a national historic landmark, was alive with swallows.  Selma's lovely historic district seemed nicely parked somewhere between 1850 and 1950, but much of the rest of the once-prosperous town had, like so much of small town America, been hollowed out by recession and a changing economy.  We could find only one restaurant open for supper downtown. Many of its beautiful nineteenth-century buildings were boarded up. Gaping bullet holes pockmarked the granite tombstone of Jimmie Lee Jackson, whose murder by a state trooper had sparked the original Bloody Sunday march. The Civil War Battle of Selma is still reenacted annually on a field outside town, with the Confederates defeated again, each year. The Voting Rights Act forged in Selma had been a triumph of the classic civil rights movement, the hinge between everything that came before and so much that would come after. But we had little reason to suspect or notice when, shortly after the act's passage in 1965, conservative organizers began a methodical 40-year campaign to gut it.  As black voter rolls in rural Alabama swelled, the state's young federal prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, brought charges of voter fraud against civil rights organizer Albert Turner, a leader of the Bloody Sunday march.  His case collapsed in court, but resistance continued, culminating in a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down one of that act's key provisions (federal approval of state changes in their voting laws). Ever since, a Republican campaign to put new voting restrictions in place has only gained momentum . In 2015, however, few had noticed the most profound changes of all, even though they were stirring just below the surface of things: sweeping working class frustration; previously dormant strains of racism, misogyny, and nativism; galloping income inequality; and Democratic Party failures that went unnoticed and uncorrected.  All of these factors would help lay the groundwork for the successful candidacy of Donald J. Trump.  He was slow indeed to reject the white supremacists and nationalists who rushed to endorse his presidential bid and he was brought to office in some measure by the very forces that the civil rights movement naively thought it had largely silenced. Because the lid had been kept on overt public racism and nativism for so long, many Americans were slow to understand how deeply systemic the problem is. The citizens of Selma voted for Hillary Clinton by a wide margin, but no matter.  Trump's wave has driven from power the vital center with which mass movements had once been able to partner. Vestiges of the very ethos against which the civil rights movement fought have grown ever stronger and found a welcome place in his White House, their strength buoyed by a growing societal disapproval of media elites.  In the process, Trump has inoculated himself against appeals for justice as has no president in our lifetime. When it comes to any rights appeals in the immediate future, no one with real federal power is likely to be listening. There will be no sympathy for human rights petitioners from majority Republicans in the House of Representatives untroubled by reelection fears in their ferociously gerrymandered districts, nor from the soon-to-be-devastated civil rights division of the Department of Justice. What mechanisms will remain for the activists to activate? In a country becoming less white every day, Democrats recently stood helpless when it came to blocking the confirmation of the whitest cabinet in decades. Soon enough, the Supreme Court will have a conservative majority and then President Trump will have the run of the table, racking up a political monoculture unknown in our time. What many Americans think of as the civil rights movement - something in our black and white past, back there, back then - is, in fact, a deep running project launched long before we were born and sure to endure long after we are gone. In one now-historic decade, civil rights organizers brilliantly identified the levers of government power they could seize, but most of those levers are today out of reach. In response, will activism translate into concrete results the way it once did? Surely, a new generation of organizers now rising with a resolve and passion not seen in years, having broadened the civil rights project into a human rights one, will develop new strategies. Surely, they will discover or invent new means of stopping what threatens to be a contraction of democracy.  Surely, with the power of social media - a veritable television station in the hands of every citizen - they will find their own ways of ensuring that oppression can't dodge the spotlight.  Already, the bottom-up strategy championed by SNCC has found new fluency in the ascendance of hyper-democratic Internet organizing and the raw eloquence of #BlackLivesMatter . Does reform still demand powerful allies, and if so, who might they be?  A few centrist Republicans, courageous career attorneys in the Justice Department, billionaire Silicon Valley CEOs committed to pluralism, a mass of determined young people running for office? As organizers have discovered more than once since the early days of the republic, new levers lie waiting somewhere deep in the grand clockwork of our democracy.  The only question is: Where?\n\nMajor legislation - the Civil Rights Act of 1957 which established the Justice Department's civil rights division, the 1964 Act which outlawed discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, gender, or national origin, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 , and the Fair Housing Act of 1968 - and hundreds of decisions handed down by federal district courts, circuit courts, and the Supreme Court all slowly expanded protections to African Americans and set precedents for all Americans. Unlike blacks within white-ruled South Africa who, at the time, were not citizens of their own nation and had little hope of federal protection, blacks across the deep South could succeed because they were citizens not only of their own states, but of the United States. Few in the 1960s believed that marching, demonstrating, sitting in, agitating, witnessing, disrupting, or singing could ever change the minds, much less the policies, of a half-dozen southern governors, a hundred county sheriffs, or millions of white segregationists.  The Montgomery bus boycott was successful in driving the bus company to the edge of bankruptcy, but legal bus segregation remained intact until the Supreme Court stepped in. Well-schooled in the strategies of Gandhi, civil rights leaders knew of the critical value of mass meetings, collective action, and civil disobedience for building resolve, visibility, and a powerful sense of community, but they also knew its limits: solidarity was not enough.  Coming together to raise awareness would not in itself achieve concrete results.  Birmingham leader Fred Shuttlesworth put it this way: \"Look, America, look at your promises; look how you've treated your poor Negro citizens.  But you can't shame segregation. Rattlesnakes don't commit suicide.\" Persuasion, appeals to reason, and simple justice certainly recruited northern liberals and some white southern moderates to the cause, but southern blacks could have preached the Sermon on the Mount or the U.S. Constitution daily to White Citizens' Councils to no effect.  In the end, the decisive language that spoke to white oppression was power, and the power that proved decisive often lay in Washington. While economic boycotts might sometimes force compromise on local businesses and segregationist officials, generally the trick was to vault over them to, if necessary, the president himself. In the documentary Eyes On The Prize , Burke Marshall, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division under President Kennedy explained, that, when push came to shove, no deep southern city or state could resist escalating federal force. \"I suppose,\" he commented, \"the president could have sent the United States Navy up the Mississippi River\" - which was exactly what Abraham Lincoln had done a century earlier. At the extreme, Republican and Democratic presidents deployed deputies, federal marshals, national guardsmen, and in the end even Army troops to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws and protect dissenters' rights under the First Amendment when state and local officials refused to do so.

The national media provided a direct prod that regularly stiffened spines in Washington, but such public disapproval by hectoring northern journalists also brought white southerners together in solidarity against the media elites (a phenomenon that should have a certain resonance in present-day America).  White crowds knew that network television coverage spelled trouble for legal segregation and often went for the cameras.  Those mobs understood the postmodern power of images as well as any postmodernist. When the first Freedom Riders' bus rolled into Birmingham's bus station in 1961, dozens of Klansmen attacked the waiting newsmen first before they went after the riders.  There would be no news clips of that event on TV that evening. On the horrific night when James Meredith tried to enter the University of Mississippi, the mob , flying Confederate battle flags, attacked the media, smashing cameras, beating cameramen, and killing a reporter from Agence France-Presse execution-style, before shooting 35 federal marshals. Second only to the courage of African Americans was the courage of those highly visible TV crews. They would stay miraculously calm and focused, navigating the mayhem between marchers, mobs, and lawmen. Though they were constrained by journalistic standards from partisanship in reporting, many of those crews could not escape their growing sympathy for the movement, and found themselves ready to join in the reformation of America with their pictures and words. They were televising a particularly disgusting pageant: officers, under the sanction of state and local laws, bludgeoning, fire hosing, arresting, punching, cattle prodding, whipping, tear-gassing, and even shooting defenseless, unresisting black people who had declared their commitment to nonviolence.  It happened month after month throughout the 1960s. The Selma Show Movement leaders chose their sheriffs carefully, judging their battlegrounds in part by the quality of available villains.  They favored bad actors like Chief Bull Connor, the proud bigot of Birmingham, who unleashed fire hoses on teenaged marchers with operatic fury, and Selma's increasingly unhinged arch-segregationist sheriff, Jim Clark . The 1965 battle royal in Selma, Alabama, marked a milestone in the expansion of democracy for the town's African Americans, which had begun with the emancipation of its slaves during the Civil War. Selma first came under siege by Union regulars in April 1865.  The Confederate defenders, an ill-trained muster of white militiamen, kids, and old men, were no match for the northern troops who ran them out of their hometown, then spent the night burning and looting.  Selma's slaves were officially freed, but after a fleeting window of hope, Reconstruction and Jim Crow would strip them and their immediate descendants of nearly all their constitutional rights. By 1965, almost a century after the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which unambiguously declares, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged... on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\" the percentage of registered black voters in Alabama was actually falling.  Local white voter registration clerks in Selma had allowed only 2% of the city's 14,000 black citizens to register, compared to 90% of Selma's whites.  A carefully targeted registration campaign by local organizers and SNCC (later joined by the SCLC) aimed to shine a national spotlight on local oppression and so spur congressional action that would open up voting for black citizens throughout Alabama and eventually across the entire deep South. Strategically deploying Martin Luther King (just back from accepting the Nobel Prize in Norway), the movement in Selma set out to provoke Sheriff Clark and his famously brutal posse.  As SNCC's Jim Forman said, \"We were laying a trap.\" The aim was to heighten a moral battle of Shakespearian proportions that television would then beam directly to President Lyndon Johnson. At one point, the city would have 20 times more blacks in jail than on its voting rolls. Confrontations simmered throughout the winter of 1964-1965, punctuated by sudden explosions of violence. Reason, brotherly love, massed demonstrations, and inflamed national opinion made no dent in Jim Clark's enduring pathology .  Like a man possessed, he simply couldn't stop himself from behaving badly in front of the cameras.  He delivered the gaudy media goods, week after week, exactly as movement strategists had hoped he would, exactly as Selma's few moderate whites feared. The scenes of violence flashed around the country on TV every night, and appeared in the pages of the New York Times and Washington Post . By 1965, President Johnson, a Texas Democrat, was ready to take risks on civil rights.  He had already directed his White House staff to secretly prepare sweeping voting rights legislation and even a constitutional amendment.  Now, the only thing needed was a trigger, and that finally came on March 7th,  \"Bloody Sunday,\" when John Lewis, Hosea Williams, Bob Mants, and Albert Turner, leading hundreds of locals, crested the Pettus Bridge on their way to deliver a voting rights petition to Governor George Wallace at the state capitol. All hell broke loose. Whites cheered from the roadside as Alabama state troopers and Clark's mounted posse clubbed, bullwhipped, and tear-gassed their way through 600 unarmed black men, women, and children. A trooper fractured John Lewis's skull with his billy club. Here was the massacre of the innocents for all Americans to see: southern lawmen in their pig-faced gas masks going berserk against African Americans who stood and took it. That televised attack, a crystalline icon of the era, worthy of Dante, had by evening rallied nearly all of Washington to the marchers' cause. It would one day become a sturdy staple of history texts and documentaries. That night, local whites murdered a northern Unitarian minister. Selma's young white mayor, Joe Smitherman, said, \"I didn't understand how big it was until I saw it on television... That looked like a war; that went all over the country. And then... the wrath of the nation came down on us.\" Citing television coverage, 31 Republican leaders condemned the situation in Alabama, as well as the administration's delay in proposing new federal voting legislation. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen rose to declare, \"The time is now.\" President Johnson sent 2,000 federal troops to Selma as Lincoln had done 100 years before, this time to protect peaceful citizens of Alabama from Alabama state troopers.  He went on national television to proclaim, \"Their cause must be our cause, and together we shall overcome!\" and then dispatched a sweeping voting rights bill to a willing Congress.  After it passed the House by a vote of 328 to 74 and the Senate by 79 to 18, Johnson signed the act into law with John Lewis and Dr. King at his side. By their determined organizing, marching, demonstrating, and most of all by their relentless courage, local black people had successfully appealed to Washington, finally brought legalized American apartheid to its knees. Black voting in Alabama jumped seven-fold in the next three years. Without the media slamming blunt facts in the face of sympathetic (or politically savvy) power brokers in Washington, \"Bloody Sunday\" might have left in its wake little more than a few hundred broken and bleeding marchers and the Jim Crow voting system still intact.  Without the TV coverage and a president and Congress capable of being won over, it might have been the civil rights equivalent of a tree falling silently in the forest, not the engine of sweeping change that it was. \"Freedom Is A Constant Struggle\" But that was then. Back in 1965, the charm of Selma was lost on most of us who ventured there. I've returned a few times since, first in 1985 to shoot scenes for Eyes on the Prize , including an interview with an unrepentant Jim Clark. The town was, by then, smaller, blacker, and poorer. In 2015, I returned again with producer Orlando Bagwell to work on a film for the Southern Poverty Law Center.  From a distance, nestled on a bluff above the Alabama River, Selma looked to me like a picturesque little town in southern France.  The air below the Edmund Pettus Bridge , now a national historic landmark, was alive with swallows.  Selma's lovely historic district seemed nicely parked somewhere between 1850 and 1950, but much of the rest of the once-prosperous town had, like so much of small town America, been hollowed out by recession and a changing economy.  We could find only one restaurant open for supper downtown. Many of its beautiful nineteenth-century buildings were boarded up. Gaping bullet holes pockmarked the granite tombstone of Jimmie Lee Jackson, whose murder by a state trooper had sparked the original Bloody Sunday march. The Civil War Battle of Selma is still reenacted annually on a field outside town, with the Confederates defeated again, each year. The Voting Rights Act forged in Selma had been a triumph of the classic civil rights movement, the hinge between everything that came before and so much that would come after. But we had little reason to suspect or notice when, shortly after the act's passage in 1965, conservative organizers began a methodical 40-year campaign to gut it.  As black voter rolls in rural Alabama swelled, the state's young federal prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, brought charges of voter fraud against civil rights organizer Albert Turner, a leader of the Bloody Sunday march.  His case collapsed in court, but resistance continued, culminating in a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down one of that act's key provisions (federal approval of state changes in their voting laws). Ever since, a Republican campaign to put new voting restrictions in place has only gained momentum . In 2015, however, few had noticed the most profound changes of all, even though they were stirring just below the surface of things: sweeping working class frustration; previously dormant strains of racism, misogyny, and nativism; galloping income inequality; and Democratic Party failures that went unnoticed and uncorrected.  All of these factors would help lay the groundwork for the successful candidacy of Donald J. Trump.  He was slow indeed to reject the white supremacists and nationalists who rushed to endorse his presidential bid and he was brought to office in some measure by the very forces that the civil rights movement naively thought it had largely silenced. Because the lid had been kept on overt public racism and nativism for so long, many Americans were slow to understand how deeply systemic the problem is. The citizens of Selma voted for Hillary Clinton by a wide margin, but no matter.  Trump's wave has driven from power the vital center with which mass movements had once been able to partner. Vestiges of the very ethos against which the civil rights movement fought have grown ever stronger and found a welcome place in his White House, their strength buoyed by a growing societal disapproval of media elites.  In the process, Trump has inoculated himself against appeals for justice as has no president in our lifetime. When it comes to any rights appeals in the immediate future, no one with real federal power is likely to be listening. There will be no sympathy for human rights petitioners from majority Republicans in the House of Representatives untroubled by reelection fears in their ferociously gerrymandered districts, nor from the soon-to-be-devastated civil rights division of the Department of Justice. What mechanisms will remain for the activists to activate? In a country becoming less white every day, Democrats recently stood helpless when it came to blocking the confirmation of the whitest cabinet in decades. Soon enough, the Supreme Court will have a conservative majority and then President Trump will have the run of the table, racking up a political monoculture unknown in our time. What many Americans think of as the civil rights movement - something in our black and white past, back there, back then - is, in fact, a deep running project launched long before we were born and sure to endure long after we are gone. In one now-historic decade, civil rights organizers brilliantly identified the levers of government power they could seize, but most of those levers are today out of reach. In response, will activism translate into concrete results the way it once did? Surely, a new generation of organizers now rising with a resolve and passion not seen in years, having broadened the civil rights project into a human rights one, will develop new strategies. Surely, they will discover or invent new means of stopping what threatens to be a contraction of democracy.  Surely, with the power of social media - a veritable television station in the hands of every citizen - they will find their own ways of ensuring that oppression can't dodge the spotlight.  Already, the bottom-up strategy championed by SNCC has found new fluency in the ascendance of hyper-democratic Internet organizing and the raw eloquence of #BlackLivesMatter . Does reform still demand powerful allies, and if so, who might they be?  A few centrist Republicans, courageous career attorneys in the Justice Department, billionaire Silicon Valley CEOs committed to pluralism, a mass of determined young people running for office? As organizers have discovered more than once since the early days of the republic, new levers lie waiting somewhere deep in the grand clockwork of our democracy.  The only question is: Where?\n\nWell-schooled in the strategies of Gandhi, civil rights leaders knew of the critical value of mass meetings, collective action, and civil disobedience for building resolve, visibility, and a powerful sense of community, but they also knew its limits: solidarity was not enough.  Coming together to raise awareness would not in itself achieve concrete results.  Birmingham leader Fred Shuttlesworth put it this way: \"Look, America, look at your promises; look how you've treated your poor Negro citizens.  But you can't shame segregation. Rattlesnakes don't commit suicide.\" Persuasion, appeals to reason, and simple justice certainly recruited northern liberals and some white southern moderates to the cause, but southern blacks could have preached the Sermon on the Mount or the U.S. Constitution daily to White Citizens' Councils to no effect.  In the end, the decisive language that spoke to white oppression was power, and the power that proved decisive often lay in Washington. While economic boycotts might sometimes force compromise on local businesses and segregationist officials, generally the trick was to vault over them to, if necessary, the president himself. In the documentary Eyes On The Prize , Burke Marshall, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division under President Kennedy explained, that, when push came to shove, no deep southern city or state could resist escalating federal force. \"I suppose,\" he commented, \"the president could have sent the United States Navy up the Mississippi River\" - which was exactly what Abraham Lincoln had done a century earlier. At the extreme, Republican and Democratic presidents deployed deputies, federal marshals, national guardsmen, and in the end even Army troops to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws and protect dissenters' rights under the First Amendment when state and local officials refused to do so.  If the attack dogs, bombings, and mass arrests of children got bad enough in Birmingham , and if it all appeared on television nationwide, local black organizers came to understand that they could usually depend on predictable moral outrage in the White House, a Congress worried about reelection, or the Supreme Court for a remedy. In 1957, faced with news bulletins of white rioters and Alabama national guardsmen blocking nine black students from entering Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower reluctantly sent in elements of the Army's 101st Airborne Division, declaring on prime-time television, \"Mob rule cannot be allowed to override the decisions of the courts.\" Five years later, President Kennedy, a convert to the civil rights cause, would similarly dispatch his Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and 200 federal marshals backed by the U.S. Army to ensure that James Meredith could enter the besieged campus of the University of Mississippi. The Revolution Will Be Televised Movement leaders patiently calculated a strategy for success that often depended on the press, in particular the new medium of television news, to haul Jim Crow's physical, social, and civic brutality out of the backwoods and into the nation's living rooms. They understood that news crews would flock not only to record Martin Luther King's oratory but also the flamboyant antics of a few southern sheriffs and the grand theater of mass non-violent resistance.  Confronted with televised attacks on peaceful demonstrators, a majority of congressmen, including dozens of Republicans, might acknowledge the searing contradictions of state racism for what they were.  Whether good will, cynicism, or electoral savvy drove politicians' actions, the strategy worked.

At one point, the city would have 20 times more blacks in jail than on its voting rolls. Confrontations simmered throughout the winter of 1964-1965, punctuated by sudden explosions of violence. Reason, brotherly love, massed demonstrations, and inflamed national opinion made no dent in Jim Clark's enduring pathology .  Like a man possessed, he simply couldn't stop himself from behaving badly in front of the cameras.  He delivered the gaudy media goods, week after week, exactly as movement strategists had hoped he would, exactly as Selma's few moderate whites feared. The scenes of violence flashed around the country on TV every night, and appeared in the pages of the New York Times and Washington Post . By 1965, President Johnson, a Texas Democrat, was ready to take risks on civil rights.  He had already directed his White House staff to secretly prepare sweeping voting rights legislation and even a constitutional amendment.  Now, the only thing needed was a trigger, and that finally came on March 7th,  \"Bloody Sunday,\" when John Lewis, Hosea Williams, Bob Mants, and Albert Turner, leading hundreds of locals, crested the Pettus Bridge on their way to deliver a voting rights petition to Governor George Wallace at the state capitol. All hell broke loose. Whites cheered from the roadside as Alabama state troopers and Clark's mounted posse clubbed, bullwhipped, and tear-gassed their way through 600 unarmed black men, women, and children. A trooper fractured John Lewis's skull with his billy club. Here was the massacre of the innocents for all Americans to see: southern lawmen in their pig-faced gas masks going berserk against African Americans who stood and took it. That televised attack, a crystalline icon of the era, worthy of Dante, had by evening rallied nearly all of Washington to the marchers' cause. It would one day become a sturdy staple of history texts and documentaries. That night, local whites murdered a northern Unitarian minister. Selma's young white mayor, Joe Smitherman, said, \"I didn't understand how big it was until I saw it on television... That looked like a war; that went all over the country. And then... the wrath of the nation came down on us.\" Citing television coverage, 31 Republican leaders condemned the situation in Alabama, as well as the administration's delay in proposing new federal voting legislation. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen rose to declare, \"The time is now.\" President Johnson sent 2,000 federal troops to Selma as Lincoln had done 100 years before, this time to protect peaceful citizens of Alabama from Alabama state troopers.  He went on national television to proclaim, \"Their cause must be our cause, and together we shall overcome!\" and then dispatched a sweeping voting rights bill to a willing Congress.  After it passed the House by a vote of 328 to 74 and the Senate by 79 to 18, Johnson signed the act into law with John Lewis and Dr. King at his side. By their determined organizing, marching, demonstrating, and most of all by their relentless courage, local black people had successfully appealed to Washington, finally brought legalized American apartheid to its knees. Black voting in Alabama jumped seven-fold in the next three years. Without the media slamming blunt facts in the face of sympathetic (or politically savvy) power brokers in Washington, \"Bloody Sunday\" might have left in its wake little more than a few hundred broken and bleeding marchers and the Jim Crow voting system still intact.  Without the TV coverage and a president and Congress capable of being won over, it might have been the civil rights equivalent of a tree falling silently in the forest, not the engine of sweeping change that it was. \"Freedom Is A Constant Struggle\" But that was then. Back in 1965, the charm of Selma was lost on most of us who ventured there. I've returned a few times since, first in 1985 to shoot scenes for Eyes on the Prize , including an interview with an unrepentant Jim Clark. The town was, by then, smaller, blacker, and poorer. In 2015, I returned again with producer Orlando Bagwell to work on a film for the Southern Poverty Law Center.  From a distance, nestled on a bluff above the Alabama River, Selma looked to me like a picturesque little town in southern France.  The air below the Edmund Pettus Bridge , now a national historic landmark, was alive with swallows.  Selma's lovely historic district seemed nicely parked somewhere between 1850 and 1950, but much of the rest of the once-prosperous town had, like so much of small town America, been hollowed out by recession and a changing economy.  We could find only one restaurant open for supper downtown. Many of its beautiful nineteenth-century buildings were boarded up. Gaping bullet holes pockmarked the granite tombstone of Jimmie Lee Jackson, whose murder by a state trooper had sparked the original Bloody Sunday march. The Civil War Battle of Selma is still reenacted annually on a field outside town, with the Confederates defeated again, each year. The Voting Rights Act forged in Selma had been a triumph of the classic civil rights movement, the hinge between everything that came before and so much that would come after. But we had little reason to suspect or notice when, shortly after the act's passage in 1965, conservative organizers began a methodical 40-year campaign to gut it.  As black voter rolls in rural Alabama swelled, the state's young federal prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, brought charges of voter fraud against civil rights organizer Albert Turner, a leader of the Bloody Sunday march.  His case collapsed in court, but resistance continued, culminating in a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down one of that act's key provisions (federal approval of state changes in their voting laws). Ever since, a Republican campaign to put new voting restrictions in place has only gained momentum . In 2015, however, few had noticed the most profound changes of all, even though they were stirring just below the surface of things: sweeping working class frustration; previously dormant strains of racism, misogyny, and nativism; galloping income inequality; and Democratic Party failures that went unnoticed and uncorrected.  All of these factors would help lay the groundwork for the successful candidacy of Donald J. Trump.  He was slow indeed to reject the white supremacists and nationalists who rushed to endorse his presidential bid and he was brought to office in some measure by the very forces that the civil rights movement naively thought it had largely silenced. Because the lid had been kept on overt public racism and nativism for so long, many Americans were slow to understand how deeply systemic the problem is. The citizens of Selma voted for Hillary Clinton by a wide margin, but no matter.  Trump's wave has driven from power the vital center with which mass movements had once been able to partner. Vestiges of the very ethos against which the civil rights movement fought have grown ever stronger and found a welcome place in his White House, their strength buoyed by a growing societal disapproval of media elites.  In the process, Trump has inoculated himself against appeals for justice as has no president in our lifetime. When it comes to any rights appeals in the immediate future, no one with real federal power is likely to be listening. There will be no sympathy for human rights petitioners from majority Republicans in the House of Representatives untroubled by reelection fears in their ferociously gerrymandered districts, nor from the soon-to-be-devastated civil rights division of the Department of Justice. What mechanisms will remain for the activists to activate? In a country becoming less white every day, Democrats recently stood helpless when it came to blocking the confirmation of the whitest cabinet in decades. Soon enough, the Supreme Court will have a conservative majority and then President Trump will have the run of the table, racking up a political monoculture unknown in our time. What many Americans think of as the civil rights movement - something in our black and white past, back there, back then - is, in fact, a deep running project launched long before we were born and sure to endure long after we are gone. In one now-historic decade, civil rights organizers brilliantly identified the levers of government power they could seize, but most of those levers are today out of reach. In response, will activism translate into concrete results the way it once did? Surely, a new generation of organizers now rising with a resolve and passion not seen in years, having broadened the civil rights project into a human rights one, will develop new strategies. Surely, they will discover or invent new means of stopping what threatens to be a contraction of democracy.  Surely, with the power of social media - a veritable television station in the hands of every citizen - they will find their own ways of ensuring that oppression can't dodge the spotlight.  Already, the bottom-up strategy championed by SNCC has found new fluency in the ascendance of hyper-democratic Internet organizing and the raw eloquence of #BlackLivesMatter . Does reform still demand powerful allies, and if so, who might they be?  A few centrist Republicans, courageous career attorneys in the Justice Department, billionaire Silicon Valley CEOs committed to pluralism, a mass of determined young people running for office? As organizers have discovered more than once since the early days of the republic, new levers lie waiting somewhere deep in the grand clockwork of our democracy.  The only question is: Where?\n\nWhile economic boycotts might sometimes force compromise on local businesses and segregationist officials, generally the trick was to vault over them to, if necessary, the president himself. In the documentary Eyes On The Prize , Burke Marshall, head of the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division under President Kennedy explained, that, when push came to shove, no deep southern city or state could resist escalating federal force. \"I suppose,\" he commented, \"the president could have sent the United States Navy up the Mississippi River\" - which was exactly what Abraham Lincoln had done a century earlier. At the extreme, Republican and Democratic presidents deployed deputies, federal marshals, national guardsmen, and in the end even Army troops to enforce federal anti-discrimination laws and protect dissenters' rights under the First Amendment when state and local officials refused to do so.  If the attack dogs, bombings, and mass arrests of children got bad enough in Birmingham , and if it all appeared on television nationwide, local black organizers came to understand that they could usually depend on predictable moral outrage in the White House, a Congress worried about reelection, or the Supreme Court for a remedy. In 1957, faced with news bulletins of white rioters and Alabama national guardsmen blocking nine black students from entering Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower reluctantly sent in elements of the Army's 101st Airborne Division, declaring on prime-time television, \"Mob rule cannot be allowed to override the decisions of the courts.\" Five years later, President Kennedy, a convert to the civil rights cause, would similarly dispatch his Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and 200 federal marshals backed by the U.S. Army to ensure that James Meredith could enter the besieged campus of the University of Mississippi. The Revolution Will Be Televised Movement leaders patiently calculated a strategy for success that often depended on the press, in particular the new medium of television news, to haul Jim Crow's physical, social, and civic brutality out of the backwoods and into the nation's living rooms. They understood that news crews would flock not only to record Martin Luther King's oratory but also the flamboyant antics of a few southern sheriffs and the grand theater of mass non-violent resistance.  Confronted with televised attacks on peaceful demonstrators, a majority of congressmen, including dozens of Republicans, might acknowledge the searing contradictions of state racism for what they were.  Whether good will, cynicism, or electoral savvy drove politicians' actions, the strategy worked. The national media provided a direct prod that regularly stiffened spines in Washington, but such public disapproval by hectoring northern journalists also brought white southerners together in solidarity against the media elites (a phenomenon that should have a certain resonance in present-day America).  White crowds knew that network television coverage spelled trouble for legal segregation and often went for the cameras.  Those mobs understood the postmodern power of images as well as any postmodernist. When the first Freedom Riders' bus rolled into Birmingham's bus station in 1961, dozens of Klansmen attacked the waiting newsmen first before they went after the riders.  There would be no news clips of that event on TV that evening. On the horrific night when James Meredith tried to enter the University of Mississippi, the mob , flying Confederate battle flags, attacked the media, smashing cameras, beating cameramen, and killing a reporter from Agence France-Presse execution-style, before shooting 35 federal marshals. Second only to the courage of African Americans was the courage of those highly visible TV crews. They would stay miraculously calm and focused, navigating the mayhem between marchers, mobs, and lawmen. Though they were constrained by journalistic standards from partisanship in reporting, many of those crews could not escape their growing sympathy for the movement, and found themselves ready to join in the reformation of America with their pictures and words. They were televising a particularly disgusting pageant: officers, under the sanction of state and local laws, bludgeoning, fire hosing, arresting, punching, cattle prodding, whipping, tear-gassing, and even shooting defenseless, unresisting black people who had declared their commitment to nonviolence.  It happened month after month throughout the 1960s. The Selma Show Movement leaders chose their sheriffs carefully, judging their battlegrounds in part by the quality of available villains.  They favored bad actors like Chief Bull Connor, the proud bigot of Birmingham, who unleashed fire hoses on teenaged marchers with operatic fury, and Selma's increasingly unhinged arch-segregationist sheriff, Jim Clark . The 1965 battle royal in Selma, Alabama, marked a milestone in the expansion of democracy for the town's African Americans, which had begun with the emancipation of its slaves during the Civil War. Selma first came under siege by Union regulars in April 1865.  The Confederate defenders, an ill-trained muster of white militiamen, kids, and old men, were no match for the northern troops who ran them out of their hometown, then spent the night burning and looting.  Selma's slaves were officially freed, but after a fleeting window of hope, Reconstruction and Jim Crow would strip them and their immediate descendants of nearly all their constitutional rights. By 1965, almost a century after the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which unambiguously declares, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged... on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\" the percentage of registered black voters in Alabama was actually falling.  Local white voter registration clerks in Selma had allowed only 2% of the city's 14,000 black citizens to register, compared to 90% of Selma's whites.  A carefully targeted registration campaign by local organizers and SNCC (later joined by the SCLC) aimed to shine a national spotlight on local oppression and so spur congressional action that would open up voting for black citizens throughout Alabama and eventually across the entire deep South. Strategically deploying Martin Luther King (just back from accepting the Nobel Prize in Norway), the movement in Selma set out to provoke Sheriff Clark and his famously brutal posse.  As SNCC's Jim Forman said, \"We were laying a trap.\" The aim was to heighten a moral battle of Shakespearian proportions that television would then beam directly to President Lyndon Johnson. At one point, the city would have 20 times more blacks in jail than on its voting rolls. Confrontations simmered throughout the winter of 1964-1965, punctuated by sudden explosions of violence.

Like a man possessed, he simply couldn't stop himself from behaving badly in front of the cameras.

As black voter rolls in rural Alabama swelled, the state's young federal prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, brought charges of voter fraud against civil rights organizer Albert Turner, a leader of the Bloody Sunday march.  His case collapsed in court, but resistance continued, culminating in a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down one of that act's key provisions (federal approval of state changes in their voting laws). Ever since, a Republican campaign to put new voting restrictions in place has only gained momentum . In 2015, however, few had noticed the most profound changes of all, even though they were stirring just below the surface of things: sweeping working class frustration; previously dormant strains of racism, misogyny, and nativism; galloping income inequality; and Democratic Party failures that went unnoticed and uncorrected.  All of these factors would help lay the groundwork for the successful candidacy of Donald J. Trump.  He was slow indeed to reject the white supremacists and nationalists who rushed to endorse his presidential bid and he was brought to office in some measure by the very forces that the civil rights movement naively thought it had largely silenced. Because the lid had been kept on overt public racism and nativism for so long, many Americans were slow to understand how deeply systemic the problem is. The citizens of Selma voted for Hillary Clinton by a wide margin, but no matter.  Trump's wave has driven from power the vital center with which mass movements had once been able to partner. Vestiges of the very ethos against which the civil rights movement fought have grown ever stronger and found a welcome place in his White House, their strength buoyed by a growing societal disapproval of media elites.  In the process, Trump has inoculated himself against appeals for justice as has no president in our lifetime. When it comes to any rights appeals in the immediate future, no one with real federal power is likely to be listening. There will be no sympathy for human rights petitioners from majority Republicans in the House of Representatives untroubled by reelection fears in their ferociously gerrymandered districts, nor from the soon-to-be-devastated civil rights division of the Department of Justice. What mechanisms will remain for the activists to activate? In a country becoming less white every day, Democrats recently stood helpless when it came to blocking the confirmation of the whitest cabinet in decades. Soon enough, the Supreme Court will have a conservative majority and then President Trump will have the run of the table, racking up a political monoculture unknown in our time. What many Americans think of as the civil rights movement - something in our black and white past, back there, back then - is, in fact, a deep running project launched long before we were born and sure to endure long after we are gone. In one now-historic decade, civil rights organizers brilliantly identified the levers of government power they could seize, but most of those levers are today out of reach. In response, will activism translate into concrete results the way it once did? Surely, a new generation of organizers now rising with a resolve and passion not seen in years, having broadened the civil rights project into a human rights one, will develop new strategies. Surely, they will discover or invent new means of stopping what threatens to be a contraction of democracy.  Surely, with the power of social media - a veritable television station in the hands of every citizen - they will find their own ways of ensuring that oppression can't dodge the spotlight.  Already, the bottom-up strategy championed by SNCC has found new fluency in the ascendance of hyper-democratic Internet organizing and the raw eloquence of #BlackLivesMatter . Does reform still demand powerful allies, and if so, who might they be?  A few centrist Republicans, courageous career attorneys in the Justice Department, billionaire Silicon Valley CEOs committed to pluralism, a mass of determined young people running for office? As organizers have discovered more than once since the early days of the republic, new levers lie waiting somewhere deep in the grand clockwork of our democracy.  The only question is: Where?\n\nIn 1957, faced with news bulletins of white rioters and Alabama national guardsmen blocking nine black students from entering Central High School in Little Rock, Arkansas, Republican President Dwight Eisenhower reluctantly sent in elements of the Army's 101st Airborne Division, declaring on prime-time television, \"Mob rule cannot be allowed to override the decisions of the courts.\" Five years later, President Kennedy, a convert to the civil rights cause, would similarly dispatch his Assistant Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach and 200 federal marshals backed by the U.S. Army to ensure that James Meredith could enter the besieged campus of the University of Mississippi. The Revolution Will Be Televised Movement leaders patiently calculated a strategy for success that often depended on the press, in particular the new medium of television news, to haul Jim Crow's physical, social, and civic brutality out of the backwoods and into the nation's living rooms. They understood that news crews would flock not only to record Martin Luther King's oratory but also the flamboyant antics of a few southern sheriffs and the grand theater of mass non-violent resistance.  Confronted with televised attacks on peaceful demonstrators, a majority of congressmen, including dozens of Republicans, might acknowledge the searing contradictions of state racism for what they were.  Whether good will, cynicism, or electoral savvy drove politicians' actions, the strategy worked. The national media provided a direct prod that regularly stiffened spines in Washington, but such public disapproval by hectoring northern journalists also brought white southerners together in solidarity against the media elites (a phenomenon that should have a certain resonance in present-day America).  White crowds knew that network television coverage spelled trouble for legal segregation and often went for the cameras.  Those mobs understood the postmodern power of images as well as any postmodernist. When the first Freedom Riders' bus rolled into Birmingham's bus station in 1961, dozens of Klansmen attacked the waiting newsmen first before they went after the riders.  There would be no news clips of that event on TV that evening. On the horrific night when James Meredith tried to enter the University of Mississippi, the mob , flying Confederate battle flags, attacked the media, smashing cameras, beating cameramen, and killing a reporter from Agence France-Presse execution-style, before shooting 35 federal marshals. Second only to the courage of African Americans was the courage of those highly visible TV crews. They would stay miraculously calm and focused, navigating the mayhem between marchers, mobs, and lawmen. Though they were constrained by journalistic standards from partisanship in reporting, many of those crews could not escape their growing sympathy for the movement, and found themselves ready to join in the reformation of America with their pictures and words. They were televising a particularly disgusting pageant: officers, under the sanction of state and local laws, bludgeoning, fire hosing, arresting, punching, cattle prodding, whipping, tear-gassing, and even shooting defenseless, unresisting black people who had declared their commitment to nonviolence.  It happened month after month throughout the 1960s. The Selma Show Movement leaders chose their sheriffs carefully, judging their battlegrounds in part by the quality of available villains.  They favored bad actors like Chief Bull Connor, the proud bigot of Birmingham, who unleashed fire hoses on teenaged marchers with operatic fury, and Selma's increasingly unhinged arch-segregationist sheriff, Jim Clark . The 1965 battle royal in Selma, Alabama, marked a milestone in the expansion of democracy for the town's African Americans, which had begun with the emancipation of its slaves during the Civil War. Selma first came under siege by Union regulars in April 1865.  The Confederate defenders, an ill-trained muster of white militiamen, kids, and old men, were no match for the northern troops who ran them out of their hometown, then spent the night burning and looting.  Selma's slaves were officially freed, but after a fleeting window of hope, Reconstruction and Jim Crow would strip them and their immediate descendants of nearly all their constitutional rights. By 1965, almost a century after the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which unambiguously declares, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged... on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\" the percentage of registered black voters in Alabama was actually falling.  Local white voter registration clerks in Selma had allowed only 2% of the city's 14,000 black citizens to register, compared to 90% of Selma's whites.  A carefully targeted registration campaign by local organizers and SNCC (later joined by the SCLC) aimed to shine a national spotlight on local oppression and so spur congressional action that would open up voting for black citizens throughout Alabama and eventually across the entire deep South. Strategically deploying Martin Luther King (just back from accepting the Nobel Prize in Norway), the movement in Selma set out to provoke Sheriff Clark and his famously brutal posse.  As SNCC's Jim Forman said, \"We were laying a trap.\" The aim was to heighten a moral battle of Shakespearian proportions that television would then beam directly to President Lyndon Johnson. At one point, the city would have 20 times more blacks in jail than on its voting rolls. Confrontations simmered throughout the winter of 1964-1965, punctuated by sudden explosions of violence. Reason, brotherly love, massed demonstrations, and inflamed national opinion made no dent in Jim Clark's enduring pathology .  Like a man possessed, he simply couldn't stop himself from behaving badly in front of the cameras.  He delivered the gaudy media goods, week after week, exactly as movement strategists had hoped he would, exactly as Selma's few moderate whites feared. The scenes of violence flashed around the country on TV every night, and appeared in the pages of the New York Times and Washington Post . By 1965, President Johnson, a Texas Democrat, was ready to take risks on civil rights.  He had already directed his White House staff to secretly prepare sweeping voting rights legislation and even a constitutional amendment.  Now, the only thing needed was a trigger, and that finally came on March 7th,  \"Bloody Sunday,\" when John Lewis, Hosea Williams, Bob Mants, and Albert Turner, leading hundreds of locals, crested the Pettus Bridge on their way to deliver a voting rights petition to Governor George Wallace at the state capitol. All hell broke loose. Whites cheered from the roadside as Alabama state troopers and Clark's mounted posse clubbed, bullwhipped, and tear-gassed their way through 600 unarmed black men, women, and children. A trooper fractured John Lewis's skull with his billy club. Here was the massacre of the innocents for all Americans to see: southern lawmen in their pig-faced gas masks going berserk against African Americans who stood and took it. That televised attack, a crystalline icon of the era, worthy of Dante, had by evening rallied nearly all of Washington to the marchers' cause. It would one day become a sturdy staple of history texts and documentaries. That night, local whites murdered a northern Unitarian minister. Selma's young white mayor, Joe Smitherman, said, \"I didn't understand how big it was until I saw it on television... That looked like a war; that went all over the country. And then... the wrath of the nation came down on us.\" Citing television coverage, 31 Republican leaders condemned the situation in Alabama, as well as the administration's delay in proposing new federal voting legislation. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen rose to declare, \"The time is now.\" President Johnson sent 2,000 federal troops to Selma as Lincoln had done 100 years before, this time to protect peaceful citizens of Alabama from Alabama state troopers.  He went on national television to proclaim, \"Their cause must be our cause, and together we shall overcome!\" and then dispatched a sweeping voting rights bill to a willing Congress.  After it passed the House by a vote of 328 to 74 and the Senate by 79 to 18, Johnson signed the act into law with John Lewis and Dr. King at his side. By their determined organizing, marching, demonstrating, and most of all by their relentless courage, local black people had successfully appealed to Washington, finally brought legalized American apartheid to its knees. Black voting in Alabama jumped seven-fold in the next three years. Without the media slamming blunt facts in the face of sympathetic (or politically savvy) power brokers in Washington, \"Bloody Sunday\" might have left in its wake little more than a few hundred broken and bleeding marchers and the Jim Crow voting system still intact.  Without the TV coverage and a president and Congress capable of being won over, it might have been the civil rights equivalent of a tree falling silently in the forest, not the engine of sweeping change that it was. \"Freedom Is A Constant Struggle\" But that was then. Back in 1965, the charm of Selma was lost on most of us who ventured there. I've returned a few times since, first in 1985 to shoot scenes for Eyes on the Prize , including an interview with an unrepentant Jim Clark. The town was, by then, smaller, blacker, and poorer. In 2015, I returned again with producer Orlando Bagwell to work on a film for the Southern Poverty Law Center.  From a distance, nestled on a bluff above the Alabama River, Selma looked to me like a picturesque little town in southern France.  The air below the Edmund Pettus Bridge , now a national historic landmark, was alive with swallows.  Selma's lovely historic district seemed nicely parked somewhere between 1850 and 1950, but much of the rest of the once-prosperous town had, like so much of small town America, been hollowed out by recession and a changing economy.  We could find only one restaurant open for supper downtown. Many of its beautiful nineteenth-century buildings were boarded up. Gaping bullet holes pockmarked the granite tombstone of Jimmie Lee Jackson, whose murder by a state trooper had sparked the original Bloody Sunday march. The Civil War Battle of Selma is still reenacted annually on a field outside town, with the Confederates defeated again, each year. The Voting Rights Act forged in Selma had been a triumph of the classic civil rights movement, the hinge between everything that came before and so much that would come after. But we had little reason to suspect or notice when, shortly after the act's passage in 1965, conservative organizers began a methodical 40-year campaign to gut it.

At one point, the city would have 20 times more blacks in jail than on its voting rolls. Confrontations simmered throughout the winter of 1964-1965, punctuated by sudden explosions of violence. Reason, brotherly love, massed demonstrations, and inflamed national opinion made no dent in Jim Clark's enduring pathology .  Like a man possessed, he simply couldn't stop himself from behaving badly in front of the cameras.  He delivered the gaudy media goods, week after week, exactly as movement strategists had hoped he would, exactly as Selma's few moderate whites feared. The scenes of violence flashed around the country on TV every night, and appeared in the pages of the New York Times and Washington Post . By 1965, President Johnson, a Texas Democrat, was ready to take risks on civil rights.  He had already directed his White House staff to secretly prepare sweeping voting rights legislation and even a constitutional amendment.  Now, the only thing needed was a trigger, and that finally came on March 7th,  \"Bloody Sunday,\" when John Lewis, Hosea Williams, Bob Mants, and Albert Turner, leading hundreds of locals, crested the Pettus Bridge on their way to deliver a voting rights petition to Governor George Wallace at the state capitol. All hell broke loose. Whites cheered from the roadside as Alabama state troopers and Clark's mounted posse clubbed, bullwhipped, and tear-gassed their way through 600 unarmed black men, women, and children. A trooper fractured John Lewis's skull with his billy club. Here was the massacre of the innocents for all Americans to see: southern lawmen in their pig-faced gas masks going berserk against African Americans who stood and took it. That televised attack, a crystalline icon of the era, worthy of Dante, had by evening rallied nearly all of Washington to the marchers' cause. It would one day become a sturdy staple of history texts and documentaries. That night, local whites murdered a northern Unitarian minister. Selma's young white mayor, Joe Smitherman, said, \"I didn't understand how big it was until I saw it on television... That looked like a war; that went all over the country. And then... the wrath of the nation came down on us.\" Citing television coverage, 31 Republican leaders condemned the situation in Alabama, as well as the administration's delay in proposing new federal voting legislation. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen rose to declare, \"The time is now.\" President Johnson sent 2,000 federal troops to Selma as Lincoln had done 100 years before, this time to protect peaceful citizens of Alabama from Alabama state troopers.  He went on national television to proclaim, \"Their cause must be our cause, and together we shall overcome!\" and then dispatched a sweeping voting rights bill to a willing Congress.  After it passed the House by a vote of 328 to 74 and the Senate by 79 to 18, Johnson signed the act into law with John Lewis and Dr. King at his side. By their determined organizing, marching, demonstrating, and most of all by their relentless courage, local black people had successfully appealed to Washington, finally brought legalized American apartheid to its knees. Black voting in Alabama jumped seven-fold in the next three years. Without the media slamming blunt facts in the face of sympathetic (or politically savvy) power brokers in Washington, \"Bloody Sunday\" might have left in its wake little more than a few hundred broken and bleeding marchers and the Jim Crow voting system still intact.  Without the TV coverage and a president and Congress capable of being won over, it might have been the civil rights equivalent of a tree falling silently in the forest, not the engine of sweeping change that it was. \"Freedom Is A Constant Struggle\" But that was then. Back in 1965, the charm of Selma was lost on most of us who ventured there. I've returned a few times since, first in 1985 to shoot scenes for Eyes on the Prize , including an interview with an unrepentant Jim Clark. The town was, by then, smaller, blacker, and poorer. In 2015, I returned again with producer Orlando Bagwell to work on a film for the Southern Poverty Law Center.  From a distance, nestled on a bluff above the Alabama River, Selma looked to me like a picturesque little town in southern France.  The air below the Edmund Pettus Bridge , now a national historic landmark, was alive with swallows.  Selma's lovely historic district seemed nicely parked somewhere between 1850 and 1950, but much of the rest of the once-prosperous town had, like so much of small town America, been hollowed out by recession and a changing economy.  We could find only one restaurant open for supper downtown. Many of its beautiful nineteenth-century buildings were boarded up. Gaping bullet holes pockmarked the granite tombstone of Jimmie Lee Jackson, whose murder by a state trooper had sparked the original Bloody Sunday march. The Civil War Battle of Selma is still reenacted annually on a field outside town, with the Confederates defeated again, each year. The Voting Rights Act forged in Selma had been a triumph of the classic civil rights movement, the hinge between everything that came before and so much that would come after. But we had little reason to suspect or notice when, shortly after the act's passage in 1965, conservative organizers began a methodical 40-year campaign to gut it.  As black voter rolls in rural Alabama swelled, the state's young federal prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, brought charges of voter fraud against civil rights organizer Albert Turner, a leader of the Bloody Sunday march.  His case collapsed in court, but resistance continued, culminating in a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down one of that act's key provisions (federal approval of state changes in their voting laws). Ever since, a Republican campaign to put new voting restrictions in place has only gained momentum . In 2015, however, few had noticed the most profound changes of all, even though they were stirring just below the surface of things: sweeping working class frustration; previously dormant strains of racism, misogyny, and nativism; galloping income inequality; and Democratic Party failures that went unnoticed and uncorrected.  All of these factors would help lay the groundwork for the successful candidacy of Donald J. Trump.  He was slow indeed to reject the white supremacists and nationalists who rushed to endorse his presidential bid and he was brought to office in some measure by the very forces that the civil rights movement naively thought it had largely silenced. Because the lid had been kept on overt public racism and nativism for so long, many Americans were slow to understand how deeply systemic the problem is. The citizens of Selma voted for Hillary Clinton by a wide margin, but no matter.  Trump's wave has driven from power the vital center with which mass movements had once been able to partner. Vestiges of the very ethos against which the civil rights movement fought have grown ever stronger and found a welcome place in his White House, their strength buoyed by a growing societal disapproval of media elites.  In the process, Trump has inoculated himself against appeals for justice as has no president in our lifetime. When it comes to any rights appeals in the immediate future, no one with real federal power is likely to be listening. There will be no sympathy for human rights petitioners from majority Republicans in the House of Representatives untroubled by reelection fears in their ferociously gerrymandered districts, nor from the soon-to-be-devastated civil rights division of the Department of Justice. What mechanisms will remain for the activists to activate? In a country becoming less white every day, Democrats recently stood helpless when it came to blocking the confirmation of the whitest cabinet in decades. Soon enough, the Supreme Court will have a conservative majority and then President Trump will have the run of the table, racking up a political monoculture unknown in our time. What many Americans think of as the civil rights movement - something in our black and white past, back there, back then - is, in fact, a deep running project launched long before we were born and sure to endure long after we are gone. In one now-historic decade, civil rights organizers brilliantly identified the levers of government power they could seize, but most of those levers are today out of reach. In response, will activism translate into concrete results the way it once did? Surely, a new generation of organizers now rising with a resolve and passion not seen in years, having broadened the civil rights project into a human rights one, will develop new strategies. Surely, they will discover or invent new means of stopping what threatens to be a contraction of democracy.  Surely, with the power of social media - a veritable television station in the hands of every citizen - they will find their own ways of ensuring that oppression can't dodge the spotlight.  Already, the bottom-up strategy championed by SNCC has found new fluency in the ascendance of hyper-democratic Internet organizing and the raw eloquence of #BlackLivesMatter . Does reform still demand powerful allies, and if so, who might they be?  A few centrist Republicans, courageous career attorneys in the Justice Department, billionaire Silicon Valley CEOs committed to pluralism, a mass of determined young people running for office? As organizers have discovered more than once since the early days of the republic, new levers lie waiting somewhere deep in the grand clockwork of our democracy.  The only question is: Where?\n\nOn the horrific night when James Meredith tried to enter the University of Mississippi, the mob , flying Confederate battle flags, attacked the media, smashing cameras, beating cameramen, and killing a reporter from Agence France-Presse execution-style, before shooting 35 federal marshals. Second only to the courage of African Americans was the courage of those highly visible TV crews. They would stay miraculously calm and focused, navigating the mayhem between marchers, mobs, and lawmen. Though they were constrained by journalistic standards from partisanship in reporting, many of those crews could not escape their growing sympathy for the movement, and found themselves ready to join in the reformation of America with their pictures and words. They were televising a particularly disgusting pageant: officers, under the sanction of state and local laws, bludgeoning, fire hosing, arresting, punching, cattle prodding, whipping, tear-gassing, and even shooting defenseless, unresisting black people who had declared their commitment to nonviolence.  It happened month after month throughout the 1960s. The Selma Show Movement leaders chose their sheriffs carefully, judging their battlegrounds in part by the quality of available villains.  They favored bad actors like Chief Bull Connor, the proud bigot of Birmingham, who unleashed fire hoses on teenaged marchers with operatic fury, and Selma's increasingly unhinged arch-segregationist sheriff, Jim Clark . The 1965 battle royal in Selma, Alabama, marked a milestone in the expansion of democracy for the town's African Americans, which had begun with the emancipation of its slaves during the Civil War. Selma first came under siege by Union regulars in April 1865.  The Confederate defenders, an ill-trained muster of white militiamen, kids, and old men, were no match for the northern troops who ran them out of their hometown, then spent the night burning and looting.  Selma's slaves were officially freed, but after a fleeting window of hope, Reconstruction and Jim Crow would strip them and their immediate descendants of nearly all their constitutional rights. By 1965, almost a century after the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which unambiguously declares, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged... on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\" the percentage of registered black voters in Alabama was actually falling.  Local white voter registration clerks in Selma had allowed only 2% of the city's 14,000 black citizens to register, compared to 90% of Selma's whites.  A carefully targeted registration campaign by local organizers and SNCC (later joined by the SCLC) aimed to shine a national spotlight on local oppression and so spur congressional action that would open up voting for black citizens throughout Alabama and eventually across the entire deep South. Strategically deploying Martin Luther King (just back from accepting the Nobel Prize in Norway), the movement in Selma set out to provoke Sheriff Clark and his famously brutal posse.  As SNCC's Jim Forman said, \"We were laying a trap.\" The aim was to heighten a moral battle of Shakespearian proportions that television would then beam directly to President Lyndon Johnson.

As SNCC's Jim Forman said, \"We were laying a trap.\" The aim was to heighten a moral battle of Shakespearian proportions that television would then beam directly to President Lyndon Johnson. At one point, the city would have 20 times more blacks in jail than on its voting rolls. Confrontations simmered throughout the winter of 1964-1965, punctuated by sudden explosions of violence. Reason, brotherly love, massed demonstrations, and inflamed national opinion made no dent in Jim Clark's enduring pathology .  Like a man possessed, he simply couldn't stop himself from behaving badly in front of the cameras.  He delivered the gaudy media goods, week after week, exactly as movement strategists had hoped he would, exactly as Selma's few moderate whites feared. The scenes of violence flashed around the country on TV every night, and appeared in the pages of the New York Times and Washington Post . By 1965, President Johnson, a Texas Democrat, was ready to take risks on civil rights.  He had already directed his White House staff to secretly prepare sweeping voting rights legislation and even a constitutional amendment.  Now, the only thing needed was a trigger, and that finally came on March 7th,  \"Bloody Sunday,\" when John Lewis, Hosea Williams, Bob Mants, and Albert Turner, leading hundreds of locals, crested the Pettus Bridge on their way to deliver a voting rights petition to Governor George Wallace at the state capitol. All hell broke loose. Whites cheered from the roadside as Alabama state troopers and Clark's mounted posse clubbed, bullwhipped, and tear-gassed their way through 600 unarmed black men, women, and children. A trooper fractured John Lewis's skull with his billy club. Here was the massacre of the innocents for all Americans to see: southern lawmen in their pig-faced gas masks going berserk against African Americans who stood and took it. That televised attack, a crystalline icon of the era, worthy of Dante, had by evening rallied nearly all of Washington to the marchers' cause. It would one day become a sturdy staple of history texts and documentaries. That night, local whites murdered a northern Unitarian minister. Selma's young white mayor, Joe Smitherman, said, \"I didn't understand how big it was until I saw it on television... That looked like a war; that went all over the country. And then... the wrath of the nation came down on us.\" Citing television coverage, 31 Republican leaders condemned the situation in Alabama, as well as the administration's delay in proposing new federal voting legislation. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen rose to declare, \"The time is now.\" President Johnson sent 2,000 federal troops to Selma as Lincoln had done 100 years before, this time to protect peaceful citizens of Alabama from Alabama state troopers.  He went on national television to proclaim, \"Their cause must be our cause, and together we shall overcome!\" and then dispatched a sweeping voting rights bill to a willing Congress.  After it passed the House by a vote of 328 to 74 and the Senate by 79 to 18, Johnson signed the act into law with John Lewis and Dr. King at his side. By their determined organizing, marching, demonstrating, and most of all by their relentless courage, local black people had successfully appealed to Washington, finally brought legalized American apartheid to its knees. Black voting in Alabama jumped seven-fold in the next three years. Without the media slamming blunt facts in the face of sympathetic (or politically savvy) power brokers in Washington, \"Bloody Sunday\" might have left in its wake little more than a few hundred broken and bleeding marchers and the Jim Crow voting system still intact.  Without the TV coverage and a president and Congress capable of being won over, it might have been the civil rights equivalent of a tree falling silently in the forest, not the engine of sweeping change that it was. \"Freedom Is A Constant Struggle\" But that was then. Back in 1965, the charm of Selma was lost on most of us who ventured there. I've returned a few times since, first in 1985 to shoot scenes for Eyes on the Prize , including an interview with an unrepentant Jim Clark. The town was, by then, smaller, blacker, and poorer. In 2015, I returned again with producer Orlando Bagwell to work on a film for the Southern Poverty Law Center.  From a distance, nestled on a bluff above the Alabama River, Selma looked to me like a picturesque little town in southern France.  The air below the Edmund Pettus Bridge , now a national historic landmark, was alive with swallows.  Selma's lovely historic district seemed nicely parked somewhere between 1850 and 1950, but much of the rest of the once-prosperous town had, like so much of small town America, been hollowed out by recession and a changing economy.  We could find only one restaurant open for supper downtown. Many of its beautiful nineteenth-century buildings were boarded up. Gaping bullet holes pockmarked the granite tombstone of Jimmie Lee Jackson, whose murder by a state trooper had sparked the original Bloody Sunday march. The Civil War Battle of Selma is still reenacted annually on a field outside town, with the Confederates defeated again, each year. The Voting Rights Act forged in Selma had been a triumph of the classic civil rights movement, the hinge between everything that came before and so much that would come after. But we had little reason to suspect or notice when, shortly after the act's passage in 1965, conservative organizers began a methodical 40-year campaign to gut it.  As black voter rolls in rural Alabama swelled, the state's young federal prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, brought charges of voter fraud against civil rights organizer Albert Turner, a leader of the Bloody Sunday march.  His case collapsed in court, but resistance continued, culminating in a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down one of that act's key provisions (federal approval of state changes in their voting laws). Ever since, a Republican campaign to put new voting restrictions in place has only gained momentum . In 2015, however, few had noticed the most profound changes of all, even though they were stirring just below the surface of things: sweeping working class frustration; previously dormant strains of racism, misogyny, and nativism; galloping income inequality; and Democratic Party failures that went unnoticed and uncorrected.  All of these factors would help lay the groundwork for the successful candidacy of Donald J. Trump.  He was slow indeed to reject the white supremacists and nationalists who rushed to endorse his presidential bid and he was brought to office in some measure by the very forces that the civil rights movement naively thought it had largely silenced. Because the lid had been kept on overt public racism and nativism for so long, many Americans were slow to understand how deeply systemic the problem is. The citizens of Selma voted for Hillary Clinton by a wide margin, but no matter.  Trump's wave has driven from power the vital center with which mass movements had once been able to partner. Vestiges of the very ethos against which the civil rights movement fought have grown ever stronger and found a welcome place in his White House, their strength buoyed by a growing societal disapproval of media elites.  In the process, Trump has inoculated himself against appeals for justice as has no president in our lifetime. When it comes to any rights appeals in the immediate future, no one with real federal power is likely to be listening. There will be no sympathy for human rights petitioners from majority Republicans in the House of Representatives untroubled by reelection fears in their ferociously gerrymandered districts, nor from the soon-to-be-devastated civil rights division of the Department of Justice. What mechanisms will remain for the activists to activate? In a country becoming less white every day, Democrats recently stood helpless when it came to blocking the confirmation of the whitest cabinet in decades. Soon enough, the Supreme Court will have a conservative majority and then President Trump will have the run of the table, racking up a political monoculture unknown in our time. What many Americans think of as the civil rights movement - something in our black and white past, back there, back then - is, in fact, a deep running project launched long before we were born and sure to endure long after we are gone. In one now-historic decade, civil rights organizers brilliantly identified the levers of government power they could seize, but most of those levers are today out of reach. In response, will activism translate into concrete results the way it once did? Surely, a new generation of organizers now rising with a resolve and passion not seen in years, having broadened the civil rights project into a human rights one, will develop new strategies. Surely, they will discover or invent new means of stopping what threatens to be a contraction of democracy.  Surely, with the power of social media - a veritable television station in the hands of every citizen - they will find their own ways of ensuring that oppression can't dodge the spotlight.  Already, the bottom-up strategy championed by SNCC has found new fluency in the ascendance of hyper-democratic Internet organizing and the raw eloquence of #BlackLivesMatter . Does reform still demand powerful allies, and if so, who might they be?  A few centrist Republicans, courageous career attorneys in the Justice Department, billionaire Silicon Valley CEOs committed to pluralism, a mass of determined young people running for office? As organizers have discovered more than once since the early days of the republic, new levers lie waiting somewhere deep in the grand clockwork of our democracy.  The only question is: Where?\n\nThe 1965 battle royal in Selma, Alabama, marked a milestone in the expansion of democracy for the town's African Americans, which had begun with the emancipation of its slaves during the Civil War. Selma first came under siege by Union regulars in April 1865.  The Confederate defenders, an ill-trained muster of white militiamen, kids, and old men, were no match for the northern troops who ran them out of their hometown, then spent the night burning and looting.  Selma's slaves were officially freed, but after a fleeting window of hope, Reconstruction and Jim Crow would strip them and their immediate descendants of nearly all their constitutional rights. By 1965, almost a century after the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment, which unambiguously declares, \"The right of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied or abridged... on account of race, color, or previous condition of servitude,\" the percentage of registered black voters in Alabama was actually falling.  Local white voter registration clerks in Selma had allowed only 2% of the city's 14,000 black citizens to register, compared to 90% of Selma's whites.  A carefully targeted registration campaign by local organizers and SNCC (later joined by the SCLC) aimed to shine a national spotlight on local oppression and so spur congressional action that would open up voting for black citizens throughout Alabama and eventually across the entire deep South. Strategically deploying Martin Luther King (just back from accepting the Nobel Prize in Norway), the movement in Selma set out to provoke Sheriff Clark and his famously brutal posse.

The air below the Edmund Pettus Bridge , now a national historic landmark, was alive with swallows.  Selma's lovely historic district seemed nicely parked somewhere between 1850 and 1950, but much of the rest of the once-prosperous town had, like so much of small town America, been hollowed out by recession and a changing economy.  We could find only one restaurant open for supper downtown. Many of its beautiful nineteenth-century buildings were boarded up. Gaping bullet holes pockmarked the granite tombstone of Jimmie Lee Jackson, whose murder by a state trooper had sparked the original Bloody Sunday march. The Civil War Battle of Selma is still reenacted annually on a field outside town, with the Confederates defeated again, each year. The Voting Rights Act forged in Selma had been a triumph of the classic civil rights movement, the hinge between everything that came before and so much that would come after. But we had little reason to suspect or notice when, shortly after the act's passage in 1965, conservative organizers began a methodical 40-year campaign to gut it.  As black voter rolls in rural Alabama swelled, the state's young federal prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, brought charges of voter fraud against civil rights organizer Albert Turner, a leader of the Bloody Sunday march.  His case collapsed in court, but resistance continued, culminating in a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down one of that act's key provisions (federal approval of state changes in their voting laws). Ever since, a Republican campaign to put new voting restrictions in place has only gained momentum . In 2015, however, few had noticed the most profound changes of all, even though they were stirring just below the surface of things: sweeping working class frustration; previously dormant strains of racism, misogyny, and nativism; galloping income inequality; and Democratic Party failures that went unnoticed and uncorrected.  All of these factors would help lay the groundwork for the successful candidacy of Donald J. Trump.  He was slow indeed to reject the white supremacists and nationalists who rushed to endorse his presidential bid and he was brought to office in some measure by the very forces that the civil rights movement naively thought it had largely silenced. Because the lid had been kept on overt public racism and nativism for so long, many Americans were slow to understand how deeply systemic the problem is. The citizens of Selma voted for Hillary Clinton by a wide margin, but no matter.  Trump's wave has driven from power the vital center with which mass movements had once been able to partner. Vestiges of the very ethos against which the civil rights movement fought have grown ever stronger and found a welcome place in his White House, their strength buoyed by a growing societal disapproval of media elites.  In the process, Trump has inoculated himself against appeals for justice as has no president in our lifetime. When it comes to any rights appeals in the immediate future, no one with real federal power is likely to be listening. There will be no sympathy for human rights petitioners from majority Republicans in the House of Representatives untroubled by reelection fears in their ferociously gerrymandered districts, nor from the soon-to-be-devastated civil rights division of the Department of Justice. What mechanisms will remain for the activists to activate? In a country becoming less white every day, Democrats recently stood helpless when it came to blocking the confirmation of the whitest cabinet in decades. Soon enough, the Supreme Court will have a conservative majority and then President Trump will have the run of the table, racking up a political monoculture unknown in our time. What many Americans think of as the civil rights movement - something in our black and white past, back there, back then - is, in fact, a deep running project launched long before we were born and sure to endure long after we are gone. In one now-historic decade, civil rights organizers brilliantly identified the levers of government power they could seize, but most of those levers are today out of reach. In response, will activism translate into concrete results the way it once did? Surely, a new generation of organizers now rising with a resolve and passion not seen in years, having broadened the civil rights project into a human rights one, will develop new strategies. Surely, they will discover or invent new means of stopping what threatens to be a contraction of democracy.  Surely, with the power of social media - a veritable television station in the hands of every citizen - they will find their own ways of ensuring that oppression can't dodge the spotlight.  Already, the bottom-up strategy championed by SNCC has found new fluency in the ascendance of hyper-democratic Internet organizing and the raw eloquence of #BlackLivesMatter . Does reform still demand powerful allies, and if so, who might they be?  A few centrist Republicans, courageous career attorneys in the Justice Department, billionaire Silicon Valley CEOs committed to pluralism, a mass of determined young people running for office? As organizers have discovered more than once since the early days of the republic, new levers lie waiting somewhere deep in the grand clockwork of our democracy.  The only question is: Where?\n\nAt one point, the city would have 20 times more blacks in jail than on its voting rolls. Confrontations simmered throughout the winter of 1964-1965, punctuated by sudden explosions of violence. Reason, brotherly love, massed demonstrations, and inflamed national opinion made no dent in Jim Clark's enduring pathology .  Like a man possessed, he simply couldn't stop himself from behaving badly in front of the cameras.  He delivered the gaudy media goods, week after week, exactly as movement strategists had hoped he would, exactly as Selma's few moderate whites feared. The scenes of violence flashed around the country on TV every night, and appeared in the pages of the New York Times and Washington Post . By 1965, President Johnson, a Texas Democrat, was ready to take risks on civil rights.  He had already directed his White House staff to secretly prepare sweeping voting rights legislation and even a constitutional amendment.  Now, the only thing needed was a trigger, and that finally came on March 7th,  \"Bloody Sunday,\" when John Lewis, Hosea Williams, Bob Mants, and Albert Turner, leading hundreds of locals, crested the Pettus Bridge on their way to deliver a voting rights petition to Governor George Wallace at the state capitol. All hell broke loose. Whites cheered from the roadside as Alabama state troopers and Clark's mounted posse clubbed, bullwhipped, and tear-gassed their way through 600 unarmed black men, women, and children. A trooper fractured John Lewis's skull with his billy club. Here was the massacre of the innocents for all Americans to see: southern lawmen in their pig-faced gas masks going berserk against African Americans who stood and took it. That televised attack, a crystalline icon of the era, worthy of Dante, had by evening rallied nearly all of Washington to the marchers' cause. It would one day become a sturdy staple of history texts and documentaries. That night, local whites murdered a northern Unitarian minister. Selma's young white mayor, Joe Smitherman, said, \"I didn't understand how big it was until I saw it on television... That looked like a war; that went all over the country. And then... the wrath of the nation came down on us.\" Citing television coverage, 31 Republican leaders condemned the situation in Alabama, as well as the administration's delay in proposing new federal voting legislation. Republican Senator Everett Dirksen rose to declare, \"The time is now.\" President Johnson sent 2,000 federal troops to Selma as Lincoln had done 100 years before, this time to protect peaceful citizens of Alabama from Alabama state troopers.  He went on national television to proclaim, \"Their cause must be our cause, and together we shall overcome!\" and then dispatched a sweeping voting rights bill to a willing Congress.  After it passed the House by a vote of 328 to 74 and the Senate by 79 to 18, Johnson signed the act into law with John Lewis and Dr. King at his side. By their determined organizing, marching, demonstrating, and most of all by their relentless courage, local black people had successfully appealed to Washington, finally brought legalized American apartheid to its knees. Black voting in Alabama jumped seven-fold in the next three years. Without the media slamming blunt facts in the face of sympathetic (or politically savvy) power brokers in Washington, \"Bloody Sunday\" might have left in its wake little more than a few hundred broken and bleeding marchers and the Jim Crow voting system still intact.  Without the TV coverage and a president and Congress capable of being won over, it might have been the civil rights equivalent of a tree falling silently in the forest, not the engine of sweeping change that it was. \"Freedom Is A Constant Struggle\" But that was then. Back in 1965, the charm of Selma was lost on most of us who ventured there. I've returned a few times since, first in 1985 to shoot scenes for Eyes on the Prize , including an interview with an unrepentant Jim Clark. The town was, by then, smaller, blacker, and poorer.

Vestiges of the very ethos against which the civil rights movement fought have grown ever stronger and found a welcome place in his White House, their strength buoyed by a growing societal disapproval of media elites.  In the process, Trump has inoculated himself against appeals for justice as has no president in our lifetime. When it comes to any rights appeals in the immediate future, no one with real federal power is likely to be listening. There will be no sympathy for human rights petitioners from majority Republicans in the House of Representatives untroubled by reelection fears in their ferociously gerrymandered districts, nor from the soon-to-be-devastated civil rights division of the Department of Justice. What mechanisms will remain for the activists to activate? In a country becoming less white every day, Democrats recently stood helpless when it came to blocking the confirmation of the whitest cabinet in decades. Soon enough, the Supreme Court will have a conservative majority and then President Trump will have the run of the table, racking up a political monoculture unknown in our time. What many Americans think of as the civil rights movement - something in our black and white past, back there, back then - is, in fact, a deep running project launched long before we were born and sure to endure long after we are gone. In one now-historic decade, civil rights organizers brilliantly identified the levers of government power they could seize, but most of those levers are today out of reach. In response, will activism translate into concrete results the way it once did? Surely, a new generation of organizers now rising with a resolve and passion not seen in years, having broadened the civil rights project into a human rights one, will develop new strategies. Surely, they will discover or invent new means of stopping what threatens to be a contraction of democracy.  Surely, with the power of social media - a veritable television station in the hands of every citizen - they will find their own ways of ensuring that oppression can't dodge the spotlight.  Already, the bottom-up strategy championed by SNCC has found new fluency in the ascendance of hyper-democratic Internet organizing and the raw eloquence of #BlackLivesMatter . Does reform still demand powerful allies, and if so, who might they be?  A few centrist Republicans, courageous career attorneys in the Justice Department, billionaire Silicon Valley CEOs committed to pluralism, a mass of determined young people running for office? As organizers have discovered more than once since the early days of the republic, new levers lie waiting somewhere deep in the grand clockwork of our democracy.  The only question is: Where?\n\nPresident Johnson sent 2,000 federal troops to Selma as Lincoln had done 100 years before, this time to protect peaceful citizens of Alabama from Alabama state troopers.  He went on national television to proclaim, \"Their cause must be our cause, and together we shall overcome!\" and then dispatched a sweeping voting rights bill to a willing Congress.  After it passed the House by a vote of 328 to 74 and the Senate by 79 to 18, Johnson signed the act into law with John Lewis and Dr. King at his side. By their determined organizing, marching, demonstrating, and most of all by their relentless courage, local black people had successfully appealed to Washington, finally brought legalized American apartheid to its knees. Black voting in Alabama jumped seven-fold in the next three years. Without the media slamming blunt facts in the face of sympathetic (or politically savvy) power brokers in Washington, \"Bloody Sunday\" might have left in its wake little more than a few hundred broken and bleeding marchers and the Jim Crow voting system still intact.  Without the TV coverage and a president and Congress capable of being won over, it might have been the civil rights equivalent of a tree falling silently in the forest, not the engine of sweeping change that it was. \"Freedom Is A Constant Struggle\" But that was then. Back in 1965, the charm of Selma was lost on most of us who ventured there. I've returned a few times since, first in 1985 to shoot scenes for Eyes on the Prize , including an interview with an unrepentant Jim Clark. The town was, by then, smaller, blacker, and poorer. In 2015, I returned again with producer Orlando Bagwell to work on a film for the Southern Poverty Law Center.  From a distance, nestled on a bluff above the Alabama River, Selma looked to me like a picturesque little town in southern France.  The air below the Edmund Pettus Bridge , now a national historic landmark, was alive with swallows.  Selma's lovely historic district seemed nicely parked somewhere between 1850 and 1950, but much of the rest of the once-prosperous town had, like so much of small town America, been hollowed out by recession and a changing economy.  We could find only one restaurant open for supper downtown. Many of its beautiful nineteenth-century buildings were boarded up. Gaping bullet holes pockmarked the granite tombstone of Jimmie Lee Jackson, whose murder by a state trooper had sparked the original Bloody Sunday march. The Civil War Battle of Selma is still reenacted annually on a field outside town, with the Confederates defeated again, each year. The Voting Rights Act forged in Selma had been a triumph of the classic civil rights movement, the hinge between everything that came before and so much that would come after. But we had little reason to suspect or notice when, shortly after the act's passage in 1965, conservative organizers began a methodical 40-year campaign to gut it.  As black voter rolls in rural Alabama swelled, the state's young federal prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, brought charges of voter fraud against civil rights organizer Albert Turner, a leader of the Bloody Sunday march.  His case collapsed in court, but resistance continued, culminating in a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down one of that act's key provisions (federal approval of state changes in their voting laws). Ever since, a Republican campaign to put new voting restrictions in place has only gained momentum . In 2015, however, few had noticed the most profound changes of all, even though they were stirring just below the surface of things: sweeping working class frustration; previously dormant strains of racism, misogyny, and nativism; galloping income inequality; and Democratic Party failures that went unnoticed and uncorrected.  All of these factors would help lay the groundwork for the successful candidacy of Donald J. Trump.  He was slow indeed to reject the white supremacists and nationalists who rushed to endorse his presidential bid and he was brought to office in some measure by the very forces that the civil rights movement naively thought it had largely silenced.

As organizers have discovered more than once since the early days of the republic, new levers lie waiting somewhere deep in the grand clockwork of our democracy.  The only question is: Where?\n\nThe Voting Rights Act forged in Selma had been a triumph of the classic civil rights movement, the hinge between everything that came before and so much that would come after. But we had little reason to suspect or notice when, shortly after the act's passage in 1965, conservative organizers began a methodical 40-year campaign to gut it.  As black voter rolls in rural Alabama swelled, the state's young federal prosecutor, Jeff Sessions, brought charges of voter fraud against civil rights organizer Albert Turner, a leader of the Bloody Sunday march.  His case collapsed in court, but resistance continued, culminating in a 2013 Supreme Court decision that struck down one of that act's key provisions (federal approval of state changes in their voting laws). Ever since, a Republican campaign to put new voting restrictions in place has only gained momentum . In 2015, however, few had noticed the most profound changes of all, even though they were stirring just below the surface of things: sweeping working class frustration; previously dormant strains of racism, misogyny, and nativism; galloping income inequality; and Democratic Party failures that went unnoticed and uncorrected.  All of these factors would help lay the groundwork for the successful candidacy of Donald J. Trump.  He was slow indeed to reject the white supremacists and nationalists who rushed to endorse his presidential bid and he was brought to office in some measure by the very forces that the civil rights movement naively thought it had largely silenced. Because the lid had been kept on overt public racism and nativism for so long, many Americans were slow to understand how deeply systemic the problem is.

It may well be that the many seeds sown by long periods of Executive inaction in the advancement of civil rights in America have reached the ugly harvest of lawlessness and violence we now see in Mississippi.

It has been difficult to believe what we have read in the newspapers and more difficult to believe what our television sets have hurled at our eyes. Is this America?.... It leaves one a little dazed and numb.... This sordid American tragedy has demonstrated once again the need for vigorous and firm exercise of the powers of the Presidency in seeking to engender a climate of understanding and respect for the civil and constitutional rights of Negroes. The executive heads of our nation must not wait for some great crisis to emerge before asserting forthright action, but must make it palpably clear on a day-to-day basis that their power, their moral leadership and authority, are committed to the task of removing the ugly weight of racial discrimination from the shoulders of the nation. It may well be that the many seeds sown by long periods of Executive inaction in the advancement of civil rights in America have reached the ugly harvest of lawlessness and violence we now see in Mississippi. What are we to say to the world? Oxford, Mississippi, has placed democracy on trial. As never before, the cry of the Negro for equality and justice in our nation has been muffled, at best. But the Little Rocks, the Montgomerys, the Albanys and the Oxfords place the questioning of our world leadership on the lips of the emerging African and Asian nations. We cannot stand before the judgment bar of world opinion so long as there erupts an Oxford, Mississippi.

Soon he'd find himself caught up in their power struggle for the club's leadership, which mirrored a core political rift dividing the group. Wright had allied himself with the writers out of \"simple loyalty,\" and one night they called a special meeting to nominate him, over his objections, for the office of executive secretary. After an all-night debate, Wright was voted into office. It was only later that he realized the writers' gambit: They were leftist intellectuals but not official members of the Communist Party-unlike the painters, who were CPUSA members. So the writers, he wrote, \"confronted the members of the party with a Negro, knowing it would be difficult for Communists to refuse to vote for a man representing the largest single racial minority in the nation, inasmuch as Negro equality was one of the main tenets of Communism.\" It was thus that the writers exploited Wright's race and the ardent anti-racist goals of Communist politics to outmaneuver the painters.\n\nThis event took place in the early 1930s, a period designated by the Communist International as Third Period Communism. It was a period defined by the sense that capitalism was on the verge of collapse. This optimism in the imminence of worldwide revolution led Tillie Olsen to write with hope in 1934 of a coming \"Soviet America.\" In the Communist imaginary of the Third Period, it was the Black worker who would lead the coming revolution-hence the writers could put forth a Black candidate and bank on the Communists' support. Within just a few years, Third Period Communism would come to an official end. Responding to the rise of fascism in Europe and the Great Depression in the United States, by the mid-1930s, the Communist left had mobilized its somewhat less orthodox, more coalitional Popular Front strategy. The shift from Third Period to Popular Front sought to enable broader alliances across the political left, but as Sara Marcus writes in her new book, Political Disappointment: A Cultural History From Reconstruction to the AIDS Crisis , the shift brought with it a \"watering down of [the party's] antiracist priorities\" and a retreat from the celebratory feeling that revolution was around the corner. For those who held true to the promise of a Black revolutionary vanguard, the move to the \"big tent\" organizing strategy of the Popular Front constituted a loss of revolutionary vision, and the mid-1930s represented a period of political disappointment.\n\nThe central thesis of Marcus's book is that for those seeking political transformation and social justice, the American post-Civil War era and the new century that followed unfolded as a series of such moments: windows of revolutionary promise that were abruptly, painfully closed. Reconstruction fell to Jim Crow; Third Period Communism yielded to the Popular Front; the classical phase of the civil rights movement faced persistent white terror; and so on. Wherever hope was raised, disappointment followed. Yet what is most striking about Marcus's account is not so much her historical narrative but her implicit argument, mostly through the book's methodology, about where these disappointments went and where the response to them can now be found: in the minute details of cultural expression.\n\nWhile each of Marcus's chapters sets the scene of political disappointment by providing historical context, her analysis takes the form of a series of intricate-and ingenious-close readings of works by W.E.B. Du Bois, Ella Sheppard, Tillie Olsen, Audre Lorde, David Wojnarowicz, and others. It is in the details of cultural production that Marcus locates the afterlife of disappointment, seeing in these details both grief for what was lost and the persistent desire for some ongoing, if reconfigured, version of it. If Political Disappointment makes an explicit case for recasting the 20th century as a century of disappointment, the real work of the book is to quietly build a case, through its method of analysis, for where grief and, ultimately, hope migrated: into the \"fleeting and overlooked moments\" of culture. Marcus illuminates these texts as repositories of political sentiment, where grief is processed and new solidarities are proposed.\n\nIn her chapter on 1930s Communism, for example, Marcus zeroes in on the work songs of Huddie Ledbetter, better known by his stage name Leadbelly. She notices a new, distinct vocalization that cropped up in his work songs in the late 1930s: a breathy huh added to the end of each line, a sonic representation of work, of axes falling, and of workers' exhalations. This huh represented the cadence of labor. She pinpoints 1937 as the first recorded instance of Leadbelly's enactment of this sound, in his recording of \"Julie Ann Johnson\" for the Library of Congress, and she observes that the sound grew more distinctly voiced in Leadbelly's recordings over the next three years. Marcus sets this evolving huh in biographical context-by 1937, Leadbelly had moved to New York, where he became a favorite of leftist folk enthusiasts-and in the larger context of the shifting sands of revolutionary Communist discourse. To Marcus, it is no wonder that Leadbelly recorded his first huh in 1937, in the wake of the Third Period and the disappointments, especially when it came to the party's \"antiracist priorities,\" of the Popular Front. For Leadbelly's huh invoked the disappointment of the Popular Front and the very figure being lost from the party's shifting priorities: the Black worker.\n\nMusic and musical transcription are ripe sites of analysis for Marcus, and her chapter on the failures of Reconstruction similarly focuses on how music made a record of political loss as well as the persistent hope for social transformation. She dives into Ella Sheppard's transcriptions of Black spirituals for the Fisk Jubilee Singers, an a cappella group whose tours of the United States and Europe in the 1870s garnered the singers and their repertoire of songs much acclaim. Marcus makes a striking observation about the way Sheppard uses the fermata, a musical notation meant to indicate an unmetered pause. At a fermata, singers might hold a note longer, or they might go silent on it. In Sheppard's transcription of the spiritual \"O I'm Going to Sing All the Way,\" Marcus notes that her fermatas sometimes ask singers to do both: They are distributed such that some singers are moving forward with a prolonged note, while others are stilled to silence. This choice by Sheppard, Marcus argues, creates a \"halting, heterogenous quality\" to the music, as though it were moving forward and backward at the same time. It is a sonic quality, Marcus extrapolates, that contravenes the period's dominant narrative of history, the sense that \"humanity was on an inexorable upward trajectory\"-a demonstrably false narrative to the many Black Americans subject to the regressive terror and disenfranchisement of the period. Instead, the Fisk Jubilee Singers' spirituals and Sheppard's transcriptions posit a different way of thinking about history, indeed about time itself: Time does not move neatly forward; rather, past and present, movement and stillness, disappointment and hope are constitutively tangled up in each other.\n\nWhere music became a harbor for political sentiment in these cases, Marcus writes of a shift away from sound-and, in particular, voice-in the focus and rhetoric of second-wave feminism. The period from 1977 to 1983 was, in some ways, a bleak period for feminism, a period of right-wing backlash. Yet it was also a period when Black and intersectional feminism rose to prominence, naming the shortcomings and injustices both of second-wave (white) feminism and of Black liberation movements. While this period is often figured as one of decline and division, Marcus recasts it as one of feminist reassessment, particularly in light of Black feminism's intersectional analysis. At the forefront of this reassessment was a shifting relationship to voice as an \"article of feminist faith\": the notion that the root of women's oppression lay in the suppression of their voices, and that the unleashing of women's voices would undo their silencing and strike at the heart of patriarchy. But by the late 1970s, the raising of women's voices had not achieved these goals. Moreover, for Black feminists, including Audre Lorde, whom Marcus spotlights, \"speaking up\" seemed insufficient for battling the racist and sexist ways that Black women were seen-how they had been \"rendered invisible by the depersonalization of racism,\" in Lorde's words, and how visibility had made Black women \"most vulnerable\" but could yet serve as their \"greatest strength.\" Marcus argues that where voice had failed, leaving feminists disappointed, vision-seeing and being seen-stepped in as a new frontier of feminist poetics, theory, and strategy.\n\nMarcus's dazzling close readings go a long way toward supporting the idea that political disappointment quite literally \"found form\" in art, literature, and music, meaning as a place for these sentiments to lodge themselves. Marcus goes beyond merely placing the works in their historical contexts; she harvests historical contexts from within the works themselves. The almost invisible phenomena of culture-a huh from Leadbelly, a fermata from Sheppard-become indices of political history. Strung together, a new historical narrative emerges: \"The story of the twentieth century is a story of disappointment.\" So, too, does its cultural-historical correlative: that 20th-century art became the vehicle of disappointment's expression, sometimes in the most surprising ways.\n\nImmanent to Marcus's analysis is perhaps another story: the story of how these political disappointments were processed in continued political mobilization. This is a story that the method of close reading is less able to accommodate, so it remains somewhat underexplored by Marcus. Surely, disappointment didn't move strictly into the confines of culture but continued to circulate in politics as well. This is a facet that may be best reflected in the histories of social movements, but Marcus's account does offer a taste of it, particularly in her chapter on the civil rights movement, which she focalizes through the 1966 March Against Fear.\n\nIn 1966, the activist James Meredith set out to walk across the state of Mississippi. His goal was to encourage Black Mississippians not to be afraid of white terror. When he was brutally attacked on the second day of his journey, an improvised coalition of activists, including Martin Luther King Jr. and Stokely Carmichael, came together to finish his walk. According to Marcus, 1966 was a year of disappointment for proponents of nonviolent civil disobedience; many, including the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, then chaired by Carmichael, were questioning the goals and the tactics of the civil rights movement. She maps the tension of this moment-and the shifting tactics of Black liberation-in the soundscape of the march: Carmichael and SNCC unveiled their new Black Power chant, but King and his proponents were still using the movement's traditional songs. In the sonic cacophony of conflicting ideology, the tenuous coalition decided to go quiet, neither to chant nor to sing but just to walk. We see in Marcus's analysis the way disappointment seeded a new political dispensation-Black Power-and how this political shift was configured in artistic expression.\n\nWhat feels lasting and applicable about Marcus's exploration of 20th-century political disappointment is her definition of disappointment itself. Disappointment is distinct from disillusionment, or the \"bitter or sheepish pronouncements that one's desires, misbegotten from the start, [are] suitable only for disavowal.\" Instead, as Marcus sees it, disappointment is fundamentally generative. As her book testifies, it is behind some of the 20th century's most important works of culture, from Du Bois's Souls of Black Folk to the poetry and prose of Lorde. It is also the engine behind the new, if tenuous, solidarities that emerge in the wake of these disappointments-the way intersectional feminists found new traction in the concept of visibility, or how the art and activism of the AIDS crisis (such as the work of Marlon Riggs and David Wojnarowicz) ushered into being coalitions that included those who had died. In all of the instances Marcus studies, we see artists refusing to disavow what they were fighting for, even if the conditions of possibility for achieving their goals had been dismantled-by white supremacy or capitalism or patriarchy. They may have been disappointed, but they weren't disillusioned. Shall we all strive, then, to be disappointed.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

On October 30, in response to an official e-mail discouraging Yale students from wearing racially insensitive Halloween costumes, Erika Christakis, a faculty member who with her husband heads the residential hall Silliman College, sent a somewhat tone-deaf, blithely condescending letter of disapproval to her students. In her response to the administration, she asked whether we had \"lost faith in young people's capacity...to ignore or reject things that trouble you.\" The ensuing protests have become national news, with students demanding an apology and eventually the resignation of Christakis and her husband. Christakis closed her letter by remarking that \"free speech and the ability to tolerate offence are the hallmarks of a free and open society\"-a laudable idea, and frequently, from authorities in Christakis's position, a patronizing antidote to student objections concerning campus climate. Students of color at these colleges are generally familiar with the evasive, smiling reasonableness of mid-level administrators, who live on planets far removed from the day-to-day atmosphere that drives student complaints and haven't made it far enough up the academic-administrative ladder to start pretending otherwise. \"The tensions at Yale,\" write Isaac Stanley-Becker and Susan Svrluga in The Washington Post , \"echo recent uprisings at colleges and schools around the country.\" The Post cites just one other university outcry to evidence a protest epidemic: the University of Missouri, where, in response to a wave of student action, university president Tim Wolfe stepped down on Monday. Wolfe was the public face, and often the ready defender, of the Missouri administration's failure to address pervasive campus racism. Yet the situation at Yale does not \"echo\" that of Missouri at all. Or that of Ole Miss, where a statue of James Meredith was vandalized last year with a noose and Confederate insignia, and where white students threw liquor and shouted slurs at a young black woman studying there; or the situation at Duke, where white students this year-wait for it- hung a noose from a tree and shouted racial slurs at a young black woman studying there. Black students at Mizzou have begun receiving death threats . This isn't to spark a round of Oppression Olympics: Disadvantaged students at Yale-caliber institutions experience daily object lessons on the well-intentioned ignorance and patrician paternalism of their classmates and professors. Their protests do touch on many elements of campus life. But institutional noblesse oblige is not all bad. Yale's endowment, which posted a stunning 20.2 percent return last year, stands at $24 billion , or nearly $2 million per student. This is put to some fine ends-including comparative institutional responsiveness, the kind that engenders certain expectations. Mizzou, by contrast, serves 35,400 students with $800 million in the bank. It literally cannot afford Yale's preoccupations: Money that could be spent on some further degree of, say, mental-health services is probably being spent on new gear for a football program that brings in $84 million yearly, more than one-tenth the endowment's value.

Two-thirds of Mizzou's scholarship athletes are black, about 10 times the proportion of the broader student body. In coordination with the university's Legion of Black Collegians and a campus group called Concerned Student 1950 (named for the year Mizzou admitted its first nonwhite student), the football team's strike has played a crucial role in the resignation of university president Tim Wolfe. Missouri racism is no longer a question of white faculty, students, and administrators extending courtesies: Students of color at Missouri wield incontrovertible power, and UM staff from ex-president Wolfe down are scrabbling to maintain the fiscal integrity of an educational program that relies on unpaid black labor . Yale, meanwhile, couldn't get rid of a dorm head-who in any case doesn't need to be summarily fired. Open racism has a long history at Southern universities, and Mizzou, though in a border state, is no exception. In 1957, a young Martin Luther King Jr. spoke in St. Louis on Southern segregation. He was given second billing at the event to a \"moderate\" pastor, with whom he registered marked disagreement on the need for direct action-that man, Liston Pope, was then dean of Yale Divinity School. In today's New Haven, a poorly considered letter and a reportedly racist fratboy provoked chaotic, intense protests. In Missouri, the n-word is not news. Nor was a swastika in a campus dorm . Nor, until very recently, were President Wolfe's moronic remarks about oppression . News coverage did little to reflect this in previous days. Before the Mizzou football strike changed the game, Yale's protests saw extensive coverage from The Washington Post , Gawker, Time , Slate, Reason , even Teen Vogue ; a full-bore explainer from Vox and the obligatory Huffington Post articles rounded out the mix. Gawker has Yale \"imploding over a Halloween email\" in its headline. Until Mizzou's athletes put their skin-and their institution's finances-in the game, Yale, a fraction the size, secured a more prominent spot in the news cycle simply by dint of its name. Why, until very recently, were the college beat's priorities so unabashedly bizarre? THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. DONATE NOW! Perhaps because the world of magazine journalism and Internet thinkpieces has much more in common, demographically, with Yale's student body than with Mizzou's. Which campus battles resonate with, even come to the attention of, those in a position to cover collegiate institutional discrimination? Dan Savage being heckled at the University of Chicago , a general source of Internet vitriol also covered here , here and here , or the KKK, appearing armed two weeks ago at Ole Miss , a story which briefly flickered on the cycles of local news affiliates? Only now, with football at stake and Wolfe's resignation at hand, has discussion of Mizzou's race problem caught up. The Washington Post 's coverage of Yale protests is written by a current Yale senior , a relationship that should surprise exactly nobody. Online on Monday, the most recent piece about the Yale conflagration (one of three at the time) ranked as its second-most-popular article. Another ranked fourth. Two more have been published since. Attendance at a college like Yale-where nearly half this year's matriculating undergraduates attended private high schools, compared to 2 percent of the general population-follows on the breed of schooling that builds kids into walking résumés, honed to pass the filter of a 6.4 percent acceptance rate. It is an institution primed to lull students into seeking institutional remedy as a first resort and last demand, a natural expectation to harbor toward a body which presents itself, sometimes convincingly, as an omnipresent amalgam of mom, dad, and school-dance chaperone. Yale's students have been told that they will not be let down, without regard to race, faith, or culture. Their repeated demands of Nicholas Christakis and Dean Jonathan Holloway were initially for one thing: an apology. An administrative and institutional apology, an apology with official sanction, an apology with resignation as the price of refusal. Confirmation that Yale does, indeed, care . When that apology wasn't forthcoming, is it any wonder how they responded ? Students' demands and approaches to restitution at Mizzou stand in illuminating counterpoint to the Yale student body's reaction . How did Mizzou's students come to adopt elementally different strategies for addressing their campus crisis? Maybe because their collegiate experiences have not led them to expect institutional results. Maybe because they cannot count on the same proportion of white allies, and the consequent critical mass of campus support, while they constitute a sparse 7 percent of the student body. Maybe because \"accountability\" is another word for instilling fear in the prestige engine, a machine that operates very, very differently in and near the South than it does at Yale. Mizzou is situated in a thoroughly conservative part of the country, and its administration and student body reflect that reality. If nonwhite Mizzou undergraduates and graduates had any illusions about institutional responsiveness, exposure to campus rhetoric, administrative and otherwise, has disabused them by now. Yale does not, cannot, care in any meaningful sense. But it is compelled to do a more convincing impression than Mizzou. According to the Post , Yale's Salovey \"said he would continue to seek the input of students without placing the burden on them to repair the university.\" This is manifestly strange. Mizzou's student activists are not exacting apologies or incremental reforms, but, by organizing effectively, demanding and winning fundamental changes at the highest levels. Their students' tactical deployment of economic and social pressure is very deliberately anchored to the words- quoted by Concerned Student 1950 in a much-cited tweet -of Martin Luther King. Few have ever had much reason to expect results from the establishment. The tactics they employed were complex and well-considered. They had no choice but to be. Their demands were not only clear but far more attainable than many outside spectators supposed. The 56 black scholarship athletes at Missouri represent a constellation of backgrounds that, by and large, diverge deeply from Yale's median students. They are acutely aware that the burden is, in fact, on them to repair their university.\n\nChristakis closed her letter by remarking that \"free speech and the ability to tolerate offence are the hallmarks of a free and open society\"-a laudable idea, and frequently, from authorities in Christakis's position, a patronizing antidote to student objections concerning campus climate. Students of color at these colleges are generally familiar with the evasive, smiling reasonableness of mid-level administrators, who live on planets far removed from the day-to-day atmosphere that drives student complaints and haven't made it far enough up the academic-administrative ladder to start pretending otherwise. \"The tensions at Yale,\" write Isaac Stanley-Becker and Susan Svrluga in The Washington Post , \"echo recent uprisings at colleges and schools around the country.\" The Post cites just one other university outcry to evidence a protest epidemic: the University of Missouri, where, in response to a wave of student action, university president Tim Wolfe stepped down on Monday.

Only now, with football at stake and Wolfe's resignation at hand, has discussion of Mizzou's race problem caught up. The Washington Post 's coverage of Yale protests is written by a current Yale senior , a relationship that should surprise exactly nobody. Online on Monday, the most recent piece about the Yale conflagration (one of three at the time) ranked as its second-most-popular article. Another ranked fourth. Two more have been published since. Attendance at a college like Yale-where nearly half this year's matriculating undergraduates attended private high schools, compared to 2 percent of the general population-follows on the breed of schooling that builds kids into walking résumés, honed to pass the filter of a 6.4 percent acceptance rate. It is an institution primed to lull students into seeking institutional remedy as a first resort and last demand, a natural expectation to harbor toward a body which presents itself, sometimes convincingly, as an omnipresent amalgam of mom, dad, and school-dance chaperone. Yale's students have been told that they will not be let down, without regard to race, faith, or culture. Their repeated demands of Nicholas Christakis and Dean Jonathan Holloway were initially for one thing: an apology. An administrative and institutional apology, an apology with official sanction, an apology with resignation as the price of refusal. Confirmation that Yale does, indeed, care . When that apology wasn't forthcoming, is it any wonder how they responded ? Students' demands and approaches to restitution at Mizzou stand in illuminating counterpoint to the Yale student body's reaction . How did Mizzou's students come to adopt elementally different strategies for addressing their campus crisis? Maybe because their collegiate experiences have not led them to expect institutional results. Maybe because they cannot count on the same proportion of white allies, and the consequent critical mass of campus support, while they constitute a sparse 7 percent of the student body. Maybe because \"accountability\" is another word for instilling fear in the prestige engine, a machine that operates very, very differently in and near the South than it does at Yale. Mizzou is situated in a thoroughly conservative part of the country, and its administration and student body reflect that reality. If nonwhite Mizzou undergraduates and graduates had any illusions about institutional responsiveness, exposure to campus rhetoric, administrative and otherwise, has disabused them by now. Yale does not, cannot, care in any meaningful sense. But it is compelled to do a more convincing impression than Mizzou. According to the Post , Yale's Salovey \"said he would continue to seek the input of students without placing the burden on them to repair the university.\" This is manifestly strange. Mizzou's student activists are not exacting apologies or incremental reforms, but, by organizing effectively, demanding and winning fundamental changes at the highest levels. Their students' tactical deployment of economic and social pressure is very deliberately anchored to the words- quoted by Concerned Student 1950 in a much-cited tweet -of Martin Luther King. Few have ever had much reason to expect results from the establishment. The tactics they employed were complex and well-considered. They had no choice but to be. Their demands were not only clear but far more attainable than many outside spectators supposed. The 56 black scholarship athletes at Missouri represent a constellation of backgrounds that, by and large, diverge deeply from Yale's median students. They are acutely aware that the burden is, in fact, on them to repair their university.\n\n\"The tensions at Yale,\" write Isaac Stanley-Becker and Susan Svrluga in The Washington Post , \"echo recent uprisings at colleges and schools around the country.\" The Post cites just one other university outcry to evidence a protest epidemic: the University of Missouri, where, in response to a wave of student action, university president Tim Wolfe stepped down on Monday. Wolfe was the public face, and often the ready defender, of the Missouri administration's failure to address pervasive campus racism. Yet the situation at Yale does not \"echo\" that of Missouri at all. Or that of Ole Miss, where a statue of James Meredith was vandalized last year with a noose and Confederate insignia, and where white students threw liquor and shouted slurs at a young black woman studying there; or the situation at Duke, where white students this year-wait for it- hung a noose from a tree and shouted racial slurs at a young black woman studying there. Black students at Mizzou have begun receiving death threats . This isn't to spark a round of Oppression Olympics: Disadvantaged students at Yale-caliber institutions experience daily object lessons on the well-intentioned ignorance and patrician paternalism of their classmates and professors. Their protests do touch on many elements of campus life. But institutional noblesse oblige is not all bad. Yale's endowment, which posted a stunning 20.2 percent return last year, stands at $24 billion , or nearly $2 million per student. This is put to some fine ends-including comparative institutional responsiveness, the kind that engenders certain expectations. Mizzou, by contrast, serves 35,400 students with $800 million in the bank. It literally cannot afford Yale's preoccupations: Money that could be spent on some further degree of, say, mental-health services is probably being spent on new gear for a football program that brings in $84 million yearly, more than one-tenth the endowment's value.

Before the Mizzou football strike changed the game, Yale's protests saw extensive coverage from The Washington Post , Gawker, Time , Slate, Reason , even Teen Vogue ; a full-bore explainer from Vox and the obligatory Huffington Post articles rounded out the mix. Gawker has Yale \"imploding over a Halloween email\" in its headline. Until Mizzou's athletes put their skin-and their institution's finances-in the game, Yale, a fraction the size, secured a more prominent spot in the news cycle simply by dint of its name. Why, until very recently, were the college beat's priorities so unabashedly bizarre? THE NATION IS READER FUNDED. YOUR SUPPORT IS VITAL TO OUR WORK. DONATE NOW! Perhaps because the world of magazine journalism and Internet thinkpieces has much more in common, demographically, with Yale's student body than with Mizzou's. Which campus battles resonate with, even come to the attention of, those in a position to cover collegiate institutional discrimination? Dan Savage being heckled at the University of Chicago , a general source of Internet vitriol also covered here , here and here , or the KKK, appearing armed two weeks ago at Ole Miss , a story which briefly flickered on the cycles of local news affiliates? Only now, with football at stake and Wolfe's resignation at hand, has discussion of Mizzou's race problem caught up. The Washington Post 's coverage of Yale protests is written by a current Yale senior , a relationship that should surprise exactly nobody. Online on Monday, the most recent piece about the Yale conflagration (one of three at the time) ranked as its second-most-popular article. Another ranked fourth. Two more have been published since. Attendance at a college like Yale-where nearly half this year's matriculating undergraduates attended private high schools, compared to 2 percent of the general population-follows on the breed of schooling that builds kids into walking résumés, honed to pass the filter of a 6.4 percent acceptance rate. It is an institution primed to lull students into seeking institutional remedy as a first resort and last demand, a natural expectation to harbor toward a body which presents itself, sometimes convincingly, as an omnipresent amalgam of mom, dad, and school-dance chaperone. Yale's students have been told that they will not be let down, without regard to race, faith, or culture. Their repeated demands of Nicholas Christakis and Dean Jonathan Holloway were initially for one thing: an apology. An administrative and institutional apology, an apology with official sanction, an apology with resignation as the price of refusal. Confirmation that Yale does, indeed, care . When that apology wasn't forthcoming, is it any wonder how they responded ? Students' demands and approaches to restitution at Mizzou stand in illuminating counterpoint to the Yale student body's reaction . How did Mizzou's students come to adopt elementally different strategies for addressing their campus crisis? Maybe because their collegiate experiences have not led them to expect institutional results. Maybe because they cannot count on the same proportion of white allies, and the consequent critical mass of campus support, while they constitute a sparse 7 percent of the student body. Maybe because \"accountability\" is another word for instilling fear in the prestige engine, a machine that operates very, very differently in and near the South than it does at Yale. Mizzou is situated in a thoroughly conservative part of the country, and its administration and student body reflect that reality. If nonwhite Mizzou undergraduates and graduates had any illusions about institutional responsiveness, exposure to campus rhetoric, administrative and otherwise, has disabused them by now. Yale does not, cannot, care in any meaningful sense. But it is compelled to do a more convincing impression than Mizzou. According to the Post , Yale's Salovey \"said he would continue to seek the input of students without placing the burden on them to repair the university.\" This is manifestly strange. Mizzou's student activists are not exacting apologies or incremental reforms, but, by organizing effectively, demanding and winning fundamental changes at the highest levels. Their students' tactical deployment of economic and social pressure is very deliberately anchored to the words- quoted by Concerned Student 1950 in a much-cited tweet -of Martin Luther King. Few have ever had much reason to expect results from the establishment. The tactics they employed were complex and well-considered. They had no choice but to be. Their demands were not only clear but far more attainable than many outside spectators supposed. The 56 black scholarship athletes at Missouri represent a constellation of backgrounds that, by and large, diverge deeply from Yale's median students. They are acutely aware that the burden is, in fact, on them to repair their university.\n\nOpen racism has a long history at Southern universities, and Mizzou, though in a border state, is no exception. In 1957, a young Martin Luther King Jr. spoke in St. Louis on Southern segregation. He was given second billing at the event to a \"moderate\" pastor, with whom he registered marked disagreement on the need for direct action-that man, Liston Pope, was then dean of Yale Divinity School.

      "text": "James Meredith and Ole Miss: Decade After a Bloody Insurrection\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Wayne King Special to The New York Times\n\nOXFORD, Miss., Sept. 30- The pool air of autumn is slow to come to the University of Mississippi, and the musky heat of summer lingers late over the campus as the students saunter past the stately buildings and great gray oaks.\n\nTen years after Army troops converged on this rolling, green campus to put down a bloody insurrection touched off by the count‐ordered enrollment of a 29‐year‐old Negro, James How ard Meredith, there are con trasts at Ole Miss.\n\nThe Stars and Bars of the Confederacy still wave over the campus, and some students still walk along Rebel and Confed erate Drives wearing tiny cari eatures of Colonel Rebel, the school's mythical mascot, whose task, one faculty member said, seems to be to \"reconstruct Mississippi in its own image.\"\n\nBut there are also an up raised fist on a black student's door and a likeness of Malcolm X in the window of the office of the Black Student Union.\n\nThere are no blacks on the varsity football team, but there are two on the freshman squad and at least one in the starting basketball line‐up.\n\nBlacks and whites coexist amiably but mingle little so cially.\n\nBy the standards of much of the rest of the country, there are many things that remain much the same at Ole Miss. But, given the events of 10 years ago, there has been dramatic progress.\n\nOn Sept. 13, I962, a Federal judge, after 16 months of de laying litigation by Mississippi officials, issued a final order to admit James Meredith to Ole Miss. On the same day, Gov. Ross R. Barnett said in a tele vision address to the people of Mississippi, \"We must either submit to the unlawful dictates of the Federal Government or stand up like men and tell them, 'Never!'\"\n\nNow, about 300 black stu dents attend the university and, in percentage terms, Ole Miss no longer lives up to its repu tation as the most segregated Southern university.\n\nEnrollment figures are not fully tabulated for this year, but those for last year showed a black enrollment of 3.5 per cent compared with the Univer sity of Alabama, 3.7; University of Arkansas, 3; Louisiana State, 2.7; University of South Caro lina, 3.2, and University of North Carolina, 2.8. South Caro lina estimates a black enroll ment of 5.1 per cent this year, North Carolina, 3.9, and the University of Georgia, 2.5.\n\n\"Most of the black students were routinely admitted,\" said Burnice Morris, editor of The Spectator, the black student newspaper at Ole Miss. \"I don't think there's discrimina tion as far as that goes. The biggest reason you don't have more blacks is that this place still seems like a planter's school-you know, the rich white kids-so blacks don't apply.\"\n\nJames Meredith was escorted onto the Oxford campus on a Sunday, the day after an Ole Miss football game at Jackson. The school band returned from Jackson in their traditional Confederate uniforms, and the Confederate battle flag, which doubles as the fighting colors of the Ole Miss Rebels, waved ubiquitously over the campus. Throughout the day, there were football‐type chants and cheers.\n\nTwo, four, six, eight,\n\nWe don't wanna integrate!\n\nTwo, one, four, three,\n\nWe hate Kennedy!\n\nThere were other cries, too: \"Where's the nigger? Get a rope!\"\n\nThere are no blacks yet on the varsity football team. It is a point of pride around the state that the team is all‐Missis sippi-and, for some, that it is all‐white. But that is changing, although the head coach, Billy Kinnard, doesn't like to talk about it.\n\n\"We don't have any black athletes at Ole Miss,\" he re torted when asked about the two black candidates for the freshman team. \"We don't have any white athletes, either. At Ole Miss, they're all just ath letes!\"\n\nThe basketball team was suc cessfully integrated last year with the addition of Coolidge Ball, a black player, to the starting line‐up.\n\n\"Coolidge Ball,\" a university public relations man said, \"is a good boy, a real good boy.\" He paused. \"I mean, a real good man.\"\n\nGerald Ulmer, a 19‐year‐old member of the team, like many blacks at the school, takes an indulgent view of race relations.\n\n\"I've gotten along very well with everybody, the coaches, the whites on the team. There was one incident that I remem ber. There was an argument and [a white player] called a black, you know, a nigger. Everybody tried to excuse it because he hadn't been around black people.very, much. But he had to know it was an insult. Maybe he just wanted to try it out to see What would hap pen.\n\nIn his first weeks at Ole Miss, James Meredith, referred to by most students as \"the nigger,\" was harassed and taunted al most continuously by students.\n\nA sixteen‐man patrol in four radio‐equipped jeeps was as signed to guard him at all times. Some students moni tored the radio calls and a code had to be employed to confuse them. For a time, Mr:Meredith's room was equipped with a switch to activate a red light atop his dormitory in case of trouble. The rooms of two stu dents who ate dinner with him in the cafeteria were broken into and wrecked. The words \"nigger lovers\" were scrawled in shoe polish next to their door. \"I am,\" Mr. Meredith said, \"the most segregated Negro in America.\"\n\nToday, black and white stu dents chat amiably, as often as hot about such things as grades and professors. \"Race,\" one white senior said, \"is no longer the most important thing in Mississippi.\" But a white junior conceded that he would \"just as soon not have so many Negroes.\"\n\n\"There is some interracial dating,\" James Evans, presi dent of the Black Student Union, said, \"but mostly the blacks and whites don't mix very much socially.\"\n\nBy and large, however, blacks and whites co‐exist amiably.\n\n\"When I first came here in 1969,\" Mr. Evans said, \"I ex pected some problems, but it was not as bad as I thought it would be. You'd walk by The Grill and you'd hear some racial slurs and some giggling, but nothing serious. There have been a few fights.\"\n\n\"The worst thing Is that it grinds you down,\" he added. \"You ask any black here what his problems are and he'll probably tell you: 'Man, this place is somthin'!\" That's all. This is Mississippi. You have the [Confederate] flags and the band playing \"Dixie\" and all that. I mean, nobody says any thing. They don't have to.\"\n\n\"Egypt,\" Governor Barnett told a meeting of the Citizens Council in Atlanta in 4963, \"was once one of the greatest nations of the world, with one of the greatest civilizations. But then the niggers came down the Nile and started going to school with them and dancing with them and marrying them. Now, what hind of country is Egypt today?\"\n\nNow 74 years old, Mr. Bar nett practices law in Jackson and remains as unreconstructed as ever. In a recent interview, he repeated almost verbatim the same view of Egyptian civilization.\n\nHe also offered the following observations on the past and present:\n\nOn the court order to admit Mr. Meredith to Ole Miss: \"I still say the Federal Govern ment has no more authority to take control of the school than the man in the moon.\"\n\nOn the Supreme Court: \"It was just a group of men that didn't know any better. They didn't know any law. They just came along and reversed the tradition and law of a hundred years.\"\n\n¶On race: \"I believe in racial integrity, the purity of the col ored and white races. A mon grel race is worthless.\"\n\n¶On a Negro acquaintance with whom he goes hunting: \"He's not the kind who pushes himself forward. He's a typical old‐time Negro-the kind who used to sit outside on the door step and pick a banjo and sing.\"\n\n¶On the changes in Mississip pi: \"The biggest change is that the public school system has deteriorated, and that's a sad thing. And the Federal Govern ment has taken away from the states the qualifications to vote. Now you don't have to be able to read or write nor own any property. In other words, you can be a tramp.\"\n\n¶On the Presidential race: \"I think Nixon will carry the state. I'll vote for him. McGov ern wants everybody to join his mainstream. Well, I think his mainsteam is too full of wiggle tails, tadpoles and snakes.\"\n\nIt is perhaps a measure of the change in Mississippi that Mr. Barnett's last venture into politics, as a candidate for a new term as Governor in 1967, was dismally unsuccessful. He ran fourth in a seven‐man pri mary with less than 10 per cent of the vote - even with the tongue‐in‐cheek endorsement of James Meredith himself.\n\nDescribed by a Federal judge as \"a man with a mission and a nervous stomach,\" James Meredith weathered his stormy months at Ole Miss with an aplomb and self‐possession that finally commanded grudging ac ceptance at the nation's last symbolic bastion of all‐out racial resistance.\n\nOn Aug. 18, 1963, Mr. Mere dith, who had slept through much of the rioting his presence precipitated nearly a year be fore, marched in the commence ment procession and became the first Negro to win a degree at the University of Mississippi.\n\nNow 39 years old and a vet eran of a series of erratic sor ties into and out of public life, James Meredith now lives with his wife and children in a rent ed house in Jackson, Miss.\n\nSince taking his degree at Ole Miss, Mr. Meredith has at tended Columbia University, where he earned a law degree, been shot down on a voters' march through Mississippi, un successfully attempted to raise a million dollars for the Mere dith Educational Fund, entered and suddenly withdrew from a race for Adam Clayton Powell's Congressional seat in Manhat tan, and, most recently, run un successfully for the Republican nomination for Governor of Mississippi.\n\nWearing a full beard and dressed in Army fatigues and combat boots, Mr. Meredith now says his racial experiences at the University of Mississippi are \"irrelevant to anything that is of any value to me now.\"\n\n\"For years,\" he said in an in terview, \"I was involved in ex tending freedom for black peo ple, broadening the role of blacks in an inferior position.\"\n\n\"Now,\" he said, \"I don't see any value in that. The only thing I'm interested in is fight ing for the whole thing, for total freedom. I don't think there is ever going to be any freedom for the black man as long as he is submerged in the white structure.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

Harris, had previously reached an agreement with federal prosecutors and pleaded guilty to a single count of using a threat of force to intimidate students because of their race.\n\nJudge Michael P. Mills of Federal District Court in Oxford, Miss., ordered Mr. Harris to surrender on Jan. 4, nearly 23 months after an inebriated Mr. Harris wanted to \"create a sensation on campus using a Confederate flag,\" according to a court filing.\n\nJoined by two other men, Mr. Harris went from the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity house to the plaza on the university campus where Mr. Meredith is honored. Once there, Judge Mills wrote, \"they draped an old Georgia state flag, which is partially comprised of a Confederate battle flag, and hung a rope around the neck of the statue.\"\n\n\"It's James Meredith,\" Mr. Harris said while the men planned the vandalism, according to another court document. \"People will go crazy.\"\n\nMr. Harris's lawyer, David G. Hill, said in a court filing that Mr. Harris felt he had been \"mistreated a few years earlier on the basis of his race.\" Mr. Harris's perceptions, the lawyer argued, were \"only exacerbated and heightened\" by the fraternity's racially charged environment.\n\nMr. Hill wrote that Mr. Harris \"was told by the fraternity leaders that no blacks were allowed in the house socially, that the only blacks allowed here are 'back there,'\" meaning in the kitchen.\n\n\"At the University of Mississippi, within the walls of the Sigma Phi Epsilon house, Graeme learned that blatant racism was not only O.K., it was expected,\" Mr. Hill wrote in a filing in which he asked that Mr. Harris be spared prison.\n\nBeaux Carriere, a spokesman for the fraternity's national office, said in an email on Thursday that Mr. Harris's \"allegations paint a picture that was not substantiated by our investigation.\"\n\n\"Members of the chapter attempted to intervene and advised the students not to go through with their plan,\" Mr. Carriere said. Mr. Harris's behavior, he added, was \"the antithesis of what our fraternity stands for and requires of its members.\"\n\nThe fraternity closed its chapter at the university in April 2014.\n\nIn a statement after Mr. Harris was sentenced, Brandi Hephner LaBanc, the university's vice chancellor for student affairs, said, \"The working relationship between the university and federal authorities very clearly affirms that offensive and illegal acts of this nature will not be tolerated on our campus.\"\n\nThe Justice Department said Thursday that its investigation was continuing.\n\nOne of Mr. Harris's friends was scheduled to plead guilty to a single charge on Wednesday, but that hearing was postponed. Another man named in court documents has not been charged.\n\nAdvertisement"

Joins Ole Miss Inquiry After Noose Is Left on Statue\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSupported by\n\nBy Alan Blinder\n\nOXFORD, Miss. - The Federal Bureau of Investigation said Tuesday that it had joined the inquiry into an act of vandalism at the University of Mississippi, where a statue of the university's first black student was found with a noose and a flag with the Confederate battle emblem.\n\nThe university authorities have said they are seeking two men in the episode, which happened early Sunday on the main campus in Oxford. The university has more than 22,000 students on campuses statewide, 24 percent of whom are minorities.\n\nA witness said the men screamed racial slurs as they defaced the statue of James Meredith, who was admitted in 1962 amid violence and after the intervention of the Kennedy administration.\n\n\"These individuals chose our university's most visible symbol of unity and educational accessibility to express their disagreement with our values,\" the university's chancellor, Daniel W. Jones, said in a statement . \"Their ideas have no place here, and our response will be an even greater commitment to promoting the values that are engraved on the statue - courage, knowledge, opportunity and perseverance.\"\n\nThe university's alumni association is offering a $25,000 reward to aid in the investigation, which the school characterized as \"rigorous.\"\n\nDeborah Madden, a spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Jackson, Miss., said that federal agents were assisting the university police in the inquiry.\n\nIt was the second high-profile act of intolerance on the campus this academic year. Last semester, the university was embarrassed after audience members used homophobic slurs at a performance of \"The Laramie Project,\" a production about the 1998 murder of a gay college student.\n\nThe university, known as Ole Miss, also drew attention in 2012 when a demonstration after President Obama's re-election disintegrated into a volley of racial epithets; two students were arrested.\n\nBut on Tuesday afternoon, there were few outward signs of dissonance at Ole Miss as scores of students and employees staged a quickly planned vigil at the statue of Mr. Meredith, which was dedicated in 2006. Students held signs with messages that included, \"The actions done in the cowardly dark will never diminish the light of James Meredith's legacy nor our creed.\" Someone had also placed a rose at the statue before the vigil.\n\nWillie Toles Jr., a biology major, said he was startled by the attackers' approach.\n\n\"I'm still kind of in shock at the tactics that some people try to use, either to try to intimidate or to provoke a reaction from the university,\" said Mr. Toles, who is black. \"What motive do you have for doing these types of things?\"\n\nThe demonstrators, who gathered mere hours after students began planning the event, said they wanted to send a message.\n\n\"This has happened here before, so people think that they can just do it,\" said Ashley Cummins, a general studies major who is white and who helped to organize the demonstration. \"We do care what they do, and there need to be consequences.\"\n\nAdvertisement"

      "text": "The Unhealed Wounds of a Mass Arrest of Black Students at Ole Miss, Fifty Years Later\n\nLate in the afternoon of February 24, 1970, in the University of Mississippi cafeteria, forty students of the recently chartered Black Student Union (B.S.U.) lined up in front of the cafeteria before it opened for dinner. The forty protesters grabbed their food, and each of them took over a separate table as the white students stared back at them silently, or left their seats, or placed their trays on the cafeteria's conveyor belt and walked out. Kenneth Mayfield, then a second-year student, grabbed his mini stereo, and the students found themselves eating to the strains of Eldridge Cleaver's cry for Black Power on \"Soul on Wax.\" The B.S.U. members had already attempted a form of protest. Members of the B.S.U. presented a list of twenty-seven demands to the university's chancellor, Porter L. Fortune, Jr.; the demands included hiring black faculty, forming a black-studies program, establishing more scholarships for black students, and eliminating Confederate imagery at official university gatherings. Next, the group brought a Confederate flag-then an unofficial symbol of the university-into the cafeteria, where they burned it. (In 1972, abuse of the Confederate flag was illegal in Mississippi, though this law was largely unenforced.)\n\nUndaunted, the B.S.U. members moved from the cafeteria to the Ole Miss campus-security office to file a complaint. \"They handed each one of us a form, and we filled it out,\" Mayfield said. \"I put my name on the form,\" he said, \"and I wrote the source of my complaint, in bold print, as 'racism.' \" His classmates did the same. It was one of those balmy days in Mississippi in late winter, just before spring arrives. Again, white students happening past mostly ignored the protesters.\n\nThe evening after the cafeteria protest and flag-burning, Mayfield recalled, \"We were in a Black Student Union meeting and somebody commented, 'We've got a group that's performing right here in Mississippi-it is international and interracial.' \" The group was Up with People, the wholesome and positive travelling revue. In the spur of the moment, the students-sixty-one in all-decided to march to Fulton Chapel, where admission to the Up with People concert was two dollars. \"I remember somebody saying, 'Step aside, we've already paid our dues-we're going in,' \" Mayfield said. Once inside, where Up with People had already taken the stage, the B.S.U. members started to chant, \"What you gonna do? Do it to him. What you gonna do? Do it to him\"-the \"him\" being the Ole Miss administration. Soon Up with People invited the protesters to join them onstage, where the students offered a Black Power salute. A few began grabbing the microphones. As the musical group launched into one of their most famous songs, \"What Color Is God's Skin?\" (\"Black, brown, it's yellow, it's red, it is white. / Every man's the same in the good Lord's sight.\"), Mayfield tried to yell into a microphone, \"He sure ain't white, he sure ain't white.\"\n\nJust before they headed to Fulton Chapel, Mayfield recalled, the protesters acknowledged the possibility that they could be arrested for their impromptu action. A year before, eight white students had been jailed for protesting mandatory R.O.T.C., and after their arrest they were placed on probation for the remainder of their time at the university. Mayfield remembered telling his friends, \"The worst-case scenario: you get a little probation. You don't get kicked out of school.\"\n\nAt the time of the Up with People protest, more than seven years had passed since James Meredith became the first black student to enroll at Ole Miss, in 1962, after a legal battle that reached the Supreme Court, and over the objections of Mississippi's governor and state legislature. President John F. Kennedy's Administration ordered five hundred U.S. marshals to insure Meredith's safety as he arrived on campus and added military police and troops from the Mississippi National Guard and the U.S. Border Patrol when he learned there needed to be additional support. Two days of rioting ensued, leading to two deaths and some two hundred injuries. Much of the rioting was concentrated around University Circle; there, the grounds are dominated by the Greek columns and red brick of the Lyceum building, which was constructed with slave labor. A gray-stone Confederate soldier stands in the Lyceum's shadow, and, in 1962, it served as a rallying point for those opposed to integration of the university. Now, fifty years after the B.S.U. delivered its demands for the elimination of Confederate imagery, the monument will be moved to a Confederate cemetery elsewhere on campus, pending the final approval of the university's governing board.\n\nThen, and even today, many Ole Miss students and alumni wished to preserve the campus as a simulacrum of Southern exceptionalism-a memorial to the Lost Cause. Confederate-heritage groups still tour the campus, pointing out the old marching grounds of the University Greys, a Civil War regiment formed by Ole Miss students in 1861. The state's white-power structure emphasized the university's link to secession as a shield that made black students feel unwelcome and unlikely to enroll. It is something I felt when I arrived, as a freshman, in 1974, four years after the Up with People protest and twelve years after Meredith walked up the blood-stained steps of the Lyceum to register for classes. Two months before the Up with People protest, M. M. Roberts, the president of the governing board of the university system of Mississippi, acknowledged in a public speech that he was a racist. \"Every time I read a definition, I say, Well, that's me,\" Roberts said. \"I have no apologies for it, though. . . . But it's my philosophy. Many of you don't share that philosophy and it doesn't bother me. . . . I don't share yours.\"\n\nThere were fewer than two hundred black students enrolled at Ole Miss in 1970, among a population of some seven thousand students, and they had grown weary and impatient in the face of persistent racist harassment: threatening notes pushed under their doors, loud knocks in the middle of the night, accompanied by taunts and racial slurs, physical intimidation. \"I remember being on my way to class one day, and some big football-looking guys blocked the sidewalk,\" Donald Cole, a participant in the Up with People protest, said. \"It had been raining, and it was muddy. When I came upon them, I knew I couldn't proceed, and the only option was to get off the sidewalk, walk in the mud. Of course, I was alone. So that's the path that I chose, as opposed to a more violent one.\"\n\nIt is difficult to imagine anyone wanting to threaten Don Cole, who has a bright, wide smile and speaks with a gentle Southern lilt. He is tall and slender, of regal bearing, and, at the age of sixty-nine, his face is unwrinkled and youthful. But if you ask him to remember the events of fifty years ago, his face contorts, and he seems to age before your eyes. An encounter with Cole provides an answer to the question that W. E. B. Du Bois asks in \" The Souls of Black Folk \": \"How does it feel to be a problem?\"\n\nIn 1969, Frank Moak, then the dean of students, wrote that black students at Ole Miss \"come bearing feelings that have been pent up for years and years and possibly centuries. Suddenly these feelings are heaped on the shoulders of this generation, making them feel they have a mission to change radically the whole structure of society to accommodate the anxieties they have been subjected to.\" Moak encouraged black students to be patient. The same year, in an article in the Memphis Commercial Appeal , he said, \"Problems are only compounded when black students eliminate completely from their vocabulary the word 'patience' and substitute the word 'now.' \"\n\nMoak was making an oblique reference to the Black Power movement. For the Ole Miss students, however, black power-as a concept, as a slogan-did not mean violence and separatism. It simply meant recognition and awareness of their presence at a university that wanted to act as though they weren't there.\n\n\"As a black person at Ole Miss, your presence was just tolerated,\" Theron Evans, who was a freshman participant in the Up with People protest, said. To be black on campus was to be somehow hyper-conspicuous and invisible at once. Activists complained that the campus newspaper, the Daily Mississippian , left black students with \"no voice at all\" in the six years following James Meredith's admission. In February, 1970, Jesse Dent, a B.S.U. organizer, told the paper, \"To get any changes made, any organization, not just the Black Student Union, should keep the administration in a state of alarm at all times. . . . Then they'll finally do something.\" Mayfield said that Ole Miss, in part, turned him \"from a conformist-type Negro to a black person on a mission.\"\n\nCole recalled that he admired Stokely Carmichael, who succeeded John Lewis as head of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and was a founder of the Black Power movement. \"Stokely was admired by all of us in the Black Student Union because he seemed to get more respect with his loud and demanding approach than we did with our written demands,\" Cole said. None of the students I interviewed remembered a particular political philosophy that informed their actions; they simply agreed that they were tired of being ignored.\n\nThe sound engineers at Fulton Chapel cut the microphones during \"What Color Is God's Skin?\" Members of the audience told the protesters that the Mississippi Highway Patrol had the building surrounded. \"My name is Chief Stringer,\" a man who greeted them outside, on the steps of the chapel, said. The other highway patrolmen on the scene were holding rifles. \"I'm in charge here,\" Mayfield remembers him saying, \"and all of you are under arrest.\" They were accused of breach of peace and trespassing, the latter charge despite the fact that they were all tuition-paying Ole Miss students.\n\nAt the height of the civil-rights movement, in 1964, the Mississippi state legislature passed a bill that gave the Highway Patrol massive police powers to intervene in protests, even allowing the governor to order them into situations without the request of local authorities. On the night of Up with People, the protesters wondered how the Highway Patrol had managed to arrive at Fulton Chapel so fast-no more than fifteen minutes after the protest had commenced, according to the students.\n\nA recently declassified F.B.I. file reveals that the B.S.U. was placed under the Bureau's surveillance soon after its founding, in 1968. The F.B.I. sought to \"expeditiously conduct\" an investigation to determine the identity of the leaders of the B.S.U., and also \"any extremist, especially leaders and develop background regarding each.\" (Kenneth Mayfield, for example, is described in the F.B.I. file as \"a loud, boisterous, and outspoken student who leans toward the 'black power' leadership.\") In addition to the F.B.I. surveillance, the students were also being monitored by the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, a homegrown spy agency that existed primarily to curb public protest in the state. In an internal memo from May, 1969, J. Edgar Hoover recommended placing informants inside the B.S.U. By November of the same year, the F.B.I. had one informant inside the group-his or her name is redacted in the file-and was looking for more. It is likely that, on the night of the Up with People protest, the informant tipped off the Ole Miss police department, who then called the Highway Patrol.\n\nNews of the protest and arrests moved across campus fast. Soon eighteen other black students gathered nearby in solidarity. Ten others staged a protest at the home of Chancellor Fortune. All of them were arrested, too. \"If you were black and walking around the Ole Miss campus in the aftermath of that event, you were arrested,\" John C. Brittain, the attorney who represented the protesters, said. Forty-nine of the students that evening found themselves locked inside the Lafayette County jail after their arrest. The remaining forty were taken on an hour-plus-long bus ride to the notorious Parchman Farm Penitentiary, in the heart of the Mississippi Delta, a place synonymous with crime and punishment in Mississippi. It was at Parchman, in a section of the prison known as Little Alcatraz, where the state of Mississippi placed the Freedom Riders, in 1961, and later other civil-rights protesters for a \"breach of peace,\" the same charge that had been levied against the Ole Miss students. (Earlier that month, a group of eight hundred and ninety-four students from the nearby Mississippi Valley State College had been jailed at Parchman, for protesting their campus living conditions and the quality of instruction at the college; the Times called this roundup \"the greatest mass arrest ever conducted on an American campus.\")\n\nRight up to the moment when he stepped inside the police cruiser, Mayfield recalled, he remained focussed on how the group's actions would attract attention to their cause. \"What better publicity could you get than the publicity we were getting right then? My feeling was that we would get attention for the arrest, standing up for a good cause,\" he said.\n\nThe following day, the front page of the Daily Mississippian carried a picture of the protest, under the headline \"Eighty-nine Blacks Arrested.\" The faces of eight student protesters-a few of them with fists raised in Black Power salutes, and again identified in the caption only as \"blacks\"-were visible in the photograph.\n\nAt age seventy-five, John Brittain is fit and trim, a nationally ranked masters runner. In 1970, he was fresh out of Howard University Law School. As an undergraduate there, he befriended Stokely Carmichael and immersed himself in civil-rights activism on campus, and he had just taken a job with North Mississippi Rural Legal Services, which served clients who lived below the poverty line. Late that February evening, he found himself representing all eighty-nine Ole Miss students. \"The principle in both domestic and international law is called collective punishment,\" Brittain said. \"The arrest that evening was illegal because there's no probable cause against any one of them, but they did it figuring if they arrest everybody, somebody is bound to tell them something.\"\n\nThe students in the county jail were released after about twenty-four hours, and the students at Parchman after just under forty-eight. Hoping to clog up the system enough to get the charges dropped, Brittain pushed for a separate jury trial for each student. The strategy worked, and the local prosecutor dropped the charges. But the students were still subject to disciplinary hearings for violating the Ole Miss code of conduct. \"And I jammed that up, too, by requesting an evidentiary hearing in every one of those cases,\" Brittain said. Eighty-one of the students were suspended for one day and placed on academic probation, without hearings. The remaining eight students were marked as the ring leaders, because of photographic evidence capturing them onstage at Fulton Chapel: Cole, Evans, Mayfield, John Donald, Paul Jackson, Alva Peyton, Henrieese Roberts, and Linnie Willis (née Liggins). \"This should asure [ sic ] that they won't be involved in any more disturbance,\" a Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission investigator wrote in March, 1970.\n\n\"We did not have any weapons, and our protest was completely nonviolent,\" Willis, who was a senior at the time, recalled. Like Mayfield, she was sent to the Lafayette County jail that night. \"I went to jail in my home town, not at Parchman; that was worse, since I became a marked person and could never be employed in Oxford.\" By the time she was expelled, Willis had completed all of the requirements to earn her bachelor's degree, but Ole Miss would not give her a diploma. Since she could not find work in Oxford, she moved North, settling in Toledo, Ohio, where she worked in public-housing advocacy for thirty-four years.\n\n\"The whole situation caused me to change the entire direction of my life,\" Willis said. \"We were committed to trying to change the atmosphere at Ole Miss and have black students feel at home. We all made a huge sacrifice.\"\n\nAmong the eight students who were expelled, there are two doctors and four lawyers, including Mayfield and John Donald, a Memphis civil-court judge. And there is Donald Cole, who returned to Ole Miss to attain his Ph.D. in mathematics and went on to become a math professor and administrator at the university. \"At the time of our leaving Ole Miss, so united, I had no idea of what the future would hold for anybody,\" Cole said. After their expulsion, at the end of the school year, Cole and Mayfield, who have sustained a lifelong friendship, moved to Gary, Indiana, where they worked together in a steel mill and applied to other colleges. Within a few months, they were admitted to Tougaloo College, in Jackson, a school with a record of civil-rights activism, and where they completed their undergraduate degrees. Eventually, both would attend the University of Michigan, where Mayfield would earn a law degree and Cole a master's in mathematics. After graduating from Michigan, Mayfield returned to Mississippi to work as a civil-rights attorney.\n\nCole returned to Ole Miss to pursue his doctorate, but had difficulty talking about the events of 1970. \"It was as if it was a dark side of life that should be kept hidden,\" he said. \"I felt I had done wrong and should feel guilty about that part of my past.\n\n\"There was a risk in coming back, and something worse would happen,\" Cole continued. \"But when I came here the first time, I was representing more than myself.\" Why did he return to Ole Miss? \"I'm often asked that question, and I have never been able to give a good answer, even to myself,\" he said. \"I had never failed at anything, and I had come here to get a degree, and I had failed to get a degree.\" Cole felt that he had left in disgrace, with what he called \"a jail certificate\" instead of a diploma. Returning gave him \"another shot at redeeming myself.\" After Cole received his doctorate, he worked in the aerospace industry, and eventually on the faculty of Florida A. & M. University. Then Ole Miss called him to come back to work in its administration. \"I felt that I had to work to make this institution something to be proud of,\" he said.\n\nThis week, Cole will join some of his fellow B.S.U. activists, including five of the eight expelled students who have agreed to attend, on the Ole Miss campus for a fiftieth-anniversary commemoration of the protests. \"This is more than a story that needs to be told,\" Garrett Felber, a University of Mississippi history professor who initiated the anniversary events, said. \"It represents intergenerational trauma and community harm that needs to be repaired.\" What repair might look like to the University of Mississippi remains uncertain. Mayfield and Theron Evans both told me that they want some sense of \"closure.\" And Willis recently received a call from the provost, telling her that she will finally receive the diploma she earned fifty years ago.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Bribe\n\nThe most exuberant football rally at the University of Mississippi last year occurred four days after the season ended, when the school's chancellor, Robert Khayat, announced the hiring of a new head football coach. A cheering overflow crowd at the school's Center for the Performing Arts welcomed Houston Nutt, whom the university had somehow lured to Oxford from the Cotton Bowl-bound Arkansas Razorbacks (who had defeated Ole Miss, as the university is nicknamed, 44-8).\n\nFor Ole Miss, a relatively small public school in a poor state, a seven-and-a-half-million-dollar deal (as was reportedly given to Nutt) seemed an implausible splurge, and some sensed the hand of a private benefactor. Khayat acknowledged as much in his opening remarks, pronouncing himself \"profoundly grateful to Dick Scruggs,\" whose jet had been used as a shuttle during negotiations. Scruggs was arguably the most successful tort lawyer in America, and a deeply interested Ole Miss football fan. Dickie, as he was called, even by those who'd never met him, hated to lose; whenever an Ole Miss coaching change was rumored, fans tracked Scruggs's plane on the Internet, for hints about where the school was looking. If Houston Nutt needed a deal sweetener, Dickie Scruggs, the man who took down Big Tobacco without conducting a single trial, probably had something to do with providing it.\n\nBut Robert Khayat was grateful to Scruggs for other reasons, too. Khayat became chancellor in 1995, with the mission of liberating Ole Miss from its past-a perilous ambition at a place where the past was so insistently present. Into the nineteen-sixties, Ole Miss embodied an idealized antebellum South. There were plenty of black people on campus, but they were caring for the immaculate green-the magnolia-lined Grove-or serving the sons and daughters of the state's white establishment in their Greek-revival sorority and fraternity houses. The school's nickname was itself a slave term for the mistress of a plantation. Students dressed for games as if going to church, and cheerleaders tossed bundles of Rebel flags into the stands before the start of each game as the band played a rousing version of \"Dixie.\"\n\nWhen, in 1962, the federal government forced the enrollment of the first black student at the university, James Meredith, Ole Miss became a national symbol of white Southern resistance to the civil-rights movement. The U.S. Marshals accompanying Meredith were pelted with rocks and bottles, and, eventually, were targets of sniper fire. Two people were killed, and more than three hundred injured, before federal troops ended the riots. Burke Marshall, the head of the civil-rights division of the Kennedy Justice Department, called the episode \"the final gasp of the Civil War.\"\n\nBy the time Khayat became chancellor, the school's endowment and enrollment had seriously declined. Khayat aggressively raised funds, cultivated allies in the academic establishment, and went to work on the school's image. Rebel flags largely disappeared from the football stands, \"Dixie\" was downplayed, and the school's mascot-Colonel Reb-was banished from the playing field. In thirteen years under Khayat, the school's endowment has quintupled, enrollment has increased by about fifty per cent, and, along with the old statue of the Confederate soldier, a bronze sculpture commemorating James Meredith now holds an honored place on the campus.\n\nThe transformation at Ole Miss aroused a good deal of opposition, and would not have happened without support from key alumni, among the most important of whom was Dickie Scruggs. Although he is the brother-in-law of the former Republican Senator Trent Lott-the two men's wives are sisters-Scruggs, who is sixty-one, is a staunch Democrat, and shares Khayat's progressive vision for the school. A few years after Scruggs hit his first litigation jackpot, in 1993, taking on asbestos companies, he asked Khayat what he could do for the university. Khayat, who is seventy, had known Scruggs for most of his life. He had been his ninth-grade homeroom teacher in Pascagoula, and was on the faculty at Ole Miss Law School when Scruggs was a student there. The Chancellor told Scruggs that faculty salaries in the College of Liberal Arts were pitifully low, and Scruggs immediately made a twenty-five-million-dollar pledge. After his tobacco victory, in 1997, he coaxed his partner in that effort, an Ole Miss alum named David Nutt, to expand his own contribution. Ole Miss professors have since received several generous pay increases. In 2005, the music building, across from the Performing Arts Center, was renamed Scruggs Hall.\n\nScruggs was not present in November when Khayat publicly thanked him for his help in the coaching search. That morning, a federal grand jury in Oxford returned an indictment charging Scruggs, his son, Zach, and three other men with conspiring to offer a fifty-thousand-dollar bribe to a judge in Calhoun City. That afternoon, Scruggs was fingerprinted, processed, and arraigned.\n\nThe reaction to the indictment was incredulity. Scruggs had achieved rare standing among trial lawyers-as a visionary, whose extravagant fee awards allowed him to discount, with some credibility, money as his prime motivation. He was said to have scored a billion-dollar fee in the tobacco case. Why would he bother with a tawdry little bribery scam? Some speculated that the Bush Justice Department was trying to eliminate a prominent Democratic donor-invitations to a Hillary Clinton fund-raiser hosted by Scruggs, featuring an appearance by Bill Clinton, had recently been mailed. Others guessed that one of the indicted figures had been caught in a crime and was trying to win leniency by blaming Scruggs.\n\n\"I'm rarely at a loss for words, but I am at a complete loss about it,\" said Jack Palladino, the San Francisco private investigator, who worked with Scruggs in the tobacco wars and came away an admirer. \"It can't be that he needed the money. I just don't know what to say about it.\"\n\nScruggs and his classmates at Ole Miss Law benefitted from a custom called \"diploma privilege,\" under which the school's graduates were admitted to the Mississippi bar without having to pass the state exam. This practice (which ended in the nineteen-eighties) heightened the striking insularity of the Mississippi bar, a community of lawyers who mostly know one another, often because they were vetted by the same contracts professor during first-year law at Ole Miss. Seven of the nine justices on Mississippi's Supreme Court attended Ole Miss Law School, as did Governor Haley Barbour and both of the state's U.S. senators. Professional and personal relationships within this group are easily tangled. John Grisham, a friend of Scruggs's, was a classmate of one of Scruggs's prosecutors, U.S. Attorney Jim Greenlee (and they both sat through Professor Khayat's class). Barbour, one of Scruggs's fraternity brothers, was his adversary in the tobacco fight. Mississippi lawyers keep score, counting each other's divorces and courtroom outcomes. Scruggs is not the only one of them to have been portrayed in the movies (\"The Insider\"), or to pilot his own jet, but he is the only lawyer notable for both distinctions. Many also insist that, although Scruggs is Mississippi's most famous trial lawyer, he never really was a \"trial\" lawyer at all.\n\n\"I can assure you he hasn't tried ten cases to verdict in his life,\" Bill Reed, a Jackson attorney who is one of Scruggs's closest friends, says. \"But he is the master of the deal.\"\n\nScruggs finished near the top of his class at Ole Miss Law, and was recruited into the Jackson law firm headed by one of his heroes-William Winter, the leader of the progressive wing of the state's Democrats, and a future governor of the state. It was a terrible fit for Scruggs, as was his brief stay at the next big Jackson firm he tried. He was, by that time, married to Diane Thompson, a dentist's daughter from Pascagoula, and he had served five years as a Navy pilot, flying A-6 attack planes from the decks of aircraft carriers. Within the disciplined hierarchy of the U.S. Navy, fighter-pilot culture is a thing apart, attracting the sort of personalities that warrant nicknames like Maverick. Scruggs is inclined to go his own way, and did. He moved to Pascagoula and opened a law office, in a former drugstore.\n\nPascagoula, on the eastern end of the Mississippi Gulf Coast, is an industrial town in the most cosmopolitan region of the state, and it was the nearest thing to a home town that Scruggs had known. He was born in 1946 in Brookhaven, up in the Piney Woods. (\"We were so poor,\" he likes to say, \"that if I hadn't been a boy, I wouldn't have had anything to play with.\") His father, Tom Scruggs, left when Dickie was five, and his mother, Helen, eventually found work as a secretary at the Ingalls shipyard, in Pascagoula. Dickie lived there for four years before going to a military school in Georgia, on a scholarship. Now back in Pascagoula, where his mother still lived, Scruggs made his first fortune from the Ingalls shipyard.\n\nIn the nineteen-eighties, the growth field for tort lawyers was asbestos litigation. Inhalation of asbestos fibres had been linked to dire diseases, and lawyers, inevitably, had uncovered documentation that asbestos manufacturers knew of the material's dangers for decades, without issuing warnings. Workplaces such as Ingalls, where asbestos was used in shipbuilding, produced whole populations of sick plaintiffs. Joining the rush of lawyers signing clients, Scruggs hit upon a competitive edge. Standard practice was to sign only clients with medical evidence of disease (such as an X-ray); Scruggs offered to pay the costs of a potential client's visit to a clinic, and to accept the case if the tests returned positive. He soon had hundreds of clients.\n\nLink copied\n\nThe problem for Scruggs and other plaintiffs' lawyers was getting their clients' cases into court. In a product-liability case, the plaintiff had to prove that the manufacturer knew that asbestos was harmful or failed to properly investigate the danger, and that the plaintiff was exposed to the material and harmed by it. The litigation of one case could take years, and a deep-pocketed defendant could extend the process for as long as possible, and then settle the case just before trial. \"It would typically cost more to litigate that one case than you could ever hope to recover for the total damage in the case,\" says Danny Cupit, a Jackson lawyer who in 1982 helped win the first asbestos case in Mississippi, against Johns-Manville. By the time one case was resolved, hundreds more had been brought. \"If it took you three years to get a case up for trial, and there were hundreds of cases being filed each year, the court could never keep up with that.\"\n\nScruggs found that his cases were far down on the court docket, stacked behind those of Danny Cupit and other lawyers who had filed earlier. Again, he devised an edge. He persuaded a Pascagoula state-court judge, a populist who was sympathetic to the sick workers, to allow him to consolidate a mass of cases, and to split the traditional litigation process into two phases. The first phase would test only the general liability of the manufacturer: was asbestos harmful, did the manufacturer know it, and were plaintiffs exposed? If the answer to each question was yes, then a series of mini-trials would follow, determining the damages to be paid to the individual plaintiffs. This formulation raised the stakes tremendously for the defendant, because one bad verdict would multiply across all the cases.\n\n\"This is where the Scruggs approach was unique,\" Cupit says. \"The risk to a defendant of having liability imposed on several hundred cases was a risk that was more than that defendant wanted to reasonably bear. It created an atmosphere to settle the cases.\" The asbestos companies caved.\n\nScruggs's innovation helped to open the litigation floodgates in Mississippi, and the state became a principal battleground in the national political fight over tort reform. Mississippi has an elected judiciary, and, as settlement money rolled in, the plaintiffs bar began investing it in the campaigns of plaintiff-minded judges. Lawyers would then shop for friendly jurisdictions. Jefferson County (pop. 9,740) became so attractive to the tort bar that seventy-three mass-action lawsuits, representing more than three thousand plaintiffs, were filed there in 2000. The American Tort Reform Association calls such tortious hot spots \"judicial hellholes.\" Scruggs called them \"magic jurisdictions.\" In a panel discussion hosted by Prudential Financial in 2002, Scruggs explained the development:\n\nThe trial lawyers have established relationships with the judges that are elected; they're State Court judges; they're populists. They've got large populations of voters who are in on the deal, they're getting their piece in many cases. And so, it's a political force in their jurisdiction, and it's almost impossible to get a fair trial if you're a defendant in some of these places. . . . The cases are not won in the courtroom. They're won on the back roads long before the case goes to trial. Any lawyer fresh out of law school can walk in there and win the case, so it doesn't matter what the evidence or the law is. The major asbestos companies were bankrupted, and the tort bar turned to pharmaceutical companies, filing lawsuits on behalf of clients who were not always legitimately injured parties. \"This is what I call the abusive phase,\" Cupit says, \"or what some others call killing the goose that laid the golden egg.\" The U.S. Chamber of Commerce and big business began pouring money into the campaigns of industry-friendly judges, and into those of politicians who promised tort reform. Haley Barbour made the issue a priority after he was elected governor, in 2003. The Mississippi legislature passed his tort-reform program, which severely limited liability.\n\nScruggs did not join the Big Pharma frenzy. He prefers only \"primary kills,\" he said in a 2002 interview with the magazine Chief Executive . \"I don't want to get there after the antelope has been brought down.\"\n\nScruggs began to formulate his own brand of litigation, entrepreneurial and boldly speculative, of which the actual practice of law was only one part. The strategic manipulation of politics and public opinion was just as important to this enterprise-\"a three-legged stool,\" as Scruggs described it to colleagues. By exerting pressure at key points, he could see to it that defenses collapsed and opponents settled without a jury ever having a say. He created a sort of floating legal syndicate, with changing players (only some of whom were lawyers) chosen as needed for a particular skill or connection.\n\nThe most important player in Scruggs's informal syndicate was his law-school classmate Mike Moore, the attorney general of Mississippi. Moore was another Pascagoulan, a crusading prosecutor who was part of a team of young progressives swept into statewide office in 1988. Moore and Scruggs contrived a means of exploiting the asbestos issue to their mutual benefit. Moore, as the top legal officer of the state, hired Scruggs, on a contingency basis, to press the asbestos industry to pay for removal of the material from public places. Scruggs prevailed, and was paid several million dollars for his effort.\n\nThe asbestos model proved useful when Moore, early in his second term, went after the manufacturers of cigarettes. He had received a call from another Ole Miss Law classmate, Michael Lewis, an attorney in Clarksdale, who proposed that the State of Mississippi sue tobacco companies in order to recover the enormous Medicaid costs and other state costs spent on health care for sick smokers. Big Tobacco had for decades loomed as the unattainable prize for trial lawyers: despite the overwhelming evidence of the hazards of tobacco, plaintiffs had never won damages against the industry. Tobacco's principal defense was \"assumed risk\"-the argument that, even if cigarettes did cause harm (an assertion the tobacco companies did not fully concede), smokers assumed all risk by deciding to smoke. That defense could not be used against a state, which had no choice in the matter of paying smokers' Medicaid costs.\n\nMoore deputized Scruggs to develop a Medicaid suit, which Moore filed in Pascagoula in May, 1994. (Scruggs later remarked that it was like having a chance to be the first man to scale Mt. Everest.) The suit's premise was innovative, but more important was the contribution of two tobacco insiders, who guided Scruggs and Moore to the industry's pressure points. The first was Merrell Williams, a former paralegal at a Kentucky law firm that had been hired by Brown & Williamson, the producer of Kool and Viceroy cigarettes, to review potentially incriminating internal documents. The material included evidence that the company had known of tobacco's addictive and injurious effects for at least thirty years, and had hidden the information from the public. Williams clandestinely removed documents from the firm, and ultimately hid them at a friend's house in Florida while he tried to find a way to bring the information to light. But the theft was soon discovered, and a judge ordered the material sealed and returned. Williams and his documents became untouchable (he vainly approached several attorneys and journalists), until he met Dickie Scruggs. Scruggs flew with him to Florida on his jet, and retrieved the purloined documents. Williams was out of work, and homeless; Scruggs moved him to the Gulf Coast, found him housing and a boat, and paid him thousands of dollars in what he called \"loans.\"\n\n\"Dick didn't get where he got by asking permission,\" one Scruggs ally said. \"He got where he got by counting on asking for forgiveness, if he needed to.\"\n\nThe second tobacco insider was Jeffrey Wigand, a former Brown & Williamson scientist who also had incriminating information, and who could serve as an interpreter of the Williams documents. But Wigand had signed a seemingly airtight confidentiality agreement after he took a buyout from the company. Scruggs offered Wigand his legal services without charge, and helped facilitate Wigand's appearance in a controversial segment of the CBS broadcast \"60 Minutes.\"\n\nAny evidence and testimony provided by Williams and Wigand in a trial would certainly be contested as hopelessly tainted, but, if the Scruggs formula succeeded, a trial would be avoided. Scruggs and Moore spent nearly two years travelling around the country, lobbying other state attorneys general to file their own tobacco lawsuits. The team also worked the corridors of Congress and the Clinton White House, trying to fashion a national tobacco settlement. The team had added other lawyers to the effort, but Scruggs was paying most of the bills, and by 1996 he was beginning to feel the strain.\n\n\"I was risking a career,\" Moore recalls. \"But he was risking all his money. And when I say 'all his money,' what people don't know is, he put all his money in. I mean, all his money. Mortgaged his house. He was all in.\"\n\nScruggs approached other members of the plaintiffs bar, offering a piece of the tobacco action in exchange for an advance investment to defray expenses. Few agreed. Finally, Scruggs made an irresistible offer to a prosperous Jackson asbestos attorney, David Nutt, who pledged several million to the effort, in return for a share of potential fees equalling Scruggs's.\n\nThe Mississippi Medicaid case was set for trial in July, 1997. By then, the national mood had become sharply antitobacco, and the industry decided to buy peace. The case was settled for nearly four billion dollars, and was followed by settlements in Minnesota, Texas, and Florida. Four tobacco companies split the cost. The tobacco industry eventually reached settlements with the attorneys general in the remaining forty-six states. In all, the industry agreed to pay two hundred and forty-six billion dollars to the states over twenty-five years, in return for freedom from future state lawsuits. Scruggs's fee over twenty-five years is estimated at close to a billion dollars.\n\nThree days after the federal grand jury indicted Dickie and Zach Scruggs, along with their law partner, Sidney Backstrom, and two associates, the Scruggs family hosted one of the biggest social events of Oxford's holiday season, a Christmas party attended by more than two hundred people. When guests arrived at the Scruggses' home, they were greeted by Dickie and Diane as if nothing were amiss.\n\n\"They did a pretty good job of carrying it off,\" one guest recalls. \"Diane looked a little pained, but Dickie put his brave face on.\" The guest list comprised the Oxford élite, who fully understood the game. \"Everybody was very much aware, but nobody was talking about it,\" one friend recalls. \"Everybody was trying to make a point of dealing with other things.\" By the end of the night, the party had achieved something like actual holiday gaiety.\n\nSuch evenings were a large part of the reason that Scruggs had moved to Oxford from Pascagoula, four years earlier. The town had changed drastically since Scruggs attended Ole Miss, when Oxford was a dull, provincial place known mostly for William Faulkner and the national ignominy of the integration riots. Students nicknamed it Oxpatch.\n\nLink copied\n\nBut as baby boomers prospered and began sending their children to Ole Miss, they bought apartments and built condos near campus for use during football weekends; the large pregame tailgate parties in the Grove came to feature barbecue suppers served on china with silver place settings. Sophisticated young chefs opened restaurants on Courthouse Square, which also began to attract high-end merchants. Richard Howorth, the current mayor, converted a former drugstore into Square Books, one of the country's prized independent bookstores, which became the center of Oxford's vibrant literary culture. Native writers such as Richard Ford, Barry Hannah, and John Grisham moved to town, and the flowering of Oxford paralleled the renaissance of Ole Miss under Khayat.\n\nBoth of the Scruggs children, Zach and Claire, attended Ole Miss, and Scruggs began to think of a new phase in his life, even retirement. In Oxford, he could assume the role of gentleman lawyer, and it seemed to fit him as neatly as the tailor-made suits he wore. He was unfailingly polite, and spoke with a courtly manner, even in casual encounters with strangers. \"He thought it would be a great place to just semiretire, and start a practice,\" Mike Moore says. \"And I'm sure what he thought was that maybe one day he would get out of the practice and Zach would have a practice, maybe set Zach up, and do something new and different in a place where they could raise their family and it would really be nice.\"\n\nIn 2003, Scruggs bought the upper floor of a building on Courthouse Square, across from the courthouse itself, and undertook a major renovation. Across the top of the building's buff-colored exterior, in big block lettering, were placed the words \"Scruggs Law Firm.\" Office assistants tended to the chore of finding a parking space on the crowded square for Scruggs's Porsche Cayenne. After the runway at the small local airfield was extended, it could accommodate his ten-seat Dassault Falcon 20. He and Diane bought a prime piece of property at the edge of campus, separated by a small forest from Faulkner's home, Rowan Oak. The Scruggs place, a five-million-dollar white mansion with six columns across the front, gave them an address on a newly created street-Faulkner Woods Place.\n\nTo most of his colleagues in Oxford, Scruggs was a welcome addition. His generosity to the university benefitted all, and his building projects had increased local property values. Scruggs also had assumed the role of resident patron. He lent his plane to an acquaintance who wanted to attend the Betty Ford clinic, and to another who needed cancer surgery in Chicago. \"Anybody- anybody -can go in and see Dickie, ask him for money, and come out with a check,\" Moore says. \"I mean, it's really dumb, how he has done some of that.\" Scruggs brought a certain élan to town, and politicians regularly came through Oxford on fund-raising quests (Joe Biden, Tom Daschle, Susan Collins, and Harry Reid among them). The federal charges against Scruggs were sensational, and troubling, but the prevailing view was probably best summed up by John Grisham, who remarked to the Wall Street Journal , \"This doesn't sound like the Dickie Scruggs that I know. . . . When you know Dickie, and how successful he has been, you could not believe he would be involved in such a boneheaded bribery scam that is not in the least bit sophisticated.\"\n\nThe central figure in the alleged bribery conspiracy was not Dickie Scruggs, or his son, Zach, or even Backstrom, their law partner. It was a thirty-nine-year-old lawyer named Timothy Balducci, from the tiny town of New Albany, about forty miles east of Oxford. The government claimed that Scruggs had facilitated a conspiracy to bribe a local circuit-court judge, Henry Lackey, in the hope of getting a favorable ruling in a lawsuit over an attorney's-fee dispute; but it was Balducci (who was not a party to that case) who approached Judge Lackey, promised him a payoff, and delivered the money to him. The indictment quoted Balducci boasting to Lackey, in a conversation that was obviously recorded, about how close he was to Scruggs. \"My relationship with Dick is such that he and I can talk very private about these kinds of matters,\" Balducci said. \"He and I, um, how shall I say, for over the last five or six years there, there are bodies buried that, you know, that he and I know where [they] are.\"\n\nBalducci was an outsider in Scruggs's Oxford social sphere, where it was assumed that he was a troubled person who had tried to exploit a peripheral relationship with Scruggs in order to buy leniency. The Scruggs defense lawyers soon advanced this notion themselves. \"It's a situation Tim Balducci did alone,\" Tony Farese, Zach's lawyer, said. \"After he got apprehended, he decided to twist and turn things around and implicate others that were not involved.\"\n\nThe day after those remarks were published, F.B.I. agents raided the law office of Joey Langston, Scruggs's principal attorney. It was a stunning event, given the sanctity of attorney-client privilege. The raid was engineered by the lead prosecutor on the Scruggs case, Assistant U.S. Attorney Tom Dawson. Dawson's office was sensitive to charges of Bush Justice Department politicization of recent public-corruption prosecutions, most notably the controversial conviction of Alabama's Governor Don Siegelman, a Democrat, in 2006. Bill Clinton had cancelled his Oxford visit after the Scruggs indictment, and Dawson believed that he needed to make it clear that the case was about corruption, not politics.\n\nDawson's means of achieving this aim was a provision in the Federal Rules of Evidence called Rule 404 (b), which allowed prosecutors to introduce evidence of other alleged crimes in order to demonstrate a defendant's motive or criminal intent. It is a favorite device of Dawson's (whose silver Chevy Tahoe, often parked on the square, bears the Mississippi license tag \"404B\"). Within a month of the raid on Joey Langston's office, Langston was standing in federal court in Oxford, confessing to having participated in trying to corrupt another judge, on behalf of Scruggs.\n\nAs Dawson explained it to the judge, Langston had represented Scruggs a year earlier, in yet another dispute over attorney fees, in a court in Hinds County, where the state capital, Jackson, is situated. Langston, working with his then associate-none other than Timothy Balducci-and a former Mississippi state auditor, Steve Patterson, paid fifty thousand dollars to Ed Peters, a close friend of the Jackson judge, in the hope of influencing the outcome of the fee-dispute case. The judge-disregarding a special master's recommendation that Scruggs owed the plaintiffs roughly fifteen million dollars-essentially ruled for Scruggs, saying that he owed the plaintiff nothing further. Langston pleaded guilty, and no one else has been charged. (Scruggs and Patterson deny any wrongdoing; Peters could not be reached.)\n\nMany in Mississippi's bar found this development even more disturbing than the original accusation against Scruggs. The Jackson judge who had allegedly been influenced was Bobby DeLaughter (Ole Miss Law, '77), a Mississippi hero and a jurist uniformly regarded as thoughtful and honest. In the mid-nineteen-nineties, DeLaughter had resurrected the cold case against Byron De La Beckwith, who had twice been acquitted by Mississippi juries of the 1963 killing of the civil-rights activist Medgar Evers. (Alec Baldwin portrayed DeLaughter in the movie \"Ghosts of Mississippi.\") According to the Langston plea colloquy, it wasn't necessarily the money exchange that had allegedly influenced DeLaughter in the Scruggs case. DeLaughter was known to covet an appointment to the federal bench, and \"based on this knowledge,\" Dawson said, at the hearing, \"Scruggs told Langston to let the judge know that if he ruled in his favor, he would pass his name along for consideration regarding the federal judgeship.\" Everyone knew to whom the accusation was referring-Trent Lott.\n\nThe families of Lott, the Republican whip in the Senate, and Scruggs were close. Lott's Thanksgiving gathering that year had taken place at Sub Rosa, an antebellum plantation near Pocahontas, Mississippi, which Patricia Lott had purchased in 2003. She bought the place with a $1.5-million loan from Diane Scruggs, who holds the deed on the property. Scruggs would have known that he could count on his brother-in-law to make a telephone call to DeLaughter, and Lott subsequently did call the Judge. (DeLaughter, whose service on the bench has been temporarily suspended pending an investigation, has denied any wrongdoing, as has Lott, who says that he customarily made calls regarding potential federal judgeships and never recommended DeLaughter.)\n\nTwo days before the Scruggs indictment, Lott announced his resignation from the U.S. Senate, in order to become a Washington-based lobbyist. (\"There's a time for everything and everything-a special time for everything under heaven,\" he said.) In Oxford, the DeLaughter development, and Lott's involvement, cast a new perspective on events. \"Trent cited the Book of Ecclesiastes,\" Curtis Wilkie, a professor at Ole Miss, and a friend of Scruggs, said. \"But it was more like Revelations.\"\n\nIn his war against the tobacco companies, Scruggs assembled a collection of lawyers, fixers, cutouts, and whistle-blowers, who joined him with the prospect of sharing in the payout. When the bonanza materialized, Scruggs was overwhelmed by claimants who believed that they had his warrant for a share. Mike Moore recalls, \"He would say to me, 'You know what I really feel like doing? I really feel like throwin' all the money I've made in a big pile, and just calling everybody up and telling 'em, \"Y'all come get what you think is yours, and just leave whatever you think is mine.\" ' \"\n\nScruggs had promised to distribute bits and pieces of the litigation's proceeds as needs arose, sometimes so casually as to invite later dispute. He wanted legislation authorizing his hiring, an unlikely prospect in a state whose governor, Kirk Fordice, so opposed the tobacco litigation that he is said to have refused to endorse the check when Mississippi's case was successfully settled. In 1994, Scruggs turned to Pete Johnson, a political blueblood (his uncle and his grandfather had been Mississippi governors) with deep connections in the legislature. Johnson says that Scruggs promised him ten per cent in any settlement if he could sway lawmakers toward the Scruggs position. A Medicaid bill was pending in conference, and Johnson had friends on the committee. Johnson, who was not a legislator, or even a registered lobbyist, wrote an amendment to the bill, giving Moore the authority to hire plaintiffs' attorneys on a contingency basis. \"I just made several phone calls and told them what I wanted to do, and they said, 'Send us the amendments,' \" Johnson recalls. \"So I sent 'em, and they were inserted. And I did it with just a handful of words, artfully placed.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nAfter the settlement, Johnson wrote to Scruggs, suggesting that they meet to discuss Johnson's payment. When Scruggs didn't respond, Johnson drove down to Pascagoula, but Scruggs refused to see him. (Scruggs, through his attorney, disputes this account.) Johnson filed suit against Scruggs, but Scruggs had the case transferred to Pascagoula, where it was dismissed. Johnson could of course appeal, but he says that one day he received a call \"out of the blue\" from a man named P. L. Blake, urging him to drop the case. \"He's kind of a dealmaker, so to speak, that nobody ever sees,\" Johnson says of Blake. \"He's a character. A Deep Throat kind of a guy.\"\n\nBlake had risen from a hardscrabble childhood in Webb, Mississippi. He played football at Mississippi State, and then in the Canadian Football League. When he returned to Mississippi, he made his way into the political sphere of the late Senator James Eastland, eventually parlaying his connections into substantial landholdings and various business ventures. In the nineteen-eighties, Blake had a series of financial and legal setbacks which resulted in bankruptcy and a bank-fraud conviction, but even then he was able to call upon powerful friends. One of his criminal lawyers was Fred Thompson, and he was represented in his bankruptcy proceedings by Dickie Scruggs, who made monthly loans to his bankrupt client, sometimes running to thousands of dollars; ultimately, the debt amounted to more than a million dollars.\n\nAccording to Pete Johnson, Blake implored him to drop the Scruggs matter. Johnson was inclined to quit the suit anyway (he had received a liver transplant, and his prognosis was uncertain), and told Blake as much. \"He wrote me a check for a hundred thousand dollars,\" Johnson recalls. \"I said, 'Do you really want me to take this money?' And he said, 'Please. Please take it.' And that was the last time I talked to him.\"\n\nOther Scruggs money fights were not as easily resolved. By 1994, as Scruggs was gearing up for the tobacco litigation, two of his former partners in the asbestos enterprise, Alwyn Luckey and William Roberts Wilson, had sued him, claiming that he had cheated them of their rightful share of fees. Scruggs fought the lawsuits, in a legal battle that lasted a dozen years, wending through several state and federal courts. An attorney for the plaintiffs, Charlie Merkel, deposed Scruggs five times over the years in an effort to determine how much Scruggs made on tobacco, how he spent it, and with whom he shared it. When Merkel pressed Scruggs as to why he had lent so much to a bankrupt client-P. L. Blake-without collateral, Scruggs replied, \"He needed the money.\" Scruggs was no more forthcoming about what Blake had done to earn a piece of the tobacco payment that could reach fifty million dollars. The tobacco litigation was a war, Scruggs explained, and he needed people like Blake, who had \"his ear to the ground politically in this state and in the South generally.\"\n\nFriends of Scruggs say that the protracted disputes wore him down, and that his family wanted the matters settled. But Scruggs refused to surrender any unmerited tobacco money. \"All the people who tried to get a piece of tobacco, he hated 'em,\" an attorney who represented Scruggs in yet another lawsuit says. \"He just despised 'em. I mean, he was not rational about them. I don't think, I still don't believe, that he would do anything illegal to beat 'em. But he would spend as much as it took to beat 'em, even if it would be smarter to settle it.\" A judge eventually ordered Scruggs to pay seventeen million dollars to Luckey; the Wilson case landed in the Jackson courtroom of Judge Bobby DeLaughter.\n\nAfter the tobacco settlement, Scruggs fell into a slump. He had more money than he could spend, and was fully stocked with yachts, planes, and vacation homes, but he ascribed to his brand of law a moral dimension (\"It's not often in life that you have a chance to make a mark on humanity,\" he said after the tobacco victory), and looked for the next great crusade. It arrived on the morning of August 29, 2005, when Hurricane Katrina made landfall on the Mississippi coast.\n\nKatrina's peculiar ferocity was its surge, a mass of Gulf water nearly three stories high and six miles thick. Hurricane winds will smash things up, but water can level a whole community and carry it away. The Mississippi coast, accustomed to hurricanes, was unprepared for a surge like Katrina's. More than two hundred people were killed there, but the storm also carried a second disaster. Much of the destruction of the coast was plainly caused by the surge, and standard homeowners' insurance policies do not cover damage caused by flooding. The federal government offers flood insurance to property owners, but few property owners on the coast had the coverage. Many properties were destroyed, down to the concrete slabs, and it was almost impossible to determine whether the damage in these \"slab cases,\" as the insurance industry terms them, was caused by water or by wind or by both.\n\n\"The wind-and-water issue was just absolutely an unwinnable situation,\" George Dale, who had been Mississippi's insurance commissioner for thirty years when Katrina struck, says. \"If there's a regular hurricane that knocks things down, the insurance company comes in, pays what it owes, and people go back to their houses. But when there's an issue of a water surge, or winds and water, there is no way to determine the per cent of that home or business that was destroyed by water.\"\n\nThe insurance companies determined that most of the slab cases were water cases, and, thus, excluded from full coverage. In instances where structures were still standing but had been damaged by a combination of wind and water, property owners were granted only fractional relief.\n\nThe situation invited a Scruggs intervention, and he was on the coast almost as soon as the water subsided. His waterfront home in Pascagoula had been destroyed, as had Trent Lott's. \"This one was very personal to him,\" Mike Moore says.\n\nScruggs set up a toll-free number and hired a bank of operators to handle the incoming calls. He had signed up Lott as a client, as well as the Democratic congressman Gene Taylor, who also lost his home to the storm, and Louis Guirola, Jr., a federal district judge. Scruggs was featured in a long article in the New York Times , in which he declared, \"I'm not going to sit still for this. I'm going to bring every organizational and legal skill I possess to make these guys do the right thing under their policies.\"\n\nScruggs announced that he would bring suit against the major insurance carriers on the coast, and he assembled a team, which he called the Scruggs Katrina Group. The core members of the group were mostly veterans of the tobacco battle, including David Nutt, who once again bankrolled the venture. A newcomer, brought into the group to develop legal theories and write briefs for litigation, was a Jackson lawyer named Johnny Jones.\n\nTo some in the group, Jones was a surprising choice. He had a small practice in Jackson, in an old house near the Capitol, with a casual atmosphere that reflected his style. With longish graying hair and the slight squint of a smoker, Jones was known, as one colleague put it, as \"an artsy-craftsy sort of guy-and he writes, too.\" He had little experience in mass torts, and none in the sort of undertaking in which he was now invited to participate. As a young lawyer in the mid-eighties, he had done some asbestos work with the master in the field, Danny Cupit, but he was deterred by the administrative nature of the work. When he saw all the money that Scruggs and the others were making at it, however, he promised his wife, Mary, and the younger partners in his firm that if the right chance came along he would take it. The Katrina project seemed right. \"It was just an insurance-company bamboozle of Mississippians,\" Jones says.\n\nJones had spent much of the previous year in close contact with Scruggs, defending him against the fee claims of Alwyn Luckey and Bob Wilson. Although Scruggs had been ordered to pay seventeen million dollars in back asbestos fees, Jones protected Scruggs's tobacco money. When Scruggs asked him to be part of the Katrina group, Jones went to work on legal theories, figuring that four or five cases would need to be tried, and won, before the insurance companies would settle.\n\nIf things went as Scruggs hoped, Jones's contribution would be the least important component of the Scruggs Katrina Group's efforts. Within a few weeks of the storm, the Scruggs group had signed several hundred clients, and was actively pursuing whistle-blowers. By December, Scruggs was ready to test his clout. He went to see George Dale, the insurance commissioner, and his deputy, in Dale's office in Jackson, and he was blunt. According to Dale, Scruggs said that there was a war coming between the insurance companies and the aggrieved people of the coast, and Dale needed to choose a side. \"He proceeded to say, 'Now, you know that they're saying some bad things about you-they're referring to you as the commissioner for insurance, rather than as the commissioner of insurance,' \" Dale recalls.\n\nScruggs then laid out his strategy for going after State Farm, the state's largest insurer. He would use the same strategy he had used with tobacco. Dale says, \"He said, 'You also know that I have all this inside information of all this wrongdoing that these insurance companies have done.' And I said, 'Well, Dickie, you ought to turn that over to the proper folks.' \"\n\nDale says that Scruggs told him he'd already gathered some information showing that State Farm wasn't playing straight with property owners. \"And then he proceeded to say, 'What I want you to do is, I want you to make State Farm put five hundred million in a fund, which I would administer, and I will pay the claims on the coast.' To which my answer was 'Dickie, I can't do that.' \" (Scruggs denies Dale's account of the conversation.) The meeting ended, and Scruggs left. \"And from that point forward,\" according to Dale, \"Dickie's intent was to get rid of me as commissioner of insurance, at which he succeeded.\" (During Dale's Democratic-primary race last year, Scruggs took out a full-page newspaper advertisement depicting Dale as a pig, frolicking with insurance companies, under the headline \" LIPSTICK ON A PIG .\")\n\nLink copied\n\nScruggs did obtain inside information about State Farm-volumes of it, delivered to him by Cori and Kerri Rigsby, sisters who were working as adjusters for a firm contracted by State Farm. The Rigsby sisters, who were stepdaughters of a former Scruggs client, claimed to have witnessed the firing by a State Farm manager of an engineering firm that had attributed storm damage to wind, rather than to water. The sisters, suspecting fraud, began to copy State Farm files, and, after meeting with Scruggs, started to deliver the purloined company material to him. After a large data delivery in June, 2006, the Rigsbys were fired by their firm, and hired by Scruggs as \"consultants,\" at an annual fee of a hundred and fifty thousand dollars each.\n\nScruggs copied the State Farm material and passed it on to Jim Hood, a protégé of Mike Moore's who in 2003 had succeeded him as attorney general. Moore, who had entered private practice, was in close contact with the Scruggs Katrina Group, and was also directly advising Hood. Hood opened a criminal investigation into State Farm.\n\nIn August, 2006, the Scruggs group actually tried a case in court, winning a nominal victory-an additional payout of twelve hundred and twenty-eight dollars for a Scruggs client from the Nationwide insurance company. More important developments, however, were occurring outside court. Trent Lott and Gene Taylor, the Democratic congressman who had also lost his home in the storm, introduced amendments to the Homeland Security appropriations bill which would require investigations of the insurance industry. Charles Chamness, the C.E.O. of a national insurance trade association, has claimed that Lott had threatened him, in a telephone call, with \"bringing down State Farm and the industry.\" Lott also co-sponsored a proposal to strip the insurance industry of an antitrust exemption that had been in place since the nineteen-forties.\n\nMeanwhile, the Rigsby sisters were featured in an ABC News exposé of Katrina insurance fraud, broadcast on the prime-time program \"20/20.\" Wearing State Farm windbreakers, the sisters told of doctored reports, shredded evidence, and widespread malfeasance on the part of State Farm. Cori Rigsby said, \"Katrina was devastating, but so was State Farm.\" (A judge ultimately disqualified them as witnesses.)\n\nOn November 14, 2006, in a teleconference with the other members of the group, Scruggs announced that State Farm had tentatively agreed to a settlement. The company would pay eighty-nine million dollars to settle the claims of the Scruggs group's six hundred and forty clients, and $26.5 million in attorney's fees. State Farm also agreed to settle a separate class action on behalf of other coast residents, Scruggs said, which could produce another ten million to twenty million dollars for the group. (That settlement was later rejected by a federal judge.)\n\nJones had not known about the Rigsby sisters, and he hadn't been consulted in the negotiations with State Farm. He felt that his small firm had suffered without his services, and he had been ignored whenever he asked for an advance on potential earnings. He figured that if the fees were shared equally he and his firm would receive about four million dollars. A few weeks after the teleconference, according to Jones, Scruggs called him to discuss his split. \"We've agreed to pay you a million dollars off the top,\" Scruggs said. Jones says that he was delighted, assuming that Scruggs was advancing him a portion of his share to help him and his firm through the holidays. \"I said, 'O.K., that's mighty nice, I appreciate that. How are we gonna split up the fees?' And he said, 'Well, that's all you're gonna get,' \" Jones recalls. \"And I said, 'No, it's not all I'm gonna get, Dickie.' \" Jones wrote Scruggs a letter conveying his disagreement with Scruggs's reckoning, the first of a months-long exchange of e-mails and letters aimed at resolving the dispute. Jones repeatedly urged that the group turn the issue over to arbitration, as provided for in the agreement, to no avail.\n\nThe settlement was finalized in January, 2007, and in March Jones and his partner, Steve Funderburg, were summoned to a meeting in David Nutt's office, to resolve the fee dispute. They were told that the rest of the group had agreed to vote them out if they didn't accept a six-per-cent share, which Jones calculated at $1.3 million.\n\nJones was despondent, and says that he thought of giving up the law. \"I was too stupid to have seen it coming,\" he says. \"Who needs a lawyer like that?\" Instead, Jones and Funderburg decided to sue Scruggs and the group. Jones recalls saying to himself, \"I'm just gonna make sure that those guys that I trusted never practice law again as long as they live.\"\n\nJones filed suit in Oxford, to maximize the embarrassment that the dispute could cause Scruggs. To represent him in the lawsuit, and to write the complaint against Scruggs, Jones hired Grady Tollison, who had been practicing in Oxford for decades. Until the arrival of Scruggs, whom some in the Oxford legal community considered \"a coast lawyer,\" Tollison had been the lawyer on the square. He had bought his building, a historic structure called the Thompson House, in 1973, with Robert Khayat, who was then a young law professor. Tollison referred to Scruggs's new home as \"the Taj Mahal,\" and grumbled about \"the jillion dollars'' that Scruggs spent on the building that housed his firm. (Tollison's mood was not improved when the Thompson House, across the square from Scruggs's building, partly collapsed last year.) But Tollison's objections to Scruggs represented something deeper. Tollison was a traditionalist, a former president of the state bar who delighted in the practice of law-the courtrooms and the juries, the legal gossip exchanged in early-morning bull sessions. \"I know some trial lawyers who've tried hundreds of cases-they're my friends,\" he would say, making it clear what he thought of the \"three-legged stool\" approach to the law.\n\nIn his complaint for Jones, Tollison accused Scruggs and his Katrina cohort of conspiring to lure Jones into the venture in order to exploit his legal skills, only to freeze him out on fees. Tollison indicated that he meant to parade before the court the history of Scruggs's money fights with his former associates, a spectacle to which Jones, who had defended Scruggs in just such a dispute, would be able to lend revealing insight. The Tollison filing charged Scruggs and his confederates with numerous infamies, and concluded, \"A scheming cabal should not be allowed to succeed.\"\n\nThe Jones complaint was filed on March 15, 2007, and was still the topic of discussion inside the Scruggs firm several days later, when Tim Balducci and his new law partner, Steve Patterson, paid a visit to the firm. The pair had become an increasingly familiar presence around the firm, a fact that would have surprised many of Scruggs's old friends. As state auditor in 1992, Patterson had examined Moore's hiring of Scruggs to represent the state in the asbestos litigation; Moore, in turn, ran Patterson out of office for a car-tag scam. Patterson was not a licensed attorney, yet he was now a full partner in the Patterson-Balducci firm.\n\nBalducci was later lampooned as a Dickie Scruggs wannabe, and the bespectacled, wisecracking, ambitious lawyer might not have disputed that portrayal. He had practiced for a time with Scruggs's ally Joey Langston-an association that introduced him to the world of big-money cases and the corporate-jet life style-but he left Langston at the end of 2006 to start his own firm, trying to create the impression of a politically connected practice in the Scruggs-Langston league. He brought in Patterson as a rainmaker, and persuaded several familiar names in Mississippi political and legal circles (including a former governor) to accept \"of counsel\" stipends, using them for letterhead adornment. Balducci and Patterson opened offices in New Albany, Oxford, and Washington, D.C., and set up an elaborate Web site that suggested the resources and talent of an established and prosperous firm. In fact, Balducci had big startup expenses and few paying clients, and what income he had came substantially from the odd jobs that Scruggs tossed his way.\n\nBalducci knew that Jones had been squeezed out of the Scruggs Katrina Group, and hoped that he might be dealt in. When the subject of the Jones lawsuit came up during his visit to the Scruggs firm, and it was suggested that Balducci might be able to help, he was eager to volunteer his services. The case was to be heard by the circuit-court judge Henry Lackey, whom Balducci had often characterized as a mentor and close friend. Balducci said that he would have a word with the Judge on behalf of Scruggs's position.\n\nIn Mississippi's casual sociality, lawyers see judges on hunting trips and at cocktail parties, and sometimes visit them privately in chambers. Occasionally, talk turns to the subject of a case pending before the court. Such ex-parte communication-or \"earwigging,\" as it's more commonly known-is a technical violation of ethics standards, but it is hardly rare, and is usually harmless. When Grady Tollison filed the Jones lawsuit, he bumped into Judge Lackey in the clerk's office, and asked him to keep the case under seal for a few days, to give the parties a chance to settle; Lackey, who didn't like lawyers airing their dirty laundry in fee disputes, agreed. Technically, Tollison should have filed a motion, to which the defendants would have had the chance to reply, but in all likelihood they wouldn't have objected anyway.\n\nBalducci wanted to influence a judge presiding over a case in which he had no role, but he did not set out to bribe Judge Lackey. Nor would he have had reason to think that Lackey would have countenanced an illegal overture.\n\nHenry Lackey was a self-described \"deep-water Baptist,\" a deacon in his church, and a member of the state Commission on Judicial Performance. He lived in the small town where he was born, Calhoun City, where his parents had owned a Ben Franklin five-and-dime store. He made early-morning front-porch deliveries from his vegetable garden to the local widows. At seventy-two, he had a full head of white hair, and spoke in a slow, Sam Ervin voice. He answered his own phone, and drove around his circuit in a used GMC Yukon; Lackey was a firm conservative, but in his court an outspoken Democrat like Grady Tollison could count on a fair shake.\n\nLackey liked Tim Balducci, and he knew that his young friend was having a difficult time. When Balducci called and asked for a meeting with him to discuss a personal matter, Lackey was happy to oblige. On March 28th, Balducci met Lackey in his office, and told him that he thought the Scruggs side in the Jones case was the right one, and that if the Judge saw it that way, too, it would do Balducci some good. Later in the conversation, Balducci said that he knew the Judge meant to retire soon, and he hoped that Lackey would consider joining Patterson-Balducci on an of-counsel basis.\n\nLink copied\n\nLackey felt that the overture was grossly improper, possibly even criminal. He says that he agonized for nearly two weeks about the meeting, consulting another judge and a local prosecutor. He even discussed it with a former partner of Balducci's, he says, \"to see if I could discover what character flaw they had seen in me to think that I would participate in something like that.\" He felt that he couldn't take the matter to the attorney general, Jim Hood-\"That would be like speaking to Mr. Scruggs himself\"-and finally he decided to go to Assistant U.S. Attorney John Hailman, in Oxford, an old friend nearing retirement, who urged Lackey to play it out with Balducci. Lackey agreed to have his telephone and office wired for recording.\n\nOn May 4th, Balducci faxed Lackey a proposed order that would have sent the Jones case to arbitration. By this point, the Scruggs side would have been happy to have an arbitrator dispose of the Jones matter, an option that Jones says he requested more than twenty times before he filed suit. On May 21st, Lackey telephoned Balducci and said that he needed reassurance: \"I just want to hear you say it again, I guess. You and Scruggs only one know anything about this?\"\n\n\"Absolutely, Judge,\" Balducci replied. \"Absolutely. There is nobody in this world, ain't but three folks in this world that know that I've even seen you. And it's me and you and him. And that's it.\" Balducci went on to say that he didn't want the Judge to do anything that made him uncomfortable.\n\nLackey asked whether Scruggs could be trusted. If he played along, Lackey wondered, might Scruggs try to hold it over him somehow? \"He ain't that way,\" Balducci responded.\n\nCalls and meetings between Balducci and the Judge continued through the summer. Balducci had broken the rules, and possibly the law, but he hadn't explicitly tried to bribe Lackey. There was no indication, other than Balducci's word, that Scruggs was directly involved. By September, Lackey had agreed to try to press the case another step forward-determining, in essence, to solicit a bribe.\n\nIn a conversation with Balducci on September 18th, Lackey haltingly broached the subject, until Balducci urged him to \"put the corn on the ground.\"\n\n\"If I help them,\" the Judge asked, \"would they help me?\"\n\n\"I think no question that would happen,\" Balducci replied. \"Yes, sir. No question. Mm-hmm.\"\n\nLackey told Balducci that he'd got himself into a fix, and he needed something \"to just kinda help me over a little hump.\" He couldn't quite bring himself to ask for money until, in a conversation three days later, he said, \"To get, to get me over a hump, I need forty.\"\n\nLackey says that he hoped Balducci would turn him down. \"I just hoped against hope that Tim would have said, 'Judge, you misunderstood me, and I'm sorry, I didn't mean to indicate that, and I was just wrong. You forget that, and I'll go my merry way, and you have a good day,' or something like that.\"\n\nBalducci replied, \"Forty? O.K.\"\n\nBalducci was now involved in a bribery attempt, and what he did next drew the Scruggs firm into the crime. He decided to pay Lackey out of his firm's \"slush fund\" (as Balducci termed it), but he needed assurance that he and Patterson would be repaid. Balducci says that he received that assurance from Sid Backstrom, at the Scruggs firm. (Backstrom denies this.) But Patterson wanted to be certain. He believed he knew how things really worked with Scruggs, so, he says, he got in touch with the mysterious P. L. Blake. According to Patterson's account, he told Blake that he and Balducci had taken care of \"a problem\" for Scruggs (he didn't say how) and that it had cost them forty thousand dollars; Blake met with Scruggs, and then reassured Patterson. (Scruggs denies that the meeting occurred; Blake could not be reached.)\n\nScruggs later issued a check to Balducci's firm in the amount of forty thousand dollars, ostensibly as payment for legal work on a Katrina case.\n\nOn November 1st, Balducci drove to Calhoun City, and delivered the payment to the Judge. As he left Lackey's office, he was confronted by F.B.I. agents. The agents produced a portable DVD player, and replayed for Balducci a video of himself making a payment to Judge Lackey. The agents then offered Balducci a choice: \"You can go to Oxford, or you can go see Tom Dawson,\" the Assistant U.S. Attorney. Balducci, a former public defender, knew that \"Oxford\" meant the detention center. He said he would see Tom Dawson.\n\nThe agents drove Balducci to the Ethridge Professional Building, down the hill from the federal courthouse, in Oxford, entering the building through a basement door so that they wouldn't be seen. They escorted him to an interrogation room, where Dawson waited. Balducci was told that his life as he knew it was over. \"The only question is, will you see your children graduate from high school?'' Dawson said. Balducci did not hesitate. \"What do you want me to do?\"\n\nDawson asked Balducci if he would wear a body wire, and go back into the Scruggs firm. Balducci agreed.\n\nThe ruse was that Lackey had rewritten the arbitration order, and that Balducci wanted to have the Scruggs team read it before the Judge entered it. Less than three hours after being confronted by the F.B.I., Balducci climbed the steps to the Scruggs office, where he proceeded to give what one defense-team member conceded was \"a dazzling performance.\"\n\nBalducci saw Dickie Scruggs almost as soon as he arrived, but Scruggs apologized and said he had to take a call. Balducci spent most of the next hour joshing with the firm's secretaries, talking about the L.S.U.-Alabama game that weekend, and going over changes in the proposed order with Backstrom and Zach Scruggs. \"Get it how you want it,\" Balducci said, \" 'cause we're paying for it to get it done right.\"\n\nFinally, Dickie appeared, and, after apologizing again, he brought Balducci into his office. Scruggs was excited about some satellite photographs he had of damaged homes on the coast-additional evidence, he was certain, of insurance-company liability. Balducci explained that he had a new order from Lackey, and that he wanted Scruggs to approve it. Scruggs looked it over. \"That last sentence is not really a sentence,\" he said. \"I think he needs a colon there.\"\n\nBalducci then posed the question that would decide Scruggs's fate. The Judge was feeling \"a little more exposed on the facts,\" Balducci said. Would Scruggs be willing to pay \" 'bout ten or so more?\"\n\nScruggs's secretary interrupted the conversation, to say that the governor of Delaware, Ruth Ann Minner, was on the line.\n\nScruggs said he would call her back.\n\n\"That's fund-raisin', it sounds like,\" Balducci said.\n\n\"Shit,\" Scruggs remarked. \"Don't know who that is.\"\n\nThe two men returned to the critical question: \"Do you want me to cover that, or not?\" Balducci asked.\n\n\"I'll take care of it,\" Scruggs said.\n\nOn November 27th, Balducci told his story to the federal grand jury in Oxford. As that secret proceeding unfolded, two of Grady Tollison's office workers stepped out to the balcony for a smoke, and noticed men wearing jackets and ties going in and out of the Scruggs firm, carrying boxes. It was an F.B.I. raid. The following day, the grand jury reported its indictment of Dickie and Zach Scruggs, their partner, Sid Backstrom, Steve Patterson, and Tim Balducci. That afternoon, Scruggs surrendered to the U.S. Marshals office, and was fingerprinted, and later arraigned. (He pleaded not guilty.) Tom Dawson had to recommend a bond, and was stumped-how do you set a bond amount for someone as rich as Scruggs? He decided to ask to have Scruggs's jet grounded, and his request was granted. This became a minor issue a few days later, when the Scruggs legal team, led by John Keker, of San Francisco, pleaded with the court for permission to use the plane; the magistrate judge, S. Allan Alexander, a former partner of Grady Tollison's, denied the request, issuing an order that included a recitation of commercial-airline fares between San Francisco and Memphis, seventy-five miles from Oxford.\n\nIt was clear to the Scruggs team that Balducci, who was arraigned separately, had become a government witness. Patterson made a plea bargain with the government, leaving only the Scruggs men and Backstrom as defendants.\n\nOn Friday, March 14th-just two weeks before the scheduled start of the trial-Scruggs arrived at the federal courthouse with Diane and his lawyer, Keker. Diane wept. Scruggs worked the room, greeting friends and colleagues, but the months after the indictment seemed to have diminished him, to a slight, almost wispy presence. Then Judge Neal Biggers entered, and announced that a plea deal had been made. Dawson read the charge that Scruggs agreed to plead guilty on-one count of conspiracy to bribe Judge Lackey-and, when Biggers asked Scruggs if he agreed with the prosecutor's account, Scruggs seemed eager to offer a dissent. \"I joined the conspiracy later in the game,\" Scruggs said. \"It's not exactly as the prosecutor allocuted, in that there was no intent to bribe the judge; it was an intent to earwig the judge, Judge Lackey.\"\n\nScruggs had to be prompted by his lawyer. \"But then later-what about later?\" Keker said. \"You got to say something about later.\"\n\n\"I did join the conspiracy after that,\" Scruggs said. Backstrom pleaded to the same count. (The following week, Zach Scruggs entered a plea of guilty to the lesser offense of misprision of a felony.)\n\nUpon leaving the courtroom, Dickie Scruggs began to prepare for his sentencing, which is likely to take place next month. He had his plane flown to Houston, where it was put up for sale. The Scruggs Law Firm was closed, and the big block lettering was taken down from the building on the square, leaving only the faint imprint of the firm's name, traced by the sun, on the façade. Scruggs also wrote a letter to Chancellor Khayat, asking that his name be removed from Scruggs Hall. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

      "text": "William Faulkner's Demons\n\nWhat if the North had won the Civil War? That technically factual counterfactual animated almost all of William Faulkner's writing. The Mississippi novelist was born thirty-two years after Robert E. Lee surrendered to Ulysses S. Grant at Appomattox, but he came of age believing in the superiority of the Confederacy: the South might have lost, but the North did not deserve to win. This Lost Cause revisionism appeared everywhere, from the textbooks that Faulkner was assigned growing up to editorials in local newspapers, praising the paternalism and the prosperity of the slavery economy, jury-rigging an alternative justification for secession, canonizing as saints and martyrs those who fought for the C.S.A., and proclaiming the virtues of antebellum society. In contrast with those delusions, Faulkner's fiction revealed the truth: the Confederacy was both a military and a moral failure.\n\nThe Civil War features in some dozen of Faulkner's novels. It is most prominent in those set in Yoknapatawpha County, an imaginary Mississippi landscape filled with battlefields and graveyards, veterans and widows, slaves and former slaves, draft dodgers and ghosts. In \"Light in August,\" the Reverend Gail Hightower is haunted by his Confederate grandfather; in \"Intruder in the Dust,\" the lawyer Gavin Stevens insists that all the region's teen-age boys are obsessed with the hours before Pickett's Charge at Gettysburg. In these books, no Southerner is spared the torturous influence of the war, whether he flees the region, as Quentin Compson does, in \"The Sound and the Fury,\" or whether, like Rosa Coldfield, in \"Absalom, Absalom!,\" she stays.\n\nA new book by Michael Gorra, \"The Saddest Words: William Faulkner's Civil War\" (Liveright), traces Faulkner's literary depictions of the military conflict in the nineteenth century and his personal engagement with the racial conflict of the twentieth. The latter struggle, within the novelist himself, is the real war of Gorra's subtitle. In \"The Saddest Words,\" Faulkner emerges as a character as tragic as any he invented: a writer who brilliantly portrayed the way that the South's refusal to accept its defeat led to cultural decay, but a Southerner whose private letters and public statements were riddled with the very racism that his books so pointedly damned.\n\nIt's too late to cancel Faulkner; he already cancelled himself. \"I will protest to the last: no photographs, no recorded documents,\" he wrote in a letter to the critic Malcolm Cowley on February 11, 1949. \"It is my ambition to be, as a private individual, abolished and voided from history, leaving it markless, no refuse save the printed books; I wish I had had enough sense to see ahead thirty years ago and, like some of the Elizabethans, not signed them.\"\n\nCowley was the editor of \"The Portable Faulkner,\" a 1946 anthology that collected and excerpted Faulkner's short stories and novels, ordering them chronologically according to their story lines rather than by their publication dates. It was an attempt to rescue Faulkner from an unsurprising obscurity: many of his books are difficult, and many had been published during the Great Depression or the Second World War, when both the money and the appetite for such writing was scarce. To make a living, Faulkner had turned to writing screenplays, including those for \"The Big Sleep\" and \"To Have and Have Not.\" Cowley made the case for Faulkner's genius, providing in the anthology a figurative as well as a literal map that showed the contours and connections of Yoknapatawpha County and its people. The volume put Faulkner's earlier novels back into print, and helped readers make sense of his modernist texts. Cowley had already published a similar anthology of Hemingway's work; it was a subsequent profile of \"Papa\" for Life that occasioned Faulkner's letter begging off any such publicity.\n\nFaulkner expressed his desire for authorial anonymity in other venues, too. \"If I had not existed, someone else would have written me, Hemingway, Dostoyevsky, all of us,\" he told The Paris Review . \"Proof of that is that there are about three candidates for the authorship of Shakespeare's plays. But what is important is Hamlet and A Midsummer Night's Dream , not who wrote them, but that somebody did. The artist is of no importance. Only what he creates is important.\"\n\nIt's hard to say whether those sentiments grew out of Faulkner's aversion to publicity in general or were instead a response to his particular stumbles with the press, but he seemed to know how much his personal reputation might damage the reputation of his work. Faulkner had grown up using racial slurs and deployed them in correspondence; after he became well known, he continued to write and say things that were just as scandalous, if not more so. In a letter to the editor of a newspaper in Memphis, he suggested that justice was delivered by juries and lynch mobs alike and that no innocent man of any race had ever been lynched. In an article for Life , he seemed to equate the N.A.A.C.P. with the white-supremacist Citizens' Council, and opposed what he called the \"compulsory integration\" of the South by the North. He told the New York Herald Tribune that he longed for the return of the \"benevolent autocracy\" of slavery, in which \"Negroes would be better off because they'd have some one to look after them.\" In 1956, several years after he won the Nobel Prize and around the time the federal government began deploying him as an international ambassador for democracy and human rights, he told a journalist that if that same government used troops to enforce integration in the South he would do as his Confederate great-grandfather had done before him. \"If it came to fighting,\" he said, \"I'd fight for Mississippi against the United States even if it meant going out into the street and shooting Negroes.\"\n\nThe outcry was swift. W. E. B. Du Bois challenged Faulkner to a debate on the steps of the Mississippi courthouse where Emmett Till's murderers had been acquitted the year before. Faulkner declined, saying, \"I do not believe there is a debatable point between us.\" He also issued a carefully hedged statement: the words attributed to him, he insisted, were ones \"no sober man would make, nor, it seems to me, any sane man believe.\" (Faulkner was a notorious drunk, but elsewhere he seemed to subscribe to the in-vino-veritas model of alcohol consumption.) He also published an apologia in Ebony titled \"If I Were a Negro,\" calling for moderation on racial questions and appealing for civil-rights advocates to \"go slow, pause for a moment.\"\n\nThe remarks were not well received, and the denials convinced no one who was not already intent on defending Faulkner. James Baldwin excoriated him in the pages of Partisan Review , writing that Faulkner was exactly like \"the bulk of relatively articulate white Southerners of good-will,\" in that his arguments \"have no value whatever as arguments, being almost entirely and helplessly dishonest, when not, indeed, insane.\" Baldwin understood that there was no middle ground between segregationists and integrationists, and no reconciling the equal rights and freedoms articulated in the Constitution with the discrimination and oppression of Jim Crow. With regard to Faulkner, he asked, \"Where is the evidence of the struggle he has been carrying on there on behalf of the Negro? Why, if he and his enlightened confreres in the South have been boring from within to destroy segregation, do they react with such panic when the walls show any signs of falling?\"\n\nGorra has no direct answer to Baldwin's question, and he acknowledges that some readers may find in these biographical facts reason enough to banish Faulkner from syllabi, if not from shelves. But Baldwin's essay is a condemnation of the writer's personal politics, not his work; it never mentions Faulkner's fiction. Gorra's argument, however, depends on close readings of everything from individual sentences to symbols and characters and themes across the author's novels, which collectively make the case that a racist person can be a radical writer. \"Faulkner the man shared many of the closed society's opinions and values,\" Gorra writes. \"But when the novelist could inhabit a character-when he slipped inside another mind and put those opinions into a different voice-he was almost always able to stand outside them, to place and to judge them.\"\n\nFaulkner was unwilling in his own life to adequately acknowledge the evils of slavery and segregation, but he did so with savage thoroughness in his fiction. He was a Hieronymus Bosch of prose: his tortured imagination filled story after story with sins of every form and with characters turned grotesque by committing them. Though much historical fiction is escapist, Faulkner's is brutalizing, depicting a South debased first by degeneracy and then by the refusal to atone for it, even in the face of defeat. In 1936, the same year that Margaret Mitchell offered the world a romance between the roguish Rhett Butler and the Southern belle Scarlett O'Hara, Faulkner published a story of rape and incest and racist terror. It was the seventy-fifth anniversary of the start of the Civil War, and Americans made clear which version of events they wanted to remember: \"Absalom, Absalom!\" sold around ten thousand copies; \"Gone with the Wind\" sold more than a million and won the Pulitzer Prize.\n\n\"Absalom, Absalom!\" was Faulkner's ninth novel, published ten years after his first. In that astonishing decade, he also wrote \"The Sound and the Fury,\" \"As I Lay Dying,\" and \"Light in August.\" A high-school dropout, Faulkner experimented with poetry as a teen-ager, then enlisted to fight in the First World War with the Royal Air Force. It's unclear why he didn't join the U.S. Army; in any case, the Armistice arrived before he had finished training, and he was discharged. Faulkner brought home an officer's uniform and the \"u\" he had added to his family's surname to make it seem more English. Both were part of the persona he cultivated at the University of Mississippi, where fellow-students mockingly called him Count No 'Count. His family had once been prominent in the part of Mississippi where he was born-his lineage included bankers and businessmen-but Faulkner was not much of a student. He took a few literature and language classes but ended up spending more years on campus as the school's postmaster. That didn't last long, either: busy playing cards and golfing during business hours, he neglected to forward mail, misdelivered some letters while throwing others in the garbage, refused to prepare return receipts, and, when he could be bothered to open the office at all, often sat inside it working on his first book.\n\nThat was a collection of poetry, \"The Marble Faun,\" probably the most traditional and certainly the least remarkable of all the books Faulkner published-he borrowed the title from Nathaniel Hawthorne and the style from the Romantics and the Symbolists. But the prose that followed was all his own. Faulkner's fiction does not have influences so much as analogues. He burned down houses with the gothic zeal of Edgar Allan Poe, staged moral crises as dramatically as Dostoyevsky, and fashioned fanatics who would have pleased Herman Melville. He created characters who migrated from one novel to another, and he wrote stream-of-consciousness narration that featured broken syntax and typographical experiments. A single, almost thirteen-hundred-word sentence in \"Absalom, Absalom!\" includes parentheses, question marks, granddaughters, spinsters, demons, dragons, chickens, coffins, Washington, Lincoln, and Faustus.\n\nThat novel has many narrative voices, but the character connecting them is Quentin Compson, who also appears in \"The Sound and the Fury,\" published seven years earlier. Quentin is a descendant of a Confederate general and a governor of Mississippi and the heir to an estate first acquired from a Chickasaw chief in the early nineteenth century, now crumbling in the center of town and subdivided to cover the cost of his college tuition. \"The Sound and the Fury\" has four sections, each devoted to a different character: Quentin, his brothers Benjy and Jason, and the Compson family's cook, Dilsey. The novel is a passion play in which the two heirs to authority and power are deceitful and depraved and the two reviled members of society are honorable and decent. The novel begins on Holy Saturday inside the constrained and tender consciousness of Benjy, who is profoundly mentally disabled, and it ends on Easter Sunday with Dilsey, whose sincere piety and caregiving contrast with the degeneracy of the family she serves and that of the former Confederacy, in which she is trapped. While the sections focussed on Benjy, Quentin, and Jason are told in the first person and reflect the wandering or wayward character of their minds, the final section features an omniscient narrator and includes a sermon on how society is redeemed by its least respected members. Listening in the sanctuary are the \"idiot\" of the Compson family, who is Christlike in his needs, and their Black servant, who is Christlike in meeting them.\n\nThe last shall be first, and in Faulkner's novel they already are. For all their philosophizing, Jason and Quentin and their father cannot reason their way out of evil and toward goodness. An American Hamlet, Quentin is half mad and half in love with his sister; he is so consumed by his obsession with sexual purity and racial honor that not even leaving the South for Harvard allows him to escape the fate of all the other failed members of his family. It is from one of his desolate soliloquies that Gorra takes the title of his book. Sitting in his dorm room more than a thousand miles from Mississippi, Quentin reconstructs a partial memory of something his father once told him: \"every man is the arbiter of his own virtues but let no man prescribe for another mans well-being and i temporary and he was the saddest word of all there is nothing else in the world its not despair until time its not even time until it was.\"\n\nA lawyer by training and an alcoholic by nature, Quentin's father is a source of torment to all four of his children-the three boys and their sister, Caddy. Although the family's fortune is wasted, the father remains obsessed with the power and wealth of the earlier generations, living in the land of \"was\" rather than \"is\" or \"will be,\" subjecting his children to his theories of time and ethics and civilization, so preoccupied with the past that he can offer them no way to live in the present or prepare for the future. That is why, just before Quentin commits suicide, he returns to the \"saddest word\" speech, breaking his grandfather's pocket watch to stop time and arriving at his own idea of tragedy: \"Again. Sadder than was. Again. Saddest of all. Again.\"\n\nIn \"The Saddest Words,\" Gorra posits that Quentin represents Faulkner's view of tragedy as recurrence. \"Again\" was the saddest word for the character and the author alike because it \"suggests that what was has simply gone on happening, a cycle of repetition that replays itself, forever.\" Both the real and the fictional Southerner were trapped in that cycle, aware that the fall of the Confederacy was right and just but unable to shed their sympathy for the antebellum South. \"What was is never over,\" Gorra writes, pointing out that the racism that ensnared Faulkner in the last century persists in this one: \"There have been moments in our history, brief ones, when the meaning of the Civil War has seemed settled. This isn't one of them, not when the illusion that this country might become a postracial society lies in tatters. Again . That's precisely why Faulkner remains so valuable-that very recurrence makes him necessary.\"\n\nPlenty of Faulkner's characters appear in multiple novels and stories, but Quentin represents the height of the writer's talents and the depths of his identification with his doomed protagonists. Faulkner's pessimism, notable even among the Lost Generation, seemed prescient during the civil-rights movement, and seems even more so today. His \"Again . . . Again . . . Again\" is the American version of Shakespeare's tragic invocation, in \"Macbeth,\" of \"To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow.\" A novelist born a full generation after the end of the Confederacy insists that he would have no choice but to repeat the racist and secessionist violence of his ancestors; a country a hundred and fifty-five years past its Civil War is still violently divided over the flags and monuments of that conflict.\n\nGorra argues that the racism and the failures in moral reasoning that characterized Faulkner's life refract brilliantly in the work: \"They speak to us of a riven soul; of a battle in which the right side doesn't always win.\" Rather than separating the artist from his art, Gorra suggests that the two are entwined; Faulkner's racism informed his devastating portrayals of it. Earlier Faulkner apologists tried to minimize aspects of his politics that they found disagreeable, whether by denying their existence, insisting that he could have been worse, or mendaciously elevating selected parts of his biography as if they excused all the rest, like the eulogy he delivered for his family's Black maid, Caroline Barr, to whom he dedicated his book \"Go Down, Moses.\" But there is no defending Faulkner's character, only his characters. As the writer himself knew, the best art will always exceed the artist who creates it. Transcendence isn't just an aesthetic experience for readers; it can be one for writers, too.\n\nFew of Faulkner's contemporaries, even those who addressed the horrors of the war or the racial segregation that followed, wrote about the intimate versions of those conflicts-the sexual exploitation of slavery, the realities of interracial love, the social and emotional entanglements of Black and white families, the lived experience of miscegenation, and the perils of passing. Faulkner's novels, meanwhile, are full of confusion over racial identity, with mixed-race characters struggling to determine their origins, or knowing them and struggling to understand how they fit into the world, and, either way, struggling to find an identity that can sustain them in a racially essentialist society. These characters include some of the most remarkable creations in American fiction: Joe Christmas, Clytemnestra Sutpen, Charles Bon, Lucas Beauchamp. Faulkner also wrote white characters who were obsessed with racial categories, like Quentin, who sits beside a Black man on an integrated streetcar in Massachusetts, thinking, \"A nigger is not a person so much as a form of behavior; a sort of obverse reflection of the white people he lives among.\"\n\nWhile Baldwin excluded these characters from his consideration of Faulkner's politics, other Black writers have drawn inspiration from them. The novelist Toni Morrison wrote her master's thesis partly on Faulkner and his depictions of what she called \"alienated\" individuals, including Quentin. The scholar James A. Snead observed in his study of Faulkner, \"Figures of Division,\" that, in a society of polarity, where people were divided into strict categories of male or female, rich or poor, white or Black, the writer saw through such dichotomies: \"Faulkner's genealogical research discovers not purity but rather merging and chaos, states against which the traditions of social classification and division vainly struggle.\" What Faulkner recognized was the ubiquity of such struggles over identity and their centrality to the American experience-the way that the question \"Who am I?\" is always connected to the question \"Who are we?\"\n\nGorra is most captivating when he tends to these pervasive private battles, leaving military sites and other tourist destinations behind. \"The Saddest Words\" lags only when it turns into a travelogue of his adventures in Faulklandia: visits to Faulkner's ancestral graveyard in Ripley, Mississippi; to the grand estate he bought in Oxford and called Rowan Oak; to the Confederate statuary on Monument Avenue, in Richmond, and the present-day Emmitsburg Road, in Gettysburg. A park ranger can provide a better tour of the troop movements at Shiloh; a literature professor can articulate what a novel does with such history. Gorra has thought for decades about Faulkner's writing, and he is a remarkably illuminating teacher-in one masterly paragraph, he explicates the first sentence of \"Absalom, Absalom!,\" pointing out how its adjectives become verbs and pile up like cars in a traffic jam, and how the place it describes is so stuffy and static that the only things moving within it are motes of dust. Of the novel as a whole, Gorra writes, \"No one can read it quickly or even entirely with pleasure, but anyone who can hear its flowered dissonance will know that such books are why we read at all.\"\n\nQuentin Compson, Gorra points out, is a broken vessel for all this history and description; Faulkner's readers are guided by \"the fractured mind of a boy who seems already half-ghost.\" Faulkner knew that the tortured self was his own true subject, and his narrators are always wrecked by the knowledge they possess. In his acceptance speech for the Nobel Prize, Faulkner said that it was \"the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself which alone can make good writing because only that is worth writing about, worth the agony and the sweat.\"\n\nRace was the most salient manifestation of that conflict for Faulkner's characters, and for Faulkner himself. As Baldwin suggested, Faulkner had pleaded with civil-rights activists for \"time in which the Southerner will come to terms with himself.\" Yet Faulkner's own novels acknowledged that a century had not been enough time for that peace to be made.\n\nAfter Faulkner was gone, his family continued to demonstrate how Quentin's \"Again . . . Again . . . Again\" was not fiction but fact. Faulkner died in the summer of 1962, at the age of sixty-four. A few months later, federal courts ordered the University of Mississippi to admit its first Black student, James Meredith. The state legislature passed a bill declaring that those charged with crimes of moral turpitude could not be admitted as students to a state university, and, the day it became law, Meredith was convicted of voter fraud, a crime he had not committed. The Kennedy Administration intervened to secure his admission, sending hundreds of federal law-enforcement officers to accompany Meredith when he enrolled.\n\nTwo people died and more than a hundred and fifty federal marshals were injured in the ensuing riots, which became known as the Battle of Oxford. As Gorra notes, that battle featured Faulkners on both sides. Six years after the novelist declared that if it came down to it he would fight for Mississippi against his nation, one of his nephews broke an arm commanding the local National Guard unit enforcing the federal integration order. That man's brother was among those who rioted. ♦\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast. All rights reserved.

The film, for example, made its run while civil-rights activists, engaging in direct action, experi-enced intense and sometimes violent reprisals. Certainly, more than a few Northern liberals found Lee's carefully contrived courtroom melodrama in Maycomb far less discomfiting than the moral dramas pressed upon them by James Meredith, in Oxford, Mississippi, the Freedom Riders in Anniston, Alabama, or Fred Shuttlesworth and the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights, in Birmingham. The book and the film, when considered in the historical context of their reception, tell us, at the very least, that American liberalism has often meant a certain squeamishness about the use of radical forms of direct action to achieve goals, however noble they might be.\n\nPeter Kuryla\n\nNashville, Tenn.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Civil-Rights Showdown Nobody Remembers\n\nWhen the Supreme Court handed down its decision in Brown v. Board of Education, on May 17, 1954, it was big news. The Times gave the story banner headlines and ten pages of coverage. The case had been before the Justices since 1952, and it was common knowledge that a decision had been in the works. Many people probably anticipated the outcome, although maybe not that the opinion would be unanimous. Everyone, though, had the same question: Now what?\n\nThere is a reason for all the Hogwarts-like trappings that surround the Supreme Court-the super-secret conferences, the ban on cameras, the fact that the Justices read their opinions from a dais, that they never hold press conferences, that they wear black robes. All this gravitas masks the reality that the Court's powers are largely paper powers. When the Court issues an opinion, it is basically waving a wand in the hope that something will happen. As Alexander Hamilton put it, the Court \"has no influence over either the sword or the purse.\" The sword belongs to the executive branch, as does the Department of Justice, and unless an Administration is prepared to enforce the Court's decisions the Court is almost powerless to see that they are carried out.\n\nThe man who wrote the Brown opinion, Chief Justice Earl Warren, had reason to believe that the President would not be especially thrilled with the decision, so there might be enforcement issues. Dwight Eisenhower 's record on civil rights was mixed. He had commanded a segregated military in the Second World War, but he followed through on Harry Truman's order to desegregate the armed forces, he supported the desegregation of public schools in the District of Columbia (a federal jurisdiction), and his Attorney General, Herbert Brownell, Jr., submitted a brief in Brown that recommended public-school segregation be declared a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's guarantee of \"the equal protection of the laws,\" which is exactly what the Court did declare.\n\nDiscover notable new fiction, nonfiction, and poetry.\n\nBut, like every twentieth-century President before him, Eisenhower found it convenient to regard race relations as a local matter and to see discrimination as a moral question. He took the position, a common one in the period, that you cannot change people's hearts by passing a law. What this position elided, of course, was that Jim Crow was a legal regime. White people and Black people were not separated simply by custom or by choice. Separation was enforced by legal sanction, and Southern legislatures kept finding new activities to segregate. In Birmingham, Blacks and whites were forbidden by law from playing checkers together.\n\nLike many opponents of Brown, Eisenhower ignored the fact that the whole purpose of the Fourteenth Amendment is to make state-ordered discrimination a federal matter. That is why four of the five school-segregation cases that were consolidated in Brown had been filed in federal courts. In the subsequent six and a half years of his Presidency, Eisenhower never endorsed the Brown decision. The most he would say was that if the Supreme Court declared it to be the law he was bound to obey it. Nevertheless, there would come a day when he would have to unsheathe the sword.\n\nChief Justice Warren was not new to the political arena. He had been elected governor of California three times, and in 1948 he was the Republican candidate for Vice-President, on the ticket with Thomas E. Dewey. Getting unanimity in Brown, a case on which the Justices had been split before Warren joined the Court, was a triumph of ego management (which is a lot of what the Chief's job is).\n\nAfter the ruling, Warren paused the \"Now what?\" question for a year. Even before the Brown opinion came down, two states, South Carolina and Georgia, had threatened to close their public schools if segregation was outlawed. Another of the Chief's duties is to guard the legitimacy of the Court. Warren did not want to wave a wand and have nothing happen. He waited until May 31, 1955, in a decision known as Brown II, to spell out how the Court's ruling was to be implemented.\n\nSeventeen states had laws mandating segregation, and four states permitted it-close to half the country. Each school district in those states faced a different set of challenges to desegregation. Warren reasoned that since federal district courts are closer to the ground than the Supreme Court, in far-off Washington, they were better positioned to set the terms for desegregation. The cases in Brown that had been in federal court were therefore remanded to the district courts in which they had originated, and those courts were instructed to \"take such proceedings and enter such orders and decrees . . . as are necessary and proper to admit to public schools on a racially nondiscriminatory basis with all deliberate speed the parties to these cases.\"\n\nThe slightly oxymoronic phrase \"all deliberate speed\" turned out to be a booby trap. It allowed segregationists to argue that \"deliberate\" might mean taking, say, a generation or so. That was one problem with Brown II. Another was that, in order to trigger the desegregation process, parties had either to petition their local school boards or, failing that, to bring suit in federal court. Courts could not order a school to desegregate unless someone asked them to do so.\n\nNot many people have the wherewithal to go to court, and certainly not many Black Southerners in 1955 did. The N.A.A.C.P., which had litigated almost all the cases in Brown, stepped in to organize the effort. But, by setting no timetable for compliance-something that both the N.A.A.C.P. and the Justice Department had urged it to do-the Court left the door open to all manner of procrastination. And the federal government remained on the sidelines. The effort to destroy Jim Crow, which had been under way for decades and which finally got traction with Brown, would take ten more years to complete.\n\nOne lawsuit was already in the courts. In 1950, five schoolchildren and their parents and guardians, represented by N.A.A.C.P. lawyers, brought suit in federal court against the Anderson County, Tennessee, Board of Education. The plaintiffs argued that Black children in their town, Clinton, were being denied equal protection: they were required to travel, by bus, twenty miles to an all-Black school in another county, even though a white school was just down the street. The district court ruled that, because some white students were obliged to take a bus to Clinton, the schools were \"separate but equal,\" the standard the Supreme Court had set in Plessy v. Ferguson , back in 1896.\n\nWhen the plaintiffs appealed, the case was put on hold by the appellate court, pending the decision in Brown. In Brown, of course, the Court overruled Plessy, and when Brown II was handed down the Tennessee case was sent back to the district court, which, in January, ordered Clinton High School to be integrated \"not later than the beginning of the fall term of the present year of 1956.\" Clinton High thus became the first Southern high school to be desegregated by court order.\n\nClinton was a town of around four thousand, in eastern Tennessee, about fifteen miles from Knoxville. It was the seat of what was then southern Appalachia's wealthiest county, Anderson County, which includes Oak Ridge, a city built by the federal government, in 1942, as a site for the Manhattan Project. Clinton High was one of the best public schools in Tennessee. The town had no history of racial friction, and its Black population was small, less than three hundred, most of whom lived in a neighborhood known as Freedman's Hill.\n\nThe governor of Tennessee, Frank Clement, although opposed to integration in principle, had vowed to abide by Brown. The state's senators-Albert Gore, Sr., and Estes Kefauver-were, along with Lyndon Johnson, of Texas, the only Southern senators not to sign the so-called Southern Manifesto, a statement endorsed by some hundred United States senators and congressmen, accusing the Supreme Court of an abuse of power. So no one expected trouble in Clinton. How wrong they were is the subject of Rachel Louise Martin's \" A Most Tolerant Little Town \" (Simon & Schuster).\n\nGiven that people today have generally heard of Selma and Birmingham and Little Rock, and many people know about the integration of the University of Georgia (by Charlayne Hunter and Hamilton Holmes, in 1961), the University of Mississippi (by James Meredith, in 1962), and the University of Alabama (by Vivian Malone and James Hood, in 1963), it's a little strange, as Martin says, that Clinton is not on the standard civil-rights time line. But in 1956 what was happening in Clinton was news around the world.\n\nSince Clinton High was the first school to test Brown, the media were alert to signs of trouble. When trouble appeared, they swarmed. This did not have a calming effect. The battle of Clinton High was covered by CBS, NBC, ABC, the Associated Press, and Reuters. Time reported on it. Life sent a photographer. There was a correspondent from a London paper. Clinton was front-page news in the New York Times and the New York Herald Tribune , whose Paris edition was distributed in Europe. Edward R. Murrow narrated a fifty-minute documentary, \"Clinton and the Law,\" on his popular CBS program, \"See It Now.\" David Halberstam reported from Clinton early in his career.\n\nClinton has since been written about quite a bit by historians, partly because the journalistic record is so rich. In 1966, one of the teachers at Clinton High, Margaret Anderson, published a book on the struggle to integrate the school, \" The Children of the South .\" And a feature documentary called \"The Clinton 12,\" directed by Keith Henry McDaniel and narrated by James Earl Jones, was released in 2006. Martin also draws on a collection of works by June Adamson. But Martin has done her own research and expanded on the existing record.\n\nThings began peacefully enough. At the end of August, 1956, twelve Black students registered to attend Clinton High. The school's principal, David Brittain, was committed to following the law, and the white students seemed accepting. Shortly after classes started, though, picketers appeared outside the school, Brittain began receiving ominous phone calls, nightly rallies formed, and the situation rapidly descended into chaos.\n\nIt seemed that there was more racial animosity in Clinton than met the eye. By the end of the school year, pretty much every item in the apparatus of Southern civil-rights resistance had made an appearance in Clinton, from anti-Black slurs and heckling to cross burnings, bombings, and Ku Klux Klan night riders. A hundred state highway patrolmen and more than six hundred National Guardsmen drove into town with armored personnel carriers and seven M-41 Walker Bulldog tanks.\n\nThe picketers grew increasingly abusive. Cars passing through Clinton with Black passengers were attacked by mobs (activities duly captured by Life's photographers). White students inside the school started harassing the Black students. A white minister was beaten by a gang of whites after he walked Black students to school. Some Black students dropped out; one was expelled. A few white students refused to attend altogether.\n\nStill, in 1957, Clinton High became the first integrated school in the South to graduate a Black student, Bobby Cain (though white students tried to beat him up after the ceremony), and by the fall of 1957 things were close to normal. The school had a new principal, journalists were barred from the premises, and when nine Black students registered only one protester stood outside. Attendance was full.\n\nIt was a false dawn. In October of the following year, Clinton High was destroyed by dynamite. No one was injured, and the bomber was never apprehended. When the county requested federal aid (people were already sending in donations from around the country), Eisenhower responded that the government cannot \"step in with money every time something goes wrong with a school from a water faucet on up.\" Terrorism, too, was a local matter.\n\nMartin interviewed many of the survivors, including most of the Black students who had formed the Clinton Twelve. Some key actors are dead. Paul Turner, the minister who was beaten, died by suicide in 1980, apparently still traumatized by the experience. Unsurprisingly, Martin evidently had trouble getting many of the anti-integration protesters to talk with her. Most of them probably faded back into the woodwork many years ago, but they are the ones that it would be most interesting to hear from. How do they justify hating on schoolchildren? Martin is a good storyteller, though, and Clinton is a good story.\n\nIt's a good story in part because it's typical. What happened in Clinton was a kind of preview of what would happen all across the South during the period. But the Clinton story has a few atypical elements, too. There is, for example, a weird connection to English departments.\n\nWhat seems to have catalyzed the change in Clinton almost overnight, from reluctant acceptance to violent resistance, was the arrival of a man named John Kasper. He was not a Southerner. He was a bookstore owner from New Jersey who went to the South on a mission to fight desegregation by any means necessary.\n\nKasper appeared in Clinton the weekend before the start of classes, carrying a list of names associated with an outfit called the Tennessee Federation for Constitutional Government. He found a pay phone and began calling. Then he rang doorbells. Did people know that Black students were about to attend the local high school? Didn't they want to do something about it? White citizens began gathering in the courthouse square, where Kasper harangued them about their right to ignore Brown. He was duly arrested, for vagrancy and for attempting to incite a riot, and thrown in jail, but the charges were dismissed for lack of evidence. When he got out, he went right back to work, and by the time the Black students got to school there were at least a hundred protesters there to welcome them.\n\nKasper was a rabble-rouser. He was arrested many times in his career as an agitator. He was never convicted of vigilante violence, but he certainly encouraged it, and he was believed to have been behind various bombings. It has also been speculated that he was the man who blew up Clinton High. Eventually, the jail time wore him down, and he retired from segregationist activism in 1960, after completing a sentence of six months of hard labor in the Davidson County workhouse, in Nashville.\n\nThe interesting thing about Kasper is that he was a disciple of Ezra Pound , a fact that Martin mentions but does not spend a lot of time on-understandably, since it's tangential to her story. Their relationship has been traced in detail by Clive Webb, in \" Rabble Rousers \" (2010), and by Alec Marsh, in \" John Kasper and Ezra Pound: Saving the Republic \" (2015). The connection tells us something about the unholy mixture of antisemitism, anti-Communism, and conspiracy theory which was part of the Southern resistance to desegregation, and which still circulates in the American body politic. Racism is only one ingredient in this cocktail.\n\nKasper seems to have encountered Pound's writings around 1950, when he was a student at Columbia. Martin gives the impression, as have others, that Kasper was a graduate of Columbia College. This is a little misleading; his degree came from Columbia's School of General Studies, an adult-education program. At the time, Pound was in a mental hospital, St. Elizabeths, in Washington, D.C. He had been there since December, 1945, when he was declared unfit to stand trial for treason, a charge stemming from his broadcasts on Italian radio during the war. (He made hundreds of them, from 1941 until his arrest by American forces, in 1945.)\n\nIn fact, Pound was never medically diagnosed. It's possible that the American government did not want to be in the position of executing a poet, and putting him in St. Elizabeths seemed the most convenient way to hold him accountable. Pound called it \"the bughouse.\" He would not be released until 1958, when he returned to Italy (something that the government should have arranged a lot sooner).\n\nPound was not crazy, nor was he repentant, and he received a steady stream of visitors to his hospital room. One was John Kasper, starting when he was twenty-one years old. Pound was always good to his disciples, and Kasper was more than a disciple. He was an acolyte, something that Pound, situated as he was, couldn't resist.\n\nFighting desegregation was not high on Pound's list of causes. The Jews were his lifelong obsession, and it was his antisemitism that first drew in Kasper. Pound was also a Jeffersonian, however. He hated the federal government-which was secretly run, of course, by Jews-so he could get behind the states'-rights argument against court-mandated desegregation.\n\nKasper had socialized with Black people at his bookstore (he opened one in New York City but relocated it to Washington, apparently to be closer to Pound), and he had even dated a Black woman. But he recognized that anti-integration agitation was not incompatible with the Poundian program, which included a horror of interbreeding. And both men agreed that the N.A.A.C.P. was a tool of Jews and Communists. Pound gave Kasper encouragement and free rein to wreak what havoc he could. As he put it in a letter to a friend, Kasper \"at least got a little publicity for the NAACP being run by kikes not by coons.\"\n\nKasper and Pound were in touch continually, to the point that their public association delayed Pound's release from St. Elizabeths. The Justice Department needed Kasper to go away before they were willing to set Pound free. After Pound got to Italy, Kasper tried to reach him, but Pound avoided him. They never met again. But during the period of Kasper's anti-integration activism Ezra Pound was in the mix.\n\nAnother odd wrinkle in the Clinton story has to do with the Tennessee Federation for Constitutional Government, the group that supplied the list of people Kasper called in Clinton. Martin mentions this group in passing. She doesn't tell us that the federation was founded in 1955 by a man named Donald Davidson, who served as its chairman. (His vice-chair was a sculptor, Jack Kershaw, who once defended his statue of the Confederate general Nathan Bedford Forrest by insisting that \"somebody needs to say a good word for slavery.\") Davidson, a poet, essayist, and journal editor, played a role in the founding of a method of literary interpretation called the New Criticism.\n\nThe New Criticism arose at Vanderbilt, in Nashville, where Davidson taught, and nearly all the first generation of New Critics were Southern partisans and Yankee-haters, opponents of secularism, liberalism, and modernity. Davidson was among the men behind \"I'll Take My Stand,\" a now notorious anthology of pro-Dixie, anti-Northern ideology by Southern writers and professors.\n\nThe New Critics addressed the South's race problem mainly by avoiding the subject. They were formalists. Politics wasn't meant to play any part in their criticism. Davidson was the exception. In 1948, when the Dixiecrat Strom Thurmond, of South Carolina, ran for President on a segregationist platform, Davidson was an enthusiastic supporter, and helped get him on the ballot. (Thurmond carried four states.) By the time of Brown, Davidson's overt racism had alienated most of his former Vanderbilt colleagues.\n\nDavidson was not a bomb-thrower like Kasper. He was what Martin (who doesn't mention him) would designate a \"law-and-order segregationist.\" He campaigned for a legal reversal of Brown, though it was not clear what body, apart from the Supreme Court, was in a position to do such a thing. When classes started in Clinton, the federation organized a rally. (Davidson was in Vermont, teaching at the Bread Loaf Writers' Conference.) And it petitioned an Anderson County court to enjoin the high school from admitting Black students, on the ground that a Tennessee law prohibited integrated schools from receiving state money. The suit backfired when Davidson appealed and the Tennessee Supreme Court seized the occasion to declare the state's school-segregation laws to be unconstitutional.\n\nAll the original New Critics except Davidson had moved North by 1956, and the New Criticism had become the dominant mode of literary pedagogy and interpretation in the academy. As for Pound, he was not cancelled; his literary reputation hardly suffered. His publisher, New Directions, kept issuing collections of his writings. Among Pound's visitors at St. Elizabeths was virtually every important American poet, who would listen to him while he explained how things were and how things ought to be. These people all knew what Pound's politics were, including the antisemitism. They just put it aside as a regrettable eccentricity.\n\nIn 1957, Kasper and a dozen other activists were put on trial for defying an injunction against interfering with the desegregation of Clinton High. Davidson's federation supported many of the defendants financially, and when seven of them (including Kasper) were convicted Davidson issued a statement. \"The jury stand sat a bulwark between potential judicial tyranny and the people,\" he said. \"The jury sitting in judgment . . . will go down in history as a tragic failure.\" Which sounds like an argument for jury nullification.\n\nIt was just over a year after the desegregation of Clinton High that Eisenhower finally unsheathed the sword. When the governor of Arkansas, Orval Faubus, called on the state's National Guard to prevent nine Black students from entering Central High School, in Little Rock, Eisenhower, after agonizing privately, federalized the Guard and sent in the 101st Airborne, to insure the students' safety. The Black students were able to attend.\n\nBut the following fall the state legislature closed all public high schools in Little Rock for a year. Southern states had always threatened this as an option. In 1959, Prince Edward County, in Virginia, closed its public schools for five years. Speed was very deliberate across the South. By 1964, ten years after Brown, less than two per cent of Black students in the South attended school with whites.\n\nWhat happened in Little Rock is better known than what happened in Clinton in part because Little Rock was the first time that the federal government sent troops to enforce a desegregation order (it would not be the last), and in part because the Arkansas government, unlike the Tennessee government, actively resisted court desegregation orders and barred Black students from entering a white school.\n\nAs familiar as the school-desegregation story is, a couple of things jump out in Martin's telling. One is how profoundly divided the races were in the Jim Crow states. They had no conception of each other's \"lived experience,\" as we would call it today. The white people in Clinton knew nothing about the Black people. Because segregation seemed to work so well, whites appear to have assumed that Black life was separate but similar.\n\nIn the Murrow documentary, David Brittain, the Clinton High School principal, was interviewed at length. The campaign of harassment against him had clearly worn him down, and he struggles to explain what it had been like. \"It just presses you down every day, lower and lower,\" he says. \"And to me it is an amazing thing that an American citizen living in the United States has to be subjected to this while the lawless citizens, those who refuse to abide or accept the law, continue to run free.\" Did it occur to him that he was only feeling something that every Black person in Tennessee felt every day?\n\nThe other striking thing in Martin's account is that virtually every white person involved in the desegregation of Clinton High School was a segregationist. No one, except possibly some of the teachers, was actually in favor of integration. That included the principal, who did not permit the Black students to interact socially with the white students or to participate in extracurriculars. (The law said that they could get an education; that was it.) It included the governor, who, after sending in the National Guard, largely washed his hands of the mess. It even included the minister who was beaten.\n\nAnd it included the captain of the football team and student-body president, Jerry Shattuck, who organized the football players to safeguard Black students in the hallways. Shattuck didn't like the idea of integration, either. He just thought, as the minister thought, that it was wrong to harass people, regardless of their race. The Black students in Clinton had defenders who believed in upholding the law, and there were white people who were prepared to put up with them. But no one really wanted them.\n\nThis brings us to the real scandal of Brown. The Supreme Court finally interpreted the equal-protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment as it had been intended: to protect Black Americans from state-ordered discrimination. The Court was not wrong when it held public-school segregation laws unconstitutional. But its decision placed the burden of desegregation-not just some of the burden, the entire burden-on children. Schoolchildren, both white and Black, were required (few volunteered) to do something that no adult was required to do. Socialized since birth to avoid unnecessary contact with the other race, they were suddenly expected to handle a situation that their parents, outside of military service, had never been asked to handle.\n\nLabor unions and police forces and fire companies were not required to integrate in 1954. Restaurants and hotels and theatres were not required to integrate. Places of business were not required to integrate. Water fountains and bus stations and city parks were not required to integrate. Only public schools were required to integrate.\n\nClinton High School had eight hundred students. It was insane to send twelve Black teen-agers in there while demonstrators screamed abuse outside and there was not a single Black teacher in the building. It was insane to send nine Black teen-agers into Central High School in Little Rock with eighteen hundred white students and no Black teachers. It was insane to ask one Black adolescent, fifteen-year-old Dorothy Counts, to walk a gantlet of taunting whites so that she could single-handedly integrate Harry P. Harding High School, in Charlotte, North Carolina. Desegregation was a war.

      "text": "An Education in Georgia\n\nBy May 17, 1954, when the United States Supreme Court declared racial segregation in public education unconstitutional, most Southern states had already desegregated their state universities, some voluntarily and some under a prophetic series of Supreme Court rulings on the practical inequality of \"separate but equal\" education. After the 1954 decision, some of the states had to pretend that the Negroes attending their universities with whites did not exist; otherwise, a good deal of the oratory of the late fifties would have been impossible. In 1957, for instance, when Governor Orval Faubus, of Arkansas, decided that the enrollment of a dozen Negro students in Central High School in Little Rock would result, as surely as election follows the Democratic nomination, in a breakdown of public order, the University of Arkansas had been integrated for nine years. Jimmie Davis promised the voters of Louisiana in 1959 that he would go to jail before allowing a Negro to attend classes with whites, and was elected governor on that platform, in a state whose university had been integrated for eight years. And a year later, when the Louisiana legislature passed a whole string of bizarre bills designed to prevent even the token integration of the New Orleans public schools, four hundred and twenty-five Negroes were attending the New Orleans branch of Louisiana State University.\n\nIn the states of the Deep South where no Negroes attended white universities before 1954, the first assault on segregation came in higher education, and came after the battle lines were drawn, with the result that it was considered as much of a threat to the system as if it had come in the grade schools or the high schools. The Negro students involved had none of the anonymity of those who had integrated the universities of Arkansas, Louisiana, Virginia, North Carolina, and Tennessee, nor were they blurred by inclusion in a group, like the teen-agers in Little Rock or the four first-graders in New Orleans. One after another, they became famous, but only for two or three weeks, their names, in some cases, fading so quickly from the news that many people now find it hard to keep them straight: Autherine Lucy, at the University of Alabama; Charlayne Hunter and Hamilton Holmes, at the University of Georgia; James H. Meredith, at the University of Mississippi; Harvey Gantt, at Clemson College, in South Carolina. Student Heroes of a strange new kind, they were famed for no achievements in athletics or scholarship but merely for showing up to attend classes. Their presence was the test of the desegregation order, whether the test resulted in successful defiance, as in Alabama, where Autherine Lucy was expelled after three days for accusing the university administration of complicity in the riots that accompanied her arrival, or in peaceful compliance, as in South Carolina, where the state authorities decided in advance that upon Harvey Gantt's admission to Clemson order would be self-consciously maintained. Nowhere was the test more decisive than in Georgia, where Charlayne Hunter and Hamilton Holmes, two Negroes from Atlanta, entered the state university, in Athens, in January of 1961. During their first week at the university-which began in relative calm, was climaxed by their both being suspended \"for their own safety\" after a riot, and ended with their both returning to the campus, under a new court order-Georgia abandoned its policy of all-out resistance and accepted desegregated education.\n\nAccording to the lawyer for the plaintiffs, an Atlanta Negro named Donald Hollowell, the University of Georgia case was \"the case that turned the state around and allowed them to start, or at least to see , what was in the other direction.\" Few would disagree with his belief that the enrollment of Charlayne and Hamilton in the university was the turning point for Georgia, being accomplished in a way and at a time that made it inevitable (a word formerly scorned and now almost popular in Georgia) that the state would move forward rather than backward. The walk out of the Deep South mentality has been accelerated a good deal since then by a federal-court ruling against the County Unit System, which formerly made Georgia the only State to elect not only its legislature but its governors, senators, and congressmen by a voting system designed to favor the rural voter, and the atmosphere in Georgia now is far different from what it was when Charlayne and Hamilton showed up in Athens on a cold Monday morning two and a half years ago. Among the Student Heroes, Charlayne and Hamilton have another distinction, too. They are the first to have completed their education, or at least their undergraduate education. Since both entered the University of Georgia after completing the first half of their sophomore year elsewhere-Hamilton had gone to Morehouse, a private Negro men's college in Atlanta, and Charlayne to Wayne University, in Detroit, during the year and a half it took them to get into Georgia after first applying for admission-they graduated this June, both in good standing and Hamilton as a Phi Beta Kappa. As a reporter then based in Atlanta, I had covered both the week-long trial that resulted in their admission and the events that followed their arrival on campus in 1961, and this spring, ten weeks before Charlayne and Hamilton graduated, I returned to Georgia from New York, where I had been living, to see how integration had worked out at the University of Georgia-whether or not the Student Heroes had ever become simply students. And because this question involved not only the university's attitude toward them but their attitude toward the university, I began by trying to find out how these two young people had happened to become Student Heroes in the first place. Both had always been considered perfectly cast for the role. Good-looking and well dressed, they seemed to be light-complexioned  Negro versions of ideal college students-models for an autumn Coca-Cola ad in a Negro magazine. Both had attended Turner High School in Atlanta, and Charlayne, a slim, attractive girl with striking hazel eyes, had edited the school paper, had been crowned Miss Turner, and had finished third in her graduating class. The valedictorian that year was Hamilton, who had been president of the senior class and, as a promisingly shifty halfback, co-captain of the football team. Since Charlayne and Hamilton had been such unlikely targets for abuse from the start, and had eventually been joined at the university by several other Negro undergraduates, the situation, looked at from a distance, seemed rather heartening. None of the stories from Georgia about school integration had mentioned any violence done to the pioneers. They had dealt instead with the peaceful integration of public schools in Atlanta and the admission of Negroes to Georgia Tech in September of 1961 without even the pressure of a court case. The atmosphere was such that Emory University, a private school in Atlanta, had been able to desegregate its nursing school voluntarily and was planning the integration of its medical school, having already chosen Hamilton Holmes as its first Negro medical student. But I knew from occasional communications I had had from Charlayne and Hamilton since they entered the university that the general progress of the State of Georgia often did not seem closely related to the day-to-day problems facing the first Negroes at the University of Georgia. I was reminded of this again by Charlayne's reply to a letter I wrote her announcing my plans to revisit the campus. \"Well, this is Brotherhood Week in Athens,\" she concluded, with characteristic irony, \"and I'm going out to stand on the street corner and wait for an invitation to lunch.\"\n\nAtlanta, called the Dogwood City on the city-limits signs, claims to have the most beautiful spring in America, and on my first day there the claim seemed justified. It was a warm March day, and in the heavily wooded residential sections the white dogwood blossoms were already coming out. Downtown, I saw another rite of spring. Some Negro students-like all students, Negro students are always more likely to protest in the spring-were picketing the Henry Grady Hotel, on Peachtree Street. The pickets, who also included two or three white students, were protesting the white-only policy maintained by the Henry Grady and most other Atlanta hotels. One sign read, \"No Room at This Inn.\" Another, more to the point in a city that prides itself on being concerned chiefly with commercial competition, read, \"Dallas, Houston, and Miami-Why Not Atlanta?\" To anyone who had lived in Atlanta in recent years, it was a familiar sight. The students, solemn and neatly dressed, were walking slowly up and down Peachtree, careful to stay the correct distance apart. Two or three Atlanta policemen, who had been assigned to make certain that the incident could be reported as having resulted in \"no incidents,\" stood in the shade of the hotel, but few of the passing shoppers gave the pickets a glance. I had watched the students picket department stores and movie theatres in Atlanta two years before, and it occurred to me that they would have little left to picket after the restaurants and hotels were desegregated-a move that seemed inevitable. (The word had always had some currency in Atlanta, even when it was not used in the rest of the state.) The hotelkeepers were already under pressure from businessmen, the editors of the newspapers, and members of the city administration, all of whom kept pointing out that hotel segregation might be costing Atlanta millions every year in convention business, plus a possible World's Fair. The progressive Atlanta Constitution , which had only urged reasonable negotiations during previous demonstrations, had just come out flatly for desegregation of the hotels. Race relations in Atlanta, it seemed to me during my stay there, had taken on a faintly Northern flavor, with a lot of talk about brotherhood and the fine relations between the races, and great satisfaction at having schools that were technically integrated but did not actually have many Negroes in classes with whites The last race story I had read about Atlanta was on an essentially Northern topic-housing. The story, which concerned the erection of wooden barricades by the city across two streets between a Negro neighborhood and a white neighborhood that felt itself threatened by infiltration, even had a Northern ending. A judge of the state superior court-not a federal judge-ruled that the roadblocks were obviously racial barriers and were therefore unconstitutional, and he ordered the blemishes on Atlanta's image removed, whereupon the white homeowners, announcing that they had nothing against Negroes, decided to move out of the neighborhood as a group.\n\nThe Atlanta Negro community has traditionally been led by the wealthy businessmen who run the insurance companies, banks, and real-estate offices on Auburn Avenue, and by the presidents of the six private Negro colleges that make up Atlanta University Center, and it has long had a considerable middle class, whose level of prosperity and education is the highest in the Negro South. Negroes have registered freely since 1944, when the white primary was declared unconstitutional, and in the last two mayoral elections in Atlanta the candidate who was elected did not have a white majority. But even though Atlanta was a relatively enlightened city-\"too busy to hate\" a former mayor used to say-it had achieved little integration by the late fifties. The traditional leaders of the Negro community, usually called the Old Leadership, seemed to have settled in to the belief that the white businessmen, always called the Power Structure, would take care of everything in time if the boat remained unrocked and the voting coalition remained unbroken. \"Atlanta was comparing itself to Mississippi and saying how enlightened it was,\" says Whitney Young, Jr., the executive director of the National Urban League and a former dean of the Atlanta University School of Social Work. \"Nothing was really integrated, not even the library or the buses, but the people were beginning to believe their own press clippings-even the Negroes.\" Early in 1958, to make a study of just what had been done in Atlanta toward equality for the one out of every three citizens who was a Negro, Young and several other Negroes, most of whom were in their forties and most of whom had their headquarters on Hunter Street, in the newer Negro district, rather than on Auburn Avenue, started an informal group called the Atlanta Committee for Coöperative Action, or A.C.C.A. The editor of the study, which was published eight months later under the title \"A Second Look,\" was Carl Holman, who was then an English professor at Atlanta University Center's Clark College, and is now the public-information officer for the Civil Rights Commission in Washington. From 1960 to 1962, Holman was also editor of the Atlanta Inquirer , a lively weekly founded during the Atlanta sit-ins by him and some other Negroes who were fed up with the cautious policies of Atlanta's Negro daily newspaper. By the time \"A Second Look\" was published, it had the backing and financial assistance of the Old Leadership, and it immediately became a guide to the action that was needed. The younger men, working through existing organizations whenever that was possible and forming new ones when it wasn't, initiated the action, pulling the Old Leadership behind them-the pattern that integration activities in Atlanta have followed ever since. The man from the A.C.C.A. group who was most concerned with school integration was Jesse Hill, Jr., the energetic young chief actuary of the Atlanta Life Insurance Company, which is the second-largest life-insurance company in Georgia and one of Auburn Avenue's most solid institutions. In 1957, Hill, who was a member of the education committee of the local chapter of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, had enlisted the help of two or three other Negro leaders in an attempt to desegregate the Georgia State College of Business Administration, in Atlanta. Georgia State had the advantages of being a city college with no dormitories, which obviated travel and rooming problems, and of having night sessions. \"In those days,\" Hill told me when I visited him in Atlanta, \"people hesitated to send a seventeen-year-old kid into that hostility, and we were working mainly to get older people to try for the night school. Frankly, we did some real campaigning. We tried to enlist some of the people in our own office, for instance. We got three girls to apply, and we won our court case, although the judge didn't order the plaintiffs admitted. By that time, the state had investigated the girls who were applying and found some illegitimate births and that kind of thing with two, and so they could have been turned down on so-called moral grounds. Also, the state passed a law that said nobody over twenty-one could start as an undergraduate in a Georgia college, which eliminated the third girl and, of course, ended any chance of having older people apply for Georgia State.\"\n\nIn 1958, working quietly (in anti-integration laws passed after the 1954 decision, Georgia strengthened its laws against barratry, or incitement of litigation), Hill and some of the other younger men compiled a list of outstanding seniors in the city's Negro high schools and began to approach those whose academic records were so good that a college would have to find other reasons for rejecting them. Hill talked to about a dozen students, some of whom agreed to consider Georgia State and some of whom were more interested in the University of Georgia or Georgia Tech or the state medical college at Augusta. Ultimately, either because something in their backgrounds made them vulnerable to one kind of attack or another, or because of a final unwillingness to go through with it, none of these actually applied. Then, in June of 1959, Hill found Charlayne and Hamilton.\n\n\"Ordinarily, this is a selling job,\" Hill told me. \"You have to go seek out and work with these people and do quite a bit of selling. That's how it's been with the other kids at Georgia and those at Tech and all. But not Hamilton and Charlayne. They had an almost normal desire to go to the University of Georgia-as normal as you could expect from a Negro in a segregated community. They both knew something about the school; Hamilton had followed the football team, and Charlayne knew all about the journalism school. They were almost like two kids from Northside.\" Northside is a formerly all-white high school in Atlanta's best residential district, and it may be a sign of progress that one of the Negro freshmen at Georgia Tech last year actually was from Northside, having entered it as one of the nine Negro seniors who integrated Atlanta high schools in 1961. \"Hamilton Holmes was on the list,\" Hill went on. \"But I really didn't have to recruit those kids; they almost recruited me. They knew just what they wanted. I took them over to Georgia State. We were after a breakthrough, and we had a good chance there. The judge had retained jurisdiction in the case, and Georgia State had plenty of vacancies, because of this age law. The Atlanta Journal had run pictures of almost empty classrooms. That was important; after all, the University of Georgia kept Charlayne and Hamilton out for a year just by saying they were overcrowded, and it sounded pretty legitimate, on the face of it. Anyway, Charlayne and Hamilton wouldn't hear of going to Georgia State. Both of them wanted to go to Georgia. Why they wanted to go I'll never know, but it happened that that was the right thing. It got straight to the heart of the matter. I think the Governor might have closed Georgia State or the Atlanta high schools if they had come first, but Georgia, with all those legislators' sons over there, and the way everybody in the state feels about it, was different. He wouldn't dare close it.\"\n\nOnce Charlayne and Hamilton had decided to go to Georgia, Hill set out to do battle again with the system that had defeated him in the Georgia State case. He fired the first volley of letters and phone calls through the facilities of Atlanta Life, and then got the local N.A.A.C.P. chapter to put up the money for the legal expenses that were necessarily incurred before the litigation got far enough along to be eligible for aid from the N.A.A.C.P. Legal Defense & Educational Fund, Inc. (a separate corporation from the N.A.A.C.P. itself, and usually called the Inc. Fund, or the Ink Fund). Hill had to make a lot of long-distance calls to find the Turner High School principal, whose signature was required on the application forms and who had left for the summer. Hill went to the Fulton County Courthouse with Charlayne and Hamilton, towing their pastors along as references, and was passed from judge to judge until the clerk of the Fulton County Superior Court finally agreed to certify that both of the young people were residents of the State of Georgia-documentation that the federal court ruled was adequate without the addition of alumni recommendations, which were formerly required and which, naturally, were not easy for Negro applicants to obtain. Hill, Holman, and Young met with Charlayne and Hamilton to warn them of what to expect from Georgia admissions officials and Georgia students. \"I had sent for application blanks and a catalogue and hadn't got them,\" said Hill. \"We wanted to make sure we had them in time. Like most places, the University of Georgia has Negroes to do the cleaning up, and one of the janitors got application blanks and catalogues for us. Every time we took a step, we double-checked. I must have written a hundred letters to the university; they wouldn't tell you anything. Don Hollowell checked every letter. We had to certify it and send it registered mail, receipt requested. Anything that got lost, that was the end of that for another year. It was just like pulling teeth. Carl Holman checked and double-checked the applications. We didn't leave anything to chance. And still, it took a year and a half.\"\n\nThe energy was provided by the same men who had published \"A Second Look.\" In the first weeks after Charlayne and Hamilton applied, the A.C.C.A. group even maintained a nightly patrol of Charlayne's house. (Atlanta has always had more bombings than Southern cities with otherwise less progressive race relations; there were a dozen in the twelve months prior to public-school integration.) Support from the rest of the Negro community varied greatly. Some members thought that Georgia Tech or the Atlanta public schools would be a better place to begin. Others believed that it was rather early to begin anywhere. \"A lot of people were opposed to this,\" Hill told me. \"They said, 'These people are going to take reprisals on us. There'll be a loss of jobs, and all.' During the Georgia State case, one leader of the Negro community said, 'Why'd you take those unwed mothers over there?' After Charlayne and Hamilton applied at Georgia, he said, 'Why'd you take those two fine kids over there?' All we ever got from the older leaders was 'You're going to mess up some kids.' \"\n\nJust why \"two fine kids\" like Hamilton and Charlayne should want to go to any Southern white college is a question that is often asked in the North, where many people take it for granted that a Negro student would go to jail for the right to eat a dime-store hamburger but must have an elaborate motive for going to a formerly all-white school. Most white Southerners have already settled the question to their own satisfaction. They believe that the students are chosen by the N.A.A.C.P.-hand-picked by one of the crafty operators from New York, where all evil finds its source, and probably paid handsomely for their services. The New York-based N.A.A.C.P. conspiracy remains a strong vision to most white Southerners, even though it should be apparent by now that if the N.A.A.C.P. had a tenth of the resources and efficiency they credit it with, segregation would have been eradicated years ago. As for Negroes in Atlanta, when they talk about why Hamilton went to the University of Georgia they usually begin by mentioning his family, and especially his grandfather, Dr. Hamilton Mayo Holmes, who is an Atlanta physician and the family patriarch. Hamilton is not only a third-generation college graduate; he is also a third-generation integrationist. His grandfather, his father, and one of his uncles filed suit to desegregate the Atlanta public golf courses in 1955, and, through a 1956 Supreme Court decision on their case, the courses became the first integrated public facility in Atlanta. I had spent some time with Hamilton's father, Alfred Holmes, during the integration in Athens, and on one of my first days in Atlanta this spring I arranged to talk with him at his office about both his son and his father. Alfred Holmes, who is known in Atlanta as Tup, is a short, chunky man with a breezy manner and a cheerful, chipmunkish expression. He seems to know everybody on the street, whether it is Hunter Street or Auburn Avenue, in Atlanta, or Hancock Street, in Athens, where he worked for six or eight months as an embalmer early in his career. Almost everybody he sees gets a cheery \"How you makin' it?\" or \"You makin' it O.K.?\" Strictly Hunter Street in philosophy himself, Tup Holmes shares an office building there with the Atlanta Inquirer , the law offices of Donald Hollowell and his associates, the local branch of the N.A.A.C.P. (which disturbed some of the Old Leadership by moving there from Auburn Avenue not long ago), the Southeastern Regional Office of the N.A.A.C.P., and a school for beauticians. Holmes has been in several businesses, mostly selling one thing or another, and the office he ushered me into-a small one-was devoted to the sale of real estate and insurance. Having assured him that I was making it O.K., I asked him about Hamilton's decision to go to the University of Georgia.\n\n\"The aggressiveness of the family might have influenced him, but Hamp's a steady sort of boy,\" Holmes said. \"He's always thought deeply and on his own. Jesse Hill asked if I would mention Georgia to Hamp, because he was just about perfect, with his grades and his personality. That's all I had to do was mention it; before I could do anything else, he had already talked to Jesse. I went down to Athens once or twice, and I tell you he's two different people when he's there and when he's in Atlanta. He lives for Friday afternoon, when he can come home. There's really no one in that town for him to talk to, and he's not the kind to do much visiting. He sticks to his lessons. He made up his mind he was going to make those crackers sit up and take notice. You know, I travel around the state quite a bit in my business, and sometimes I talk in the high schools or the churches. I didn't realize for quite a while what a hero this boy is to those people in the backwoods. When I'm being introduced to a group of people, sooner or later the man introducing me gets around to saying, 'This is the father of Hamilton Holmes.' And they say, 'You mean the Hamilton Holmes up at Georgia? Let me shake your hand.' I think he means so much to those people because of his grades. The white man in the South has always accepted the Negro as his equal or superior physically, because he figures we're not far removed from the jungle and we've had to do physical work for so long that our muscles have got hard. But the whites never have accepted us as their equal or superior mentally. They have always said that the Negro is only good for plowing. Well, Hamp is destroying all those myths. He's made the Phi Kappa Phi honor society, you know, and we hope he'll make Phi Beta Kappa. When those people in the backwoods see those A's, they stand up. That's why he means more to them than James Meredith, or even Charlayne.\"\n\nAfter we had talked a while longer, Holmes said, \"Well, if you're going to get in to see Daddy, we'd better get over there. If you come after eleven-thirty, there's so many patients you can't get near the place.\" On the drive from Hunter Street to Auburn Avenue, where Dr. Holmes has his office, Tup Holmes told me about his father, whose prowess as a doctor, a golfer, and a speaker makes him almost as popular a subject for conversation in the Holmes family as Hamilton. \"My daddy's a real scrapper,\" Tup Holmes said. \"He ran away from home when he was twelve to go to school. He was from Louisiana. The backwoods. And I mean the real backwoods. He worked in the sugar mills in New Orleans and went to school at night in a small school that's now part of Dillard. Then he worked his way through Shaw Medical School, in North Carolina, and came to Atlanta to practice-that was in 1910. He's a real scrapper. Daddy was a pioneer on this golf-course thing. It required a lot of courage on his part, especially considering all the training and inhibitions of his generation. You have to remember that when he was coming up he would have to tip his hat and move to the side every time he saw a white lady on the street.\"\n\nWhen we arrived at Dr. Holmes' office, on the fourth floor of an old building, it was half an hour before his office hours began, but six or eight patients were already sitting in the waiting room, watching television. They hardly looked up as Holmes and I walked into the Doctor's office, where a nurse from the treatment room, adjoining, told us to make ourselves comfortable until the Doctor arrived. Dr. Holmes' office was a small room, containing an old-fashioned desk, a refrigerator, a day bed, a floor safe with a filing cabinet on top of it, and two or three tables. Almost every flat surface was covered with golfing trophies, and the walls were covered with a staggering collection of plaques, pictures, and framed prayers. There were several religious pictures, some family pictures, and numerous plaques from golf Organizations and fraternities. In one frame were three glossy prints of Hamilton and Charlayne and a letter from the Half Century Alumni Club of Shaw University. The wall decorations also included a chart showing the postal zone of every street in Atlanta, a sports award from radio station WSB for a hole-in-one made on January 1, 1961, and a cardboard reprint of the Prayer for Physicians by Maimonides. Between a plaque signifying life membership In the United Golfers Association, which is the Negro equivalent of the U. S. Golfers Association, and a poem about medicine from the Fifty Year Club of American Medicine hung an eye chart.\n\nAfter a few minutes, Dr. Holmes hustled in. A jolly man, shorter, chunkier, and darker than his progeny, he had a tiny gray mustache and a tiny gray goatee. Since he also had tufts of gray hair on the sides of his head and more tufts of gray hair for eyebrows, he looked like a tiny Uncle Remus. He wore a three-piece blue suit, a diamond stickpin, and a watch chain. When Dr. Holmes heard that I was there to ask about Hamilton, he could hardly wait to begin.\n\n\"I trained my children from infancy to fear nothing, and I told my grandson the same thing,\" Dr. Holmes said. \"I told him to be meek. Be meek, but don't look too humble. Because if you look too humble they might think you're afraid, and there's nothing to be afraid about, because the Lord will send his angel to watch over you and you have nothing to fear. I'm glad Hamp has faith; you have to have faith. Science is not enough; you have to have more than science. You have to know the Lord is watching over you. Hamp is a religious boy and he's a natural-born doctor. He's wanted to be a doctor since infancy. I told his mother before he was born, I said, 'You just think on medicine and if it's a boy maybe the prenatal influence will make him a natural-born doctor.' And she did think on it, and sure enough, that's what he is, a natural-born doctor.\"\n\nDr. Holmes talked a bit about his own practice. \"I've been practicing medicine here for fifty-three years, and I'm busier now than I've ever been,\" he said. \"I come in at eleven-forty-five and I stay until four-thirty or five. I come back at seven and stay till ten-thirty or eleven. I don't much like to work past eleven any more. I try to treat everybody as an individual. Once, a lady came in and said, 'You sure took a long time with that last patient,' and I said, 'O.K., if you want, I'll hurry on you.' She said, 'Don't hurry on me. Oh, no!' Well, I treat them all like individuals, but I still see fifty or sixty patients a day. I work every day but Wednesday and Sunday. I play golf on Wednesdays, and on Sundays I go to church. Then I play golf.\"\n\nI asked Dr. Holmes if his game was still as good as the trophies indicated.\n\n\"I beat nearly everybody I play with, young and old alike,\" he admitted. \"They say, 'I'm waiting for you to get tired.' I tell them they better beat me now, because I'm not going to get tired. I'll be seventy-nine on the fourth of April, but not an ache, not a pain, not a stiffness in the joints. Not a corn, not a callus, not a bunion on my feet. And my memory is as good as it was fifty years ago.\" And Dr. Holmes stretched his muscles and his joints to demonstrate their efficiency. I certainly had no reason to doubt it, or to doubt his memory. (\"Hamp's granddaddy is quite a character,\" Charlayne told me a day or two later. \"He called up once and said he'd decided Hamp and I should get married, and he'd give me any kind of convertible I wanted for a wedding present. He hadn't consulted Hamp, of course. I explained to him that Hamp and I were more like brother and sister, and that Hamp had a girl. But he said we would just have to get married, because we'd have such smart children.\")\n\nCharlayne, unlike Hamilton, is rarely explained as the logical result of a family tradition. In fact, even at the age of eighteen, when she entered the University of Georgia, she seemed remarkably independent. \"She's always wanted to be out front,\" I was once told by her mother, a pretty, retiring woman who works as a secretary in a Negro real-estate company. \"When she was a little girl, I never had to get after her to do her lessons, or anything. She's just always been that way.\" Charlayne's poise during the first days of integration was occasionally attributed to her having spent her eighth-grade year as one of only a few Negroes in an integrated Army school in Alaska, where her father, Charles Hunter, a career Army chaplain, was stationed. Now retired, with the rank of lieutenant colonel, he was often the first Negro to hold whatever post he was assigned to, but the extent of his influence on Charlayne is not certain. He and Mrs. Hunter separated after the year in Alaska, and Charlayne, who had previously gone for long stretches without seeing her father while he was overseas, rarely saw him after that, for she returned to Atlanta to live with her mother, her two younger brothers, and her grandmother. Charlayne's father is a Methodist minister and her mother is also a Methodist, but Charlayne became a Catholic when she was sixteen. At Georgia, Charlayne continued to look at things from a point of view of her own. In fact, because she was a journalism student, she had a kind of double vision for those two and a half years. During her first week or two at Georgia, she sometimes seemed to be watching the reporters watch her integrate the university, occasionally making notes on both phenomena for one of the articles on the integration she was later to write for the Atlanta Inquirer . According to Carl Holman, who, as editor of the Inquirer , had also found that covering the integration news often meant observing his own activities, \"It gave her a detachment she might not have had otherwise. Hamilton has the views of the average citizen on the subject; that is, he regards reporters as just as dangerous as anyone else. But Charlayne was always studying them, and I think it made her feel better that they were around.\"\n\nOne day last March, while Charlayne was at home for several days after her next-to-last round of final examinations at Georgia, she and I met for lunch at a restaurant on Hunter Street, and I found that she was still able to see her experience as a news story. Although she had always received more attention in the press than Hamilton, she assured me that Hamilton made a better study. \"He's consistent and I'm not,\" she said. \"He knows what he wants and where he's going and how he's going to get there. We're a lot different. For instance, he can't wait for Friday. He comes back to Atlanta every weekend. He has a girl here, and his family. I think my mother and brothers are great, but that's the only reason I come home at all. I'd just as soon stay in Athens and sleep or read. Hamp's very uncomfortable there. For one thing, he's not crazy about white people. And he loves Atlanta. I guess I'm just as comfortable there as I am anyplace else. Hamp and I were sort of rivals at Turner, but we usually agreed on big things. I wanted to go to journalism school, and I had considered Georgia, but not really seriously. It seemed such a remote possibility. I had just about decided to go to Wayne, for no special reason except they had a journalism department and had answered my letters and I wanted to go to school away from home. When Hamp brought up Georgia-I think it was while we were posing together for a yearbook picture-I said sure, I'd like to go. It seemed like a good idea. I can't stress enough that I didn't ponder it. I guess it always was in my mind that I had the right, but Hamp and I never had any discussions about Unalienable, God-given Rights. We just didn't speak in those terms. It sounded like an interesting thing to do, and in the back of my mind I kept thinking this would never really happen; it was just something we were doing. I guess at that stage of the game we thought that anything we wanted to do was possible. Each step got us more involved, but we didn't think of it that way. We just went step by step, and it seemed kind of like a dream. When we got together with Jesse Hill and Hollowell and Carl and Whitney Young, they thought we ought to go to Georgia State. It also had journalism courses, and I really didn't know the difference. Negro kids don't know anything about white colleges. We figured if it was white it was good. We picked up applications at Georgia State, but neither one of us really liked the place; the catalogue showed they really didn't offer much. We went out on the steps and stood around, and Hamp said, 'I want to go to Athens. That's the place to go.' And he pointed right in the direction of Athens. I said, 'I'm with you,' and they said 'O.K., you'll go to Athens.' I think a lot of it was Hamp's having always taken an interest in the Georgia football team.\"\n\nOne reason for the dreamlike quality of the eighteen months that followed was that, except for two or three hearings they had to attend, Charlayne and Hamilton were merely spectators of the complicated maneuvers that Jesse Hill and Donald Hollowell-eventually joined by Constance Baker Motley, associate counsel of the Inc. Fund-were carrying on with the state. Charlayne and Hamilton regularly submitted applications, which were regularly turned down, usually on the ground of a space shortage, and all they had to do to be rejected again was to submit their college transcripts each semester. They did have to appear in federal district court in Macon, in the summer between their freshman and sophomore years, but at that time Judge William Bootles refused to order them into the university through a temporary restraining order, ruling that they had not exhausted their administrative remedies. He did, however, schedule a December trial on a motion for a permanent injunction. Under Judge Bootles' orders, Charlayne and Hamilton both went to Athens for admission interviews that November. At these, Charlayne was treated politely, and Hamilton, appearing before a three-man panel, was asked such questions as whether or not he had ever been to a house of prostitution or a \"tea parlor\" or \"beatnik places\"-questions that, BootIe later noted in a judicial understatement, \"had probably never been asked of any applicant before.\"\n\nAll-out stalling is not an ineffective strategy, as Southern white strategies against integration go. It worked well against the first Negro who tried to get into the University of Georgia-Horace Ward, who sued for admission to the law school in 1952. The stalling went on until 1957, by which time Ward had stayed out of school for a year or so, had then been drafted, had served in the Army, and had finally entered another law school, so that a federal Judge ruled the case moot. The possibilities of carefully managed stalling are demonstrated in a sentence from the decision that eventually ordered the university to admit Charlayne and Hamilton. \"Plaintiffs have already prosecuted one appeal through administrative channels which required 122 days for final administrative action,\" Judge Bootles wrote. \"If plaintiffs were required to appeal from defendants' failure to admit them each quarter for which they made application for admission, they would probably use up the normal four-year college attendance period before securing any final administrative action.\" Some federal judges in the South, as a matter of fact, probably would never have ended the stalling, since the reasons given for rejecting Charlayne and Hamilton always sounded plausible enough. And such delaying tactics, even if it could be assumed that they would end sooner or later, forced applicants either to stay out of school, which Charlayne and Hamilton, ambitious and anxious to get started, would obviously not do, or to enter another college and complicate their problems by applying as transfer students. Indeed, Georgia admissions officials said they were very much concerned about the credits Charlayne and Hamilton might lose if they transferred in the middle of the year from colleges that divide the school year into two semesters to a college that, like the University of Georgia, divides it into three quarters. (The summer session constitutes the fourth quarter.) Shortly after Charlayne and Hamilton applied, Georgia began to accept transfer students only when they fell into certain categories, supposedly based on whether a transfer was necessary for the continuation of a student's program, and Charlayne never seemed to be in the right category. Also, after a year and a half of college life among friends, both students found the idea of facing the hostility of the University of Georgia much less appealing than it had seemed following high-school graduation, when Georgia had sounded like a good idea and also like something a long way off. This was especially true of Hamilton, who went to Morehouse, the most highly regarded of the Atlanta University Center colleges. An alumnus of Morehouse-Charlayne's father is one-is always called a \"Morehouse man\" by Atlanta Negroes, who are proud of A.U.'s School of Social Work, and of Spelman, its girls' college, but especially of Morehouse. During a visit to see Hamilton's mother in March, I asked his brother Herbert, who is a freshman at Morehouse, how he thought Hamilton compared Morehouse and Georgia, and I was assured that Hamilton preferred Morehouse in every respect but one: he thought Georgia's science facilities were superior. Herbert seemed concerned lest I get the impression that anybody could be happier somewhere else than he could be at Morehouse. The mantelpiece of the Holmes house had almost as many trophies for Hamilton's achievements as a regular student at Morehouse and Turner as for his being a Student Hero at Georgia. There were a trophy that he had received for being the outstanding freshman football player at Morehouse; a Turner High valedictorian trophy; the National Newspaper Publishers Association Russwurm Award for \"making possible a richer conception of democratic principles [at Georgia];\" a trophy from Turner for excellence in math; two trophies for his attendance at Georgia from Alpha Phi Alpha, the fraternity that Hamilton joined at Morehouse; and a plaque from the Turner High School P.-T.A., given to Mr. and Mrs. Holmes.\n\nHamilton's mother, Isabella Holmes, turned out to be an articulate, attractive woman with a gentle voice, which added force to, rather than detracted from, what she said. She had grown up in Tuskegee, Alabama, where her father edited one of the trade magazines published by Tuskegee Institute, and where she had met her husband while both were students at the Institute. When Mrs. Holmes mentions integration, she is almost always talking about the integration of blind and partly sighted children into regular classrooms-a pioneer project in Atlanta that Mrs. Holmes, as a sixth-grade teacher, has been taking part in for several years. \"Hamp was supposed to go to Morehouse through the early-admissions program the year before he got out of Turner,\" Mrs. Holmes told me. \"He had a four-year Merrill Scholarship that paid full tuition. But that summer he decided he didn't want to give up his senior year at Turner, and later he decided on Georgia. Then, I remember the day the judge's decision was handed down after Hamp had been at Morehouse a year and a half. I saw that the judge said they didn't have to enter that quarter, or even spring quarter. And since I knew how much Morehouse meant to Hamp, the first thing I said was that he wouldn't be letting anybody down if he waited until fall. He surprised me. He said, 'No, I've got to go now.' Hamp doesn't do much talking, and sometimes you don't know what he's thinking. It's lonely for him down in Athens. It's particularly hard for a boy who's from a large family. With four others, there's no such thing as isolation in this house. You'd think some students there would make overtures to a boy in a situation like that. It's hard for me to believe that nobody would bother, unless the boy was objectionable. I guess I'll never understand. He got so low last spring, when he saw the other boys playing baseball on the lawn and all, that I wanted him to come home for a while. He wouldn't hear of coming home. If Corky King, the Presbyterian minister there, hadn't started having him over to dinner every week, I don't know what would have become of him. I sometimes wish one of my other boys, Gary, the one who's in college in Charlotte now, had gone instead of Hamp. They could have run him over with a truck and not bothered him. But Hamp is very sensitive in many ways.\"\n\nI knew that the family had been subject to harassment after Hamilton applied, and I asked Mrs. Holmes about this.\n\n\"We had quite a time here with the phone,\" she said. \"I think they had the phone tapped, because they cut in on conversations, and if you left it off the hook it would cut off and go dead, and you couldn't call out. We complained to the phone company, and they gave us a private number, but before I even knew the number myself-they sent it by mail-the calls began coming in on that one. They would start about the time I got in from work and go through the night. Sometimes, when we left the phone off the hook, we'd have to cover it with something, because they would just keep talking. And I hated to be without the phone. And I was afraid about somebody passing by. I think I even imagined things when I got into the car and put my foot on the starter. I also wondered about jeopardizing other people if somebody passed by and threw something. I did wonder sometimes if it was worth it.\"\n\nHamilton spent most of his final spring break this March filling speaking engagements-a function he had left pretty much to Charlayne during their first two years at Georgia. \"I'm getting around a little more,\" he said when I finally got him on the phone, late that same week. \"But with me the studies still come first.\" He went on to say that he was scheduled to speak at the Emmanuel Baptist Church in Atlanta that Sunday, and I arranged to meet the Holmes family there.\n\nSunday was another beautiful spring day in Atlanta. It was, in fact, Safe Boating Sunday in WSB-land, the radio announcer said as I drove over to Emmanuel Baptist, a neat, new red brick church in the middle of a red brick Negro housing project in the southeastern section of the city. Hamilton's father was chatting with friends in the vestibule when I arrived, and he led me down to the first row, where his wife and his father were already seated. Dr. Holmes looked as natty as he had in his office, wearing a blue suit with a light pin stripe, a blue tie, his diamond stickpin, and, hanging from his watch chain, a medallion, which, he told me a few minutes later, was one of Tup's golf awards. \"I have a lot of them of my own, but I like this one,\" he explained. \"It looks like a gold dollar. Tup got it in Chicago in 1940 or 1941.\"\n\nThat was enough to turn the conversation to golf.\n\n\"About the only time I leave town is for golf tournaments,\" said Dr. Holmes. \"I used to go to a lot of medical meetings, but I'm getting tired of them. I play in three tournaments a year, usually-United Golfers Association tournaments, in the senior division. I usually shoot in the low eighties.\"\n\n\"He kills those old men,\" Tup Holmes said proudly. \"He just kills them. But he hasn't been able to shoot his age yet. It's all mental. He gets a thirty-six or thirty-seven on the first nine and then he gets to thinking about it and he blows it on the back nine. He gets nervous.\"\n\nDr. Holmes acknowledged that Tup was the best golfer in the family when he was in form-he won the national U.G.A. in 1947, in Philadelphia, and again in 1958, in Pittsburgh-but said he was able to beat him occasionally. \"In the seniors, I win first place sometimes, second place sometimes, and sometimes third place, although not often,\" he went on. \"The seniors are for men over fifty, and you have to remember that I didn't have a golf club in my hands until I was fifty. Some of those other fellows are experienced.\"\n\nI reminded Dr. Holmes that even though he had a late start, he'd had twenty-nine years of experience, and he just smiled and turned toward the pulpit, for the service was about to begin.\n\nAccording to our programs, the church was holding its Annual Youth Day Observance, on the theme of \"Christian Youth and Their Spiritual Challenge in an Emerging Age of World Freedom,\" although the bulletin board on the lawn outside had said merely, \"9:30-Sunday School. 10:45-Hamilton Holmes.\" About half an hour after the service was scheduled to begin, Hamilton walked out on the platform with four girls. He looked about the same as when I had last seen him, almost two years before, except that some extra weight accented the start of the heaviness around the jaw that seems to be a Holmes characteristic. He was, as usual, well dressed, wearing an Ivy League-cut blue summer-weight suit, a rep tie, and a white button-down shirt, and he had a tiny Alpha Phi Alpha pin in his lapel. As Hamilton shifted in his seat through the first part of the service, his face had the serious look that most people at Georgia had interpreted as a scowl. The service, conducted by the four girls, proceeded through an opening hymn, a responsive reading, the morning hymn, a scripture lesson, the morning prayer, a selection by the youth choir, a statement of purpose, several selections by the Turner High School choral ensemble, the collection, and the doxology. Finally, one of the girls introduced Hamilton, calling him \"a militant and pioneering young speaker who has symbolized and portrayed in his own actions and character the fight for human dignity and first-class citizenship.\" There was one more hymn, and then Hamilton rose to speak.\n\nPutting on a pair of horn-rimmed glasses, he read from a prepared text entitled \"Higher Education and the New Negro\"-Hamilton's favorite speech topic. He began by outlining advances in science, in industry, and even in housework-advances that had eliminated many traditional Negro jobs. There was, he went on, an increasing need for highly trained workers, and that need could be filled by the New Negro, \"who realizes he is just as good as any other man . . . not the Negro sitting passively around waiting for his rights to be handed to him on a silver platter.\" Hamilton said that movements like the sit-ins had opened doors but that the Negro must be prepared to go through them, and that his greatest drawback was his lack of education. \"Ours is a competitive society,\" he continued. \"This is true even more so for the Negro. He must compete not only with other Negroes but with the white man. In most instances, in competition for jobs and status with whites, the Negro must have more training and be more qualified than his white counterpart if he is to beat him out of a job. If the training and qualifications are equal, nine times out of ten the job will go to the white man. This is a challenge to us as a race. We must not be content to be equal, education- and training-wise, but we must strive to be superior in order to be given an equal chance. This is something that I have experienced in my short tenure at the University of Georgia. I cannot feel satisfied with just equalling the average grades there. I am striving to be superior. I have found that I must be superior in order to be accepted as an equal. If the average is B, then I want an A. The importance of superior training cannot be overemphasized. This is a peculiar situation, I know, but it is reality, and reality is something that we Negroes must learn to live with.\"\n\nThat was, I thought, a pretty good summary of Hamilton's philosophy at Georgia-what his father would call \"making those crackers sit up and take notice.\" As Hamilton sat down, a man in the congregation said, in a sonorous voice, \"Richly spoken, richly spoken.\" He turned out to be the minister of Emmanuel Baptist, Benjamin Weldon Bickers, and he came forward at that point to take over from the girls and introduce some guests, including three students from integrated Atlanta high schools. He also introduced Mr. and Mrs. Holmes, and Hamilton's sister, Emma, who had joined the family after singing in the Turner chorus, and two or three more Holmeses, and then somebody reminded him that he had neglected Dr. Holmes. Bickers not only introduced the Doctor but asked him to say a few words.\n\nDr. Holmes, still beaming over Hamilton's speech, popped right up and turned around to face the congregation. \"Brothers and sisters,\" he began, \"I assure you that it is a pleasure to be here. I always hoped I would be able to live long enough to see this young man stand as he stands in the community and in his daily deportment. It gives me a thrill, and I thank the Lord I lived long enough to see it. And to have such a fine boy! He does not smoke or chew; he does not drink beer, wine, or liquor. I told him when he was a little boy, 'Never live long enough to smoke or drink.' As a result, here he is. It did me good to hear him philosophize, to go step by step through what the New Negro needs. It did me good, and I thank the Lord I lived long enough to hear him.\" The congregation was nodding in approval. Dr. Holmes digressed briefly to talk about another grandchild, a girl who had gone to Elmira College, in upstate New York, as an exchange student from Spelman and had immediately become the star of the choir. \"I'm glad I took the Biblical advice not to let your riches pile up where thieves and robbers can get them but to deposit them in your children,\" Dr. Holmes went on. \"I'm proud of this boy. And we don't want him to stop. We want him to get his M.D. or his Ph.D. or whatever D. he wants. He might be too smart to practice. He might have to teach. But we want him to have everything he wants. It's a pleasure to be here.\"\n\nAs Dr. Holmes turned and sat down, there was the shuffling and murmuring of a congregation that wanted to show approval but knew better than to clap in church. Just as I thought I might have witnessed my first Negro church meeting in the South that had only one collection, Mr. Bickers announced that he was going to collect Hamilton's honorarium right there, and passed the plate again.\n\nAlthough Hamilton's family has long been active in community affairs, the only one of his relatives professionally involved in race relations is his uncle, Oliver Wendell Holmes, who was destined by Dr. Holmes to be the family lawyer but ended up as a Congregationalist minister instead. A small, cheerful man, and the most direct heir to the patriarch's jolly eloquence, Oliver Holmes is the associate director of the Georgia Council on Human Relations. In 1956, the Council grew out of the Georgia Interracial Committee, which was founded right after the First World War to start some communication between white and Negroes, meeting as equals. Among the early participants in the Georgia Interracial Committee was Oliver Holmes' mother-Hamilton's grandmother-who, as one of the first Negro registered nurses in the South, was, before her death, a prominent member of the Negro community. \"Mama used to go have her tea and cookies once a month,\" Oliver Holmes recalled when I visited him at the organization's headquarters in Atlanta. \"And we'd say, 'Well, Mama, you've had your tea and cookies now, and next month you can go have your tea and cookies again.' But I think it actually did do some good. It kept the lines of communication open, and they could have closed easily in those days.\"\n\nI had first met Oliver Holmes two years before in Savannah, where he had become pastor of the First Congregational Church in 1959, after several years of preaching in Talladega, Alabama. While he was in Talladega, he had organized the area's first N.A.A.C.P. branch, but, he said, the most important case was a criminal one, rather than one involving civil rights. It came up when \"a drunken Negro cabdriver, in a one-eyed car with no brakes, in the raIn, hit and killed two white policemen who were harassing a couple of college kids who were parked there by the side of the road doing a little light necking.\" Holmes went to Birmingham and came back with a young Negro defense lawyer. \"They said if a colored lawyer came there to defend that boy, he'd be lucky not to get the chair himself,\" said Holmes. As the case turned out, the cabdriver got only five years for manslaughter, because the policemen had been on the wrong side of the road, and the accident was, despite his condition and the multiple handicaps of his car, not his fault. \"Everybody in the town was just as happy as could be,\" Holmes told me. \"The Negroes said, 'Our lawyer got that boy off with five years,' and the whites said, 'DespIte that little nigger, we put that boy away for five years.' When it came time that he was eligible for parole, we went up to see him at the state prison farm and he said, 'Don't you bother me about any parole. I'm driving a tractor and I got more money in my pocket than I ever had and I don't want to leave. When my time is up, I'm going to ask for an extension.' Yes sir, everybody was happy about that case.\"\n\nWhile Holmes was in Talladega, he found time to make trips to Atlanta for golf, and he was in the foursome that tested the public golf course on the segregation issue in 1955. \"When we first went out there to make the test, they were a little surprised,\" he said. \"I went up to the window and asked for four tickets, and the man said, 'Tickets for what?' I told him, 'For whatever you're selling them for.' And he said he couldn't sell us any tickets, because the course wasn't open to Negroes. I told him that was what I thought-just testing. After the Supreme Court decision, we went out to play, and we figured somebody had better stay home, in case something happened. So we finally convinced Daddy that as long as he held the purse strings, maybe he'd better stay home. He didn't want to. He sure is crazy about golf, and he was just as excited as he could be about this. My brother Tup was really up for this game, with the press out there and everything. I think he had been practicing for it; he shot a thirty-eight on the first nine. I had been stuck out in Talladega without much chance to play and my game was a little off, and maybe I was a little nervous.\"\n\nWhen Holmes moved to Savannah, he found that the public golf course was available to Negroes only one day a week, and then did not permit them access to such facilities as the rest rooms and the snack bar. Those were conditions that would put any Holmes off his game, So Oliver Holmes worked out a plan with the mayor whereby the course was at first open to Negroes two days a week, with the use of all facilities, and then, a couple of months later, was completely desegregated. The golf-course desegregation worked out so smoothly that the mayor appointed Holmes to the Park Board, which put him in a good position to work on the integration of the parks. While he was in Savannah, he also worked with the mayor to get the library quietly desegregated and headed the N.A.A.C.P. negotiations committee that, with the aid of a year-long boycott, effected the desegregation of the lunch counters in downtown Savannah department stores. When a human-relations council was formed in Savannah, Holmes was the logical choice for co-chairman. \"We usually try to have co-chairmen, to insure the participation of both races,\" he told me. \"It's always easy to find a Negro co-chairman but sometimes not a white. So I was the co-co-chairman for a while.\" Holmes eventually decided to leave the pulpit for a full-time job with the Georgia Council, which, he said, \"does a little troubleshooting around the state.\" He went on to explain, \"We try to see if we can't get the whites and Negroes to sit down and talk. We try to stress reason rather than force.\"\n\nWhen I visited Holmes in Atlanta, he had just returned from a little troubleshooting at Jekyll Island, a state-owned resort whose facilities Negroes believed to be not only separate but distinctly unequal. \"They have a sign up at the Negro end saying 'Site of Proposed Golf Course,' \" Holmes said. \"They've been proposing that golf course for three years now. The first time I tried the white golf course, they put out a sign, 'Closed for Watering.' I never heard of a course being closed for watering. You just turn on a hose and water it. Finally, they said they did not allow Negroes to use the course.\" Holmes had then started appearing before the State Park Commission to argue for the desegregation of Jekyll Island. \"I saw the Director of State Parks at this hearing,\" Holmes went on. \"He said he lived down in Albany, and he asked me, 'With all this trouble down there, how do you explain it that I've got a hundred and sixty Negroes working for me, and they're just as happy as they can be? They tell me so.' I explained it. I said, 'You got yourself a hundred and sixty of the biggest liars in the state of Georgia.' \"\n\nHolmes said that the rest of the Holmes family had always been active in civil rights in one way or another. \"My father has always been active in the N.A.A.C.P. in a financial way,\" he told me. \"He's never had time for any other. Of course, since he met golf he's never had time for much of anything. Hamp's daddy always thought he was entitled to what other people were entitled to, and, unlike some Negroes, he always spoke out. In fact, he always shouted it from the rooftops.\" Oliver Holmes had arranged for Hamilton to make a speech to the Savannah Human Relations Council the weekend before and had gone along to introduce him. When I told him that I had heard Hamilton speak at Emmanuel Church, and had unexpectedly heard a speech from Dr. Holmes as well, Holmes laughed and said, \"I've been asked to preach twice since I left the ministry, and both times I took my daddy with me. Both times, they asked him to say a few words after the sermon, and both times he gave a better speech than I did. He really killed me. The second time, the fellow behind me said right out loud, so I could hear, 'That's the one who should be preaching.' I told Daddy next time I got an invitation I wasn't going to tell him about it. When I heard that he spoke in the church where Hamp spoke, I said, 'I hope he didn't kill Hamp like he killed me.' \"\n\nAlthough Hamilton's high school record indicated that he was likely to have an outstanding academic career at Georgia, he was found unqualified before he went to court, and not, said the officials, because he was a Negro. Shortly before the trial in Athens federal court in December of 1960, at which I first met Charlayne and Hamilton, the university Registrar and Director of Admissions, Walter Danner, having considered the interviews with both students, wrote Charlayne that she would be considered for admission the following fall-there was no room for transfer students in her category before then-and wrote Hamilton that he had been rejected on the basis of his interview. Hamilton, the Registrar said, had been \"evasive\" in answering the questions put to him by the three-man panel, and had left its members in \"some doubt as to his truthfulness.\" As Hollowell later brought out in the trial, these were almost exactly the same reasons that a special interviewing board had given eight years before for deciding that Horace Ward was unqualified to be a lawyer and should therefore be rejected by the University of Georgia Law School. (Ward had gone on to Northwestern Law School, had returned to join Hollowell's office in Atlanta, and must have derived a good deal of satisfaction from assisting Hollowell and Mrs. Motley in the trial, not to mention escorting Hamilton into the admissions office to register a month later.) The charge of untruthfulness was based on Hamilton's having given a negative reply to the board's question of whether or not he had ever been arrested. The admissions office, Danner said in court, just happened to know that Hamilton had once been fined and had had his license suspended for speeding, and the office considered that an arrest.\n\nBefore the trial, Mrs. Motley and three assistants spent two weeks going through the Georgia admissions files, which had been opened by court order. By comparing the treatment given Charlayne and Hamilton with that given other students, they had no difficulty in demonstrating that the whole business was a subterfuge, that the only real category the university had was white, and that the interviewers were less interested in Hamilton's speeding ticket than in the impossibility of stalling him any longer by claiming that the dormitories were overcrowded, since university rules permitted male students to live off campus after their freshman year. In any event, the housing problem was not so acute that the university had to refrain from sending a dean of the agriculture school to upstate New York that year to recruit students for its food-technology program Moreover, the interview that had been considered so important in Hamilton's case was given to some students after they were already attending the university. The university, then, had been double-dealing for a year and a half, and it was instructive to see the double-dealing presented as a legal defense by a state that had vowed open resistance to integration. In the effort to correct the false notion that the South has a monopoly on bigotry, the equally false notion has been created that the North has a monopoly on hypocrisy, and I had often heard it said that \"in the South at least everybody knows where he stands and people are honest about it.\" According to this way of thinking, the resistance promised on the campaign stump by politicians should have been continued in court by state officials. But the university officials I listened to for a week in Athens, testifying about their overcrowded dormitories and their administrative problems, sounded less like Southerners fighting a holy crusade than like Long Island real-estate brokers trying to wriggle out of an anti-discrimination law. After one has spent a few minutes listening to a desegregation trial, the reason for this shift becomes clear. It is a simple matter of law. In federal court, where the case must be tried, the issue has already been decided: segregation in the public schools is unconstitutional. The only possible defense is that segregation does not exist. When politicians say they will resist integration \"by all legal means,\" they can only be implying that they will try to prolong litigation by any available dodge, since the issue has already been settled by all legal means. In Georgia, in 1960, a trial had to be held. It was demanded by what had evolved into a ritual of combatting integration even when it was obvious that the combat would do no good.\n\nIn a state whose highest officials were declaring daily that there would be no integration, a state that had a law on the books establishing that funds would be cut off from any school that was integrated, a state whose governor had promised in his campaign that \"not one, no, not one\" Negro would ever attend classes with whites in Georgia, Omer Clyde Aderhold, the president of the University of Georgia, had the following exchange with the state's own lawyer, B. D. Murphy:\n\nM urphy: Now I'll ask you if, as an official of the University of Georgia for the period you have stated and as President of the University of Georgia since 1950, do you know of any policy of the University of Georgia to exclude students on account of their race or color?\n\nA derhold: No sir, I do not.\n\nM urphy: Do you know of any policy to discriminate against Negro applicants?\n\nA derhold: I do not.\n\nM urphy: Have you ever had any instructions from the Chancellor of the University System or the Chairman of the Board of Regents or anybody else to exclude Negroes as applicants to the University of Georgia?\n\nA derhold: I have not.\n\nM urphy: Have their applications, so far as you know, been considered on the same basis as the applications of white people?\n\nA derhold: On exactly the same basis, as far as I know.\n\nThe Chancellor of the University System was Harmon W. Caldwell, a respected former president of the university. He had sworn in the Horace Ward trial that he would recommend admission of a qualified Negro, and now he had to read in court a note he had sent to Aderhold on that subject. The note, attached to a letter requesting Caldwell to use his influence to get a white girl into the university, had been found in the admissions files by one of Mrs. Motley's assistants. It read, \"I have written Howard [Howard Calloway, a member of the Board of Regents] that it is my understanding that all of the dormitories for women are filled for the coming year. I have also indicated that you relied on this fact to bar the admission of a Negro girl from Atlanta. . . .\"\n\nAlthough the spectacle of Aderhold and Caldwell in court was a particularly sad example of what The Ritual can lead to, it was by no means unusual. In one brief, Georgia's lawyers denied \"the existence of any policy, practice, or custom of limiting admission to the University of Georgia to white persons.\" Nor was this form of defense restricted to higher education, where it sounded relatively plausible. Early in the case that brought about the integration of the Atlanta public schools, the defense claimed that the schools were not actually segregated; it was mere chance that resulted in there being all Negro teachers and students in some schools and all white teachers and students in others. At some point in every higher-education case, Mrs. Motley, who has handled practically all such cases for the Inc. Fund, always asks the university registrar what she calls \"the old clincher\": Would he favor the admission of a qualified Negro to the university? The registrar, often a strong segregationist himself, has to answer yes, as Danner did during the Georgia trial, and face the newspaper stories the next day that begin, as the Atlanta Journal's began, \"The University . . . registrar has testified in Federal Court here that he favors admission of qualified Negroes to the University.\"\n\nWhen I mentioned this to Mrs. Motley one evening in New York before I made my return trip to Georgia, she said, \"It's not funny, really. The system is based on people getting on the stand and telling the truth. But people who talk about their respect for tradition and integrity and the Constitution get involved in one lie after another. They're willing to break down the system to keep a Negro out. In Mississippi, university officials got up on the stand and said they had never even discussed the Meredith case. They do the same kind of thing in voting cases. People are denied the right to vote not because they're Negroes but because they didn't dot an 'i' or interpret the Constitution correctly. This is one of the most serious by-products of segregation. The people get a disregard for the law. They see supposedly important people get up day after day on the stand and lie. The reason the whole thing seems funny to watch is that you spend all that time proving something everybody already knows.\"\n\nTo anybody who had sat through the trial in the Athens Federal Building to the reporters, who sat in the jury box, or to the university and town people, who segregated themselves by race the first day or two, even though they were in a federal court, and only gradually got used to sitting wherever there was a place-it was no surprise to read Judge BootIe's decision that \"although there is no written policy or rule excluding Negroes, including plaintiffs, from admission to the University on account of their race or color, there is a tacit policy to that effect,\" and that the plaintiffs \"would already have been admitted had it not been for their race and color.\" However, BootIe's decision, issued one Friday afternoon in early January, 1961, a month after the trial ended, did contain one surprise; it ordered the students admitted not by the following fall, as had been predicted, or for the spring quarter, beginning in March, but, if they so desired, for the winter quarter, for which registration closed the following Monday.\n\nIf the entire conspiracy against the State of Georgia had indeed stemmed from the intricate machinations of a foreign-looking man in New York, he could have picked no better place than the University of Georgia for the first confrontation, so it was ironic that this, the most cunning maneuver of all, was the result of two local accidents-the accident that the University of Georgia case got through the courts faster than the Atlanta school case, which had been filed two years earlier, and the accident that two seventeen-year-old high-school students happened to prefer the University of Georgia to Georgia State, probably because of the football team. There is no doubt that by 1961 the atmosphere in Georgia had benefited from the dismal example of other Southern states, and that the movement to keep the schools open, even with some desegregation, had spread from its normal base, consisting of housewives, to the ordinarily timid businessman. The open-school movement became almost respectable after a fact-finding commission, created by the Georgia legislature, more or less as a part of The Ritual, to gather opinion on segregation around the state, had submitted a surprising majority report urging that each community be given a choice of whether to close its schools or submit to desegregation. Still, most observers thought that if the first test came in the Atlanta high schools in September of 1961, as was expected, the result would be about the same as the result in New Orleans the year before. The Georgia legislature, dominated by representatives of the rural counties, might have enjoyed closing the Atlanta schools, or at least harassing them, in the name of the folks at home. Closing the University of Georgia, where many of the legislators had gone to school, was a different matter. The university, ninety per cent Georgian, customarily had students from every county-no slight achievement in a state with a hundred and fifty-nine counties-and its graduates often went right back where they came from. The spell of the university was once explained to me by William Tate, its dean of men, who has been there for forty years and exchanges more affection with the university than any other man in the state. \"When integration came, the university was the one institution that could weather It,\" Tate said. \"There came a time when the people of the State of Georgia wanted the university not to close. A lot of people in the state love the university, and the university has always been tied up to the state. We usually have people here from every county-though sometimes we fudge a little to get one from Echols County or some little bitty place like that. We also have five hundred agricultural-extension workers and home-demonstration workers spread out all over the state. Our agriculture people have borne the brunt of shifting from a cotton economy to diversified farming. Ernest Vandiver, the last governor, was a graduate of the university. Carl Sanders, the present governor, is a graduate of the university. Both United States senators-Talmadge and Russell-are graduates of the university. Herman Talmadge's son is here and he is the fourth generation of Talmadges to attend the university. Richard Russell went here; his father was a trustee; his uncle was here. Why, he was the fourth Richard B. Russell here. I went down to speak in Greenville not long ago, and nine graduates came to hear me speak. Nine graduates right there in Meriwether County. It's not that way with Tech. The engineers don't drift back to these little old counties. There's not a soul in Meriwether County who gives a damn what happens to Tech. When this thing happened, I bet a lot of folks said, 'Hell, I get griped up a lot with that university. The students don't behave so well. I don't like the football. But it's a pretty good old university. It's helped us. They've done the best they can. They got their feet on the ground. And my granddaddy went there. I'll help them out.' \"\n\nIf, by chance, there was a politician in Georgia at the time who would not have agreed with Dean Tate's interpretation, he could look at the record. The only political defeat of Eugene Talmadge, a Georgia graduate and one of the South's most adroit demagogues, came when he meddled with the university. That was in 1941, when the Board of Regents refused to fire a dean whom Governor Talmadge suspected of integrationist sympathies. Talmadge installed a new Board of Regents, which fired the dean, but a good number of angry teachers left as well, and the Southern Association of Colleges and Secondary Schools suspended the accreditation of all Georgia's public colleges and universities-called the University System-because of the political interference. In the next campaign, fought largely on the education issue, Talmadge could not shout about race loud enough to avoid an overwhelming defeat by Ellis Arnall, a liberal. Accreditation was restored, and a simple lesson was learned-that the voters of Georgia cared more for their universIty than for their segregation.\n\nAlthough, as was later revealed, Governor Vandiver had advisers who thought he should make the gesture of going to jail before permitting the university to admit Charlayne and Hamilton (he had, after all, promised \"not one, no, not one\"), there was never much doubt about what the Governor would do or how the legislature, then gathering for its annual session in Atlanta, would react. On the day Charlayne and Hamilton registered, Vandiver finally announced that he would have to cut off the university's funds, because the law required him to, but that he would ask the legislature to change the law. (The university planned to declare a five-day \"holiday\" while this was being arranged.) He must have been thankful that Judge Bootles enjoined him the next day from using the law, for this move provided him with the opportunity to rail against the tyrannical federal judiciary for doing something he would otherwise have had to do himself. Later, Vandiver offered the legislature his alternative to resistance: repeal of the segregation laws, and the passage of a new group of laws, built around a state tuition grant to parents who wanted to send their children to private schools rather than integrated public schools. According to The Ritual, Vandiver could not call this retreat a retreat. He called it, instead, \"the child-protection freedom-of-association defense package.\" It passed easily.\n\nWhen I returned to Atlanta two and a half years later, I was curious about the outcome of all the legislative and judicial activity that had gone on during the integration. I noticed in back issues of the Atlanta Constitution that B. D. Murphy, Georgia's chief counsel at the Athens trial, eventually presented a bill to the state for $14,500, plus $248 in expenses. The total bill for outside counsel for the Georgia trial, exclusive of the ordinary expenses of the Georgia Attorney General's office, was something over $25,000. \"The state got off cheap,\" an enlightened lawyer, wise in the ways of Georgia politics, told me during my visit. \"It's just a matter of who loses gracefully, of course. But this way the issue is settled. They got the best lawyer they thought they could get, he lost, and nobody can say that the case was thrown or the state should have had more lawyers or that somebody else might have won.\" Governor Vandiver's \"child-protection freedom-of-association defense package\" turned out to be an even costlier form of The Ritual. The tuition-grant law-\"the basis of our defense,\" according to the Governor-could not mention segregation without being thrown out by the courts; it therefore merely provided a grant enabling any child to attend an approved private school. But, as it happened, not everybody in Georgia was willing to go along with the game. A number of citizens took the law at its word and claimed the grant it provided them, even though they did not live in an integrated school district, and even though, in most cases, their children were in private schools anyway. The week I arrived in Atlanta, the Constitution printed the names of twelve hundred Georgians who had received tuition grants for the 1962-63 school year-the first year the grants were available. The Constitution pointed out that eighty-three per cent of the people had had their children enrolled in private schools before the law was passed. Among those listed were hundreds of people outside Atlanta, which has the only integrated schools in the state, and a Negro educator in Atlanta, who was sending his children North to prep school; one suspects that the list also included dozens of smiling integrationists. The Constitution soberly printed letters from outraged citizens who pointed out that the total cost of the tuition grants, $215,000, was a lot of money to be handed out by a state that regularly ranks among the last in the country in money spent for public education. The legislature, equally alarmed, changed the law so that a parent could apply for a tuition grant only if the school board and the county authority of his district had agreed that a \"need\" existed in the district. Even then, the request had to go through the local board, and the grant had to be paid partly from local funds \"We expect this will cut this business down to nothing,\" a legislative assistant at the Capitol told me. That seemed to be the ideal arrangement for a law that was part of The Ritual; it would remain on the books for all to see but could not be used enough to become expensive or embarrassing.\n\nI also discovered, to my surprise, that Georgia still maintains a program of grants to Negro students who go outside the state to take courses offered at one of the \"white\" institutions in the Georgia University System but not at one of the colleges it provides for Negroes. The out-of-state aid program was originated to give some semblance of \"separate but equal\" status to a system that offered whites two large universities, a medical school, and a dozen other colleges across the state and offered Negroes three liberal-arts colleges that were once summed up easily by Tup Holmes as \"a joke.\" Although Negroes can now legally attend any college in the system, the out-of-state aid program is still going forward, perhaps to hold down the attendance of Negroes at colleges still considered white. (Charlayne could have received out-of-state aid for studying journalism out of the state during her last two years in college.) The students annually receive the difference between the tuition they pay outside the state and what they would pay at a Georgia college, plus the equivalent of one round-trip railway coach ticket and a room-and-board supplement of $2.78 a week The records for the 1961-62 school year, which are the latest available, show that fourteen hundred and twenty-five students were given out-of-state aid for study in thirty-four major fields at eighty-one institutions. Nine hundred and twenty-five of these students were majoring in education. The total cost in 1961-62 was $236,124.73, and the estimate for the next school year was about the same. In the 1962-63 school year, then, Georgia, through tuition grants and out-of-state aid, was spending between four hundred thousand and four hundred and fifty thousand dollars for the ritualistic protection of a custom that had already been violated. And that was in addition to the cost of maintaining two separate school systems.\n\nThe University of Georgia was desegregated with unusual suddenness. Only a weekend separated Judge Bootles' surprise order and the appearance of Charlayne and Hamilton on the campus-not enough time for either the side of law or the side of violence to marshal its forces. A succession of contradictory or ambiguous court orders and executive acts added to the confusion. At one point, Judge BootIe stayed his own order, to allow time for an appeal, only to have Elbert Tuttle, chief judge of the Fifth Circuit, rescind the stay within a couple of hours. From the vague statements of Governor Vandiver and the refusal of President Aderhold to say anything at all, there was some doubt whether the university would remain open or not. The result of all the confusion was three relatively non-violent, if chaotic, days on campus for Charlayne and Hamilton, and a spate of congratulations to the university from television newscasters and Northern newspapers on how well everybody had behaved. Some of the undergraduates at Georgia had spent the weekend rounding up signatures for petitions to keep the university open-the dominant concern of most students. Others had engaged in some minor effigy and cross burning, including a sorry demonstratIon I witnessed on the football practice field the Saturday night before Charlayne and Hamilton arrived. Twenty-odd students wanted to burn a cross made of two-by-fours, but, owing to a lack of kerosene and a lack of experience in this kind of endeavor, they were unable to get it ablaze. Most of the demonstrations against integration during the two new students' first three days on the campus seemed to be in that tradition. When Charlayne and Hamilton showed up at nine o'clock Monday morning, they were met only by a small group of curious students and a few reporters. In fact, throughout the first day, as Hamilton and his father and Horace Ward walked around campus going through the registration process, they often met with nothing more than some stares or a muttered \"Hey, there's that nigger.\" The crowds around Charlayne were larger, but they seemed almost playful, even when they began to bounce a car she was riding in, or swarmed into the Academic Building, where she was registering, to yell \"2-4-6-8! We don't want to integrate!\"-a chant they had borrowed from the women screaming at six-year-olds outside the integrated schools in New Orleans. A large crowd, triggered by a speech of Vandiver's that seemed to say the school would close, marched through downtown Athens on Monday night behind a Confederate flag. On Tuesday night, the first night Charlayne spent on campus, some of those who had found out which dormitory she had been assigned to-Center Myers-gathered on the street in front of it to chant, push around some television cameramen there, and throw some firecrackers. It was a rowdier crowd, but, like the rest, it was broken up by Dean Tate, who, working singlehanded, confiscated some university identification cards and told some of the boys he knew to go home.\n\nIn a special issue of the campus newspaper Tuesday, ten student leaders issued a warning that violence could only mar the image of the university. By Wednesday, just about everybody on the campus knew there was a riot scheduled in front of Charlayne's dormitory after the basketball game that night. It had been organized by a number of law-school students. All day Wednesday, the organizers scurried around making plans and bragging about the promises of help and immunity they had received from legislators. Some students got dates for the basketball game and the riot afterward. Reporters, faculty members, and even some students warned Joseph Williams, the dean of students, about the riot and suggested that he ban gatherings in front of the dormitory, or at least cancel the basketball game. But Williams said that neither step was necessary. Just after ten, a small crowd of students gathered on the lawn In front of Center Myers and unfurled a bedsheet bearing the legend \"Nigger Go Home.\" Then three or four of them peeled off from the group, ran toward the dormitory, and flung bricks and Coke bottles through the window of Charlayne's room. Dean Tate had been assigned by Williams to remain with the crowd at the gymnasium after the basketball game, and Williams himself, standing in front of the crudely lettered sign, made no attempt to break up the group. As more people came up the hill from the basketball game-a close loss to Georgia Tech-and a few outsiders showed up, the mob grew to about a thousand, many of whom threw bricks, rocks, and firecrackers. The few Athens policemen present were busy directing traffic, and after about thirty minutes Williams finally agreed to let a reporter phone the state police, who had a barracks outside Athens. Although the university understood that thirty state troopers would be standing ready in the barracks, the desk sergeant said that he could not send the troopers without the permission of the captain. But the captain said he had to have authority from the Commissioner of Public Safety, and the Commissioner, in turn, said he could not make a move without an order from the Governor. (In a failure of communications that still fascinates students of Georgia backroom shenanigans, it was so long before the Governor gave the order that the state police did not arrive until an hour after the riot was over and two hours and twenty minutes after they were called. Then a carload of them came to take Charlayne and Hamilton back to Atlanta.)\n\nThe riot was finally broken up by the arrival, together, of Dean Tate, who waded in and started grabbing identification cards, and of more Athens cops, who started fighting back when they were pushed, and then drove everybody away with tear gas. It had been a nasty riot, but the group courage that sometimes comes to mobs had never infected it. Although the students could have stormed the dormitory several times without meeting any effective defense, they never did. A few hours after the television newscasters had congratulated Georgia on its behavior, the area around Center Myers looked like a deserted battlefield, with bricks and broken glass on the lawn, small brush fires in the woods below the dormitory, and the bite of tear gas still in the air. The casualties were several injured policemen, a girl on the second floor who had been scratched by a rock, and, as it turned out, the university's reputation. Dean Williams suspended Charlayne and Hamilton, informing them that it was \"for your own safety and the safety of almost seven thousand other students,\" and they were driven back to Atlanta. Williams' on-the-spot decision to suspend the target of the mob, rather than those in the mob itself, seemed unrelated to anybody's safety, since it was made after the last rioter had gone home and after university and Athens officials had assured Williams that order had been restored and that giving in to the mob would only mean going through the whole experience again. Dean Williams and Charlayne, who was crying by this time and clutching a statue of the Madonna, walked right out of the front door of Center Myers into the state-police car, watched only by a few straggling reporters.\n\nFrom the moment the two arrived on campus, Charlayne attracted much more attention than Hamilton. At the time, some onlookers explained this by devising complicated anthropological theories about the greater interest in the enemy female. Others said it was only natural that unfriendly students should believe the girl more likely to be frightened away by their presence and that friendly students should think her more in need of their support. Dean Tate's answer is that it was merely a matter of convenience. He calculated that two or three times during the day there were two thousand students within two hundred yards of Charlayne, whose classes at the Henry W. Grady School of Journalism kept her on the busiest part of the campus, whereas there were far fewer students around the science center (which is removed from the main campus), where Hamilton spent most of the week. The fact that Charlayne took a dormitory room, while Hamilton moved in with a Negro family in Athens, made the difference even greater. Then, after the riot, stories about it, including a widely published picture of Charlayne leaving the dormitory in tears, made her better known to people outside Athens as well. The immediate result of Charlayne's publicity was that in her first week or two at Georgia she received about a thousand letters-three or four times the number Hamilton got-from all over the United States and several foreign countries. Charlayne's mother filed all the letters by states, the Georgia and New York folders ending up the fattest, and later sent each of the writers a reprint of an article Charlayne wrote about her experience for a now defunct Negro magazine called the Urbanite . I was interested in seeing just what people wrote in such letters, and during my trip this spring I borrowed the folders from Mrs. Hunter, who has them stored in a big pasteboard box. Charlayne told me later that the University of Georgia library would like to have the letters eventually but that she hesitated to give them up, especially while some of the writers might be embarrassed by even a historian's perusal of their names and opinions. That was an understandable objection, I thought, but it did seem like the justice of scholarship for the university to end up with nearly a thousand expressions of outrage at its behavior. There were only fifteen or twenty abusive letters, I discovered, and this surprised me, but I was more surprised to find that most of the particularly foul ones were from the North. The unfriendly letters from the South, even if they were written in the guise of kindly advice, were instantly recognizable, since in almost every case they contained no conventional salutation. \"Dear Charlayne\" would have been too chummy, and anybody willing to say \"Miss Hunter\" apparently would not have written a letter in the first place. Most of the writers solved the problem by starting out with a flat \"Charlayne Hunter,\" as if they were beginning a formal proclamation. There were also surprisingly few crank letters, although some of the writers were obviously just lonely people who wanted somebody to write to, and a few of the letters, like one from Italy that began, \"Dear Little Swallow,\" reflected emotions other than sympathy. A number were from Negro undergraduates (their own experiences with separate but equal education revealed in their spelling) who sent along a picture and hoped that a correspondence might develop. Many of the writers told Charlayne they were praying for her; many of the Catholics mentioned her conversion to Catholicism. She received dozens of prayer cards, copies of sermons by Harry Emerson Fosdick and Norman Vincent Peale, Seventh Day Adventist tracts, and two books by Gandhi. Several letters were from college student councils or N.A.A.C.P. chapters that had taken resolutions supporting Charlayne and deploring the action of those who persecuted her. Most of the letters from individuals also expressed admiration for Charlayne's \"courage and dignity\"-the phrase was used almost as one word-and outrage at the mob There was often a mention of helplessness in the letters from Northerners, which included phrases like \"This must be small comfort\" and \"Of course, I can never really understand.\" Some of those who believed they could never really understand nevertheless tried to establish their credentials for understanding, listing personal experiences with prejudice or with Negroes. A girl at the University of Connecticut told Charlayne that her high school had a Negro teacher, who was considered by all the students to be the best teacher in the school; the yearbook had been dedicated to him four out of the five years he had been there, she said. A young white woman in West Virginia wrote that she was attending a formerly all-Negro college. \" your people are teaching me ,\" she noted. But the great majority of the letters from the North had no personal experiences to offer. In many of them, a picture of Charlayne cut from a newspaper was enclosed, and most of them seemed to be from sensible, decent people who were appalled by the picture of a pretty girl being bullied by a mob and felt they had to write, even if they didn't know quite what to say.\n\nThe letters from Georgia had a different theme. Many of them were from University of Georgia alumni, who seemed to have a very specific and compelling reason for writing. They wanted to tell Charlayne that all of them were not like the mob or the people who permitted it to form. As I read through their letters, it seemed to me that each person who wrote felt he had to assure Charlayne of that or she might not know. On the whole, of course, the Georgia letters were also more realistic. But none quite captured the plain realism of a young boy in Rochester, New York, one of two dozen pupils in a parochial-school eighth grade who had apparently written to Charlayne as a class project. \"Dear Miss Hunter,\" he said. \"I am very sorry for the way you are being treated. I hope you have the courage to take this treatment in the future. Respectfully yours.\"\n\nI had first discussed the letters with Charlayne two years before, when she was back in Atlanta for the weekend after her second week at the university. Since her return to the campus following the riot, she had been under police protection, and in consequence she was now cut off from the rest of the students even more sharply than she had been during the chaotic first week. She seemed amazed and moved by the number of people who had written to her, but she found some of their letters slightly off the subject. \"All these people say 'Charlayne, we just want you to know you're not alone,' \" she said, smiling. \"But I look all around and I don't see anybody else.\"\n\nMany reasonable people in Georgia, when they look back on what everybody calls \"that night,\" believe that, all things considered, the riot was both inevitable and beneficial-a nice clean shocker to polarize opinion, revolt decent citizens, and purge the violent of their anger. This line of thinking has never appealed much to Charlayne, who tends to be less dispassionate about the events of that night, but she admits that the reaction to the riot by the state and the university meant that she and Hamilton need no longer have any real fear about their physical safety. About the only public figure in the state who did not express outrage over the riot was Peter Zach Geer, who was then Governor Vandiver's executive secretary and is now lieutenant governor; instead, he issued a statement, late that night, saying, in part, \"The students at the University have demonstrated that Georgia youth are possessed with the character and courage not to submit to dictatorship and tyranny.\" Geer now finds those ringing words a political liability. As for Governor Vandiver, with almost everybody else in a mood for law and order, he guaranteed that the peace would be maintained when, under a new court order, Charlayne and Hamilton returned to the campus the following Monday.\n\nIn their reactions to the riot, each of the groups involved in the situation-the state's politicians and the university's administration, faculty, and students-seemed to set the pattern for their future behavior. The university administration, looking around for somebody else to blame, eventually found the press (the group that had appeared most interested in preventing the riot) and \"outsiders,\" represented by seven Knights of the Ku Klux Klan who had been arrested in their car on the campus that night. The Klansmen, sullen, ugly, and properly ominous, had been armed, and did afford an indication of what might have happened if the tear gas had not broken up the mob, but, as a matter of fact, they had left their arms in the car and had taken no real part in the riot. Nevertheless, they had guns and bad reputations, and were more logical suspects than respectable law students. Administration officials at first thought that a ban on student demonstrations would be undemocratic, but by the end of the week, finding the pressure for the ban greater than the pressure against it, they established a permanent policy of not putting up with overt hostility.\n\nAs for the faculty, it had maintained silence while the administration felt its way through the crisis, but with the riot and the suspension of Charlayne and Hamilton it almost exploded. A meeting was called the night after the riot, and eventually about four hundred faculty members signed a resolution that said, in part, \"We insist that the two suspended students be returned to their classes.\" It was an extraordinarily strong statement for that time in Georgia; insisting that Negroes attend classes with whites was not a popular view, no matter what the circumstances. But the faculty went unpunished, and even when some professors organized groups to patrol the campus the first few nights Charlayne and Hamilton were back in Athens, there were no reprisals of any sort. The legislators in Atlanta noted the resolution with displeasure but expressed their displeasure in no concrete action. Instead, they set up an investigating committee called \"The Special Committee Appointed on the 12th Day of January, 1961, by the Speaker of the House of Representatives of the General Assembly of the State of Georgia to Find and Ascertain Facts Concerning the Certain Happenings and Episodes Surrounding the Admission of Two Negro Students to the University of Georgia.\" One of the facts the committee found and ascertained was that \"the majority of rocks were aimed at Center Myers Dormitory and not at persons.\" Another was that \"many students feel they are being unduly restrained in exercising their right of freedom of assembly and freedom of speech.\" But the legislators did not seem terribly interested, and sooner or later most of them actually appeared relieved to be done with this issue that had absorbed so much of their energy.\n\nThe pattern of the students' attitude toward Charlayne and Hamilton emerged during the week of their return. The fraternities and sororities let it be known that anybody interested in his own position on campus would be wise not to talk to the two Negroes. Another group of students, most of them associated in one way or another with Westminster House, the campus Presbyterian organization, formed a group called Students for Constructive Action. They posted signs about the Golden Rule in the classroom buildings and arranged to take turns walking with Charlayne and Hamilton on their way to classes. The girls in Center Myers had all trooped down to visit Charlayne the first night she was in the dormitory, reinforcing a widely held opinion that girls would always be kind to a new girl, even a new Negro girl, but on the following night-that of the riot-their behavior changed drastically. After the first brick and the first Coke bottle had crashed into her room, Charlayne went to a partly partitioned office, ordinarily used by one of the student counsellors, and stayed there during most of what followed. A group of Center Myers coeds soon formed a circle in front of the office and marched around, each screaming an insult as she got to the door. \"They had been told to strip their beds, because tear-gas fumes might get into the sheets,\" Charlayne said to me later. \"They kept yelling that they would give me twenty-five cents to make their beds, although at the hourly rate I was being paid by the N.A.A.C.P., according to them, it wouldn't have made much sense for me to work for a quarter. They kept yelling, 'Does she realize she's causing all this trouble?' Out of all the girls who had visited me the night before, only one girl came in and stayed in the office with me. But I finally made her go to bed. After a while, Mrs. Porter, the housemother, told me to get my things together, because I was going back to Atlanta, and that's when I started to cry. Dean Williams carried my books and my suitcase, which was pretty nice. He could have made me carry them. When we went by to pick up Hamp, he wanted to drive his own car back. I guess by then my imagination was running wild; I could imagine K.K.K. all up and down the highway. I didn't want Hamp to drive, and I almost got hysterical. Finally, he said O.K., he'd go with the troopers. Dean Tate went with us, and talked all the way back about the little towns we went through-things like why 'Dacula' is pronounced 'Da cu la,' Instead of ' Dac ula.' The next day, at home, the lights were low, and people kept coming by saying how sorry they were. It felt as if I had been ill for a long time and was about to go, or as if somebody had already died. I was going back to Athens, but I was glad we didn't have to go back for two or three days.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "How a Fictional Racist Plot Made the Headlines and Revealed an American Truth\n\nIn 1968, the African-American novelist John A. Williams published his\nthird novel, \" The Man Who Cried I Am ,\" a bitter, beautiful, and feverish\ndepiction of the failed promises of the civil-rights era. The novel,\nwhich was a best-seller and went through six printings, narrates the\nlives of two writers, one of whom, Max Reddick, is a journalist whose\ncareer path resembled Williams's own. Like Max, who had served in the\nArmy during the Second World War, Williams had enlisted in the Navy, where he\nwas almost killed-not by the enemy but by a gang of white American\nsailors. Both men later worked as beat reporters for New York magazines.\nTheir shared suspicion of the subtle, yet omnipresent, racism of the\nwhite creative class and the black integrationists who mimicked its\nliberal politics led both of them abroad-first to Europe, then to Africa\nat the height of the Black Power movement.\n\nThe novel's other central character, Harry Ames, is a celebrated black\nAmerican writer of social-protest fiction who so closely resembled\nRichard Wright that the lawyers at Little, Brown expressed some concern\nthat the author's estate would sue. And yet there are elements of\nWilliams's own story in Harry's, too. Like Harry, Williams had been\nnominated for a prestigious writing prize-the American Academy in Rome's\nRome Prize Fellowship-only to have it withdrawn without explanation. As\nWilliams recalled, he had lost the fellowship after a racially charged\ninterview with the academy's director, an incident that seemed proof to\nhim that most of the \"good, white moderate people of the North and\nSouth\" were privately \"anti-Negro,\" for to be so publically was \"no\nlonger fashionable.\" \"The vast silence-the awful, condoning silence that\nsurrounded the affair fits a groove worn,\" he reflected. \"The rejection\nconfirms my suspicions, not ever really dead and makes my 'paranoia'\nreal and therefore not 'paranoia' at all,\" he wrote in an article in Nugget . \"That is the sad thing, for I always work to lose it.\"\n\n\"The Man Who Cried I Am\" is a novel about the kind of paranoia that\nproves to be entirely justified, a theme that culminates in its\npenultimate chapter, in which Harry, living in self-imposed exile in\nParis, dies under suspicious circumstances. Before his death, we learn,\nhe had recently discovered a briefcase containing \"the King Alfred\nPlan\": a series of leaked documents outlining the measures that the U.S.\ngovernment would adopt if the racial unrest and discord of the\nmid-nineteen-sixties turned into civil war-an \"Emergency\" that would\ninvolve \"all 22 million members of the Minority.\" \"The Minority has\nadopted an almost military posture to gain its objectives, which are not\nclear to most Americans,\" the plan read. \"It is expected, therefore,\nthat, when those objectives are denied the Minority, racial war must be\nconsidered inevitable.\" The plan, which was named after the first\nAnglo-Saxon king of England, detailed how the government would\n\"terminate, once and for all, the Minority threat to the whole American\nsociety, and indeed, the Free World.\"\n\nIn the first draft of the novel, Williams unveiled the King Alfred Plan\nin what his editor, Harry Sions, described as a \"James Bondish note\"\nthat Harry Ames had written to Max, and which Sions deemed \"not quite\nconvincing.\" \"The reader must feel that it damn well could be true and\nindeed well may come true,\" Sions added, encouraging Williams to\nrevise the end of the novel to resemble \"one of a number of contingency\nplans which I'm sure our government must have in certain events, and\nwhich would be put in motion under specific circumstances, like an\noverall war.\" In response to Sion's notes, Williams designed six pages\nto imitate classified government documents, which included a memo from\nthe National Security Council rationalizing the plan, a crude map from\nthe Department of the Interior highlighting the regions where the\n\"Minority\" would be detained, and a bullet-pointed timetable from the\nSecretary of Defense outlining how the \"Minority\" would be subject to\n\"vaporization techniques\" or deported to Africa. In the novel's final\nchapter, Max reads the plan over the telephone to a black nationalist\nnamed Minister Q (a stand-in for Malcom X), urging him to revolt against\nthe state. Max's discovery, Williams writes in the final pages of the\nnovel, gave \"form and face and projection\" to American racism. His worst\nsuspicions were finally confirmed.\n\nJacksonville, Ferguson, Beavercreek, Waller County, Baltimore, and\nStaten Island are not named on the maps or timetables of Williams's\npages-but the themes of \"The Man Who Cried I Am,\" today a largely\nforgotten novel, continue to resound. There is something contemporary,\ntoo, in the way that Williams's fictional King Alfred Plan took hold of\nthe public imagination upon its publication, in 1967. That year, there\nwere uprisings in Boston, Philadelphia, Detroit, Newark, Milwaukee, and\nTampa, in which black men and women were assaulted by the police. The\nfederal government was known to be surveilling black leaders, and,\naccording to Williams, many activists were already convinced that the\nF.B.I., C.I.A., and local law-enforcement agencies were conspiring to\nneutralize the Black Panther Party and other radical organizations. As\nWilliams's agent, Carl D. Brandt, observed, the plan, when combined with\nthe novel's fictional but accurate portraits of Wright, Williams, Martin\nLuther King, Jr., and Malcolm X, as well as its faithful reporting on\nthe Kennedy White House's half-hearted desegregation initiatives and the\nrise of the Black Power movement, appeared \"entirely credible in the\nlight of current events as well as within the terms of necessity for the\nplot of the novel.\"\n\nThe fictional King Alfred Plan outlined the measures that the U.S. government would adopt if the racial unrest and discord of the mid-nineteen-sixties turned into civil war.\n\nWilliams, who had worked for a time in P.R., had an innate sense of what\nmight today be termed viral marketing. The summer before the book's\npublication, Little, Brown sent promotional materials-an excerpt of the\nKing Alfred Plan alongside details of the book's publication, all in a\nmanila folder labelled \" CLASSIFICATION: TOP SECRET \"-to two thousand\nbooksellers and jobbers. Williams thought that the King Alfred Plan\ncould make more of an impact if presented without the references to the\nnovel, and urged his publishers to take out a one-page ad in the Times to publish the plan without any reference to what it was or where it was\nfrom. Williams was \"enormously distressed\" when he learned that his\npublishers had balked, both because it seemed to him a missed\nopportunity to make a splash and because he sensed that the mere act of\nspeculating about the plan's authenticity had an almost revolutionary\npotential. For Williams, the documents weren't fake news but a conduit\nto a deeper truth. \"I don't believe it is cheap publicity,\" he wrote.\n\"The concentration camps do exist. I have since learned that the Federal\ngovernment does have such a contingency plan. We know that the Army and\nNational Guard as well as the local police are undergoing riot training.\nWhat in the hell is cheap about the truth?\"\n\nIn a schedule that he put together for his sales manager, Patrick\nMcCaleb, Williams suggested that Little, Brown \"get the plan in its CIA\nfolder, perhaps, to representatives of the Soviet bloc nations, either\npress or diplomats.\" He wanted copies to go \"the embassies of every\nnation mentioned in the plan\" and to \"make sure the Germans got a copy.\"\nHe also wanted \"copies to go in some mysterious fashion to Dick Gregory,\nJames Meredith, Claude McKissick, and Stokely Carmichael,\" the black\nactivists who Williams believed would \"make the most noise.\" The plan\nhad to look like it had no point of origin. \"Secrecy can be power, and\nthere is power in secrecy,\" Williams wrote to Sions.\n\nIn mid-October, Williams asked Little, Brown for a hundred copies of the\nplan-ones that made no mention of his novel-and began leaving them in\nsubway cars in Manhattan. According to Williams's friend, the journalist\nHerbert Boyd, \"The ploy worked so well that soon after black folks all\nover New York City were talking about 'the plan'-a fictitious plot that\nmany thought was true.\" As photocopies circulated, readers themselves\nedited the plan's visual presentation to enhance its authentic\nappearance and reproduced their versions of the plan in oppositional\nblack newspapers. Portions of the plan were redacted; the map was\nenhanced to include color-coördinated keys and city names where the\nconcentration camps were located; patterned code names such as \" REX -84,\"\nshort for \"Readiness Exercise 84,\" were affixed to the documents. The\nplan migrated north to Boston and west to Chicago, where members of\nactivist groups, unsure whether it was real or fictional, read it at\nmeetings, sometimes aloud, and interpreted how its designs reflected the\nhistory of black oppression in America. According to the Black\nTopographical Society of Chicago, the plan was key to understanding\neverything from racist hiring practices to how superhighways were\n\"always routed through black ghettoes to facilitate eventual military\noperations against those communities.\"\n\nIn 1970, Clive DePatten, a nineteen-year-old from Des Moines who had\njoined the Black Panther Party following a violent altercation with the\npolice, appeared in front of the House Internal Security Committee to\ntestify to the existence of a plan to exterminate blacks that he had\nencountered in an activist publication. According to an account in the\nHartford Courant , the congressmen let DePatten finish his testimony\nbefore informing him that the F.B.I. had already investigated the King\nAlfred Plan, in 1969, and had \"found it to be lifted from a novel, 'The\nMan Who Cried I Am,' by John A. Williams, a black himself.\" DePatten\nnevertheless insisted on its truth. \"Even if it actually is fictional,\nevents in the black community are paralleling those set out in the King\nAlfred Plan,\" he said. The urban-renewal projects of the\nnineteen-fifties and sixties had corralled black Americans \"into the\nghettoes,\" he argued, where they were as vulnerable to state brutality\nas interned Japanese-Americans during the Second World War or Jewish prisoners\nin Nazi concentration camps. \"It is a plan of fear,\" the Republican\ncongressman William J. Scherle said at DePatten's testimony. \"If you\nwant to believe it, sure, it will scare the hell out of you.\"\n\nThrough the early nineteen-seventies, many other people and\norganizations testified to the truth of the plan before the government:\nex-Army spies, who claimed that it was an open secret; the A.C.L.U.,\nwhich claimed that the Reverend Jesse Jackson was under surveillance by\nthe government. The government was dismissive of all their concerns.\nJust as Williams had found the American Academy in Rome's silence proof\nenough of their racism, they found in this response all they needed to\nconfirm their sense that Williams's fictional documents bespoke an\nAmerican truth.\n\nSections\n\nMore\n\n© 2025 Condé Nast.

      "text": "The Mission\n\nIn one of his more bizarre Oval Office confidences, Lyndon Johnson said that he didn't want to \"follow Hitler\" but that Hitler had the right idea: \"Just take a simple thing and repeat it often enough, even if it wasn't true, why, people accept it.\" Johnson was speaking by telephone to Martin Luther King, Jr., in Selma, Alabama, about how to convince Southern whites that Southern blacks deserved the franchise. The curious political-science tutorial came on the afternoon of January 15, 1965, King's thirty-sixth birthday. Whatever he may have thought of Johnson's inaccurate analogy, King had already begun repeating, on television, in the press, and from church pulpits, the moral necessity of a guaranteed vote for every American, regardless of color. Two weeks earlier, King had publicly announced that the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the alliance of Baptist preachers he led, would launch voter-registration protests in Selma, where fourteen thousand four hundred whites had, by legal ruse and naked force, limited fifteen thousand blacks to one per cent of the registration rolls.\n\nJohnson, as recorded by the secret Oval Office taping system, both commended and cautioned King on his Selma strategy. He was, he said, committed to getting federal voting legislation enacted, but he implied that King's timing and his tactics were dangerously precipitate. Johnson's Great Society programs for Medicare, Medicaid, education, and poverty were pending, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964 had already depleted congressional good will. King was by then expert at telling Johnson what Johnson wanted to hear, and managed to interrupt the Presidential monologue long enough to tell Johnson what he felt Johnson needed to know. He pointed out that, in the five Southern states that Johnson lost to Goldwater in 1964, fewer than forty per cent of eligible African-Americans were registered to vote. A voting-rights act would produce a coalition of blacks and white moderates, changing the electoral map of the South. Johnson liked that. It could be his greatest achievement, he said-\"It will do things that even that '64 Act couldn't do.\"\n\n\"At Canaan's Edge\" (Simon & Schuster; $35), the third and final volume of Taylor Branch's monumental chronicle, \"America in the King Years,\" covers the period from 1965 to 1968, and charts civil-rights history as the parallel biographies of two tragic titans-Martin Luther King, Jr., the modern Moses, and Lyndon Baines Johnson, the would-be Lincoln. The tape of Johnson's phone call to King has inspired speculation about their collusion in the design and execution of the Selma-Montgomery campaign; one student of the period recently called it the Johnson-King voting-rights \"pas de deux.\" Branch doesn't go this far, but he briskly relates how Johnson moved from annoyed doubt about Selma to outright collaboration within a matter of weeks. He urged King to expose the worst of voting conditions in Alabama, Mississippi, South Carolina, and Louisiana, but he could hardly have had in mind the brutal reaction of Selma's sheriff, Jim Clark. For King's purposes, however, Clark and his deputies were ideal-studio-cast thugs guaranteed to provoke national outrage and instigate federal intervention.\n\nThe march from Selma to Montgomery is one of America's grandest sagas, a racial, regional, and constitutional crisis whose flash points illuminate the country's path to social democracy. In his earlier volumes, Branch followed King's first steps along that path. \"Parting the Waters: America in the King Years, 1954-63\" went from the Montgomery bus boycott to the March on Washington. After Rosa Parks refused to surrender her seat to a white passenger aboard a city bus, King's friend and fellow Baptist pastor Ralph David Abernathy proposed a bus boycott, and King assumed the leadership of what soon became the victorious Montgomery Improvement Association. King and Abernathy moved to pastorates in Atlanta and formed the S.C.L.C., in order to capitalize on the gathering civil-rights momentum. After King made a visit to Gandhi's disciples in India, he developed a philosophy of nonviolent passive resistance out of what had been, back in Montgomery, a commonsense tactic. But it was the March on Washington, on August 28, 1963, that projected King indelibly into the national consciousness.\n\n\"Parting the Waters\" ended with King at the head of a civil-rights movement that had long been dominated by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Urban League, and faced with a pending civil-rights bill that Congress seemed unlikely to pass. But John F. Kennedy's assassination assured its passage, and it became the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Branch's second volume, \"Pillar of Fire: America in the King Years, 1963-65,\" followed the civil-rights path through an arena of white-supremacist violence in Birmingham, Alabama, and in Mississippi during the Freedom Summer, and culminated in King's receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. On January 18, 1965, he registered as a guest at the Hotel Albert, in Selma, the first black man ever to enter the front door of this antebellum replica of the Doge's Palace, in Venice. The civil-rights bill behind him, Martin Luther King had gone to Selma to launch a voter-registration drive. It escalated into a virtual replay of Reconstruction.\n\nIn the engrossing narration of Branch's final volume, events seem to unfold almost in real time. On a late January morning, in two proud waves, more than a hundred teachers, the backbone of Selma's black middle class, shook off more than two generations of diffidence and gathered at the county courthouse, demanding to be registered, while Jim Clark barked orders to disperse them. Two weeks later, he arrested King and Abernathy as they led a demonstration of more than seven hundred local citizens. National newspapers carried pictures of scores of black youngsters being pursued by police cars and pickup trucks with electric cattle prods dangling from the windows.\n\nOn March 1st, King preached at the Brown Chapel A.M.E. Church, in Selma, and proclaimed, \"We are going to bring a voting bill into being in the streets of Selma.\" These challenging words raised the stakes for a procrastinating Administration, as did the events at the Edmund Pettus Bridge the following Sunday. Branch's description of Bloody Sunday, one of this book's many effective set pieces, vividly captures the exact hour when the political order of the Deep South finally invalidated itself in the eyes of mainstream America. The carnage inflicted by municipal and state police at the bridge and along the marchers' route of retreat accomplished for voting rights what song, prayer, and marching had not. That evening, ABC was broadcasting the television première of \"Judgment at Nuremberg.\" Suddenly, forty-eight million Americans who had been watching an elderly German couple protesting their innocence of the Holocaust were confronted with scenes of people choking on tear gas, snarling dogs tearing at flesh, baton-wielding troopers on horseback, and bruised and traumatized men, women, and children. The activist Hosea Williams, a war veteran, bellowed that not even the Nazis had been more savage. Branch says, \"The Nuremberg interruption struck with the force of instant historical icon.\"\n\nKing and Abernathy were not at the Pettus Bridge on March 7th; they were preaching to their respective congregations in Atlanta, something that Branch is more prepared to excuse than other commentators have been. Two days later, King led a second attempt to march across the bridge, but with dangerously equivocal results. Governor George Wallace, segregation's last best hope, ordered Alabama officials to hold the line at all costs while he and King sought injunctions against each other. Forbidden to conduct a second march toward Montgomery, King faced an unprecedented dilemma: defy a federal court order and jeopardize Presidential good will, or cancel the march across Pettus Bridge, demoralize thousands of ordinary men and women, and risk vindicating the deep mistrust of the movement's more radical factions, such as the Student Nonviolent Coördinating Committee. Branch calls this chapter \"Devil's Choice.\" King, having promised the Brown Chapel audience that he would \"rather die on the highways of Alabama than make a butchery of my conscience,\" ended up doing the latter in the eyes of young militants. He ordered a retreat from the bridge just as the blocking phalanx of Alabama troopers stepped aside.\n\nStill, it was probably the right choice for history. Eight days after Pettus Bridge, Lyndon Johnson delivered his \"We Shall Overcome\" speech to Congress, an example of Presidential oratory arguably unsurpassed in idealism and emotional impact. The reworked phrases of the speechwriter Richard Goodwin fell upon a hushed chamber. Speaking that night \"for the dignity of man and the destiny of democracy,\" the President pledged the Administration to secure \"the full blessings of American life\" for the country's Negroes. \"Because it is not just Negroes, but really it is all of us, who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice. And we-shall-overcome.\" Liberal whites were electrified; whites in the Deep South were stupefied. Johnson was indeed on the verge of altering the South's political landscape, but not in the way that he and King had discussed on the phone. The withdrawal of Southern whites' allegiance from the Democrats-the Great White Switch, as it has been called-gathered speed soon after Johnson's speech. On the other side-for instance, in the SNCC leader James Forman's sneering comment \"That cracker was talkin' shit\"-was the voice of rising black nationalism.\n\nBranch's panoptic approach exposes telling juxtapositions: we see Johnson approving the reluctant recommendation of Attorney General Nicholas Katzenbach for a public declaration on voting rights, and then ordering his ever-sanguine Defense Secretary, Robert McNamara, to \"go ahead tonight\" and commence bombing Vietnam. Lyndon Johnson's tragedy, as Branch painstakingly (and perhaps too sympathetically) documents, is that his visionary domestic agenda was destroyed by the bombing of Vietnam.\n\nWithin a week of Johnson's stunning performance came the Selma-Montgomery march-a parade of citizens, film and other entertainment celebrities, national organizations, and religious delegations that rivalled the March on Washington, if not in numbers then at least in symbolism and spirit. George Wallace, having been alternately mauled and massaged into acquiescence during a three-hour Oval Office session, surrendered Alabama to Martin Luther King for five extraordinary days and nights. Three miles outside Montgomery-on a black Catholic academy's athletic field, where every famous name in America, from Belafonte and Bernstein to Odetta and Shelley Winters, seemed to be singing, playing, and speaking-twelve thousand pilgrims were exhilarated by King's preaching. His sermon was a stem-winder, beginning with an encapsulation of Reconstruction history and ending in a riff of magnificent call and response. \"How long will justice be crucified and truth buried?\" he asked, and went on to provide the answer: \" Not long!\" Branch writes, \"Already shouts echoed and anticipated his refrain at a driving pace, above cries of encouragement and a low roar of anticipation.\" King continued, \"How long? Not long! Because the arc of the moral universe is long , but it bends toward justice. How long? Not long! Because mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord.\"\n\nThe voting-rights bill became law on the sixth day of August, 1965, with Rosa Parks and King and the other principal civil-rights leaders present for the signing ceremony, at the Capitol. Almost from that moment, in Branch's telling, the reader has the sensation of watching history escape the control of the book's two main characters. The principal story lines (better balanced between the two men than in the second volume) are Johnson's sinking fast into the Vietnam quagmire, and King's increasing isolation as his mission expands to challenge America's fundamental social inequalities. The effect is like watching two bio-pics simultaneously. And, thanks to F.B.I. wiretaps and Oval Office tapes, the reader is at all times aware of each man's calculations about the other.\n\nBefore the end of 1965, Johnson had approved General William Westmoreland's request for more than a hundred thousand troops to supplement those already engaged in propping up the Saigon regime. In the course of Branch's book, the agonizing in the Oval Office, as the President alternately rails at and pleads with his advisers about the unwinnable Vietnam dilemma, starts to seem more farcical than tragic. \"The North Vietnamese just said, 'fuck you,' \" he tells a sympathetic U.S. senator. \"They're winning-why would they want to talk?\" George Ball, the UnderSecretary of State, tells the President in a secret memo that \"humiliation would be more likely\" than achieving U.S. objectives on the battlefield, while the historian and Presidential adviser Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., publicly warns of the terrible consequences of \"either enlargement or withdrawal.\" Bewildered and bellicose, Johnson dreaded being seen as a President too indecisive to win a war. He put a determined face on the State of the Union address in January, 1966, and vowed to continue the Great Society \"while we fight in Vietnam.\" Still, he confided to one of his generals that he felt \"a good deal of ice cracking\" under his feet.\n\nAll these developments stoked the growing radicalism in SNCC , which was soon beyond the reach even of King's persuasive powers. He could only grimace when James Forman or Stokely Carmichael provided the media with inflammatory sound bites. \"We're going to tear this county up,\" Carmichael told one gathering. King and the S.C.L.C. had hardly begun to plan the next chapter in nonviolent racial progress when the nation was confronted by the spectacle of the Watts riots, which began just five days after the Voting Rights Act was signed. Ten days after the signing, King risked his first public criticism of the Vietnam War. \"Reporters bolted for telephones,\" Branch notes, after King, in an address to the S.C.L.C.'s annual convention in Birmingham, announced his intention to write personal appeals for peace negotiations to world leaders, including Ho Chi Minh. A month later, at the President's insistence, King and Arthur Goldberg, the Ambassador to the United Nations, engaged in a frank seventy-minute give-and-take on the issue of Vietnam. Speaking afterward to the U.N. press corps, King outlined his \"unthinkable\" proposals-a halt to bombing, negotiations with the Vietcong, and U.N. recognition of Communist China. The fury of the Administration at this and the disdain of the media nearly matched the negative reaction of the African-American leadership class. F.B.I. agents, listening in on a conference call between King and his advisers, heard a beleaguered King say, with a sigh, that he had to find a way to \"gracefully pull out.\"\n\nBoth Vietnam and civil rights began to play poorly with much of the electorate as the midterm congressional elections approached. Richard Nixon, Gerald Ford, Strom Thurmond, and other Republicans blamed Johnson for not conducting the war vigorously enough. At the polls, liberals signalled their lack of support for the war, and the congressional Democrats lost badly. In early March of 1967, Robert F. Kennedy suggested that the heavy bombing of Vietnam be suspended. Within twenty-four hours, headlines carried news of Kennedy's involvement in a plot to assassinate Fidel Castro. Branch sets out the facts, and the reader is left to connect the dots running from an avenging Oval Office to an obliging F.B.I. headquarters.\n\nJ. Edgar Hoover looms unforgettably in these pages. No reader who has digested the Church Committee reports will be surprised by Branch's evidence of F.B.I. transgressions against King and anyone else Hoover deemed un-American. Referring to King as \"the burr head,\" Hoover provided Johnson with spurious reports of Communists at the center of the S.C.L.C. and with copious evidence of King's prolific extramarital calisthenics. Worse, he kept intelligence of assassination plots from King and barred F.B.I. agents from providing covert protection.\n\nNo longer primarily a Southern pastor fighting regional racism, Martin Luther King, as a Nobel Peace Prize laureate, had acquired an emboldened sense of mission. The Voting Rights Act addressed political disenfranchisement; it was now time to address economic disenfranchisement, or so he had told an increasingly wary and distracted Johnson. King believed that, just as marching in Alabama had caused Johnson to embrace an accelerated voting-rights timetable, so marches exposing slums, unemployment, and inferior public schools in particular Northern cities would force the Administration and Congress to pass remedial legislation. However, he seriously underestimated the difference between targeting parochial Southern hierarchies and espousing a truly redistributive program that called into question the way of life of most middle-class white Americans.\n\nKing also found it bitterly hard to gain any credence for his evolving social prescriptions either from the stodgy N.A.A.C.P. and Urban League leadership or from the emergent inner-city activists of SNCC . SNCC officers, with the notable exception of John Lewis, dismissed him as too cautious. But a clear majority of the S.C.L.C. board felt that King was becoming too outspoken. For them, his antiwar pronouncements undermined the core mission of ongoing registration in the South.\n\nLate in January, 1966, King surprised America by taking up residency in a tenement apartment in Chicago-a city that was home to the world's largest public-housing complex and to two of the poorest census tracts in the country. After six months of bruising marches through ethnic neighborhoods, fruitless exchanges with Chicago's real-estate and education boards, and much shadow-boxing with the nimble mayor, Richard Daley, King was ill and starting to realize that the political terrain here was rougher than in the South. Then, Branch writes, he heard that \"his latest staff prodigy,\" the young Jesse Jackson, \"had committed him impulsively to a suicidal march.\" Jackson had shouted, \"I'm going to Cicero!\" The prospect of Jackson attempting to desegregate Cicero, one of the city's most entrenched white working-class suburbs, was terrible enough to bring King, Daley, Archbishop John Cody, the veteran community leader Al Raby, and seventy-five contending parties swiftly to the negotiating table.\n\nAt times, Branch serves up more content than interpretation, assuming that facts speak for themselves. The Chicago Summit Agreement on open-housing and employment objectives, we read, glossed over details, in fine language intended to \"minimize potential ridicule\" resulting from the fact that little had been accomplished. One wishes that Branch had attempted to assess more closely the damage that the Chicago campaign did to King's national standing and to the prospects of Johnson's Great Society. Three weeks after the Summit Agreement, the Civil Rights Act of 1966, containing open-housing provisions that Illinois's Senator Everett Dirksen called \"a package of mischief for the country,\" failed to pass in the Senate. After the congressional Democrats' midterm disaster that fall, a brooding Johnson insisted that he hadn't \"lost that election\"; rather, \"the Negroes lost it.\"\n\nKing had no illusions about what happened in Chicago, but, in his view, a worse failure-a failure of judgment-was his participation in the Meredith march across Mississippi: a \"terrible mistake.\" Consulting no one, James Meredith had started a two-hundred-and-twenty-mile walk from Memphis to Jackson, Mississippi, to establish the right of black men to walk in the Deep South unmolested. When, one day into his walk, he was shot by a sniper at the Mississippi state line, King lent his name to an improvised, hyperbolic manifesto, then walked with three hundred and fifty student radicals to the Greenwood courthouse, where Stokely Carmichael shouted \"Black power!\" for the first time. This provocative slogan established Carmichael as a media phenomenon, and one who made Martin Luther King appear ineffective and dated. In January, 1967, a year after launching the Chicago campaign, King was no longer among the Gallup Poll's ten most admired personalities in America. \"Whites have ceased to believe in him, or really care,\" a lengthy dismissal in The New York Review of Books alleged. \"The blacks hardly listen.\"\n\nKing had begun to perceive that society tends to confine its indignation to injustices that can be attenuated without imperilling fundamental economic relationships. He was working in an era when the controversial Moynihan Report, which blamed black matriarchs and absent fathers for black poverty, rather than absent jobs, was widely accepted, whereas the prophetic Kerner Commission, indicting white society as \"deeply implicated in the ghetto,\" was ignored. Near the end of Branch's fourteen-year saga of a nation alternately affirming and denying the centrality of race, there is a telling moment. Late one evening, while his advisers and lieutenants debated the S.C.L.C.'s next move after the disappointing 1966 Chicago campaign, King momentarily gave way to pressure. Branch writes:\n\nKing literally howled against the paralyzed debate. \"I don't want to do this any more!\" he shouted alone. \"I want to go back to my little church!\" He banged around and yelled, which summoned anxious friends outside his room until Young and Abernathy gently removed his whiskey and talked him to bed.\n\nIn the determination to omit nothing relevant, \"At Canaan's Edge\" seems to keep the entire era in view at all times-immigration reform, media coverage of civil rights, education, the work of NASA , the Six-Day War, campus unrest, and much else. Such perspective yields fine insights. While narrating the passage of the Voting Rights Act, Branch weaves in an extended discussion of the Immigration Reform Act of 1965. Then he vaults forward to remind us that, although neither politicians nor the press grasped the Immigration Act's significance at the time, it \"rightfully joined the two great civil rights laws as a third enduring pillar of the freedom movement.\" Thirty-six years later, he mentions, the students at J. E. B. Stuart, a suburban Washington high school named after a Confederate cavalry general, came from seventy countries.\n\nWhen Johnson and King met at the White House for the last time, in late April, 1966, their civil-rights pas de deux was over. At Johnson's behest, Katzenbach had unleashed Hoover to uncover politically compromising information about King. (To some, the L.B.J.-M.L.K. relationship may have resembled that of Henry II and Thomas à Becket.) By the following spring, both men were set on irreversible and opposing courses. King's splendid antiwar speech in Manhattan's Riverside Church, on April 4, 1967, in which he called his government the \"greatest purveyor of violence in the world today,\" placed him in the vanguard of the peace movement. For Johnson, there was the public-opinion disaster of the Tet Offensive, which began in January, 1968, followed by Democratic primary challenges from Eugene McCarthy and Bobby Kennedy. For King, there was the public-opinion disaster of the riots surrounding the Memphis garbage strike, which occurred in the midst of another controversy, concerning the Poor People's Campaign. And, on April 4, 1968, there was the fatal rifle shot on the Lorraine Motel balcony, fired by an assassin about whom this book says little more.\n\nMartin Luther King, Jr., survived for a time the machinations of an unscrupulous national police force. He rose above the particularism of his own people in an almost quixotic and ultimately tragic attempt to deliver the entire country from racism, war, and greed. Taylor Branch, with his concluding volume, walks with the prophet and the President toward the promised land at the head of an interracial throng pledged to a new American covenant of social and economic justice. He leaves us there, pensive and remorseful, at Canaan's edge-King, his people, and all of us who were once inspired and then deceived by a great dream of a nation rising up to \"live out the true meaning of its creed.\" ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the April date on which King gave his antiwar speech at Riverside Church in New York City.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Social Activist Side of James Brown You Won't See In Get On Up\n\nPhoto by Robert Trippett-Pool/Getty Images\n\nThe first big screen biopic of the life of James Brown, Get On Up , takes pains to remind you of his genius nearly every chance it gets, but as others have rightly noted , the film falls short when it comes to probing the more complicated sides of the singer. This is especially true in regards to Brown's well-documented social activism, a significant and often contentious aspect of his character.\n\nDirector Tate Taylor and screenwriting partners (and siblings) Jez Butterworth and John-Henry Butterworth briefly touch on a few major events in Brown's career as an activist, including his performances for the troops in Vietnam, his concert on the evening following Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination , and his recording of \" Say It Loud (I'm Black and I'm Proud) .\" But there was a lot more to Brown the Activist than that, and it's a shame to leave so much of it out of the film. Below you'll find a brief primer on the key political moments from Brown's life that you won't see in Get On Up .\n\nThe \"March Against Fear\"\n\nOn June 6, 1966, James Meredith, the first black American accepted into the University of Mississippi, set out-solo-on a voting rights march leading from Memphis, Tennessee to Jackson, Mississippi. The following day, Meredith was shot by a white supremacist near Hernando, Mississippi; while recovering in the hospital, many black activists, including Martin Luther King, Jr. and Stokely Carmichael, descended upon Mississippi and picked up the march where he had left off. Brown was one of the many public figures to join them, performing at a rally later that month at the historically black Tougaloo College, hosted by comedian and activist Dick Gregory. This was Brown's first instance of social and political activism in the public's eye since becoming a star.\n\nIn his 1986 autobiography James Brown: The Godfather of Soul , the singer recalled the tensions within the Civil Rights Movement of the time:\n\nMartin was trying to keep things going in a nonviolent way, and Stokely and them were starting to talk about Black Power-and upsetting a whole lot of people with it, too ... Black Power meant different things to different people, see. To some people it meant black pride and black people owning businesses and having a voice in politics. That's what it meant to me ... I wanted to see people free, but I didn't see any reason for us to kill each other.\n\nCampaign With Hubert Humphrey\n\nSoon after the \"March Against Fear,\" Brown catapulted himself further into the political spotlight, recording the stay-in-school anthem \" Don't Be a Drop-Out .\" Brown took the first copy of the record to Vice President Hubert Humphrey. The two built a campaign around the song, with Brown visiting schools and stressing the importance of education.\n\nIn 1968, Brown endorsed Humphrey for president, though the Black Panthers saw this as an \"Uncle Tom\" move. Judging Brown as a sellout, some of these critics changed Brown's nickname to \" Sold Brother No. 1.\"\n\nEndorsement of Nixon\n\nGet On Up doesn't spend much time on Brown during the '70s, but that was a fascinating period in the singer's biography, both musically and politically. Brown, who always marched to the beat of his own drum, outraged many black Americans with his endorsement of Richard Nixon for re-election in 1972, and he was among a handful of prominent black entertainers-including Sammy Davis, Jr. and Johnny Mathis-who were publicly criticized for it. (It wasn't the first time he had shown some support for Nixon: In 1969, Brown performed \"Say It Loud\" at Nixon's inaugural ball .)\n\nAs Jet reported in November of that year, Brown's concert in Baltimore was picketed , and black militant groups planned to boycott his performances across the country. In his autobiography, Brown recalled the protests outside one of his performances at the Apollo after Nixon's re-election: Signs read \"James Brown-Nixon's Clown\" and \"Get the Clown Out of Town.\"\n\nBrown supported Nixon based on their shared enthusiasm for individualist policies and the notion that hard work, and hard work alone, would be the key to success for black Americans. In a statement made in the wake of Dr. King's death , Brown expounded upon his \"up by your bootstraps\" philosophy:\n\nYou know, in Augusta, Georgia I used to shine shoes on the steps of a radio station... I think we started at three cents, then we went to five and six. Never did get to a dime. But today, I own that radio station. You know what that is? That's Black Power... It's in knowing what you're talking about, being ready.\n\nBrown would speak of this philosophy frequently, and he even incorporated it into his music, as he did in the song \" I Don't Want Nobody to Give Me Nothing (Open Up the Door, I'll Get It Myself) .\" The singer admitted that his Nixon support \"cost [him] in a lot of ways,\" though he never regretted his decision.\n\nFriend of Strom Thurmond\n\nPerhaps the weirdest alliance Brown formed in his lifetime was with South Carolina senator and segregationist Strom Thurmond, infamous for his record-breaking filibuster in opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1957 (as well as for having a secret, illegitimate mixed-race child , revealed in the wake of his death in 2003). Brown held Thurmond in high regard , deeming him \"great for our country\": \"He's like a grandfather to me,\" he said.\n\nOn Black Identity\n\nDespite his contentious relationship with the Black Panthers, some of Brown's views did align with theirs. In a 1968 interview on The Mike Douglas Show alongside guest David Susskind, Brown openly discussed his stance on education and black identity. When Susskind referred to the \"very misguided\" black militants who advocated for separatism, Brown replied:\n\nI believe that black people can talk to black people better than you can talk to black people. Don't you think so? And so we have to have our own way of speaking. We got to have our own way. We want to have our own community. There's nothing wrong with that.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

      "text": "Ole Miss Struggles to Be a New Miss\n\nPhoto by Andy Lyons/Getty Images\n\nThis article originally appeared in Inside Higher Ed .\n\nTo most University of Mississippi students and alumni, calling the institution \"Ole Miss\" is just natural. It's what people say. University email addresses are @olemiss.edu, not @umiss.edu. But not everyone likes the name.\n\nThe university's announcement on Friday that, as part of a review of race relations at the university, it would encourage \"appropriate\" use of the term won praise from some quarters but plenty of criticism. So did a series of other announcements by the university, which is hoping to change its association with symbols of the Confederacy. Reports commissioned by the university (which influenced Friday's announcement) angered some students and alumni-particularly those with ties to the Greek system-by discussing the perceptions of some black students and alumni who are far more critical of university traditions and life at the university than are white students and alumni.\n\nOne of the reports, discussing a student focus group, linked the Greek system and the symbols of Southern history: \"A number of students believe that the traditional fraternities and sororities serve as attractors, incubators, and protectors for students wedded to the symbols and beliefs of the South's racist past. With few exceptions, the majority of the group, white and black, nodded in agreement. The African American students shared examples of indignities they have been subject to or witness of that involved the fraternities and sororities.\"\n\n\"Every black student in the room said that they had been called the 'N-word' at least once on campus,\" the report says. \"From rejection of people of color into the organizations, chanting 'The South will rise again' at sporting events, to hurling racist and sexual epithets at innocent passersby, the Greeks are viewed as a major problem.\"\n\nThe university announcement didn't use language anything like that but talked about making the university more inclusive. The university announced a series of recommendations that it was endorsing:\n\nCreate a new vice chancellor's position for diversity and inclusion Develop \"a set of standards for diversity and engagement\" Deal \"squarely\" with issues of race. Provide more \"context\" in various ways for people to understand the history of race relations at the university Change the names of some facilities to draw attention to black Mississippi figures. For example, a road will be renamed to honor Lee \"Chucky\" Mullins, a black football player who was paralyzed and later died. Change the name of \"Confederate Drive\" to \"Chapel Lane\" Seeking \"appropriate\" use of the Ole Miss name\n\nA statement from Chancellor Dan Jones said, \"We will need to continue a dialogue on race at our university. Our unique history regarding race provides not only a larger responsibility for providing leadership on race issues, but also a large opportunity-one we should and will embrace.\"\n\nThe University of Mississippi was segregated for decades and admitted James Meredith as its first black student in 1962 only after multiple court orders and federal intervention-and days of riots by white people opposed to integration. A statue of Meredith at the university-seen as a symbol of the institution acknowledging its history-was vandalized with a noose this year, and three fraternity members were accused of being responsible.\n\nThis is not the first time the university has tried to limit its association with Confederate symbols. In the 1990s, amid concerns that waving the Confederate flag at football games was discouraging black athletes from enrolling, the university adopted new rules designed to bar the flag (although the rules were not explicit about the Confederate flag to avoid violations of the First Amendment). A federal appeals court in 1990 upheld the rules (which barred all large flags or flags on sticks from football games) and the Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal. While the university won the legal ruling, confederate symbols (many times unofficially) continued to be associated with the university.\n\nThe Ole Miss Name\n\nThe current review is broader than many of the previous efforts, which focused on specific practices such as flying Confederate flags. The university is now discussing diversity broadly, and history and symbols and names that have created strong emotional connections for many students and alumni. The Ole Miss name is a particularly contentious issue.\n\nThe university statement said this on the Ole Miss name: \"UM's longstanding nickname is beloved by the vast majority of its students and alumni. But a few, especially some university faculty, are uncomfortable with it. Some don't want it used at all and some simply don't want it used within the academic context.\" The statement noted that the university did a national study of people's responses to the name and found that most people view it only as \"an affectionate name for the university\" and that \"a very small percentage of respondents associate the university, either as 'Ole Miss' or 'University of Mississippi,' with negative race issues.\"\n\nThe statement said that \"both names will be used in appropriate contexts going forward, with particular emphasis going to 'Ole Miss' in athletics and as a representation of the university's spirit.\"\n\nThe report commissioned by the chancellor went further in characterizing discontent with the breadth of the use of Ole Miss. The report was by Edward L. Ayers, the noted Civil War historian who is president of the University of Richmond, and Christy Coleman, of the American Civil War Center in Richmond. They noted the way the city of Richmond has overcome some tensions about its history not by trying to cover it up but by promoting better understanding of history, and they suggest the university do the same. The university has many symbols, they note in their report, but little context is provided, and it is badly needed.\n\n\"Such work would provide a more coherent narrative than currently exists, in which several isolated monuments, including the Confederate Memorial and the James Meredith monument, seem to stand at polar opposites, with vast blank spaces of time and struggle missing,\" they write. \"People are not told in any meaningful way about the world of slavery in which the University began, the decision for secession that shaped everything that followed, or the segregation that dominated life in the South for a century after the Civil War.\"\n\nOf the Ole Miss name, they note that some but not all who use the name are aware of its antebellum past (a name slaves would use for the woman married to the plantation owner). And while the report agrees that many students and alumni love the name, it adds that they see the nickname as a symbol that holds the university back. \"Building a dialect version of 'old' into an institution that is built to prepare for the future strikes them as inherently problematic,\" the report says. It also notes that many are reluctant to speak out publicly for fear of offending those who revere the name.\n\nThe report adds: \"A nickname cannot carry the weight and gravity of the state's name or convey the seriousness of purpose that an important institution of research, health care, and social mission deserves. In interactions involving grant proposals, job applications, or letters of recommendation in particular, we were told; faculty, staff, and students chafe at having the email address read 'olemiss.edu.' They think the University should identify itself as 'umiss.edu' in such contexts. This does seem worth considering for official university business and the university might well consider making 'Mississippi' or 'The University of Mississippi' the default. The nickname could be reserved, as it is for almost all other universities, for athletics and alumni relations.\"\n\nWhile that report and the university statement didn't in fact ban the use of Ole Miss, asking only for consideration of the name's use, many alumni took to Twitter to condemn Chancellor Jones for a ban he didn't in fact issue.\n\nA typical comment: \"DAN JONES is a MORON and should be fired immediately!! He is CLUELESS and an embarrassment to MY OLE MISS!!!\" Notably, some of the comments that praised Jones on Twitter for raising these issues expressed doubt that he could change some parts of the university's culture, such as the name. Said another tweet: \"If you think the name 'Ole Miss' is going anywhere, you are misinformed. BUT, what Dan Jones IS doing is overdue and courageous.\"\n\nErasing the Past?\n\nAn open letter to the chancellor circulating, particularly among supporters of the Greek system at Mississippi, takes on many of the ideas in the new policies and in the reports commissioned by the university.\n\n\"Does changing our email address URL from \"olemiss.edu\" to \"umiss.edu,\" promote diversity?,\" the letter says. \"Or does it suggest that we are a school that is ashamed of itself and ashamed of its past? While the University of Mississippi has a history that we may not be proud of as modern Americans, the best approach is not to do what we can to erase the past. While it may seem like a noble idea to restrict 'Ole Miss' to the athletic field, the fact is that I will continue to refer to the school as Ole Miss no matter what. Does this make me a racist? Or does this make me a student that is fond of the nickname (or simply fond of fewer syllables)?\"\n\nBut the letter took particular exception to the statements about the Greek system. \"[T]he comments about the Greek system are the most offensive. Chancellor Jones, I understand that these comments are not necessarily your opinion, and may not even be the opinion of many. As an Ole Miss student ... and an active member of my sorority, being referred to as a girl 'wedded to the symbols and beliefs of the South's racist past' simply for being a member of a Greek organization is both offensive, false, and, to be frank, it is hypocritical of the University of Mississippi to post such comments in a report trying to promote diversity. Because of the actions of three fraternity members last semester, the entire Greek community is now subjected to the scolding looks of faculty, administration, and every non-Greek student. How does that promote diversity?\"\n\nAnd the letter also expressed fear about creating a new senior position in the administration to focus on diversity, saying that \"by trying to promote racial diversity, you are creating new problems.\" By creating the new position, the letter says, \"you are suggesting to the rest of the world that Ole Miss is inherently a racist school, and her students are incapable of change on their own.\"\n\nWhile various parties are debating the new effort on race at Mississippi, one observer on Twitter wrote that the chancellor, accused of denigrating tradition, might not be, at least in all respects. The comment: \"Dan Jones is, in fact, preserving the most time-honored tradition at Ole Miss: arguing over tradition.\"\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Rebel Yelp\n\nIt's not easy explaining to people why I'm a big fan of the Ole Miss Rebels football team, especially since I didn't go to school at Ole Miss and don't live in Mississippi. But my dad was from Ole Miss' hometown, Oxford, and he, my two older brothers, and a niece and nephew all put in time at the school.\n\nI grew up partly in Jackson, Miss., intensely devoted to the Red and Blue (colors originally borrowed not from the Confederate flag, but from Harvard and Yale). In fact, I was derailed from my destiny as a drunken, flunkin' Ole Miss frat boy only because we moved from Jackson to Garden City, Kan., when I was in ninth grade. I didn't want to go, and I begged my parents to leave me behind, rent me an apartment, buy me a season ticket to Ole Miss home games (the big ones were mostly played in Jackson back then), and trust me to \"act responsibly\" during my three years on the loose in high school.\n\nNo dice. I was forced onto the prairie schooner, and I ended up going to a small state college in Kansas and then back south to Vanderbilt, in Nashville, where I secretly cheered when the Rebels thumped the always-struggling Commodores.\n\nPeople will gladly cut slack for adults with pathetic attachments to college football teams (especially nationally prominent ones like Notre Dame and USC), but when the Rebels enter the conversation, they seize up.\n\n\"Ole Miss,\" they'll say. \"Isn't that like a ... slavery name?\"\n\n\"Yes. Unfortunately, back in the bad old days, that was a nickname slaves used for the mistress of a plantation. But time has softened the connotations. The name now suggests friendly hospitality, as in, 'Hey, it's good ol' Mississippi.' \"\n\n\"Uh-huh. And the whole rebel flag thing?\"\n\n\"Fans aren't allowed to wave those anymore. But I can't lie. The Confederate imagery is a tricky situation.\"\n\nBut I can lie by not mentioning other messy trivia. Ole Miss holds claim to the most gruesome incidence of the Sports Illustrated cover jinx: Just after the magazine put the Rebels on a 1962 cover , riots broke out over the enrollment of Ole Miss' first black student, James Meredith. Further back in time, we find that, up until 1936, the University of Mississippi mascot was the Flood. A vote to pick a new name yielded two close finishers: Rebels and, um, Ole Massas. According to an excellent historical summary published in the Daily Mississippian , Ole Miss' student newspaper, \"The Confederate army nickname was selected because Ole Miss Rebels was easier to say than Ole Miss Ole Massas.\" So, if not for that narrow phonetic escape, Ole Miss fans literally might have been in the stands yelling, \"Beat 'em, Ole Massas!\"\n\nSuch baggage makes my current challenge that much greater. Ole Miss will play Oklahoma State in the Cotton Bowl on Jan. 2, and I'd like you to \"be for them,\" as we used to say down South. A win in this storied bowl could be a turning point for a program that has struggled-with off-and-on success but never real greatness-since the 1968-1970 era, when Archie Manning was the quarterback.\n\nIn recent seasons Archie's son Eli has been at the helm, a jillion-yards-passing phenom who led the Rebels through a bizarre 2003 miracle season. The team started out awful, with a squeaker win over Vandy and losses to Memphis and Texas Tech, thanks to a weak defense that has been a chronic problem.\n\nBut then something clicked. The offense kept mushing, the defense stiffened, and the Rebels started defeating SEC opponents, with wins over Florida (in the Swamp), Alabama, South Carolina, Arkansas, and Auburn. The Dream hit a pothole on Nov. 22 when Ole Miss faced third-ranked LSU in Oxford. A victory would have secured sole possession of the Southeastern Conference Western Division title and a trip to the SEC championship game in Atlanta. Alas, though Ole Miss played valiantly, they lost 17-14. Despite the bitter taste, Ole Miss fans can't help but be thrilled at how this season turned out.\n\n\"OK,\" you're saying. \"That's stirring, and Eli is cool, so I'm with you. What do you need?\"\n\nNot much. Just mental positrons aimed at Dallas on Jan. 2, along with your lifelong commitment to emotionally supporting Ole Miss over despised foes like Auburn, Alabama, LSU, and Mississippi State.\n\n\"OK,\" you're saying. \"I'm not with you anymore.\"\n\nI figured you could only go so far. In terms of total conversions, my lifetime average is zero. The problem is that, no matter how much Ole Miss tries to adapt to modern times-and they do try; right now the school administration is licking wounds from an aborted attempt to replace the Colonel Rebel mascot with perky substitutes called Rowdy Rebel and Rebel Bruiser -there's little to recommend them to non-cult-members except for their uniforms , the nattiest in all of college football.\n\nIn 1990 I dragged my girlfriend (now wife) to the last Egg Bowl played in Jackson, hoping to brainwash her. The Egg Bowl is the annual scrum between Ole Miss and the Mississippi State Bulldogs-which just happens to be the most heated college football rivalry that no one outside of Mississippi cares about. As we entered the stadium, I tried to explain to Susan that her future obligations included \"hating\" the Bulldogs. But she was too busy starting to seriously dislike Ole Miss.\n\nThe Confederate flags were the first glitch-they were still street-legal back then. But more damning were the students. Rebel frat boys and sorority girls \"dress up\" for the games, the men looking like junior FBI agents in their jackets, ties, and sunglasses; the women looking like they just graduated from Laura Ashley Clown School. Susan was frowning at the garb when a Rebel fan walked by wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with an insult directed at State: \"WE'RE NOT SNOBS. WE'RE JUST BETTER THAN YOU.\"\n\nHer first tenderly posed question: Why the hell is Ole Miss \"better\" than State? I explained that this involved a classic dynamic that embroils many competing state universities: the liberal-arts campus with the law and medical schools (like Texas or Ole Miss) versus the agricultural-and-mechanical campus with the ag and engineering programs (like Texas A&M or Mississippi State). I didn't explain that, as is true in the Texas/A&M hatefest, Ole Miss fans regard themselves as an \"elite\" and they scorn State fans as sun-addled redneck loons. That one just doesn't  translate well.\n\nShe snorted. Ole Miss was better because it produces shyster lawyers instead of food producers? Before long she was hailing the \"proletarian\" sound of the State fans ringing their god-awful cowbells. Later, she saw the competing mascots bouncing around on the field: Colonel Rebel and Bully the Bulldog. \"Ohhhh,\" she said. \"The bulldog is so cute!\"\n\nOle Miss won that day, 21-9, but the '90s weren't outstanding for the team. They went to some middling bowls and got slapped with NCAA sanctions in 1994. Rebel fans watched with horror as State gained an edge under head coach Jackie Sherrill, an irritating cuss who rubbed me the wrong way starting in 1992, when he had a bull castrated on the practice field to motivate his players before a game against Texas. The Sherrill era has ended badly. His last three teams finished a combined 8-27, and the Bulldogs are looking down the barrel of a major NCAA investigation into recruiting violations. (Ole Miss could be heading for some trouble, too, involving a running back who may have received booster help in purchasing an SUV.) State made a smart move after Sherrill's departure by hiring the first black football coach in SEC history, Sylvester Croom, but this obviously fine individual will face an uphill slog.\n\nGiven State's current woes, the table was set for serious gloating on Thanksgiving night, when I traveled to Starkville to watch the 2003 Egg Bowl. But somehow I couldn't muster any animosity. I've met a lot of State people over the years, and they have a vexing tendency to be really, really nice. At the game itself-a 31-0 Ole Miss victory played in a driving rainstorm-the bedraggled Bulldog faithful, looking soggy in their throwaway ponchos, aroused only sympathy. I roamed the sidelines talking to fans and met a hulking end-zone presence named David \"Big Dave\" Miller, who made it clear that he will stick with his Dogs even if they go 0-120 over the next decade. How do you hate a guy like that?\n\nThe truth is, both schools have enough problems that they'd be well-advised to cease the loathing vibe and try a rising-tide-lifts-all-boats approach, as in, \"We hope you're good, but we hope we're better.\" In that hopelessly naive vein, I'll close with a few positive suggestions for building a better future.\n\nFor both teams: Enough already with the clumsy NCAA violations. Leave that stuff to Alabama.\n\nFor State: Lose the cowbells and change your school colors to something other than maroon-and-white. (Sorry, but those colors will always scream \"Shriner.\") I'd switch to \"brick\" and \"charcoal,\" a more designerish combo that also bespeaks your school's devotion to industry. Meanwhile, clone multiple copies of your live bulldog mascot immediately-he's damn cute.\n\nFor Ole Miss: The administration's current schizo approach to the Rebel Problem isn't working. At present the situation is: Rebel flags and on-field Colonel Rebel mascot, not OK. Rebel nickname, Rebel mascot circulating goofily among fans outside the stadium before games, and playing \"Dixie\" inside the stadium, OK.\n\nDoesn't make much sense, does it? For a possible solution, I'd reach further into the past. The school's association with Confederate stuff goes back all the way, and it's nothing to be ashamed of. In 1861, a group of Mississippi students, relatives, and locals formed a 150-man company that came to final grief at Gettysburg, where it's said that every soldier remaining from the original group was killed or wounded.\n\nThe name of this brave outfit, adapted slightly, could work just fine. I'm usually against using uncountable nouns for team names-Tide, Blaze, Heat-but how do you like the sound of this? The University of Mississippi Fighting Greys, or the Ole Miss Greys for short. You can keep the little colonel guy on school merchandise-he's cute, too!-but I'd update his uniform to match the school's current atmosphere: Give him khaki pants, a navy blazer, and a go cup full of rum and Coke.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

Like us on Facebook , follow us on Twitter @slatevault , and find us on Tumblr. Find out more about what this space is all about here .\n\nThis flyer, around 5,000 copies of which were distributed around Dallas in the days before President Kennedy's November 22, 1963 visit, accused Kennedy of a range of offenses, from being \"lax\" on Communism, to \"appointing anti-Christians to Federal office,\" to lying to the American people about his personal life.\n\nGeneral Edwin A. Walker, a Texan who served in World War II and the Korean War, had resigned his Army post in 1961 after a Kennedy-ordered investigation found that he had violated the Hatch Act , which prohibits federal employees from engaging in political activity on the job, by distributing John Birch Society literature to his troops. Walker moved to Dallas and became a leader of right-wing activity in the city (more on the full range of that activity here ). The ex-General led resistance to James Meredith's 1962 enrollment at the University of Mississippi and unsuccessfully ran for the position of Texas governor .\n\nAfter the assassination, Walker's organization was briefly under suspicion, and the Warren Commission investigation tracked these flyers to Walker's aide Robert Surrey. Surrey had overseen the distribution of the sheets in the days prior to JFK's arrival; members of Walker's organization, acting on his behalf, placed them under windshield wipers and in newspaper racks.\n\nWalker's group was exonerated of involvement with the assassination, but the Warren Commission did turn up a bizarre coincidence. On April 10, 1963, Walker was sitting at his desk in his home study when a bullet fired from outside the house narrowly missed his head. According to Marina Oswald's testimony, which the Commission found convincing, Lee Harvey Oswald had carefully planned and executed this attempted murder, months before his November assassination of the President.

      "text": "\"Negro to Address Ole Miss Class\"\n\nSomewhere in my attic there is a fading copy of a campus newspaper from 1967-my first year as a law professor at the University of Mississippi. The headline, as I recall, says \"Negro to Address Ole Miss Class.\" In the space of my own adulthood, a world in which a guest lecture by a black man was a front-page news story has morphed into a world in which a person of color will be speaking on the Rebel campus tonight as a candidate for president of the United States. When my wife and I first arrived in Oxford, Miss., she to teach English and I to teach law, we entered a deeper South than the one we had known growing up in New Orleans and North Carolina. We were not quite prepared for the triumphal playing of \"Dixie\" and the unfurling of an enormous Confederate battle flag over the entire playing field, marking the opening of every home game. Bullet holes still scarred our faculty apartment building from shots fired when three people died a few years earlier in the turmoil over James Meredith's admission to the university. Until my wife, Anne, protested, the waiting room of the only obstetrician in town was still divided into designated \"white\" and \"colored\" sections.\n\nThe law-school dean was a liberal lawyer from Poplarville, Miss., who was determined to educate black lawyers on behalf of the state. He recruited some wonderful Mississippi lawyers for the faculty-as well as half a dozen newly minted graduates of Yale Law School. By my second year, more than 50 black students were enrolled in the law school.\n\nAs one of two Southerners in the contingent drawn from Yale, I was assigned to teach political and civil rights. I was told some students taped my lectures and sent them to the White Citizens' Council. In an effort to combine the doctrinal material with the real world of the civil rights struggle, I invited several guest lecturers to my class. Mississippi pharmacist and state NAACP President Aaron Henry was my first guest, followed by the extraordinary civil rights lawyer Marion Wright (now Edelman) and William Simmons of the White Citizens' Council in Jackson, Miss.\n\nI can't know for sure whether Aaron Henry was the first person of color to lecture at the university, but the campus paper certainly thought so and made of it a very notable event. One of my students-whose relatives were reputed to be Klansmen-asked whether he could sit in a chair in the hall and listen to Henry lecture through the open door. His religion, he explained, precluded him from being present at an event at which a black person was in a role of authority. I told him it would be up to Mr. Henry, who agreed to this \"separation\" with a ready smile.\n\nIt seemed at the time a historic event, which is probably why I still have that old newspaper. Now, on the day of the appearance on the campus of candidate Barack Obama, I am amazed at how close and how far away that Oxford of the 1960s really seems. One other event from that time is equally vivid: In the spring of our second and final year at Ole Miss, Martin Luther King Jr. was killed in Memphis, Tenn.,  80 miles to the north. The Mississippi state government kept its flags flying proudly at full mast. When black students at the university insisted the campus lower its American flag to half-mast, University officials sought to avoid \"taking sides\" by removing the flag altogether and leaving the pole bare.\n\nIn response, black students hoisted an American flag back onto the pole and stationed it at half mast. Reports circulated that rural whites with guns were headed to the campus to raise it forcibly to the top of the pole. Black students stood guard through the night. I had composed a guest editorial as a tribute to King for the student newspaper, but because of the concern over the possibility of campus violence, the university was closed and the newspaper did not print that day.\n\nWhat I had wanted to explain to the campus about King was drawn from an observation by one of my Yale professors, the late Charles L. Black Jr., that the tragedy of Southern race relations is drawn from that prima materia of tragedy: \"the failure to recognize kinship.\" King had felt the bond of kinship between Southern whites and blacks, and he understood that his work could help liberate the entire South from the grasp of segregation. As I tried to explain to my Mississippi students, King came not to defeat but to redeem his white brothers and sisters.\n\nSen. Barack Obama comes to Oxford tonight in a far more exalted role than Aaron Henry did in his appearance as a guest lecturer 40 years ago. But while the fact of his race is no longer front-page news, I am nevertheless struck by the thread that connects both appearances. Tonight's visit to the home of the Ole Miss Rebels by a person of color seeking the presidency of the United States is just one more step on a journey of redemption for Americans, both white and black. The fact that his race is not front-page news tells me we are on the right track.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "The Conservative Movement's Favorite Legal Theory Is Rooted in Racism\n\nAt least five justices on the Supreme Court identify as originalists, meaning they believe judges must interpret the Constitution as it was understood when ratified. Originalism is ascendant everywhere: on SCOTUS, on the lower courts stacked with Donald Trump nominees, in law schools and Congress and state legislatures. The Republican Party endorses originalism in its platform every four years. GOP politicians wield the doctrine to justify their own policies to attack those favored by Democrats. Progressive lawyers may fight and Democrats may gripe about it, but originalism is clearly here to stay.\n\nAll of which raises an important question: Where, exactly, did originalism come from? Its proponents frequently assert that it is a reaction to freewheeling liberal judicial activists imposing their own views on the Constitution through an approach often called \"living constitutionalism.\" In a groundbreaking article published in American Political Science Review, however, University of Chicago Ph.D. candidate Calvin TerBeek argues that modern originalism arose out of the backlash to Brown v. Board of Education , the landmark 1954 Supreme Court decision prohibiting public school segregation. TerBeek's research-which spanned 14 archival collections, thousands of newspapers and magazines, and interviews with key players-all points in one direction: Originalism has fundamentally racist roots.\n\nOn Tuesday, I spoke with TerBeek about the link between opposition to desegregation and a theory that dominates the current Supreme Court. Our conversation has been edited and condensed for clarity.\n\nMark Joseph Stern: How did conservatives develop originalism as a weapon to combat Brown ?\n\nCalvin TerBeek: After Brown came down, conservatives developed a handful of different arguments against it. The first was, let's revive interposition and nullification, which would let states ignore Brown . It was not simply Southern conservatives making this argument-elite intellectual conservatives were, too. But after Little Rock and James Meredith at Ole Miss , these conservatives start to realize they were not going to revive interposition and nullification because they're obviously rooted in antebellum Southern slavery.\n\nThis is where Barry Goldwater's 1960 book The Conscience of a Conservative comes in. Goldwater alights on this \"original intent\" idea that had been floating around saying that the 14 th Amendment's framers had no intent of creating integrated schools. He said, this is simply a constitutional principle-it'd be great if schools were desegregated, but unfortunately the Supreme Court can't do that, because it's not the original intent of the 14 th Amendment's framers. From then on in the 1960s, you really start to see the conservative movement, particularly intellectuals, the folks in the law schools, start to build this up into an academic theory.\n\nA daily email update of the stories you need to read right now.\n\nYou mentioned that the theory had been floating around for a while before it migrated to law schools. Where did it crop up first?\n\nIt was one of the main charges against Brown from the jump. But initially, the conservatives making these arguments were not elite legal academics. They were mostly media impresarios who opposed desegregation, like Dan Smoot, Clarence Manion, folks on National Review's masthead, and politicians like Goldwater. You do have some less elite academics, as well as some state court judges and lower federal court judges, making these intent-based arguments. They would say, well the original intent of the framers was only to secure a few basic rights for Black people; they certainly never meant to have desegregated schools.\n\nAs it became taboo to make more racially explicit arguments, these conservatives moved toward treating this as a matter of first constitutional principles of interpretation. They'd say: Whether or not segregation is moral or immoral has nothing to do with the inquiry. We must simply look to what the 14 th Amendment's framers thought, and that's simply what the law is. And so, what Chief Justice Earl Warren did in Brown is not only wrong, but illegitimate as law. By moving the terrain of the argument to what they called first constitutional principles, it was no longer immediately apparent that this theory is racialized. Brown 's critics could say, \"Well, are you claiming these first constitutional principles are themselves racist? That can't be true.\"\n\nHow did the argument catch fire with the conservative legal elite?\n\nSome folks in the law schools-most notably a conservative lawyer and law professors named Alfred Avins, who defended literacy tests at the Supreme Court-started to build up this idea into an academic theory. Yale Law professor Robert Bork talked about the \"framers' intent\" in a now-canonical law review article in 1971. Six years later, Harvard Law professor Raoul Berger endorsed \"original intent\" in his book Government by Judiciary . Berger's book repeatedly attacked Brown . When Berger went on William F. Buckley's show Firing Line to promote his book, he said \"the intention\" of the framers was \"to create separate schools.\" But Berger said he didn't support overturning Brown because \"the expectations have been aroused in the breasts of the Blacks.\"\n\nThese are the type of racialized things that today's originalists leave on the cutting room floor when they tell their own history of originalism. Originalists both on the court and in the legal academy have not dealt with the theory's racist roots.\n\nThe standard origin story of originalism today often starts with Bork's 1971 article. But you found that Bork's role is vastly overstated.\n\nAs it turns out, Bork was not all that important of a thinker. He was far more interested in being a public intellectual and also active in Republican and movement conservative politics. When he's getting ready to write this now-canonical 1971 law journal article, he even says, \"these are preliminary thoughts.\" And during the 1970s, his article wasn't cited all that much, or viewed as a new huge theoretical statement. Berger was probably more important for cohering the idea of original intent.\n\nBut Bork became Richard Nixon's solicitor general, and he gave the theory a pedigree that allowed Ronald Reagan's Justice Department to promote originalism. And that's when the theory really took off.\n\nIt was terribly important that Bork was at Yale and Berger was at Harvard because this allowed legal academics and governing elites-like Ed Meese, who was counselor to Reagan, then his attorney general-to claim that this was a sophisticated theory from the highest echelons of the legal academy. Meese said originalism had to be taken seriously. And he was seen as the conservative guy in the White House.\n\nBy the way, Reagan's chief of staff James Baker called Meese \"big bigot,\" and called assistant counselor T. Kenneth Cribb \"baby bigot.\" It was an open secret that these guys were racists.\n\nHow do you respond to originalists who say, well, we've moved from original intent to original meaning , so all this history is irrelevant?\n\nThe politics of it never change. You can go from original intent to original public meaning, but the same politics are always driving the bus. It's not an objective theory. It's a deeply, inherently political one. And what that move did more than anything else, theoretically, was give conservatives a wider terrain of space to have a more proactive originalism, one that was not simply interested in cutting down Brown and the Warren court but also laying the groundwork for a more muscular, proactive conservative jurisprudence.\n\nHow do you respond to those who claim that originalism was actually the accepted theory of constitutional law until progressives overthrew it in the 20 th century with living constitutionalism?\n\nWhat we think of as originalist theory today is not what people were doing before living constitutionalism. To impute back to them the theory of originalism is to take our present day framework and place it onto them in ways that they would not have understood. This is Intellectual History 101. When people invoked the \"original intent\" construct prior to Brown , they almost always did so in this high level of generality, an argument from 10,000 feet. They would say things like, \"The growth of the bureaucracy has resulted in the perversion of the intent of the Constitution.\" Or they would criticize progressive amendments, like those allowing women's suffrage and an income tax, as running afoul of what the Constitution was supposed to mean as originally drafted.\n\nThey did not mine specific clauses in constitutional amendments to figure out what the Framers thought when they wrote the text of the Constitution; that was just not part of their toolkit. Originalism as we know it today developed directly in response to Brown .\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Eugene Hoskins Is His Name\n\n\" Eugene Hoskins is his name . He lives at Oxford, Miss., a University place of about three thousand people. He is well known about town for his eccentricities.\" Thus begins the 1920 account of a 24-year-old black man whose constellation of neuropsychological symptoms-that is to say, his \"eccentricities\"-are now immediately recognizable as those of an autistic savant. Remarking on his \"uncanny knowledge of dates,\" the case report relates how \"a bystander said to him: 'I was married on the 8 th of June, 1901.' Without a moment's hesitation Eugene said: 'Dat was a Satu'day.' Given the month, day and year, he will give the day of the week. He never fails, never hesitates. Vary if you will by giving the year and month and asking what day of the month was the second Tuesday, or the fourth Friday-he answers just the same.\"\n\nThe author of this Southern-drawled study from the Journal of Applied Psychology was a hygiene professor at the University of Mississippi named Hiram Byrd. After describing Hoskins as a tall and lanky \"eight-rock,\" Byrd offers a footnote for his naïve Yankee readers: \"A pure blood African is, among some of the Southern negroes, called 'eight-rock,' while half-breeds are known as 'ginger-breads' and lighter shades as 'high-yellows.' \" Despite this casual racist tone, Byrd shows a genuine interest in Hoskins as a human being, and shares observations made with both a cold, clinical gaze and a novelist's sympathetic eye. One can picture a suspender-wearing Byrd dictating his case report to a secretary while leaning back in a rickety leather-padded chair and chewing on the end of a pipe, the distant ah-hoo-gas of Model Ts and the sound of horse hooves clacking just outside his window.\n\nSuch details we'll never know. We do know this: Over the next 92 years, Byrd's brief report on Hoskins would be cited just a dozen or so times, and tangentially at that. Today the eccentric young man from Oxford is merely one of countless characters whose mental anomalies haunt the undisturbed volumes that decompose on library bookshelves. But there are at least two reasons for us to look at Hoskins more closely. First, he appears to be among the first black Americans ever to be described-unintentionally, of course-as possessing the clear hallmarks of autism. (The very first might be Thomas \"Blind Tom\" Wiggins , an autistic savant born into slavery in 1848 on a Georgia plantation whose prodigious musical abilities as a \"negro boy pianist\" made him world-famous.) Second, Hoskins happened to call home a place that would soon be immortalized by another Oxford resident, an aspiring young writer less than a year apart from him in age, named William Faulkner.\n\nTo appreciate Hoskins' role in the history of autism, realize just how swiftly our knowledge of this neurocognitive disorder has evolved over such a short span of time. In Hoskins' day, autistics of all races and ethnicities were scattered across small towns and burgeoning metropolises, and many of these people were institutionalized after being misdiagnosed as \"idiots\" or schizophrenics. Autism wouldn't be identified as such for another two decades. (I'd stumbled upon Byrd's ancient article only by chance while writing a piece on the demoralizing vocabulary once used to refer to those with mental disabilities. Byrd's study of Hoskins was titled, \"A Case of Phenomenal Memorizing by a Feeble-Minded Negro.\") It wasn't until 1943 that an Austrian-born psychiatrist from Johns Hopkins named Leo Kanner published a report of 11 children exhibiting a distinct set of social and emotional deficits. \"[These] children's relation to people is altogether different,\" wrote Kanner. \"Every one, upon entering the office, immediately went after blocks, toys, or other objects, without paying the least attention to the persons present ... the people figured in about the same manner as did the desk, the bookshelf, or the filing cabinet.\" Kanner's diagnostic christening of autism was made against the asocial mind of Donald Triplett (\"Case 1\"), a 9-year-old boy from a privileged white family living just a few hours south of Oxford in Forest, Miss. (You can read a 2010 profile of Triplett in the Atlantic .)\n\nSince Kanner's initial report, innumerable scholarly articles and chapters have examined various aspects of autistic spectrum disorder-everything from its genetic and neurochemical underpinnings to its impact on family members and the community at large. Yet few studies have focused on the question of how autism relates to race and ethnicity. Although there are no known differences in the prevalence or epidemiology of the disorder ( 16.8 of every 10,000 individuals have autistic disorder, and 62.6 fall somewhere along the spectrum), black families have often been underrepresented in genetic studies. A common prerequisite for participating in genetic research is that both parents provide their DNA, too-which means that minority children, who are disproportionately raised in single-parent households, are often excluded. There are also disparities in the diagnosis and treatment of minority children. Black autistic children are more likely to be mislabeled as having, say, ADHD or conduct disorder, and when they are properly identified, the diagnosis comes significantly later than it would for their white peers. These disparities are probably due to diminished access to health care (one-third of all black children are in the welfare system, compared with 9 percent of white children), lower rates of education among black parents, and the prejudices of physicians who may be more inclined to focus on black children's disruptive social behaviors or generalized intellectual deficits, rather than their other symptoms of autism.\n\nIf invidious stereotypes can still creep into the clinic as psychiatric bias, consider how the perception of black intelligence in 1920s Mississippi might have influenced a scholar like Byrd. Oxford is the same town, keep in mind, where more than 40 years later James Meredith waded through a sea of angry segregationists and U.S. marshals to pass the university's Lyceum doors as the first black man enrolled at Ole Miss. Anyone who has ever read a Faulkner novel about \" Yoknapatawpha County \" (the author's fictitious name for the locale) grasps the sharp and unquestioned racial divides of that specific place in time.\n\nBut Hoskins' autism made him stand out from other blacks, and his difficulty in reading into the behavior of other people may have shielded him, in some ways, from the overt injustices that so dehumanized his peers. From Byrd's descriptions, Hoskins seems almost to transcend race: \"He is a never ending source of entertainment for them,\" writes the professor of Hoskins' impressive calendar performances for dumbfounded undergrads on the Ole Miss campus. \"He has a habit of mumbling to himself, and often laughs right out.\" Onlookers would often toss him a nickel, but rarely would he accept more. \"He has been known to refuse a dollar and [to] become indignant when the donor put it in his pocket. He would not touch it and insisted that it be taken out.\"\n\nThis brings us to the question of how Hoskins, an undiagnosed, black autistic savant living in the egregiously racist Deep South of 1920, managed to get by. Byrd tells us that Hoskins was cared for by a white family named the Gambles, \"who furnish him with food and clothes and a place to sleep, in return for which he delivers papers, gets in coal, feeds the pigs on the farm, and does little odds and ends about the place ... he trusts the Gambles implicitly.\" Hoskins was especially close to Mr. Gamble. Being known about town by several names-Eugene, Gene, James, and Jim-he loathed being called the latter; this entitlement was reserved for Mr. Gamble alone. When someone else once shouted over to \"Jim\" for a pail of water to help put out a burning house up the road, \"he balked and refused to move.\" When Byrd asked him why he did this, Hoskins replied, \"Da wasn't talkin' to me-I ain't Jim.\"\n\nI wanted to learn more about Hoskins' life, including how he came to live with the Gambles. So after consulting with a local historian by email, a few weeks ago I visited Oxford to sift through the county archives. The Gambles, it seems, had owned a small general store near the train depot that catered to weary rail travelers and incoming students. A 1920 census shows that the family was living on a road adjacent to the station. These pieces fit together when considering another clue to Hoskins' autism-his obsession with trains. Byrd tells us that the subject of his case report was frequently at the train depot, a place redolent with honeysuckle and coal, and which for generations was a hectic passenger node along the Illinois Central. \"I was talking with him once when the locomotive whistled. He darted out of the room almost like a released spring. I asked him yesterday if he meets all the trains. He said not, and told me of two or three times that the trains had passed when he didn't meet them.\" Byrd describes having departed from Oxford on a train between 3 and 4 a.m. one chilly morning, and finding Hoskins alone on the platform. He was likely scribbling notes on train engine numbers into his notebook-an object for scientific study that Byrd would later pry from his hands with \"suggestive pressure\" for a peek inside. My guess is that the Gambles gradually warmed up to the peculiar young man always milling about outside their shop or hunched over a notebook, murmuring cryptic route numbers and soliciting birthdates from perplexed passengers, and that's how they came to take him under their wing and open up their home to him.\n\nSuch a preoccupation with public transportation routes-or other nonsocial \"circumscribed interests\"-is widely recognized as an autistic trait. Trains, planes, blocks, home electronics, computer equipment, road signs, and sporting equipment have all been identified as topics of \"high autism interest.\" It's clear that Hoskins wasn't just a train buff; his notebook revealed a blinkered obsession with detailed engine numbers and arrival schedules to the exclusion of all else. Byrd also noticed in Hoskins the autistic savant's inability to solve easy problems that fall outside narrow domains of expertise. \"He did the most astonishing and contradictory things,\" observes Byrd. \"Although he has such a wonderful memory for dates, he failed utterly to repeat five digits.\" (The average 7-year-old can perform this task.) \"In [spatial intelligence tasks] he made a superior record. ... Everything pertaining to ages and dates was perfect. But he could interpret a picture only in terms of enumeration, could define in terms of use only, and thought that house rhymed with day .\" From such results, Byrd surmised that Hoskins had a mental age between 8 to 9 years. (I have posted some more background elsewhere on the science of autistic savantism, calendar calculation, and circumscribed interests .)\n\nWhile in Oxford, I visited the old train depot, which after decades of abandonment had been acquired by the university in 2001 and beautifully restored a few years later. Today the building serves as a multipurpose facility for the community. The railroad has long been paved over with asphalt and the vanished tracks extend into a traffic intersection of more recent vintage, but standing on the very spot that Hoskins staked out so regularly transported me back to the age of the Harding administration. If any images of him exist, they most likely survive in some old photos of the depot. Maybe an eager student took a picture or two of his snappily dressed classmates on arriving into town in the 1920s, and happened to capture an image-slightly out of frame and in the shadowy distance-of a tall, slender black man with a notebook in his hand, staring expectantly down the tracks. While such a photo may indeed be pasted into a forgotten family album in some attic out there, the few dated photos of the train station that I could find at the public library showed not a single black person; only the epochal stares of the white Southern middle class looked back at me .\n\nSoon after writing his report on Hoskins, Byrd left Ole Miss for the University of Alabama, where he'd been hired to run their first department of hygiene. He published a book in 1922 titled Forty Notifiable Diseases , but his citation trail runs cold after that. Yet it was the fate of Hoskins that grabbed my interest, and I had one advantage in my search: his name. A similar case study today would describe its subject as \"an African-American male, aged 24\" or as someone \"living in the Southern United States,\" but psychologists of the 1920s weren't especially concerned about protecting the identities of their human subjects. Hoskins himself may have had some reservations about publicity, though. \"At length I struck his tender spot,\" writes Byrd after several weeks of cozying up to the man by way of introduction through the Gambles. \"After complimenting him on his unusual ability, I asked him why he didn't put it in the paper. Told him I would write it up for him if he wanted me to. 'Den everybody see it,' he said. But I didn't press the matter then.\"\n\nHoskins' military draft card from 1918 shows a \"P.T. Gamble\" as his employer. A 1920-census cross-check confirms the name of Hoskins' patron, Patton T. Gamble. Mrs. Gamble was called Annie, and the couple was then living with their three children, Baskin (26), Lillian (19), and Jewel (16). I was able to track Baskin Gamble to Memphis, where he ran a filling station in the early 1940s and died in 1963. The records indicate that Hoskins, meanwhile, may have lived periodically in Coldwater, Miss., about an hour north of Oxford, where he lists a half-brother named Thomas Ellis as his nearest relative. The 1930 census shows him as a boarder in that area, residing with a \"Negro\" couple named Sam and Hatti Lee. But Hoskins returned to Oxford at some point. His 1972 Social Security Death Index shows he died there in his mid-70s.\n\nSitting in the Oxford Public Library, I thumbed my way through a list of thousands of departed souls in a survey of the segregated black cemeteries in town. There was no sign of Eugene's bones anywhere, nor was his obituary in the papers. The telephone directory showed that both Coldwater and Oxford are home to several Hoskinses today. There's even a \"Hoskin Road\" in Coldwater. The people who answered the phone at these numbers listened patiently and politely as I told them the story of Eugene, but he was a complete mystery to them; they knew of no history of autism in the family and even the older ones couldn't recall ever hearing anything about an odd relative who spoke of trains or calendars. Autism is considered heritable, and researchers have even found that the occupational histories of people in a given lineage often overlap with the nonsocial characteristics of autism-an abundance of, say, engineers or mathematicians in a family. But these folks all seemed intuitively sociable to me. It was as though Byrd's \"feebleminded negro with a phenomenal memory\" had faded gradually into the backdrop of a storied town that had seen so much change in a half-century, until he disappeared altogether into the hot Mississippi sun.\n\nOn one of my walks through Oxford, I happened to stroll past the house where William Faulkner lived briefly with his new bride, Estelle, while writing As I Lay Dying in a six-week literary tour de force in 1929. It had been years since I'd read any Faulkner and, though he'd definitely been in the back of my mind while wandering in search of Hoskins' ghost, this imposing neoclassical structure jarred me into a very different type of investigation. There's little question that Faulkner would have known of Hoskins and crossed paths with him; not only were both notorious in this small town during the 1920s (Faulkner for his drinking and storytelling, Hoskins for his eccentricities), but Faulkner famously did a stint as the university's lackluster postmaster between 1921 and 1924. One of his daily responsibilities, in fact, was dropping off mail at the train depot. If Hoskins made as strong an impression on Faulkner as he did on Byrd and the other town residents, might some glimmers of him actually appear in Faulkner's work?\n\nIt's long been taken for granted that Faulkner based his most famous \"feebleminded\" character, that of Benjy Compson in The Sound and the Fury (1929), on a white man in his 30s named Edwin Chandler . Chandler, whom Faulkner often watched as a boy bellowing and pacing behind the iron gate of his wealthy family's antebellum home near the square , is believed to have had Down syndrome, and the connections are indisputable. But there may be more to the story. When I discussed my research with Jay Watson, a professor of English at Ole Miss and the president of the William Faulkner Society , he noted that Benjy's predicament in the book evokes the black experience in several ways: Like a slave, Benjy is stripped of his given name and reassigned a biblical one; he is castrated after being accused of assaulting a white girl; his \"domain\" is on a former plantation; and so on. At one point in the book, the character of Versh even tells Benjy that he's turning into a \"bluegum,\" an archaic derogatory term for blacks. Though Watson had never heard of Eugene Hoskins before, he found the possible Faulkner connection intriguing.\n\nAfter several days spent in the Deep South, looking for signs of Hoskins and visiting friends, my partner and I (and our two dogs) hit the road back to Ithaca, N.Y., and on that unconscionably long drive home, we listened to the nine-hour unabridged audio version of The Sound and the Fury , tuning our ears for the slightest evocation of Eugene. There was no mention of calendar calculators or train-engine connoisseurs, but Faulkner does seem to endow Benjy-only incidentally, perhaps-with a voice that, against the background of today's scientific knowledge, sounds distinctly autistic. Soothed only by routines such as staring into the fireplace, holding his mother's cushion, or standing at the fence looking at schoolgirls, Benjy inhabits a world of perpetual motion and chaos. In those who chatter and buzz around him, he sees mostly frightening, unpredictable action. In Benjy, Faulkner narrates the autism archetype, a fragile vessel of a mind that processes and contains only the literal.\n\nBack at home now, I'm looking onto a snow-covered field in upstate New York, but my thoughts are still with Hoskins, standing alone at the train depot. I wonder if he was around the day that the Illinois Central ended its passenger service into Oxford in 1941. Did he return to the closed station anyway, staring down rusty, old tracks overgrown with weeds? The predictability of those numbered train engines that whistled into town had given Hoskins a sense of obtainable order and a purpose for decades. As an early case study in autistic savantism, we can look back at his life now and see just how purposeful it really was. I find solace in the thought that whether he lives on in the corpus of science or in the history of American literature, this long-forgotten man never really went away.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC.

      "text": "Department of Homeland Screw-Up\n\nThe Bush administration has been staggeringly ineffectual in its response to the rapidly deteriorating situation in New Orleans. Its failures are painful evidence of how far we have to go in developing the capability to respond rapidly to a mass-casualty disaster.\n\nThe president's statement this afternoon set the tone. Rather than direct the U.S. military to immediately assist the thousands of people without food or water in the city center, Bush assured the nation that expected gasoline shortages would be temporary and that his father and former President Clinton were ready to pass the tin can to ensure private-sector support for rebuilding New Orleans. As people began dying around the Convention Center, and Mayor Ray Nagin resorted to issuing a pathetic SOS over CNN, Homeland Security Chief Michael Chertoff spoke empathetically of the suffering of the people in New Orleans. But somehow he seemed proud that 72 hours after the hurricane hit, only 2,800 National Guardsmen had come to the city. The number is about to reach 12,000 by tomorrow. That is awfully late for the people stranded there. Yet Lt. Gen. Russel Honoré, who is commanding the military component of Washington's response, pleaded for patience from the people of New Orleans, promising that the U.S. Army was \"building the capability\" to help them.\n\nBuilding the capability? How is it possible that with the fourth anniversary of 9/11 almost upon us, the federal government doesn't have in hand the capability to prepare for and then manage a large urban disaster, natural or man-made? In terms of the challenge to government, there is little difference between a terrorist attack that wounds many people and renders a significant portion of a city uninhabitable, and the fallout this week from the failure of one of New Orleans' major levees. Indeed, a terrorist could have chosen a levee for his target. Or a dirty-bomb attack in New Orleans could have caused the same sort of forced evacuation we are seeing and the widespread sickness that is likely to follow.\n\nChertoff's Department of Homeland Security demonstrated today that it could organize an impressive press conference in Washington, lining up every participating civilian or military service from the Coast Guard to the Federal Emergency Management Agency to promise its cooperation. But on the ground in Louisiana, where it counts, DHS is turning out to be the sum of its inefficient parts. The department looks like what its biggest critics predicted: a new level of bureaucracy grafted onto a collection of largely ineffectual under-agencies.\n\nWhat has DHS been doing if not readying itself and its subcomponents for a likely disaster? The collapse of a New Orleans levee has long led a list of worst-case urban crisis scenarios. The dots had already been connected. Over the last century, New Orleans has sunk 3 feet deeper below sea level. With each inch, pressure grows along the levees. Meanwhile the loss of wetlands and the shrinking of the Gulf Coast's barrier islands have reduced the natural protection from hurricane winds. The weakness of the levees was underscored in a 2002 wide-ranging exploration of New Orleans' hurricane vulnerability by the New Orleans Times-Picayune , one of many grimly vindicated Cassandras. The U.S. Army Corp of Engineers, which built the levees and continues to manage them, told the paper then that there was little threat of a levee's collapse. But the corps admitted that its estimates were 40 years old and that no one had bothered to update them.\n\nThe response to Katrina thus far indicates two flaws in the Bush administration's thinking about homeland security. The federal government hasn't learned how to plan for a tragedy that demands putting a city on sustained life-support, as opposed to a one-moment-in-time attack that requires recovering the dead and injured from debris and then quickly rebuilding. And DHS appears unwilling to plan for the early use of the U.S. military to cope with a civilian tragedy. Presidential administrations have perennially underestimated the difficulty of the latter task. In 1962, President John F. Kennedy's top aide, Kenneth O'Donnell, thought it would be easy to deploy troops rapidly to defend James Meredith when he was attacked by segregationists while trying to enroll as the University of Mississippi's first black student. \"If the President of the United States calls up and says, 'Get your ass down there,' \" O'Donnell said, \"I would think they'd be on a fucking plane in about five minutes.\" Kennedy made that call. But then, in spite of O'Donnell's prediction, he watched in frustration as the army dithered for hours before deploying to Oxford, Miss.\n\nThe Kennedy administration thus learned that the army must be told in advance what to do. As a matter of law and preference, the military does little training for domestic missions. It balks and mutters about posse comitatus, the legal principle that prohibits the use of the army for law enforcement, and leaves the hard work for the National Guard and state and local authorities. This has made sense most of the time. But in an era when we are supposed to be better prepared for an urban disaster, the tradition of allowing local and state authorities to be overwhelmed before the federal government and military step in should have been rethought.\n\nLocated only three hours from New Orleans is Fort Polk, home of the 4 th Brigade of the 10 th Mountain Division, a light infantry unit with about 3,000 soldiers. Also at Fort Polk is the Joint Readiness Training Center, which prepares military units to respond rapidly to crises abroad. The 4 th Brigade has been training for duty in Afghanistan. Why was it also not ready to take on a local disaster scenario in hurricane season? Or at the least, once the National Hurricane Center predicted that the eye of Katrina would come close to New Orleans, couldn't DHS have deployed the military to help shore up the levees?\n\nAnd in the event of a WMD attack, when there would likely be no warning at all, what is DHS's contingency plan for moving into position the army or the marines to restore order and sustain life? In the wake of Katrina and the breached levee, the answer seems to be not much of one. In the wake of 9/11, that is worse than incomprehensible. It is unforgivable.\n\nSlate is published by The Slate\n          Group, a Graham Holdings Company.\n\nAll contents ©\n        2025\n        The Slate Group LLC. All rights reserved."

We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe South represents slavery and bigotry. Living here has emboldened me like nowhere else I've been before.\n\nby Jemar Tisby\n\nI almost swerved off the road the first time I saw cotton in full bloom.\n\nI had seen the dull green cotton plants crawling toward the sky through the summer months. Then, practically overnight, the cotton bolls exploded to reveal their fluffy prize. Nothing moves fast in the South - except when it does.\n\nMy wife's grandmother spent some of her childhood days picking cotton. She described to me how the plant grudgingly yielded its prize, how the spiny shell would scrape open her fingers.\n\nCotton farming is all automated now. Huge machines comb the plants for their fibrous cotton centers. The cotton gets smashed into huge rectangular bales that are loaded onto flatbed trucks and shipped off for processing. But when those fields are blooming, you can't help but picture slaves dressed in rags, hunched over in the oppressive heat, their hands scarred from years of labor.\n\nThe first question I get when I tell people I live in the Mississippi Delta is, \"Why?\"\n\nThis is what strikes me most about the Deep South - the immediacy of the past. Nothing stands between you and the stories you hear about slavery, Jim Crow, and the civil rights movement. This history is in the ground you walk on and the people you live among.\n\nThe delta is a place historian James C. Cobb called \"the most Southern place on earth.\" For most people it's a region that brings up pictures of slavery, lynching, and poverty. So why would I, a black man from the Midwest, volunteer to move to the cradle of American racism?\n\nMy journey in the South started as a middle school teacher. I joined the Teach for America program and signed up for a two-year stint in a new public charter school on the Arkansas side of the Mississippi River.\n\nAt first, I hated it. This tiny rural town felt like an island. Even more remote than an island, it seemed detached from both space and time. I couldn't even describe to friends and family back home - \"It's real down here\" is the best I could come up with.\n\nSome of the differences from places I'd lived before were trivial. Store hours were rarely followed. You still can't buy alcohol on Sundays. Camouflage is always appropriate attire, whether you're going to the dentist or even church. And be careful driving at night - you don't want to be stranded on a country road in the delta with no towns or streetlights for miles.\n\nBut there was the darker stuff. On my daily commute, I would pass a truck weigh station that flew the state flag. Mississippi is the last state in the country to retain the \"Southern cross\" on its flag; it defiantly sits in the upper left corner of the banner. At this truck station, the flag hangs just below the American flag, the two symbols inseparable from each other.\n\nEven the cemeteries are segregated. In our town, the Confederate cemetery, which now sits in the corner of a larger cemetery, was meant only for white people.

We were divorced from our native soil on the African continent and shipped to agricultural regions of North America; the Deep South is as close as many African Americans will get to their past.\n\nI could have easily left after my two-year commitment - but I didn't. The people I surrounded myself with and the impact I was making on my students in this small Southern town kept me rooted in place. But it was more than that. In some sense, I chose to live in the Deep South not in spite of its racial past but because of it. The racial wounds are apparent here, and they help me see this nation for what it truly is.\n\nAlthough the trend is changing , black people have been stealing away from the South for decades. It's a place that represents bondage, lynching, and the humiliation of second-class citizenship.

The real estate company showed us certain properties, while our white co-teachers had access to more and better options in the wealthier parts of town.

So in their minds, we weren't as big a risk as the locals who probably saw even fewer sites than we did.\n\nSuch blatant discrimination confused and then angered me. I wanted to boycott the company, but there were only a couple of real estate brokers in town and this one had the most properties by far. While we did have other options, they weren't very good ones. We ended up renting from them. A sense of powerlessness simmered into frustration - the bitter realization that principles and pragmatism don't often dwell in harmony when it comes to race in America.\n\nBut as long as there has been oppression, people have resisted it. Living in the South has turned my attention to the countless women and men whose acts of defiance, both everyday and exceptional, broke down barriers and built new bridges.\n\nWhen I was teaching a Sunday school class at my church in Jackson, Mississippi, I noticed an older man with a rim of gray hair around his balding head sitting quietly. When I later asked who he was, I found out he was James Meredith - a man who, in 1962, became the first African-American student at the University of Mississippi. The night before he started classes, white segregationists started a riot on campus. By the end, thousands of federal troops had been dispatched to quell the chaos and two people were dead.\n\nThis kind of thing - a personal encounter with a living legend of the civil rights movement - has a way of reminding you that the worst days of segregation and racism are not that far away.\n\nI think many people were appalled at what happened in Charlottesville, Virginia , because they thought America had moved past such performative displays of white supremacy. But I wasn't surprised at all. Living in the Deep South has taught me that racism never really goes away.

The library, located in Biloxi, a six-hour drive from my house to the Mississippi Gulf Coast, is dedicated to preserving and celebrating his memory. Like many rich Southern men, Davis owned people. Few placards mentioned slavery at all; several of them simply praised Davis's beneficent care of his human property and their unfailing loyalty to him. Most of the exhibits ignored the war's root causes in slavery.\n\nIn his illuminating look into the Southern mind, Baptized in Blood , historian Charles Reagan Wilson describes the South's Lost Cause narrative as \"a mythic construct that helped white Southerners define a cultural identity in the aftermath of Confederate defeat.\" The civil religion of the Lost Cause is on full display at a place like the Jefferson Davis Museum, recasting Confederate history as heroic and virtuous.\n\nAnd the Lost Cause isn't just a Southern myth; it's a national one. This is why you see Confederate flags in Maine . It's why the current president can say \"they are trying to take away our history and our heritage\" at a rally in Phoenix, Arizona, and still get wild applause. It's why the domestic terrorist who rammed his car into counterprotesters in Charlottesville was born and raised far away from the South, in Ohio . It's why cities from Birmingham to Brooklyn are grappling with what to do about their Confederate monuments.\n\nBryan Stevenson, founder of the Equal Justice Initiative, put it well : \"The North won the Civil War, but the South won the narrative war.\"\n\nThe promise of the Deep South, though, is that if racial progress can happen here, then it can happen anywhere.\n\nMoving to the delta put me in touch with the legacy of liberation that my ancestors left me.

Living here has emboldened me like nowhere else I've been before.\n\nby Jemar Tisby\n\nI almost swerved off the road the first time I saw cotton in full bloom.\n\nI had seen the dull green cotton plants crawling toward the sky through the summer months. Then, practically overnight, the cotton bolls exploded to reveal their fluffy prize. Nothing moves fast in the South - except when it does.\n\nMy wife's grandmother spent some of her childhood days picking cotton. She described to me how the plant grudgingly yielded its prize, how the spiny shell would scrape open her fingers.\n\nCotton farming is all automated now. Huge machines comb the plants for their fibrous cotton centers. The cotton gets smashed into huge rectangular bales that are loaded onto flatbed trucks and shipped off for processing. But when those fields are blooming, you can't help but picture slaves dressed in rags, hunched over in the oppressive heat, their hands scarred from years of labor.\n\nThe first question I get when I tell people I live in the Mississippi Delta is, \"Why?\"\n\nThis is what strikes me most about the Deep South - the immediacy of the past. Nothing stands between you and the stories you hear about slavery, Jim Crow, and the civil rights movement. This history is in the ground you walk on and the people you live among.\n\nThe delta is a place historian James C. Cobb called \"the most Southern place on earth.\" For most people it's a region that brings up pictures of slavery, lynching, and poverty. So why would I, a black man from the Midwest, volunteer to move to the cradle of American racism?\n\nMy journey in the South started as a middle school teacher. I joined the Teach for America program and signed up for a two-year stint in a new public charter school on the Arkansas side of the Mississippi River.\n\nAt first, I hated it. This tiny rural town felt like an island. Even more remote than an island, it seemed detached from both space and time. I couldn't even describe to friends and family back home - \"It's real down here\" is the best I could come up with.\n\nSome of the differences from places I'd lived before were trivial. Store hours were rarely followed. You still can't buy alcohol on Sundays. Camouflage is always appropriate attire, whether you're going to the dentist or even church. And be careful driving at night - you don't want to be stranded on a country road in the delta with no towns or streetlights for miles.\n\nBut there was the darker stuff. On my daily commute, I would pass a truck weigh station that flew the state flag. Mississippi is the last state in the country to retain the \"Southern cross\" on its flag; it defiantly sits in the upper left corner of the banner. At this truck station, the flag hangs just below the American flag, the two symbols inseparable from each other.\n\nEven the cemeteries are segregated. In our town, the Confederate cemetery, which now sits in the corner of a larger cemetery, was meant only for white people. A completely separate plot of land in another part of town, unkempt and underfunded by comparison, was reserved for deceased black people. The cemeteries still operate, and although segregation is no longer enforced, the racist history is literally etched in stone.\n\nMost of the black folks I talk to outside of this region can't fathom ever living here. I try to tell them that they can't truly understand the nation or themselves unless they at least make a pilgrimage to the Deep South.\n\nFor black people, the South is our homeland away from home.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nby David Kopel\n\nDo people have a right to defend themselves against a tyrannical government? And does the Second Amendment reinforce that right? Donald Trump appeared to be referring to such a right recently, in his muddled comments about \"Second Amendment people.\" But trying to discern the thinking behind Trump's thoughtless blather is pointless. Instead, it's better to consider the guidance of the Constitution and the founders.\n\nAccording to the Declaration of Independence, the only legitimate governments are those with the consent of the governed. When a government becomes the enemy and not the defender of human rights, the people can withdraw their consent and set up a new government.\n\n\"Prudence dictates\" against changing long-established governments, or withdrawing consent for \"light and transient causes,\" said the declaration. But by 1776, \"the long train of usurpations and abuses\" by King George's government had demonstrated \"a design to reduce\" the colonists \"under absolute Despotism.\" The declaration pointed out that the Americans had repeatedly asked their \"British brethren\" to redress the problems, but the British \"have been deaf to the voice of Justice.\" Therefore, \"necessity\" required the Americans to separate from Great Britain, as a last resort.\n\nJefferson later explained that among the sources of the declaration were \"the elementary books of public right,\" such as the works of Cicero , Locke , and Sidney . Those theorists had agreed that government without consent is the same as robbery; in both cases, forcible self-defense was legitimate.\n\nBut once the Americans had won their independence, how could the declaration's legal principles be applied if an American government became as abusive and obstinate as King George had been?\n\nWhen the proposed Constitution was before the people for ratification, many anti-Federalists worried that the new government would be too powerful, and could become tyrannical. In Federalist No. 46 , James Madison reassured the public that the many checks and balances in the Constitution - the separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, for example - made it very unlikely that a tyrant could seize power. If a tyrant did, he would speedily be deposed by the state governments, who would lead the armed people in the militias.\n\nPerhaps, as Madison predicted, all the other checks and balances will always prevent tyranny. But should tyranny ever triumph, the US Constitution provides a mechanism to restore constitutional order.\n\n\"Besides the advantage of being armed, which the Americans possess over the people of almost every other nation,\" Madison wrote, \"the existence of subordinate governments, to which the people are attached, and by which the militia officers are appointed, forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition, more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of.\" By \"simple,\" Madison meant a unitary government, such as France, as opposed to the US Constitution's system of dividing sovereignty between the federal government and the states.\n\nMadison was following a long tradition in Western Christian thought that the best leaders of resistance to tyranny were \"intermediate magistrates\" - such as local governments and their officials.\n\nThe founders rejected the notion that individuals or some group could use armed force just because they did not like a particular law. In fact, they believed quite the opposite: The Constitution specifically empowers Congress \"[t]o provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions.\" The power was first exercised during the presidencies of George Washington and John Adams, when the federal government called forth state militias to suppress insurrections known as the Whiskey Rebellion (in western Pennsylvania) and Fries's Rebellion (in eastern Pennsylvania). Both insurrections had grown out of anti-tax protests, in which mobs crossed the line by using armed force.\n\nIn contrast, the American Revolution perfectly fit with the principle of intermediate magistrates: Independence was declared by delegates representing the state governments.\n\nThe Second Amendment does not create a right of revolution against tyranny. That inherent right is universal. As stated in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights , adopted by the United Nations in 1948, \"[I]t is essential, if man is not to be compelled to have recourse, as a last resort, to rebellion against tyranny and oppression, that human rights should be protected by the rule of law.\" The Universal Declaration was influenced by the Declaration of Independence, thanks in part to the US delegation led by Ambassador Eleanor Roosevelt (who carried her own handgun for protection).\n\nThe Second Amendment does, however, reinforce the rule of law and anti-tyranny structure of the US Constitution, by ensuring the government cannot disarm the people. In the 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller , all nine Justices agreed that the amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms for service in the militia. (The justices disagreed about whether the right includes other purposes, such as personal self-defense or hunting.) Why did the founding generation believe that a well-regulated militia was necessary? One reason, observed Justice Antonin Scalia: \"when the able-bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized, they are better able to resist tyranny.\"\n\nExplaining the proposed Second Amendment, Madison's ally Tench Coxe , a delegate to the Continental Congress for Pennsylvania, wrote: \"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow-citizens, the people are confirmed by the next article in their right to keep and bear their private arms.\" Madison thanked Coxe for the newspaper essay .\n\nDemocratic Vice President and Minnesota Sen. Hubert Humphrey, the congressional leader of the civil rights movement, expressed a similar sentiment nearly two centuries later. For three decades after World War II, he was the embodiment of a liberal Democrat. In 1960, Humphrey wrote : \"Certainly one of the chief guarantees of freedom under any government, no matter how popular and respected, is the right of citizens to keep and bear arms. This is not to say that firearms should not be very carefully used and that definite safety rules of precaution should not be taught and enforced. But the right of citizens to bear arms is just one more guarantee against arbitrary government, one more safeguard against a tyranny which now appears remote in America, but which historically has proved to be always possible.\"\n\nAs Humphrey recognized, there was local tyranny in the Jim Crow system of the South. In the mid-1960s, the Ku Klux Klan was so powerful in southwestern Mississippi and southeastern Louisiana that they called the region \"Klan nation.\" The Klan's organized terrorism had the tacit acquiescence of local law enforcement.\n\nIn the summer of 1965 about 20 black army veterans in Jonesboro, Louisiana, founded an armed community defense patrol, \"Deacons for Defense and Justice.\" Inspired by visible public presence of boldly armed men, black attitudes in Jonesboro began to change. Black housekeepers stopped accepting racial taunts, and quit if the taunts continued. \"Armed Negroes Make Jonesboro Unusual Town,\" was the headline of a New York Times article on Jonesboro, on February 21, 1965. The Deacons model spread to other Klan heartlands, and was able to overturn Klan power with scarcely a shot fired.\n\nIn June 1966, after the attempted murder of civil rights leader James Meredith, major civil rights organizations banded together to continue the \"Meredith March against Fear,\" from Memphis, Tennessee, to Jackson, Mississippi. With Martin Luther King's consent, armed security was provided the entire way by the Deacons for Defense. As the Deacons example demonstrates, resistance to tyranny does not have to rise to the level of state militias attempting to oust a national dictator. Sometimes, the simple, lawful of carrying firearms for defense of self and others may be all that is needed to safeguard the exercise of other rights, such as free speech.\n\nBut hotheads who try to make political statements by armed displays often do not help their cause. Such was the case of the American Indian Movement's takeover of the Wounded Knee, South Dakota, reservation in 1973, or the 2016 takeover of an unoccupied building at a federal wildlife reserve in eastern Oregon. Arms should be a last resort, not a publicity tactic.\n\nToday's world is different from 1791. The genocides of the last century show that a criminal government is even more dangerous than the founders thought. The US military - along with the federal government - has grown more powerful than the founders could have imagined. Yet global military history since 1791 repeatedly demonstrates that mighty armies can be defeated by citizens fighting for the consent of the governed. One thing hasn't changed since the days of the Roman lawyer Cicero: Free republics are sometimes taken over by tyrannical demagogues.\n\nDuring American history, some members of the party out of power have worried about impending tyranny. Happily, this has never come to pass.\n\nToday, some people worry that Donald Trump resembles Hugo Chavez and other fascists. Other people, such as National Review's Jonah Goldberg in his book Liberal Fascism , describe the similarity of Woodrow Wilson's nationalist and quasi-socialist programs to those of Mussolini. Goldberg argues that Hillary Clinton would amplify a century-long slide of the American left towards a mild, Americanized version of fascism. The rhetoric and records of Trump and Clinton are not exactly scrupulous about respect for the Constitution, or any other law.\n\nPerhaps, as Madison predicted, all the other checks and balances will always prevent tyranny. But should tyranny ever triumph, the US Constitution provides a mechanism to restore constitutional order. In the vision of Madison, it would be states leading their militias, the militias consisting of the able-bodied male population.\n\nIn a modern sense, the organized portion of the state militia is the State National Guard, and the unorganized portion of the militia is able-bodied males. So we might think of today's mechanism as governors, hopefully with legislative backing, calling forth whatever parts of their state militias were considered appropriate under the circumstances. As in Madison's day, militiamen by themselves can rarely defeat a professional army in direct battle. But in modern times as in Madison's day, neither can a professional army always succeed in imposing a dictator's will throughout a vast and well-armed country.\n\nLike the one in Federalist No. 46, this is an \"in extremis,\" largely theoretical, argument. The American system has thus far proved strong enough to check the worst characters, such as Richard Nixon. The threat of impeachment, and not revolution, sufficed to end his assault on the rule of law - and that threat, along with the other checks and balances, has always sufficed to prevent dictatorship.\n\nDavid Kopel is research director, Independence Institute, Denver; associate policy analyst, Cato Institute, Washington, DC; adjunct professor, Denver University, Sturm College of Law; and author of the forthcoming book The Morality of Self-Defense and Military Action: The Judeo-Christian Tradition .

In Federalist No. 46 , James Madison reassured the public that the many checks and balances in the Constitution - the separation of powers between the executive, legislative, and judicial branches, for example - made it very unlikely that a tyrant could seize power. If a tyrant did, he would speedily be deposed by the state governments, who would lead the armed people in the militias.\n\nPerhaps, as Madison predicted, all the other checks and balances will always prevent tyranny.

In fact, they believed quite the opposite: The Constitution specifically empowers Congress \"[t]o provide for calling forth the Militia to execute the Laws of the Union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions.\" The power was first exercised during the presidencies of George Washington and John Adams, when the federal government called forth state militias to suppress insurrections known as the Whiskey Rebellion (in western Pennsylvania) and Fries's Rebellion (in eastern Pennsylvania). Both insurrections had grown out of anti-tax protests, in which mobs crossed the line by using armed force.\n\nIn contrast, the American Revolution perfectly fit with the principle of intermediate magistrates: Independence was declared by delegates representing the state governments.\n\nThe Second Amendment does not create a right of revolution against tyranny.

In the 2008 case District of Columbia v. Heller , all nine Justices agreed that the amendment protects an individual right to keep and bear arms for service in the militia. (The justices disagreed about whether the right includes other purposes, such as personal self-defense or hunting.) Why did the founding generation believe that a well-regulated militia was necessary? One reason, observed Justice Antonin Scalia: \"when the able-bodied men of a nation are trained in arms and organized, they are better able to resist tyranny.\"\n\nExplaining the proposed Second Amendment, Madison's ally Tench Coxe , a delegate to the Continental Congress for Pennsylvania, wrote: \"As civil rulers, not having their duty to the people duly before them, may attempt to tyrannize, and as the military forces which must be occasionally raised to defend our country, might pervert their power to the injury of their fellow-citizens, the people are confirmed by the next article in their right to keep and bear their private arms.\" Madison thanked Coxe for the newspaper essay .\n\nDemocratic Vice President and Minnesota Sen. Hubert Humphrey, the congressional leader of the civil rights movement, expressed a similar sentiment nearly two centuries later.

This is not to say that firearms should not be very carefully used and that definite safety rules of precaution should not be taught and enforced.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nIt's unlikely anyone could stop him from using it, too.\n\nby Alex Ward\n\nPresident Donald Trump on Monday threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act - a centuries-old law that gives the president the authority to send the US military into US cities and towns to quash domestic unrest - if state governors don't take sufficient action to quell the ongoing protests and unrest happening in cities across the country.\n\n\"If a city or state refuses to take the actions that are necessary to defend the life and property of their residents, then I will deploy United States military and quickly solve the problem for them,\" Trump said in a short speech delivered from the White House Rose Garden.\n\nAs he spoke, loud booms could be sporadically heard in the background as law enforcement officers fired tear gas and rubber bullets at peaceful protesters who had gathered near the White House.\n\nFor the past three days, Trump has flirted with sending troops into cities around the country to put down the protests and unrest sparked by the death of George Floyd, a 46-year-old black man who was killed last week when a Minneapolis police officer used his knee to pin Floyd's neck to the ground for several minutes while he was handcuffed.\n\nOn Saturday, Trump tweeted, \"Liberal Governors and Mayors must get MUCH tougher or the Federal Government will step in and do what has to be done, and that includes using the unlimited power of our Military and many arrests.\"\n\nTwo days later, he tweeted that Republican Sen. Tom Cotton was \" 100% Correct \" for suggesting violent activists would cower before a US Army presence.\n\nAs of Monday, 23 states and the District of Columbia had mobilized thousands of National Guard members to support police officers and firefighters with trying to control the demonstrations and unrest.\n\nTrump , however, is unsatisfied with those efforts. In a private call with governors on Monday, he told them, \"If you don't dominate, you're wasting your time,\" adding that \"we have a wonderful military.\" Hours later, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany said the president would soon send \" federal assets \" around the nation, and mentioned the Insurrection Act as a possibility.\n\n\"The Insurrection Act, it's one of the tools available, whether the president decides to pursue that, that's his prerogative,\" she said .\n\nHowever, Trump did say US military police, many of whom have spent part of the past two decades in the Middle East, will deploy to Washington, DC. Importantly, they still don't have the authority to perform law enforcement duties.\n\nBut if Trump were to go through with invoking the Insurrection Act, experts say it would be one of the most dramatic law enforcement escalations in decades, certain to inflame tensions between the demonstrators and their government instead of lower them.\n\nAn active-duty US Air Force officer who flew warplanes in Afghanistan told me such a decision isn't wise. \"These protests aren't combat and shouldn't be viewed through the same prism,\" the officer said, speaking on the condition of anonymity to talk candidly about a sensitive issue. \"Expecting a military response is myopic on the part of the administration, tone-deaf in light of yet another intolerable and unacceptable killing, and a misuse of the military.\"\n\nBut Trump hasn't heeded that advice. Instead, he's leaning away from it.\n\nTrump absolutely can send American troops to any part of the United States to deal with the protests. He is the commander in chief, after all. But if he wants them to be able to search, seize assets, and arrest protesters and people who are looting, there are a few legalistic hoops he'll have to jump through first.\n\nYou might have heard of \"posse comitatus,\" a longstanding law that bars the US military in most cases from being used to enforce domestic law. However, there is actually a way for federal troops to perform law enforcement functions. Simply put, they have to get special, statutory authorization to allow them to do those duties.\n\nBy far the most important of those authorizations - and the one most likely to come into play in this situation - is the Insurrection Act .\n\n\"This is the legal key that unlocks the door to use federal military forces ... to quell civil unrest,\" Mark Nevitt , a military law expert at the US Naval Academy, wrote for the Just Security website last Friday.\n\nNevitt noted two main ways the Insurrection Act could be invoked for the protests. It's worth going through each in turn.\n\nA state's legislature or its governor could directly request US military support. This actually happened in 1992: California Gov. Pete Wilson sought assistance from President George H.W. Bush during the Los Angeles protests that erupted after a jury acquitted police officers charged with arresting and beating Rodney King. In response, Bush put California National Guard members under federal command and sent in soldiers and Marines already based in the state.\n\nIt's unclear if any governor would actually make such a request of Trump right now. Experts told me governors typically shy away from taking this step because of how controversial it is. Plus, they have National Guard members already under their command who, when authorized, can perform law enforcement functions.\n\nReports , however, indicate that active-duty troops stationed around the country are on high alert to deploy within 24 hours. \"We have our military ready, willing and able, if they ever want to call our military,\" Trump told reporters on Saturday. \"And we can have troops on the ground very quickly if they ever want our military.\"\n\nTrump could invoke the law to send troops even without a state legislature's or governor's consent - but there's a catch.\n\nTrump can only deploy troops within the US \"for certain purposes,\" Lindsay Cohn, a US military expert at the Naval War College, told me. \"Technically and legally, he can send them to protect federal property or enforce federal law.\"\n\nPast presidents used this authority to defend civil rights in the 1950s and '60s.\n\nIn 1957, then-Arkansas Gov. Orval Faubus refused to follow federal integration laws after the Supreme Court's Brown v. Board of Education ruling three years earlier. As a result, President Dwight Eisenhower sent soldiers from the 101st Airborne Division into Little Rock to escort nine black high school students into the all-white Central High School despite protests against them.\n\nFive years later, President John F. Kennedy sent Army soldiers into Oxford, Mississippi, after the state's governor tried to block a black student from attending the University of Mississippi in Oxford (often referred to as Ole Miss). This allowed the student, James Meredith, to register safely even though a mob tried to stop him.\n\nIn both the Eisenhower and Kennedy cases, the president used federal troops to enforce federal laws. That's important, Cohn told me, because the key is that those and other deployments by presidents were to suppress insurrections against US federal laws - not laws of the individual states.\n\nReading the provision in full helps drive this vital point home:\n\nWhenever the President considers that unlawful obstructions, combinations, or assemblages or rebellion against authority of United States makes it impracticable to enforce the law of the United States in any State or territory by judicial proceedings, the President may call into Federal service the militia of any State and use the Federal military to enforce the laws or suppress the rebellion.\n\nImportantly, to invoke the act, Trump must first - with the attorney general's help - issue a \" proclamation to disperse .\" Basically, he has to give the people working against federal law a bit of time to stop their actions. If they don't, the president is free to send in the US military.\n\nIf Trump were to do this, it would be guaranteed to anger a lot of people, and many would likely contend that Trump is behaving in an authoritarian manner, using the might of the US military to crack down on protesters. But while the impulse behind it may seem undemocratic, that doesn't necessarily mean it wouldn't be legal.\n\n\"It's not implausible to argue that these statutes could apply now,\" Steve Vladeck , a national security law expert at the University of Texas Austin, tweeted on Saturday. \"And it's hard to imagine courts second-guessing factual determinations by the President that circumstances warrant use of the military to restore order.\"\n\nIf Trump wants soldiers and Marines to go into American cities and start shooting, he'll be wildly disappointed.\n\nAs Nevitt explained, there are clear and severe restraints on active-duty troops using force while performing policing duties at home, even under the Insurrection Act:\n\n[F]orce is to be used only as a last resort, and the force used should be the minimum necessary. Further, deadly force is to be used only when all lesser means have failed or cannot be reasonably employed.\n\nOf course, the rules for the use of force do not limit the inherent right of self-defense of people. It also authorizes force-to include deadly force-to protect three specified assets: (1) assets vital to national security (such as nuclear command and control facilities); (2) inherently dangerous property (such as missiles, rockets, and explosives); and (3) national critical infrastructure (such as designated public utilities).\n\nTo be clear, that could apply in some instances, but obviously not in the majority of them. Which means that the US military will serve mainly as more manpower.\n\nThe move isn't without some risk for Trump, either. As Vladeck tweeted, is that sending in American troops puts the onus for ending the protests on Trump.\n\n\"If Trump invokes these statutes, he'd own all that follows,\" he wrote on Saturday.\n\nMayors and governors, then, wouldn't take the credit or the blame for whatever happened next - Trump would.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Miss. School Desegregation Suit Settled\n\nApril 23 -- Mississippi will spend an extra $500 million on its three historically black colleges to settle a desegregation lawsuit filed 26 years ago, according to a deal announced today between the state, the Justice Department and plaintiffs.\n\nIn 1975, the late Jake Ayers Sr. filed a federal lawsuit on behalf on his son Jake Jr., a student at Jackson State University, and other students at Mississippi's black, public four-year colleges. Ayers and other plaintiffs claimed black colleges did not receive the same funding as predominantly white colleges and that the black universities could only be made more enticing to students with increased state funding. The Justice Department later joined Ayers and the other plaintiffs in the lawsuit.\n\nThe lawsuit sought to improve the academic programs and facilities at Mississippi's three historically black colleges - Jackson State, Alcorn State, and Mississippi Valley State - by forcing the state to boost funding.\n\nToday's settlement calls for Mississippi to provide $246 million over 17 years for academic programs at the three black universities. Another $75 million will be spent on capital improvement projects over a five-year period, and $70 million in public endowments and $35 million in private endowments will be provided for the institutions over a 14-year span.\n\nIn addition, Mississippi will recognize Jackson State University as a comprehensive higher education institution and designate Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium in Jackson as the home of the JSU Tigers.\n\nSchool Integration's Long Fight in Mississippi\n\nMississippi's state-run colleges resisted integration until 1962 when, under court order, James Meredith was admitted into the previously all-white University of Mississippi. But the Justice Department found in 1969 that Mississippi had failed to integrate its higher-education system, and the federal Department of Health, Education, and Welfare ordered the state to develop an integration plan. When officials failed to produce one, the Justice Department began monitoring the state's efforts.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "NAACP calls for federal probe over locker room noose incident\n\n&#151; -- WIGGINS, Miss. -- The Mississippi chapter of the NAACP is calling for a federal investigation of a possible hate crime after an African-American football player at a southern Mississippi high school allegedly had a noose placed around his neck and yanked backward by a teammate.\n\nDerrick Johnson, president of the Mississippi chapter of the civil rights group, told ESPN the incident took place the afternoon of Oct. 13 at Stone County High School.\n\nThe alleged victim in the attack, a sophomore member of the football team, was not physically harmed but was \"terrified\" by the incident, Johnson said.\n\nJohn Feaster, the first-year head coach for the Stone Tomcats, told ESPN the incident happened inside the football locker room as players were getting ready for practice.\n\n\"I reported it to the administration and handled it as swiftly as I could,\" Feaster said.\n\n\"The individual that was responsible hasn't been with our team since the incident. I just want it understood, it could have been the biggest superstar and he would have been gone. I don't care who it is -- if you do something like that, you can't be part of our team,\" Feaster added.\n\nThe alleged victim's father, when reached Monday night by ESPN, declined to comment and said he and his family wish not to be identified.\n\n\"We're calling on federal investigators to view this as a racial hate crime. No child should be in fear of going to school. No child should be walking down the hall or in the locker room and be accosted with a noose around their neck. This is 2016, not 1916,\" Johnson said at a news conference in Wiggins on Monday.\n\nJohnson told ESPN that at least three students, all of them white, were involved in the incident but Feaster, the head coach, disputed those details.\n\n\"To my knowledge it was one individual. It was not a group,\" Feaster said.\n\nJohnson told ESPN the incident was first reported to the Stone County Sheriff's Department by the victim's mother, but that she was discouraged from filing a report.\n\nStone County Sheriff Mike Farmer had not responded to a request for comment from ESPN.\n\nJohnson called on school officials to expel anybody responsible for the incident and said \"these same individuals came to school earlier this year brandishing Confederate flags on their vehicles.\"\n\nJohnson said the parents of the sophomore who was attacked have not been informed of any punishment for the students involved.\n\nStone County High School Principal Adam Stone referred comment to Superintendent Inita Owen. She and school board attorney Sean Courtney didn't immediately respond to phone calls and emails seeking comment.\n\n\"Allowing students to commit blatant hate crimes without severe consequences sends a message to students that their safety and well-being are not valuable enough to be protected,\" the NAACP said in a statement Monday.\n\nMississippi has struggled with a history of racial division. It is the last state that still incorporates the Confederate battle emblem on its state flag. In 2014, two out-of-state students at the University of Mississippi placed a noose on the campus' statue of James Meredith, the black student who integrated Ole Miss in 1962. Both pleaded guilty to using a threat of force to intimidate African-American students and employees. Neither attends the school anymore.\n\nThe names and ages of the students involved in the Stone County incident weren't immediately released.\n\nThe African-America student targeted in the attack has returned to school and football practice, according to Feaster.\n\n\"It's tough. I feel bad for the kid it happened to. That's where my major concern is,\" Feaster said.\n\nWhen asked about frustrations within the African-American community in the predominantly white Stone County, Feaster responded: \"Trust me. I understand. I'm an African-American male and I was born and raised in Mississippi. It's sad that something like this happens in 2016. I just pray we can get it together.\"\n\nInformation from The Associated Press was used in this report.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

      "text": "Doar to receive Medal of Freedom for civil rights work\n\nWASHINGTON -- What John Doar remembers most about the tumultuous civil rights movement 50 years ago is the courage of black college students who registered blacks to vote in the Deep South.\n\n\"They took enormous risks,\" recalled Doar, then a Justice Department official. \"For a black student to work in southwest Mississippi for example - or in the Delta in 1960, 1961, 1962 - was high-risk work.''\n\nCivil rights activists say Doar deserves plenty of credit himself for aiding the registration effort in Alabama, Louisiana and Mississippi.\n\nOn Tuesday, President Obama will award the 90-year-old Doar the Medal of Freedom. The medal is the nation's highest civilian honor and is awarded for \"especially meritorious contributions.''\n\nDoar called the award \"totally unexpected and undeserved.\"\n\nBut those who worked with him on the front lines of the civil rights movement say otherwise.\n\n\"No one I know of deserves to be honored more than John Doar,\" said Democratic Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, who received the medal himself in 2010 for his civil rights work. \"This one man, one former government official, did so much to help bring us to where we are today. It's an honor that's long overdue\"\n\nDoar served as assistant attorney general in the Justice Department's Civil Rights Division in the 1960s. He led the 1967 prosecution of Mississippi Ku Klux Klan members for the murder of civil rights workers Andrew Goodman, James Chaney and Michael Schwerner.\n\nDoar also successfully prosecuted Collie Leroy Wilkins for the murder of civil rights worker Vida Liuzzo in Alabama.\n\nIn 1962, Doar escorted James Meredith to the University of Mississippi, where Meredith was the first black student.\n\nDoar also played a key role in crafting civil rights legislation.\n\n\"He was not a bureaucrat,'' said Dorie Ladner, who helped register voters in Mississippi in the 1960s. \"But he was one who took it a step further, who was personally involved.''\n\nDoar recently returned from Mississippi, where he and Ladner spoke at a civil rights conference at Tougaloo College in Jackson. He has visited Mississippi only a few times since 1968.\n\n\"The world has changed,\" said Doar, now a partner with the Doar Rieck Kaley & Mack law firm in New York City. \"I'm not saying to you that every element of segregation and discrimination and second-class citizenship has changed. But in the political sense, the world has changed. People now who want to vote can vote.\"\n\nIn the 1960s, he said, blacks in many Mississippi counties couldn't vote. But \"if you were white and you breathed, you voted,\" he said.\n\nWith Doar's help, the Civil Rights Division filed a friend-of-the-court brief in the first lawsuit filed by a citizen - Lawrence Guyot, a native of Pass Christian, Miss. - under Section 5 of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The provision requires states with a history of voting discrimination to get approval from Justice officials or a federal court in Washington before making any changes, no matter how small, to their voting procedures.\n\n\"John Doar was key to making sure that the Department of Justice followed the highest standard on voting rights protections,\" Guyot said.\n\nLewis first met Doar in 1961 when Lewis and 20 other Freedom Riders were beaten at a bus station in Montgomery, Ala. Doar urged the riders not to talk to local police and to blend in with the choir at a mass meeting held at a nearby church.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"

Would he mobilize the power of the federal government to assure the safety of a Black child who simply wanted to go to school?\n\nAfter the events of the last few days, it's hard to believe that he would. When faced with the kind of hate that we had hoped was behind us as a country, Trump failed to condemn it with the force that we have come to expect from our presidents. That failure of moral leadership will live with us forever, just like that picture of Ruby Bridges.\n\n24/7 coverage of breaking news and live events"
