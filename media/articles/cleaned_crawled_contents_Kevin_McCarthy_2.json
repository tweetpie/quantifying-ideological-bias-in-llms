(AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Speaker Kevin McCarthy was voted out of the job Tuesday in an extraordinary showdown - a first in U.S. history, forced by a contingent of hard-right conservatives and throwing the House and its Republican leadership into chaos.\n\nIt's the end of the political line for McCarthy, who has said repeatedly that he never gives up, but found himself with almost no options remaining. Neither the right-flank Republicans who engineered his ouster nor the Democrats who piled on seem open to negotiating.\n\nMcCarthy told lawmakers in the evening he would not run again for speaker, putting the gavel up for grabs. Next steps are highly uncertain with no obvious successor to lead the House Republican majority. Action is halted in the House until next week, when Republicans try to elect a new speaker .\n\n\"I may have lost this vote today, but as I walk out of this chamber I feel fortunate to have served,\" McCarthy said at a press conference at the Capitol, alternating between upbeat assessment of his speakership and angry score-settling of those who ousted him.\n\nStill, he said, \"I wouldn't change a thing.\"\n\nMcCarthy's chief rival, Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, orchestrated the rare vote on the obscure \"motion to vacate,\" and pushed ahead swiftly into a dramatic afternoon roll call.\n\nWhile McCarthy enjoyed support from most Republicans in his slim majority, eight Republican detractors - many of the same hard-right holdouts who tried to stop him from becoming speaker in January - essentially forced him out.\n\nStillness fell as the presiding officer gaveled the vote closed, 216-210, saying the office of the speaker \"is hereby declared vacant.\"\n\nMoments later, a top McCarthy ally, Rep. Patrick McHenry, R-N.C ., took the gavel and, according to House rules, was named speaker pro tempore, to serve in the office until a new speaker is chosen.\n\nThe House then briskly recessed as lawmakers met privately to discuss the path forward.\n\nIt was a stunning moment for McCarthy, a punishment fueled by growing grievances but sparked by his weekend decision to work with Democrats to keep the federal government open rather than risk a shutdown.\n\nBut in many ways, McCarthy's ouster was set in motion when, in deal-making with hard-right holdouts at the start of the year, he agreed to a series of demands - including a rules change that allowed any single lawmaker to file the motion to vacate.\n\nAs the House fell silent, Gaetz, a top ally of Donald Trump , rose to offer his motion.\n\nLeaders tried to turn it back, but the vote was 218-208, with 11 Republicans against tabling the motion, a sign of trouble to come.\n\nThe House then opened a floor debate unseen in modern times, and Republicans argued publicly among themselves for more than an hour.\n\n\"It's a sad day,\" Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma said as debate got underway, urging his colleagues not to plunge the House Republican majority \"into chaos.\"\n\nBut Gaetz shot back during the debate, \"Chaos is Speaker McCarthy.\"\n\nAs the fiery debate dragged on, many of the complaints against the speaker revolved around his truthfulness and his ability to keep the promises he has made.\n\nAlmost alone, Gaetz led his side of the floor debate, criticizing the debt deal McCarthy made with President Joe Biden and the vote to prevent a government shutdown, which conservatives opposed as they demanded steeper spending cuts.\n\nBut a long line of McCarthy supporters stood up for him, including Rep. Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, a leader of the conservative Freedom Caucus, who said, \"He has kept his word.\" Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., waved his cellphone, saying it was \"disgusting\" that hard-right colleagues were fundraising off the move in text messages seeking donations.\n\nMcCarthy, of California, insisted he would not cut a deal with Democrats to remain in power - not that he could have relied on their help even if he had asked.\n\nDemocratic leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a letter to colleagues that he wants to work with Republicans, but he was unwilling to provide the votes needed to save McCarthy.\n\n\"It is now the responsibility of the GOP members to end the House Republican Civil War,\" Jeffries said, announcing the Democratic leadership would vote for the motion to oust the speaker.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Biden \"hopes the House will quickly elect a Speaker.\" Once that happens, she said, \"he looks forward to working together with them.\"\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell issued a statement thanking McCarthy for \"what is often a thankless role.\n\nAt the Capitol, both Republicans and Democrats met privately ahead of the historic afternoon vote.\n\nBehind closed doors, McCarthy told fellow Republicans: Let's get on with it.\n\nMcCarthy invoked Republican Speaker Joseph Cannon, who more than 100 years ago confronted his critics head-on by calling their bluff and setting the vote himself on his ouster. Cannon survived that takedown attempt, which was the first time the House had actually voted to consider removing its speaker. A more recent threat against John Boehner in 2015 didn't make it to a vote but led him to early retirement.\n\nGaetz was in attendance, but he did not address the room.\n\nAcross the way in the Capitol, Democrats lined up for a long discussion and unified around one common point: McCarthy cannot be trusted, several lawmakers in the room said.\n\n\"I think it's safe to say there's not a lot of good will in that room for Kevin McCarthy,\" said Rep. Richard Neal, D-Mass.\n\n\"At the end of the day, the country needs a speaker that can be relied upon,\" said Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Calif. \"We don't trust him. Their members don't trust him. And you need a certain degree of trust to be the speaker.\"\n\nRemoving the speaker launches the House Republicans into chaos heading into a busy fall when Congress will need to fund the government again or risk a mid-November shutdown.\n\nTypically, top leaders would be next in line for the job, but Majority Leader Steve Scalise is battling cancer and Majority Whip Tom Emmer, like any potential candidate, may have trouble securing the vote. Another leading Republican, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, is also a Trump ally.\n\nOne of McHenry's first acts in the temporary position was to oust Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi from her honorary office at the Capitol while she was away in California to pay tribute to Sen. Dianne Feinstein.\n\n\"No matter who is going to be the speaker, the challenges still remain,\" Scalise said. \"But I think the opportunity is there to continue moving forward.\"\n\nAsked if he was physically up to the job, Scalise said, \"I feel great.\"\n\nIt took McCarthy himself 15 rounds in January over multiple days of voting before he secured the support from his colleagues to gain the gavel.\n\nTrump, the former president who is the Republican front-runner in the 2024 race to challenge Biden, complained about the chaos. \"Why is it that Republicans are always fighting among themselves,\" he asked on social media.\n\nAsked about McCarthy's ouster as he exited court in New York, where he is on trial for business fraud, Trump did not respond.\n\nOne key McCarthy ally, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., who is also close with Trump, took to social media urging support for \"our speaker.\"\n\nRepublicans left the chamber in a daze, totally uncertain about next steps. \"I honestly don't know,\" said Rep. Debbie Lesko, R-Ariz. \"This is a total disaster.\"\n\nMany had lined up to hug McCarthy, some to shake his hand.\n\nDemocrats, who have bristled at McCarthy's leadership - cajoling them one minute, walking away from deals the next - said they were just holding back, waiting for Republicans to figure out how to run the House.\n\nRep, Don Bacon, R-Neb., the leader of a centrist group, said the only option was to leave the eight hardliners behind and try to work across the aisle. \"We're going to stay with Kevin,\" he said. \"He told us earlier he'll never quit.\"\n\nBut McCarthy made it clear Tuesday night that he would not try to win back the job.\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kevin Freking, Stephen Groves, Mary Clare Jalonick and Will Weissert contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Scott Applewhite, File)\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) - Two months after his historic ouster as U.S. House speaker, Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy said Wednesday that he is resigning and will leave Congress by the end of the year.\n\nHis announcement capped a stunning end to a House career for the onetime deli counter owner from Bakersfield, California, who ascended through state and national politics to become second in line to the presidency, until a cluster of hard-right conservatives engineered his removal in October.\n\nMcCarthy is the only speaker in history to be voted out of the job.\n\n\"No matter the odds, or personal cost, we did the right thing,\" McCarthy wrote in The Wall Street Journal, announcing his decision. \"It is in this spirit that I have decided to depart the House at the end of this year to serve America in new ways.\"\n\nWord about McCarthy's future had been expected, days before the filing deadline to seek reelection to the House. But his decision ricocheted across Capitol Hill, where his departure will leave the already paper-thin House GOP majority even tighter, with just a few seats to spare.\n\nIt adds to a wave of retirements in both parties, as many members seek higher office or look to escape the partisan rancor that often paralyzes the chamber. Republicans have been split by infighting and the rare expulsion last week of indicted GOP Rep. George Santos of New York, dashing hopes for major accomplishments and leaving the majority straining to conduct the basic business of governing.\n\nAP Washington correspondent Sagar Meghani has more.\n\nIt's also the end of an era for a generation of House Republicans led by McCarthy and former Reps. Paul Ryan and Eric Cantor, the so-called \"Young Guns\" whose book of the same title outlined a new style of GOP governance. Ryan and Cantor are gone, and McCarthy will soon exit.\n\nMcCarthy had brought the Republicans into the majority but found it was much more difficult to lead the GOP's factions.\n\nHis toppling from the speaker's post was fueled by grievances from his party's hard-right flank, including over his decision to work with Democrats to keep the federal government open rather than risk a shutdown.\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson of Louisiana, a Republican who succeeded McCarthy as speaker, tweeted that McCarthy \"served faithfully and sacrificed substantially for the good of our country and our cause.\"\n\nSpeaking later with reporters, Johnson called McCarthy a \"long and trusted friend\" and said he was \"sad to see him go.\"\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., who led the effort to remove McCarthy, tweeted a one-word response after his announcement: \"McLeavin.\"\n\nHe later chastised McCarthy, whose departure will further narrow the GOP's fragile hold on power. \"I think he should have stuck around and helped us hold a strong majority,\" Gaetz told reporters. \"But he left.\"\n\nMcCarthy, 58, arrived in the House in January 2007 after a stint in the California Assembly, where he was minority leader. In Congress, he maneuvered through his party's hierarchy before being elected speaker in January.\n\nThe dayslong floor fight that preceded his elevation to the House's top job foreshadowed a stormy tenure, at a time when former President Donald Trump remained the de facto leader of the party and deep divisions within the GOP raised serious questions about the party's ability to govern.\n\nIt took a record 15 votes over four days for McCarthy to line up the support he needed to win the post he had long coveted, finally prevailing on a 216-212 vote with Democrats backing leader Hakeem Jeffries of New York and six Republican holdouts voting present. Not since the Civil War era has a speaker's vote dragged through so many rounds of counting.\n\nMcCarthy emerged from the fight weakened, especially considering Republicans held only a fragile margin in the chamber after a predicted \"red wave\" failed to materialize in the 2022 elections.\n\nIn the speaker's job, McCarthy's well-known savvy for fundraising and political glad-handing appeared ill-suited for corralling his party's hard-right members. Deals he cut to become speaker - including a rules change that allowed any single lawmaker to file a motion to remove him - left him vulnerable.\n\nWhen he became speaker, \"he faced new challenges that required a different skill set,\" said Claremont McKenna College political scientist Jack Pitney, a onetime domestic policy analyst for House Republicans. And \"the deals he made to become speaker made it almost impossible for him to succeed as speaker.\"\n\nMcCarthy, the son of a firefighter and a homemaker, has long depicted himself as a tireless battler. He is fond of quoting his father, who told him, \"It's not how you start, it's how you finish.\"\n\nMcCarthy is from a Republican-leaning area in Central California where oil derricks blanket hillsides and country music fans pack into Buck Owens' Crystal Palace hall. Far from the Southern California beaches and San Francisco's restaurants, farming and oil pumping shape the economy.\n\nIt wasn't immediately clear what would happen with the vacancy, which could have implications for Republican control. Only a handful of seats separates the two parties.\n\nIn California, Friday is the last day for candidates to file paperwork to enter the 2024 elections. If the vacancy occurs before the end of that period, Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom would be required to call a special election to fill McCarthy's seat.\n\nIf McCarthy steps down after that time, it would be up to the governor to decide whether to call a special election.\n\nMcCarthy has been credited with helping recruit a new, more diverse generation of GOP House members, including in his home state, where the delegation includes two South Korean immigrants, both women.\n\nRep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., was handpicked by McCarthy in 2020 to run for a House seat that had swung back and forth between Democrats and Republicans for several elections. McCarthy's instinct turned out to be right and Gimenez won that election over an incumbent Democrat.\n\n\"I surely will miss him, but I think the House will miss him more,\" Gimenez said.\n\nHe said McCarthy's departure could put House Republicans at a financial disadvantage in their efforts to keep the majority.\n\nMcCarthy exited with a reminder of his fundraising prowess. Just before Thanksgiving, he transferred $3 million of his political funds to vulnerable GOP members, state Republican parties and the House GOP campaign arm, spokesperson Drew Florio said in an email.\n\n\"Nobody could raise funds like Kevin McCarthy could,\" Gimenez said. \"To replace him at this point, at this short time for the next election, that's an impossible task for Speaker Johnson. If he comes even close, I will take my hat off to him.\"\n\n___\n\nFreking reported from Washington.

Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - The day before he was ousted, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was doing what he loved - stopping to greet tourists at the Capitol, gushing about the beauty of the place and its history at the center of American democracy.\n\nOn Wednesday, McCarthy's House was shuttered, his Republican majority in chaos and unable to legislate for the foreseeable future, with grave ramifications for the U.S. experiment in governing.\n\nWith no speaker of the House, a constitutional officer second in line to the presidency, the Congress cannot fully function - to pass laws, fund the government and otherwise serve as the branch of government closest to the people - during a time of simmering uncertainty at home and abroad.\n\n\"A democracy relies on its legislative branch - it's the most important branch of any democratic government,\" said Matthew Green, an expert on Congress at Catholic University.\n\n\"Without a speaker, you have real risk.\"\n\nFor McCarthy, it's the end of the arc of his political career, from running a sandwich counter in Bakersfield, California, to the pinnacle of power, only to have his downfall engineered by some of the hard-right Republican lawmakers he helped elect to Congress but ultimately could not tame.\n\nDemocrats compounded the pain, only too happy to help oust him, in a brutal display of partisan politics.\n\n\"He had made his bed,\" Rep. Abigail Spanberger, D-Va., said ahead of the vote.\n\nMcCarthy is no bystander to the turmoil that so often defined his tenure in Congress, and in fact he was an early architect of the new Republican Party that has almost fully replaced what once was.\n\nIn office for nearly 20 years, McCarthy played a pivotal role in the 2010 election that sent a new generation of \" tea party \" Republicans to take control of the House. He was the campaign chairman who recruited the dozens of conservative newcomers who swept to power.\n\nWith fundraising skills and a keen eye for unique candidates, McCarthy was the party's winning strategist, adding to Republican ranks even when it meant electing hard-right figures.\n\nPart of the trio of \"Young Guns\" with Majority Leader Eric Cantor and future Speaker Paul Ryan , McCarthy and his political operation were crucial for the party as he crisscrossed the country with an extensive base of connections to wealthy donors.\n\nThose years saw the stirrings of a party purge that continues to this day, leaving an open question of who, if anyone, can lead the House Republicans.\n\nThen-Speaker John Boehner tried but failed to corral the newly conservative flank - enduring a U.S. debt default crisis, a prolonged government shutdown and a fiscal cliff that put the country on edge - before he was ultimately chased to early retirement by the same threat that would befall McCarthy.\n\nBoehner's chief antagonist at the time was Mark Meadows , then a Republican congressman who led the Freedom Caucus and would go on to become President Donald Trump's chief of staff. Meadows filed a \"motion to vacate\" - at the time an unheard-of procedural move resurrected from political obscurity.\n\nRather than risk the continued threat of an ouster, Boehner simply mic-dropped and left.\n\nA California Republican, McCarthy was never considered much of an ideologue. Rather, he positioned himself as a Reagan Republican, part of a generation that came of age during Ronald Reagan's presidency captivated by a more sunny-side telling of the American experience.\n\nThat lack of a firm ideological footing in far-right politics cost McCarthy the speaker's gavel when he first reached for it, after Boehner's ouster in 2015, as fellow Republican lawmakers viewed him as insufficiently conservative at best. Others viewed him as operating without a political compass.\n\nHe abandoned the speaker's race to Ryan, who was chased from the office a few short years later as he came up against the right flank during the Trump era.\n\n\"All three of them were chased out,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday.\n\n\"Speaker Boehner, Speaker Ryan and now Speaker McCarthy have all learned the same lesson: You cannot allow the hard right to run the House, or the country.\"\n\nAs Republicans fell into minority status with Speaker Nancy Pelosi in charge, McCarthy went on to recruit the class of 2022 Republicans to retake House control - in line for the speaker's gavel in another history-making moment.\n\nBut it took a brawling 15-vote slugfest over the first week of the new Congress in January for McCarthy to win the votes from his own reluctant Republican Party to become speaker, a prelude of his ouster to come.\n\nWith just a slim majority hold, a handful of hard-right holdouts forced him to make concessions for the gavel, including the ability to more easily remove him from office.\n\nStill, finally becoming speaker after so long seemed to have changed McCarthy, and he quickly grew into the role. His mantra: \"I never quit.\"\n\nHis suits appeared sharper, his sunny demeanor more pronounced, the flashes of anger subdued as he ambled through the halls.\n\nIn his element, McCarthy would open the House chamber, making a point to stop and chat with visitors along the way - at times even setting up a photo line for those who swarmed to snap pictures.\n\nUnderestimated from the start, he surprisingly delivered at two crucial moments, reaching a debt deal with President Joe Biden to avoid default and preventing a government shutdown last weekend at grave risk to his job.\n\nMcCarthy had become the magnanimous \"Man in the Arena,\" as he liked to think of himself - the portrait of Teddy Roosevelt hanging in his suite of speaker's offices at the Capitol.\n\n\"I give as good as I get,\" he quipped the night he was ousted.\n\nBut like the others before him, McCarthy was no match for the increasingly hard-right flank that has come to dominate the Republican Party.\n\nA handful of hardliners led by Rep. Matt Gaetz , R-Fla., blocked McCarthy in January from becoming House speaker, and many of them cast the votes Tuesday on the \"motion to vacate\" to remove the speaker - with the government shutdown deal the latest complaint against him.\n\nOthers, including Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., who had been beneficiaries of McCarthy's campaign funding, also turned on him in the end.\n\nSenate Republican leader Mitch McConnell said he had just one piece of advice to the next House speaker: Get rid of the motion to vacate.\n\n\"It makes the speaker's job impossible,\" he said. \"The American people expect us to have a functioning government.\"\n\nMcCarthy bitterly unleashed on his foes and intimated he would use his vast campaign sums in the future to wage primary candidates against them as he tries to steer the Republican Party back to some earlier vision of itself.\n\n\"They're not conservative,\" McCarthy railed in a rambling press conference on his way out. Evoking Reagan, he said of his foes: \"They don't get to say they're conservative because they're angry and they're chaotic. That's not the party I belong to.\"\n\nMcCarthy had taken great pride in reopening the House this year after pandemic closures and the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol - the people's House, he would say.\n\nBut after nine months on the job, one of the shortest speakerships in history, the leader who said he would never quit did just that, announcing he would not try to regain the gavel as the House closed up.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Lawmakers who had been sitting in stunned silence gasped at the declaration: The office of speaker \"is hereby declared vacant.\"\n\nFor the first time ever, a House speaker had been voted out of the position, plunging Congress into a new degree of turmoil . \"Now what?\" someone in the chamber yelled out.\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy , the California Republican who has survived decades of upheaval in Congress, had projected a sense of cool as he strolled out of his office just hours earlier, still speaker. But when he exited the House chamber, no longer with the gavel, he walked in silence.\n\nHe left a House roiling. Lawmakers fled the chamber after the vote, some speechless at what they had witnessed. An essential body of American democracy no longer has an elected leader, the latest moment of testing for an institution grappling with aftermath of the Capitol siege on Jan. 6th, 2021 , a Republican Party in upheaval and the United States' contested role in global leadership.\n\nWhere the House goes from here, no one can say.\n\nTempers are red hot in Washington and across-the-political-aisle relationships - endangered but crucial in times of crisis - have all but collapsed.\n\nThe House faces pressing questions of how to avert a government shutdown , whether to continue to fund Ukraine's defense against the Russian invasion and whether to proceed with an impeachment inquiry - unprecedented in many respects - into President Joe Biden . Meanwhile, procedural weapons Congress once reserved for the most dire offenses - censure, expulsion, impeachment and now the motion to vacate the speaker's chair - have become common.\n\nMany Republicans were left in a state of total exasperation, having begged their colleagues not to follow through.\n\n\"If we vacate the chair, the government will shut down. Our credit rating will go down; interest rates will go up,\" Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, a Pennsylvania Republican known for working with Democrats, warned hours before the vote to oust McCarthy. \"Ukraine will be victimized and lose that war to Russia. That is what is at stake here. Not to mention the institutional erosion that will occur.\"\n\nMcCarthy, who had managed to hold his conference together for nine months by taking a defiant stance toward the rest of Washington, insisted on fighting to hold on to his speakership to the end. He told Republicans at a morning meeting that he wanted to get on with the motion to vacate vote and insisted he would not give Democrats any concessions to save his job.\n\nBring it on, was McCarthy's message.\n\nHe seemed to have a chance of surviving: Most Republicans rallied around McCarthy as they met in the Capitol's basement, giving him several rounds of applause.\n\nBut Democrats, at their own meeting in the Capitol's sub-levels, played through what they see as the black marks of McCarthy's record: how he had continued to support former President Donald Trump even after a mob of his supporters stormed the Capitol and how he had catered to his party's right wing during his nine months as speaker.\n\nIn the end, they united around Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and decided to wash their hands of what they cast as a Republican problem.\n\n\"Kevin McCarthy brought this madness upon himself,\" said Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland, citing how McCarthy had agreed to allow any one member to bring the motion to vacate as part of a deal with right-wing lawmakers to win the speaker's gavel in January.\n\n\"There seems to be a major political party now addicted to insurrection, rebellion, overthrow and not to governance.\"\n\nAs the House gathered for votes in the afternoon, Rep. Matt Gaetz , the bombastic Republican who initiated McCarthy's ouster, sat in the chamber's front row, ready to make his case. McCarthy stood just feet behind him, nodding and smiling to his fellow Republicans, but refusing to acknowledge Gaetz's presence.\n\nAfter it became clear from a first procedural vote that Democrats would not save him, McCarthy settled into his seat for the hourlong debate over his future. He glanced at his phone; he ran his hands over the wooden arms of his chair. But he declined to speak in his own defense, instead dispatching his closest allies to defend his record.\n\n\"Chaos is Speaker McCarthy,\" Gaetz said on the floor, suggesting a series of reforms could make Washington work better. But insults and personal slights - bottled up for months and years among Republicans - soon exploded onto the House floor.\n\nThe normally raucous chamber - filled with hundreds of lawmakers - grew somber and hushed as the roll call vote began. One by one, for nearly 45 minutes, lawmakers rose and stated their vote. Republicans hung their heads as eight of their colleagues and every Democrat voted to remove McCarthy. He was out.\n\nMcCarthy smiled as the House clerks tallied the vote. A few moments later, he was no longer speaker and one of his closest House allies, Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, became caretaker of the speaker's gavel.\n\n\"Shocking ... just the finality of it,\" said Rep. Michael McCaul, a Texas Republican who chairs the House Foreign Relations Committee. \"We don't have a speaker, we don't have a leader and that's the message that's sending to our adversaries.\"\n\nRepublicans and Democrats dispersed, reeling and grasping for their next moves. Republicans will try to coalesce around a new leader after McCarthy ruled out another bid to become speaker. They face a leadership vacuum and deep divisions, with many Republicans seething at Gaetz and those who joined with him.\n\nMcCarthy, for his part, took a chance to settle political scores. At a quickly assembled news conference after nightfall, he began by citing Abraham Lincoln and Teddy Roosevelt, but soon indulged himself with unflattering stories about his political rivals - both Republicans and Democrats - and suggested he would use his fundraising and political clout to target them.\n\nHe concluded the extended banter with reporters with a barbed farewell: \"I'm sure I won't miss you.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Mary Claire Jalonick, Farnoush Amiri, Lisa Mascaro and Kevin Freking contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Scott Applewhite)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - One year since Kevin McCarthy was booted from the House speaker's office after Congress voted in a bipartisan way to prevent a federal government shutdown, the new House Speaker Mike Johnson finds himself courting, but so far avoiding, a similar political fate.\n\nJohnson is leading the House this week to vote on legislation to fund the government and ensure no interruption in federal services, but he's similarly abandoning demands from his own hard-right Republican colleagues and relying on Democratic votes and House Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries to push the package to bipartisan approval.\n\nWhile Johnson appears to be in no imminent threat of being ousted - the way McCarthy lost his position in a historic vote last fall when eight hardline Republicans engineered a motion to vacate the speaker - the new leader's ability to hold on to the speaker's gavel for the long term is not at all certain .\n\n\"It's a tough job,\" said McCarthy, who is now retired from Congress and watching from the sidelines.\n\nThe government funding vote provides a notable capstone to what has been an extraordinary and tumultuous session of Congress with the House Republican majority that swept to power in January 2023, as lawmakers now prepare to face voters.\n\nThe outcome of November's election will determine the White House and control of Congress, and may very well decide Johnson's political future. Colleagues are weighing whether to keep Johnson or try someone else as their leader ahead of internal party voting expected later in November after the election.\n\n\"The vast majority support Speaker Johnson - it's a shame that we've got like 10 people that always hold this over his head,\" said Rep. Don Bacon of Nebraska, among the more centrist Republicans.\n\n\"He's a good man. He's got a great heart,\" Bacon said. \"I think he's learned a lot this year.\"\n\nOn the job for the past 11 months, Johnson had been an unlikely choice for the speaker's gavel. The Louisiana congressman was a relatively unknown low-rung party leader, first elected to office in 2016 alongside Donald Trump , when he emerged as Republicans' last-ditch consensus choice to replace McCarthy.\n\nRepublicans had fought behind closed doors over who should become their new speaker after they took the historic step of ousting McCarthy - passing over their Majority Leader Steve Scalise, their GOP Whip Tom Emmer and hard-right Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, among others - before Johnson stepped up and won support , with Trump's blessing.\n\nJohnson, a lawyer, had led one of Trump's main legal cases challenging President Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 election and could play a prominent role in the 2024 election amid potential legal challenges to the outcome.\n\nAs the new speaker, Johnson inherited a bitterly divided House GOP majority and worked quickly to pick up the pieces. He cleaned out the speaker's staff at the Capitol, moved in his own team - and closely aligned himself with Trump, throwing his support behind the indicted former president's bid to retake the White House.\n\nJohnson prioritized several House initiatives, from the Biden impeachment inquiry to the House impeachment of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, that aligned tightly with Trump's agenda.\n\nBut the annual spending fights over the federal budget always loomed over Johnson's term. With the Sept. 30 deadline signaling the end of the fiscal year, the House GOP's ultraconservative flank agitated for the speaker to push for spending cuts, even if it meant throwing the government into a shutdown.\n\nTrump urged the House Republicans to take a hardline approach.\n\n\"I wish he would take Trump's advice,\" said Rep. Ralph Norman, R-South Carolina, a member of the hard-right House Freedom Caucus, who said of Johnson: \"He's risk averse.\"\n\nBut with a very slim majority that leaves Johnson with just a few votes to spare on any issue, he needs almost unanimity from his own ranks to pass legislation over the objections of Democrats. He already survived one attempt from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene to boot him from office this year.\n\nAhead of Wednesday's expected vote on the spending plan, Johnson defended his decision, saying it would have been \"political malpractice\" to lead the government into a federal shutdown weeks before the election.\n\nJohnson said he had tried to run what he called \"the best play\" he could, which was attaching a bill called the SAVE Act, which would prevent immigrants who are in the U.S. without legal status from voting in the nationwide elections, even though that's already the law and experts say it rarely happens .\n\nBut that approach from the speaker failed, voted down by more than a dozen Republicans along with almost all Democrats. A similar dynamic played out on several other bills to fund the various agencies when lawmakers opposed the steep budget cuts or the specific policy provisions as too extreme.\n\n\"So we have to go with the next available thing,\" Johnson said at his weekly press conference Tuesday.\n\nJohnson described the temporary government funding bill, which will keep operations going until Dec. 20, as bare bones, with no add-ons - except for $231 million for the U.S. Service in the aftermath of the two assassination attempts on Trump this election season.\n\nHe insisted he and Trump are \"on the same page\" on the strategy and have spoken \"at great length\" about the situation. And Johnson vowed House would hold the line against extra spending next time, in December, when the next round of funding will be needed.\n\n\"There's no daylight between us,\" Johnson said of Trump.\n\nOne key difference between the situation McCarthy faced and this week's vote is that last year Congress was also considering funding to help Ukraine buy weapons as it battles the Russian invasion, something Trump and the hard-right flank did not support, and it was eventually dropped from the final bill .\n\nExtra war funding is not included in this week's temporary bill either, but Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is expected on Capitol Hill later this week as he presses Congress to ensure ongoing support.\n\n\"I actually think Kevin McCarthy would have done much better,\" said Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., an ultraconservative who opposes most of the spending bills.\n\nMassie said he thinks \"the only way Mike Johnson gets reelected speaker is he gets a lifeline from Trump, should Trump win the White House.\"\n\nAs for the eight House Republicans who dislodged McCarthy, they've had their own political journeys since then - one, Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, a former chairman of the Freedom Caucus, lost his primary bid for reelection.\n\nMcCarthy, meanwhile, is not necessarily eying any comeback, but fundraising for the House majority and showering Republicans in tight reelection contests with money to run their campaigns - and opposing those who crossed him.\n\n__\n\nAssociated Press writer Kevin Freking contributed to this story.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Scott Applewhite, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - Kevin McCarthy spent years raising mountains of Republican campaign cash, flying around the country to recruit top candidates in key districts and painstakingly building political relationships as he worked his way toward becoming speaker of the House.\n\nNow that he's been ousted from the post after less than nine months, some in the GOP are wondering if anyone can take his place as a fundraising dynamo and party builder.\n\nThe House isn't scheduled to vote on who could replace McCarthy until at least next week with all legislative work suspended as the chamber navigates a situation never before seen in the nation's history. In the meantime, House Republicans have no clear leader heading into next year's election as they cling to a razor-thin majority .\n\n\"Nobody can raise money like him,\" said Rep. Kelly Armstrong, R-N.D. \"And no matter who is the next speaker of the House, none of them can do what Kevin McCarthy did.\"\n\nThe National Republican Congressional Committee, the GOP's House campaign arm, postponed its upcoming fall gala in Dallas that McCarthy was supposed to headline. The committee said McCarthy helped it raise more than $40 million during the last election cycle and $20-plus million so far this cycle.\n\nThe totals were even higher for a McCarthy-aligned super PAC, the Congressional Leadership Fund, which said that it and its associated nonprofits had raised about $645 million under McCarthy. That included about $215 million for the 2020 election, roughly $350 million during last year's midterm races and around $80 million so far this cycle.\n\nFILE - Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., speaks to reporters hours after he was ousted as Speaker of the House, Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2023, at the Capitol in Washington. (AP Photo/J. Scott Applewhite, File)\n\nThe leadership fund will shift its alignment to follow the new House speaker once one is elected. Paul Ryan replaced fellow Republican John Boehner in 2015. The GOP retained House control the following year when Donald Trump was elected president.\n\n\"Speaker McCarthy has fundamentally altered House elections for Republicans through his recruitment efforts, his unmatched fundraising prowess, and his ability to inspire and generate confidence among donors,\" Congressional Leadership Fund President Dan Conston said in a statement. \"While this is an obvious loss for the House, CLF remains laser-focused on our mission of holding radical Democrats accountable, protecting our vulnerable incumbents, and expanding the House Republican majority.\"\n\nAs speaker and in his prior years leading the Republicans in the minority, McCarthy was viewed by many as less of a legislator and more of a political tactician who found strong Republican candidates and raised enough money to get them elected and to bolster the national party.\n\nMcCarthy visiting a district could often be a major draw, juicing fundraiser proceeds, though that's a role any new House speaker can grow into.\n\nA bigger test for the next speaker is whether they will be able to raise the same kind of sums as McCarthy for the party's outside groups, which every year pour millions of dollars into advertising in key races, unburdened by contribution limits for individual campaigns.\n\n\"That's where McCarthy has crushed it,\" said Cam Savage, a longtime Republican strategist who works on House races. \"He did the heavy lifting for the Congressional Leadership Fund.\"\n\nDuring the 2022 midterms, Republicans underperformed national expectations and eked out a House majority so narrow that McCarthy needed an unprecedented 15 rounds of voting to claim the speakership in January. McCarthy had to remain close to Trump, who is now the front-runner in the party's 2024 primary, and balance the interests of moderates and hard-right members alike. He ultimately couldn't.\n\nThe revolt against him featured eight Republicans teaming with House Democrats to vote McCarthy out of the speakership. Ironically, McCarthy had campaigned for some of those who eventually helped strip him of the post he'd worked so long to obtain.\n\n\"A lot of them, I helped get elected, so I probably should have picked somebody else,\" McCarthy joked at a press conference after being forced out.\n\nHe may still prove a force in 2024 races. McCarthy has so far suggested that he'll continue to bolster the GOP nationally, saying, \"My goals have not changed, my ability to fight is just in a different form.\"\n\n\"I intend to make sure that we gain and keep the majority in the next cycle as well,\" he said.\n\nHolding the House already looked tough since the current majority includes 18 GOP members representing districts that Joe Biden won in 2020. Especially critical could be Republican-held districts in McCarthy's native California , which Democrats were already targeting and could get even more competitive without the clout that comes with the state having one of its own as speaker.\n\n\"After this week's chaotic episode, House Republicans have basically upgraded to a Disney fast-pass in their never-ending roller coaster ride to the radical right,\" said Viet Shelton, a spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the party's House campaign arm.\n\nHouse members in both parties said that what happens next will depend greatly on whether the former speaker endorses his eventual successor. That's because aligning the GOP's various fundraising mechanisms to the new speaker will likely go far smoother if McCarthy supports his replacement.\n\n\"It's going to be a challenge,\" said Marty Obst, who worked for Trump's 2020 campaign and has raised money with McCarthy in the past. \"The transition is going to be fairly bumpy.\"\n\nBut other Republicans aren't lamenting his departure. McCarthy noted during his valedictory press conference that he got a text message from a former opponent of one of the eight Republicans who voted against him, Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina.\n\n\"I did text him because he did dump $3 million into that run to defeat me,\" said Katie Arrington, who lost to Mace in a 2022 primary. \"He wasted money.\"\n\nArrington, who was backed by Trump in her challenge to Mace, questioned the notion of the speaker being the House majority's chief campaigner.\n\n\"Why is Kevin McCarthy running around recruiting people, giving them money, picking winners and losers out of Washington?\" Arrington asked. \"That is the problem with Washington - the elites think that they know better.\"\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press writers Kevin Freking in Washington and Meg Kinnard and James Pollard in Columbia, South Carolina, contributed to this report.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

Scott Applewhite, File)\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - House Speaker Mike Johnson's margin for error in getting Republican priorities through the House is getting slimmer, complicating future votes and magnifying the ability of individual lawmakers to force concessions.\n\nRepublicans had just a 222-213 margin before Rep. George Santos of New York was expelled in a broad, bipartisan vote a week ago. Then, Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California announced Thursday he would be retiring at the end of the month. He was the first speaker ever booted from the position, a victim of a process he had agreed to implement that allowed just a few defections from within the GOP ranks to oust him.\n\nThe margins before both representatives' exits allowed Republicans to lose up to four votes on a party-line ballot and still get a bill over the finish line, assuming every lawmaker was in attendance.\n\nNow that margin is down to three votes. It could even drop to two if Democrats flip the Santos seat in a special election set for Feb. 13, which would leave their majority at 220-214.\n\nRep. Bill Johnson, R-Ohio, is also expected to leave to begin a new job as president of Youngstown State University. It's unclear when he'll begin that job, but it's no later than March 15.\n\n\"It just makes everything harder. It's just that simple,\" said Rep. Tom Cole, R-Okla. \"You have to have perfect attendance, which is hard to get. And you have to have perfect agreement, which is damn hard to get.\"\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, the 11-term congressman from Oklahoma also noted that lawmakers during election years look to spend more time back in their congressional districts than in Washington, leaving the focus on the most basic functions of government - namely a spending bill to keep agencies and programs functioning.\n\n\"I just don't see much in the way of major legislative accomplishments next year with the margins this narrow and government this divided,\" he said.\n\nOthers see a rather muted impact. After all, the GOP's narrow margin for error has already proven difficult for the party's leaders to overcome.\n\nIt took McCarthy 15 votes to finally be elected speaker once the new Congress began in January. And that was only the beginning of his troubles.\n\nThe House's staunchest conservatives brought the chamber to a standstill after he made an agreement with the White House in May that did not cut spending as much as they wanted. And then, when the House ousted McCarthy in October, Republicans cycled through three potential replacements before finally landing on Johnson.\n\nHow much harder could it really get?\n\n\"Clearly, I'd rather move from four to six than from four to two,\" said Rep. Dusty Johnson, R-S.D., of the Republican voting cushion. \"But I wouldn't want to overstate the impact.\"\n\nTwo months after his historic ouster as U.S. House speaker, Republican Rep. Kevin McCarthy said Wednesday that he is resigning and will leave Congress by the end of the year. (Dec. 6)\n\nIt takes only one member of the House to make a motion to remove the speaker, or \"vacate the chair.\" Johnson has generated some grumbling from members, but they also seem more sympathetic to the difficulties he faces in getting House Republicans to unite on major legislation.\n\nRep. Garret Graves, R-La., one of McCarthy's most trusted advisers, said the last thing many members want is to go down the same road as they did with McCarthy.\n\n\"Is there risk, yes, because you still have the one-member motion to vacate,\" Graves said. \"Risk, yes. Likely, no.\"\n\nHe said, \"There's a lot of scar tissue within the conference.\" Members who put themselves up for the job of speaker were attacked by their colleagues. Others were offended by the total number of votes they ended up getting. There's not an appetite to repeat that process.\n\n\"The other reason that I don't think it's likely is because more people are coming to the realization that leading in this environment is really hard,\" Graves said.\n\nCopyright 2025 The Associated Press.

      "text": "GOP Pays the Price for Booting Kevin McCarthy\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nFormer Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) failed at many things: building unity in his conference, making deals across the aisle, and, obviously, fending off the revolt that made him a former speaker.\n\nIn one crucial area, however, McCarthy was a legendary success: raising money.\n\nThe longtime GOP politician spent more than a decade and a half building a political machine that hauled in millions from big donors. His critics used this fact as ammunition against him, portraying him as a swampy corporate hack who would sell his principles to anyone paying top dollar. But his money engine unquestionably helped power Republicans to the House majority in 2022.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhen Republicans booted McCarthy last year and elevated Mike Johnson to the speakership, some lawmakers believed they were getting a leader with more scruples. While the conference seems divided on that question , what's painfully clear already is that the GOP got a leader with far less skill in scaring up valuable campaign dough.\n\nAccording to federal campaign finance records, Johnson still has yet to match his predecessor's fundraising success, specifically when it comes to boosting the most vulnerable incumbent Republicans.\n\nMcCarthy outraised Johnson on behalf of at-risk Republicans several times over, according to a Daily Beast analysis of the two men's various campaign, joint fundraising, and leadership committees.\n\nThat discrepancy is most starkly reflected in the fundraising for members of the National Republican Congressional Committee's Patriot Program-incumbents the GOP has deemed most vulnerable, especially ones running in districts President Joe Biden won in 2020.\n\nWhere McCarthy distributed upwards of $400,000 to some of those members last year, Johnson has given many of them just a fraction of that.\n\nTake Rep. Juan Ciscomani (R-AZ), a freshman in a battleground district. Campaign finance data indicates he brought in roughly $459,000 from the various committees associated with McCarthy this cycle. Over the first three quarters of last year-the bulk of McCarthy's time as speaker-the California Republican directed an average $145,000 per quarter to Ciscomani.\n\nCompare that to the most recent two quarters under Johnson, whose average quarterly transfer to the Arizona Republican works out to just under $14,000.\n\nMeanwhile, Federal Election Commission data indicates Johnson has distributed just over $28,000 to Ciscomani this cycle-about $16,000 through his joint fundraising committee, Grow the Majority; $10,000 through his leadership committee, American Revival PAC; and $2,000 through his campaign account.\n\nIt's a similar story when it comes to Rep. Marc Molinaro (R-NY), another freshman in a battleground district. McCarthy steered an average of $193,000 over the first three quarters of last year. Johnson's quarterly fundraising average for Molinaro is about $28,000.\n\nThe clear downgrade in fundraising capacity from McCarthy to Johnson could have potentially catastrophic effects for the House GOP as it seeks to defend its razor-thin majority this year.\n\nThe Trump-dominated Republican Party is already contending with a financial and leadership crisis that has signaled potential fallout for vulnerable congressional candidates . Where those candidates could previously depend on significant support from McCarthy, the late-game switch to Johnson knocked yet another fundraising leg out from underneath them.\n\nOf course, Johnson-who was first elected in 2016 and had only a peripheral leadership role until last year-hasn't had years to nourish the profitable relationships his predecessor built and could improve drastically in the future. But with just six months to go before the election, House Republicans may struggle to hold their majority unless he catches up quickly.\n\nAs Republicans told The Daily Beast, the dollars provided by their speaker are incredibly valuable in an election year like 2024.\n\n\"When there is not a Republican president in office, the No. 1 political fundraising draw is the Speaker of the House,\" GOP strategist Ken Spain told the Daily Beast.\n\n\"McCarthy was a money machine,\" GOP donor Eric Levine told the Daily Beast. \"He just had a great talent for it.\"\n\nLevine observed that the acrimonious circumstances of Johnson's ascension may have made it even harder for him to build financial bridges.\n\n\"I think the other thing is people were really, really angry-I know I was-when the speaker was vacated and he was removed,\" Levine said. \"So donors were going to take it out naturally on whoever was next.\"\n\nJohnson's team defended the speaker's performance-and acknowledged the challenge at hand-in a statement to The Daily Beast.\n\n\"Since October, Speaker Johnson has built a team from the ground up, traveled to 25 states, and contributed millions directly to Republican campaign accounts across the country,\" wrote Johnson's campaign spokesman. \"His most recent quarter with over $20 million raised demonstrates the Speaker's success and commitment to growing the majority.\"\n\nLike other setbacks for the financially troubled GOP, former President Donald Trump has something to do with the House cash crunch.\n\nWhen McCarthy faced a revolt last October, Trump declined to intervene to save him, despite the obvious political consequences of losing the party's best fundraiser. While it's unclear how much the former president could have done to prevent his ouster, Trump has been far more proactive when it comes to Johnson, appearing alongside the speaker and praising his efforts even amid GOP backlash.\n\nThe parameters of replacing McCarthy were also tight; the party needed someone Trump-approved who had credibility among both conservatives and moderates. After three weeks of maneuvering and failed votes, the job finally fell to Johnson, a politician with little national experience or name recognition.\n\nThe fact that Republicans were forced to install a relatively low-level member of GOP leadership-and who, unlike McCarthy, had not built out a wide donor network as he moved up the ranks-could come back to bite them.\n\nIn addition to being a campaign cash rainmaker in general, McCarthy's impact was most pronounced in a state that could decide the House majority: his home state of California, which will see numerous competitive races this year.\n\nThe Golden State is something of a golden egg for campaign cash, and McCarthy had long used his connections to help raise money for other members of the delegation. Since he was removed as speaker, nearly all the vulnerable California Republicans in the House have seen a decline in their average quarterly contributions.\n\nSpain, who was an NRCC staffer when McCarthy arrived in Congress, recalled how the congressman leveraged his relationships in California from the very beginning.\n\n\"He was raising money for House Republicans on the first day,\" Spain said. \"He was the minority leader in the California Legislature right before he arrived. So he was an experienced fundraiser even before arriving in Congress.\"\n\nPreviously this cycle, McCarthy directed boatloads of cash to vulnerable California members, like Rep. Michelle Steel (R-CA), who represents a plurality Asian American district in Orange County. In the first three quarters of last year, Steel received an average of $147,000 from McCarthy each quarter; Johnson's quarterly average as speaker is only $17,000.\n\nBut Ciscomani, Molinaro, and Steel are lucky Johnson is helping them as much as he is. Though the speaker has dutifully doled out cash to the NRCC's Patriots, he has given only a token amount to other Republicans on the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's target list-as little as $1,000 each. McCarthy, meanwhile, had given these candidates much more; sometimes, over 100 times more.\n\nThere is at least one member who Johnson has boosted financially more than McCarthy. That's Rep. Maria Elvira Salazar (R-FL), who brought in $65,000 from Johnson and only $12,000 from McCarthy this cycle. That works out to a quarterly average of about $32,000 from Johnson while he served as speaker and about $4,000 from McCarthy while he did.\n\nJohnson appears to be working to make up some of his fundraising shortfalls, however. According to reporting from the Washington Post , Johnson recently took a victory lap in a call with billionaires who fund the GOP, touting the foreign aid bill passed last month and promising he'll hold on to his gavel. He's also touring the country to get face time with the megadonors who are just getting to know him.\n\n\"People like to donate money to winners,\" Levine told the Daily Beast. \"Now that he's demonstrated leadership, I think you'\"\"ll see a shift. I don't think he'll ever get to the level-maybe he will-but I don't think he'll ever get to the level of McCarthy. But there's no shame in that. McCarthy was just in a class of his own in terms of raising money. But I think you'll start seeing a significant uptick.\"\n\nMaking the task even more difficult is that Johnson is looking to ramp up fundraising while the threat of losing his job hangs over him. But unlike McCarthy, Johnson is expected to be able to count on support from Democrats to keep his job. Johnson also has credibility with his party's conservative wing, and support from Trump, who has recently stood by his side. Donors are starting to view him more optimistically, too.\n\n\"I think if he continues to govern and get things accomplished, I think that'll give a lot of people a lot of comfort,\" Levine added. \"I think if he comes out in support of mainstream Republicans and if he speaks out against the Marjorie Taylor Greenes, Matt Gaetzes, and Bob Goods of the world, I think he would do himself a lot of good. In the group that I move in ... there is unanimity that we hate these people, that we wish they would go away, and he would do himself a service, at least in my group, if he continues to stand up to them.\"\n\nAlong with distrust across the aisle, McCarthy's fundraising prowess was part of what ultimately did the former speaker in, with Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) leading the charge against him.\n\n\"He's the product of a corrupt system that rewards people who collect large sums of special interest money and then redistribute that money in exchange for political loyalty and political favors,\" Gaetz told reporters at the time .\n\nVulnerable Republicans did start the year with tons of campaign cash , thanks in part to coffers filled during the former speaker's tenure. For the majority of them, their cash on hand at the end of the first quarter exceeded that of their challengers. And Republicans are quick to note that Democrats have historically outraised them, but that they've often managed to pick up seats anyway.\n\n\"Our swing-district incumbents continue to stack the cash they'll need to beat their extreme Democrat challengers,\" NRCC National Press Secretary Will Reinert wrote in a statement to the Daily Beast.\n\nBut going forward, the concerns about fundraising that began bubbling up when McCarthy was deposed are looking more like premonitions.\n\n\"Nobody can raise money like him,\" Rep. Kelly Armstrong (R-ND) said of McCarthy days after he was ousted. \"And no matter who is the next Speaker of the House, none of them can do what Kevin McCarthy did.\"\n\nPolitics Reporter\n\nmini.racker@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Deposed Speaker Kevin McCarthy to Resign From Congress\n\nDeputy Politics Editor\n\nDeposed former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is calling it quits on his 15-year career in Congress.\n\nIn a Wall Street Journal op-ed posted on Wednesday, McCarthy announced that he would resign from office at the end of the year.\n\nThe move represents a punctuation mark on one of the more stunning political downfalls in recent history. It also ensures McCarthy's reliably Republican seat will be vacant until a special election is held to replace him, cutting into the House GOP's already razor thin majority.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBut the California Republican emphasized his intent to remain involved in politics. The title of his essay declared he was leaving Congress, \"but not the fight.\"\n\n\"I will continue to recruit our country's best and brightest to run for elected office,\" McCarthy wrote. \"The Republican Party is expanding every day, and I am committed to lending my experience to support the next generation of leaders.\"\n\nSince eight Republican lawmakers engineered his removal as House Speaker in October, McCarthy's future in the House of Representatives has been in doubt.\n\nAfter spending nine months as Speaker, and over a decade in House Republican leadership, McCarthy was not exactly well positioned to adjust to life as a rank and file lawmaker. His apparent inability to contain his anger at the colleagues who ousted him-best exemplified by his apparent shove of Rep. Tim Burchett last month-left many observers confident he was not long for Capitol Hill.\n\nAccording to The Washington Post , McCarthy even cursed out former President Donald Trump in a phone call following his removal from the speakership, angry Trump had not done enough to help him. One of McCarthy's most enduring legacies, of course, was his rehabilitation of Trump after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol.\n\nA powerful Washington player with deep connections in the world of political donors as well as corporate lobbying and influence, McCarthy is poised to make good on his promises to continue shaping the GOP. But he's also primed to earn a major payday as a power lobbyist himself.\n\nAlways projecting the persona of a happy warrior, McCarthy's op-ed sought to frame his exit from Congress as anything but humiliating.\n\n\"I never could have imagined the journey when I first threw my hat into the ring,\" he wrote. \"I go knowing I left it all on the field-as always, with a smile on my face.

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy's Temporary Success Now Sets Up His Final Failure Later\n\nAfter a week-long battle where conservatives brought the House floor to a standstill, Speaker Kevin McCarthy finally struck a deal with Freedom Caucus members on Tuesday to get the House moving again.\n\nBut the temporary win for McCarthy may ultimately come at a much bigger cost-like when House Republicans are forced to fold on a spending deal in the fall. And it may be McCarthy who's left holding the bag in the end.\n\nFor now, McCarthy is taking the resolution as a win. He struck a deal Tuesday where conservatives would stop voting against the procedural motions that bring bills to the floor in exchange for writing spending bills at budget levels from two years ago.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRepublicans now plan to put forth appropriations bills at those old spending caps-save for the Pentagon budget, which will still get increases even though the United States already spends exorbitantly on defense .\n\nBut the irony of this new hardline stance on spending-again, with the notable exception of defense dollars-is that it may make it harder for the House to get its way in the end. And if that's the case, it may set McCarthy up for his final act as speaker.\n\nIn the most straightforward explanation, it may be more evidence of conservatives putting their ideological purity over actual results. In the most Machiavellian account, McCarthy's failure-and his potential removal-may actually be the true intent.\n\nBrendan Buck, a GOP strategist who was formerly a top staffer for Speaker Paul Ryan and Speaker John Boehner, suggested that this deal may backfire on all parties involved. \"You don't have to have years and years of experience to look down the road and see how this ends,\" Buck told The Daily Beast.\n\nBuck said an omnibus-an all-encompassing spending deal in which Congress wraps all the appropriations bills into one take-it-or-leave-it measure-was now the most likely scenario. A government shutdown, he said, \"feels very possible,\" too. And while Buck gets that Republican leadership can argue they're not breaking the deal with Democrats, he said it was hard not to read between the lines.\n\n\"I understand the technical argument they're going to make, that it's setting a ceiling, not a floor or level. That may theoretically be true,\" Buck said. \"But I think everybody involved understands that this was setting spending levels.\"\n\nHe continued that the whole concept of the deal with President Joe Biden-where Republicans and Democrats agreed to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for writing appropriations bills at those newly agreed-upon levels-was a core element allowing everyone in Congress to \"jump past the budget resolution process and actually know how much we're spending.\"\n\n\"That was the deal,\" Buck said.\n\nTypically, in the wonky explanation of Congress, the House and Senate are supposed to adopt a budget resolution that sets topline spending numbers, and then appropriators write spending bills to those agreed-upon levels.\n\nBut in this Freedom Caucus-designed version, Republicans go back on the deal with Biden, act like the spending levels they set in the debt limit deal were just limits that Congress couldn't exceed but also didn't have to meet, and then magically get those spending bills passed by the Democratic Senate and signed by the Democratic president.\n\nIf those expectations seem unrealistic, it's because they are.\n\nBut that's exactly what Freedom Caucus members are insisting upon-and it's exactly what McCarthy has agreed to do. At least for now.\n\nAllies of GOP leadership allies weren't inclined to predict how this gambit would end. And conservatives certainly aren't spelling out how their plan is going to ultimately work-or who would pay the price for it not working. But nobody is denying that these new expectations are bound to complicate things.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett (R-TN), one of the conservative defectors who was holding up proceedings, said he doesn't think this new deal with McCarthy will lead to an omnibus. \"We've gotta get realistic about where we are and what we can do,\" he said.\n\nBurchett went on to describe the \"art of compromise,\" which he said is asking for a certain amount, saying what you got back isn't everything you wanted, \"and then you walk away snickering, because it's everything you wanted.\"\n\nPredictably, Burchett isn't sure what the Senate will do, or whether they'll get behind lowering the caps. (They almost certainly won't.) But Republicans like Burchett would very much like to believe they just reined in government spending, even though the most likely scenario is that the Senate just wins the spending standoff now.\n\nStill, Republicans are moving ahead at the moment with the assumption that their bankshot maneuver will actually work.\n\nRep. Blake Moore (R-UT), a moderate, said he was \"always going to be concerned\" about the prospects of passing the appropriations bills, expecting \"Democrats to just oppose it-just based on the topline number, not the actual content of the bill.\"\n\nBut he's good with the current approach and the efforts to cut wasteful spending, even if it tees up a clash with the Senate.\n\nShort of blowing up the filibuster , any spending deal in the Senate will require 60 votes, meaning at least nine Republicans would have to join all 51 Democrats in support. And Biden would still have to sign the legislation-an unlikely prospect if House Republicans went back on their deal claiming they technically were being true to the debt limit agreement.\n\nAnd yet, House conservatives seem to be brushing off the challenge, believing it's all just another opportunity to own the libs.\n\n\"What we should be doing in the House,\" Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) said, \"is driving as hard a bargain as we possibly can, because this town has spent too much money over too many years and they've become addicted to it.\"\n\nDonalds, a Freedom Caucus member and staunch supporter of Donald Trump, said he thought going below the spending caps set in the debt limit deal was a wise approach.\n\nAsked about the likelihood of passing an omnibus, McCarthy told reporters Monday that he has a longstanding position against putting an omnibus on the floor as speaker.\n\nAsked whether this new deal tees up a government shutdown, McCarthy completely dodged the question, instead saying that he prays for reporters, who he believes are not positive enough.\n\nIn that less positive, more skeptical world, the House could end up passing a continuing resolution-a stopgap measure that just continues government spending at current levels for a certain period of time. But that also would go against McCarthy's commitment to pass all 12 spending bills on time.\n\nThat would almost certainly be less of a betrayal to conservatives than an omnibus. And it may take a painful government shutdown-one in which Republicans were taking the majority of the blame-before McCarthy would put an omnibus spending deal on the floor.\n\nBut either way, conservatives are setting McCarthy up for failure, insisting that reneging on his deal with Biden not only won't come with consequences, but will also somehow lead to reduced government spending.\n\nIf, as it's almost inevitable, McCarthy falls short of those lofty expectations, he could be in for trouble. And regardless of how the speaker falls short, he'll be a weaker negotiator in the future-one who can't keep his word.\n\nDemocrats never wanted to negotiate a debt deal with McCarthy in the first place. A number of Senate Democrats said they'd specifically be concerned about McCarthy's ability to keep his word on a deal, given the control just a few members can exert over his speakership. Ultimately, Democrats negotiated.\n\nBut if McCarthy goes back on the deal, arguing he's somehow living up to the letter of the agreement, he risks proving the left's point.\n\n\"I don't know why Democrats would negotiate with McCarthy in the future if there's a potential that members are going to completely undermine whatever deal they reach,\" Buck said.\n\nAs always, thanks to the deal he struck to be speaker in January, McCarthy risks a motion to remove him from the speakership.\n\nAnd yet, McCarthy is sticking with his impossibly positive outlook. As he spins it, things are fine, and he's doing his job just fine.\n\n\"My job isn't to pass a bill that I hope the Senate will take up because the Senate doesn't do their work,\" he told reporters Monday. \"My job is to pass a bill-just as we found in the debt ceiling-that the House believes in, that puts America in a better place.\"\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Was Kevin McCarthy Actually Undone by Personal Grudges?\n\nDeputy Politics Editor\n\nIn the end, it may not have been the case against Kevin McCarthy's performance-the gripes over his dealmaking with Democrats, the legislative process he ran, the promises he did or didn't make to any number of people-that cemented the abrupt end of his speakership .\n\nFor eight of McCarthy's most dedicated Republican critics, their unprecedented and extraordinary decision to boot the speaker and throw the House into turmoil may have been most animated by something else.\n\nBeef.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe ringleader of the coup, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), has insisted his misgivings with McCarthy weren't personal. \"I have no personal animus to him,\" he said on Fox News Tuesday night. \"I hope he finds fruitful pastures, and I'm certain he will.\"\n\nBut to many Republicans, it's clear the far-right Florida congressman has long harbored a deep resentment toward McCarthy-and that's clear to even McCarthy himself.\n\n\"You all know Matt Gaetz,\" McCarthy said at a press conference Tuesday announcing he would not seek the speakership again. \"You know it was personal.\"\n\nMcCarthy first noted Gaetz's most obvious incentive: boosting his own popularity with a MAGA base that had never really cared for the speaker, and fundraising off his gambit.\n\nBut McCarthy also mentioned something else. \"I've seen the texts,\" he said. \"It was all about his ethics. But that's alright.\"\n\nFor over two years, the House Ethics Committee has had an open investigation of Gaetz, focusing on a variety of potential offenses- allegations of sexual misconduct most serious among them. That investigation was paused while the Department of Justice probed whether Gaetz had paid for sex with a minor , but it resumed recently when no charges resulted from the investigation.\n\nAccording to The New York Times , Gaetz complained to colleagues that McCarthy hadn't scuttled the investigation-even though he had no real power to do so. \"It seems that the Ethics Committee's interest in me waxes and wanes based on my relationship with the speaker,\" Gaetz said on Monday, though he has since claimed the Ethics probe had nothing to do with his stand.\n\nBeyond any Ethics Committee situation, McCarthy and Gaetz-the House GOP's consummate backslapper and gadfly, respectively-seemed to just never get along.\n\nIn a revealing anecdote from her new book , former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson described what happened when she, Gaetz, McCarthy, and other members joined Donald Trump on a presidential retreat to Camp David. McCarthy ordered some alcohol and invited a small group back to his cabin. It was around 1 a.m. when there was a knock on McCarthy's door.\n\n<p>I thought it was Camp David staff coming to warn us to quiet down-Kevin's cabin was across from the president's. But when Kevin opened the door, we discovered Matt Gaetz leaning against the doorframe. Matt straightened his posture when Kevin asked him what he wanted, and he explained that he had seen my golf cart parked outside and thought that this was my cabin. Embarrassed, I got up and asked Matt what he needed. He explained that he was lost and asked me to escort him to his cabin. I told him to proceed around the circle drive-all the cabins were clearly marked and it was impossible to get lost. He asked me one more time to leave with him. \"Get a life, Matt,\" Kevin said, then shut the door.</p>\n\nThe Florida congressman is not the only one of the McCarthy rebels whose opposition might have hinged on personal considerations.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett (R-TN), though a hardline conservative, consistently voted in favor of McCarthy during his slog to win the gavel in January. But what apparently tipped Burchett toward voting to boot McCarthy was a Tuesday morning call he got from the speaker.\n\nAccording to Burchett-who said he was going to \"pray about\" his decision-McCarthy opened the conversation by belittling his faith. \"He just said something that was very condescending,\" Burchett said. \"I thought to myself, that pretty much sealed it right there.\"\n\nAfter losing the vote later that day, an exasperated McCarthy insisted to reporters that he did no such thing, only that he read Burchett's own words to him when they began speaking.\n\nAnother Republican who voted against McCarthy-Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO)-was passed over earlier this year for the chairmanship of an antitrust subcommittee. According to The Washington Post , McCarthy didn't even inform Buck, an antitrust wonk who was set to win the chairmanship on seniority, that the position was going instead to Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY).\n\nBuck ultimately learned about the \"snub,\" as the Washington Examiner put it, from the media about a week after he put out a book lambasting Big Tech .\n\nNotably, Buck had not mentioned that history in discussing his opposition to McCarthy. A spokesperson for Buck did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) was probably the most surprising addition to the ranks of the McCarthy rebels. An occasional moderate who sometimes postures with the hard right, Mace might not be in office if not for McCarthy; when she first ran for Congress in 2020, the GOP leader steered millions of dollars to her struggling campaign to flip a seat held by a Democrat.\n\nIn the final days of his speakership, Mace's opposition seemed to come from out of nowhere, and she struggled to articulate exactly why she was upset, other than claiming that he had not kept promises he made to her.\n\nAfter Mace appeared on ABC's The View to slam McCarthy, the speaker told reporters he called her chief of staff, who he said told him \"You have kept your word, 100 percent.\"\n\nAt his press conference, McCarthy was asked by a reporter if he regretted \"not reaching out\" to Mace directly, with the reporter adding that Mace was not happy that he called her chief of staff.\n\n\"She was on The View saying I didn't keep my word, so I didn't know what to...\" McCarthy responded, before trailing off and, apparently, deciding not to say more. \"Listen, I can't say this in the press, but OK.\"\n\nThere is a deep irony to the fact that McCarthy's fall from grace was accelerated by personal grievances. What brought the California Republican to the top of his party was not brainpower or legislative mastery, but relentlessness in cultivating allies and building strong interpersonal relationships.\n\nIn their defenses of McCarthy ahead of the vote on Tuesday, GOP member after GOP member testified to his strengths as a leader, colleague, and friend. He was someone who never missed a call on birthdays or when a child or grandchild was born, they said.\n\nMcCarthy's skill in this regard carried him far-but only so far. In today's House GOP, under the rules that he himself approved, a small group of determined lawmakers could topple a broadly popular speaker, for whatever reason they want.\n\nWhoever succeeds McCarthy-no matter if it is Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA), Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH), or someone else-will have enemies. Every political leader racks up a few of those in the course of rising through the ranks. But that one disgruntled colleague could engineer the downfall of a speaker is just one reason why McCarthy's successor may have just as impossible of a job as he did.\n\nWhat remains clear is that there are plenty of strong political incentives for Republican members to be seen as fighting the party establishment, no matter how chaotic the outcome.\n\nGaetz, for instance, is seen as likely to run for governor of Florida in 2026, where his anti-McCarthy crusade could make him a hero in a GOP primary. (He has said he is not planning to seek the office.)\n\nAnother one of the anti-McCarthy eight, Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-MT), is gearing up to run for U.S. Senate in Montana, where he would face off against GOP consensus pick Tim Sheehy in a primary battle.\n\nMace, meanwhile, fundraised off her vote the following day-though, pleading for contributions in an interview from the Capitol on Fox News, the congresswoman may have unknowingly broken t he strict prohibition on soliciting campaign donations in the building .\n\nIt's unclear if these lawmakers will face any consequences from their party anytime soon. But plenty of Republicans are worried that failure to respond forcefully might incentivize the behavior even more.\n\nSeveral GOP lawmakers have called for the conference to expel Gaetz, as fury boils over in the wake of the coup he orchestrated. Freshman Rep. Max Miller (R-OH), who once served as an aide to Trump, called Gaetz \"disturbed.\"\n\n\"He's gone too far,\" he said. \"He's a party of one. He's going to fail.\"\n\nRep. Don Bacon (R-NE) told The Daily Beast he wanted Gaetz out of the conference as well.\n\n\"He's not a Republican,\" Bacon said of Gaetz. \"He's an anarchist.\"\n\nAnd Rep. Michael Lawler (R-NY) has made attacking Gaetz something of a sport in recent days, calling him a \" charlatan \" on Monday and saying he thought Gaetz should be expelled on Tuesday. Rep. Dan Newhouse (R-WA) wondered to The Daily Beast whether it was just Gaetz who should be expelled.\n\nIf Gaetz was taking the calls for his punishment personally himself, he wasn't showing it on Tuesday.\n\n\"If they want to expel me,\" he told reporters, \"let me know when they have the votes.\"\n\nZachary Petrizzo contributed to this report.\n\nDeputy Politics Editor\n\nSam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Will Donald Trump Save Kevin McCarthy From a Far-Right Coup?\n\nFormer Politics Reporter\n\nAs hardline House Republicans prepare to force a vote on the removal of Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) this week, there's one man they hope will stay out of the GOP drama: Donald Trump .\n\nWhile never quite predictable, Trump likely has the power to save McCarthy, should the California Republican- as expected -face a \"motion to vacate\" vote. (Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) told CNN's Jake Tapper on Sunday that he intended to offer the motion this week .)\n\nBut McCarthy's detractors don't seem to think Trump will speak up for McCarthy.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Honestly, I don't think the president is going to weigh into that at all,\" Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) told The Daily Beast.\n\nDonalds said he spoke with Trump late last week, and he believed Trump was \"just going to let, you know, House business be House business.\"\n\nOther Freedom Caucus members and allies also projected confidence that Trump would stay out of the fray.\n\n\"I don't see him messing with leadership right now,\" Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN) said. Burchett seemed to mean that Trump wouldn't speak out against McCarthy, but he also predicted that Trump wouldn't say anything.\n\nWhile Trump's been preoccupied with the campaign trail and a mountain of legal trouble , one Republican lawmaker who spoke with Trump about the shutdown said the ex-president's been paying attention to the House chaos, but gave \"no mention\" of supporting McCarthy's ouster during their conversation.\n\nA Trump confidant told The Daily Beast it was unlikely the former president would \"abandon his relationship with McCarthy,\" but this source noted that Trump and the speaker have always had a \"love-hate relationship.\"\n\n\"This is not going to be the issue that Trump comes out to destroy McCarthy with. He still needs him,\" the source said.\n\nA Trump spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nAt a campaign stop in Iowa on Sunday, Trump avoided committing either way on the impending motion to vacate.\n\n\"I don't want to comment on it yet. I think it's too early,\" Trump said, though he noted that he appreciated the \"very nice things\" McCarthy said had about him earlier in the day.\n\n\"He said very great things about me today,\" Trump said.\n\nThe situation with McCarthy is far from theoretical. House conservatives told Politico on Sunday that they believe there are at least a dozen votes already against McCarthy. One member apparently told the publication they knew of at least seven votes against the speaker, meaning McCarthy's fate could be in the hands of Democrats.\n\nEven if Trump did wade into the drama, some Republicans don't think it would matter.\n\n\"Didn't change any minds the first time he weighed in,\" one member said, referring to McCarthy's contested 15-round speakership vote at the beginning of the Congress. But members were careful to say-including this one-that they have no indication Trump has turned on McCarthy.\n\nRep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX) noted that Trump has strongly backed McCarthy up to this point.\n\n\"If you think back even to the very beginning of the year, when it took us 15 votes to make him Speaker of the House, President Trump was very supportive of Kevin McCarthy at that time,\" Hunt said.\n\nAnd Donalds suggested the lesson of Trump supporting McCarthy during the speaker election was that \"something substantial would have to happen\" for the former president to turn his back on McCarthy.\n\nStill, Trump's position on McCarthy-and what kind of impact him speaking up would have-are matters of intense interest among the House GOP. That's especially true for the conservatives who may hold McCarthy's fate in their hands.\n\nFor some Republicans, crossing Trump on any issue is anathema. Rep. Ronny Jackson (R-TX), who served as Trump's personal physician while he was in office, was clear that what Trump said on McCarthy would matter.\n\n\"It matters every time he weighs in on anything,\" he said. \"He's influential!\"\n\nBut Trump's influence on GOP leadership elections hasn't exactly held the sway that he or his allies may present. For one, Trump has been a constant critic of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY), and even though the Senate is decidedly not the same as the House, McConnell's position as the GOP leader has never really been in doubt.\n\nFor another, even in Trump's most fraught moments with Paul Ryan when he was speaker, Ryan never had a problem retaining the speaker's gavel.\n\nBut with McCarthy already facing a mutiny -and with his majority so slim-Trump turning on McCarthy could be the nail in his coffin. Unfortunately for McCarthy's detractors, there's no indication Trump is turning, even as they try to present otherwise.\n\nGaetz has tried his best to highlight Trump's differences with McCarthy-and use the spending battle to claim his own unity with the former president.\n\nWhen Trump argued for not playing ball on appropriations in late September-\"SHUT IT DOWN!\" Trump blared in one recent post on Truth Social -Gaetz tried to sow discord between Trump and McCarthy.\n\n\"Trump agrees with me. Not Speaker McCarthy. No Continuing Resolution. Break the Fever,\" Gaetz tweeted .\n\nWhen The Daily Beast asked Gaetz last week if he thought Trump would abandon McCarthy, Gaetz dodged.\n\n\"Oh, that's between them,\" Gaetz said. \"I'm going to let them define their own relationship.\"\n\nBut after McCarthy put a clean 47-day extension of government funding on the floor Saturday-and got the legislation passed 331-91, with 209 Democrats voting yes and 90 Republicans voting no-Gaetz was escalating his attacks against McCarthy on Sunday.\n\n\"I do intend to file a motion to vacate against Speaker McCarthy this week,\" Gaetz said on CNN. \"I think we need to rip off the band-aid. I think we need to move on with new leadership that can be trustworthy. The one thing everybody has in common is no one trusts McCarthy.\"\n\nIn response to Gaetz's announcement that he'd bring the motion, McCarthy fired back, projecting confidence that he'd survive.\n\n\"You know, this is personal with Matt,\" McCarthy said on CBS' Face the Nation .\n\nFormer Politics Reporter\n\nzachary.petrizzo@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

David Schweikert (R-AZ), who represents a swing district Biden carried in 2020. \"We're borrowing $63,000 a second and this is what you focus on?\"\n\n\"You are functionally the only one who has ever asked me that question,\" Schweikert added.\n\nFor McCarthy, who has proven to be a skillful triangulator of the various factions of his party, his management of the building impeachment pressure will continue to preserve his own speakership.\n\nAs with many McCarthy leadership decisions, however, his short-term survival may spell longer-term problems for himself and for the party. By opening the door to impeaching Biden, the Speaker may have crossed a point of no return on the path to an inevitable impeachment vote.\n\nWhile Republicans dutifully said they would follow the evidence wherever it leads, clearly, some are not having a hard time seeing the destination.\n\n\"I think McCarthy is moving in the right direction, to the next phase,\" said Rep. Ryan Zinke (R-MT), who previously served as Trump's Interior Secretary. \"The evidence will lead us to a conclusion and right now, that path is headed toward impeachment, but not at the expense of the Constitution.\"\n\nEven if the GOP's destination is clear, how they will get there remains anything but.\n\nIn their sprawling investigations into Biden, his family, and his administration, congressional Republicans have thus far been unable to surface any clear proof that the president abused his power for personal gain.\n\nIn talking to Republicans, it's not clear what conduct they specifically believe would be impeachable; they usually suggest broad areas of inquiry that they believe could lead to the discovery of impeachable offenses.\n\nSince Republicans began aggressively investigating in January, they have focused on allegations that Biden and his family-specifically his son, Hunter-leveraged their influence with foreign actors to enrich themselves. But much of their investigation focuses on facts long in the public record , involving Hunter's business dealings in Ukraine.\n\nAn added element of particular interest to lawmakers is recent testimony from IRS whistleblowers involved with the years-long Department of Justice probe into Hunter. They have claimed that he was shown unusual lenience by prosecutors, though much of the investigation occurred when Trump was president.\n\nWhile many Republicans support the investigations, privately, GOP sources said they do not believe a clear majority of the conference currently supports moving forward with impeachment.\n\nSome Republicans have been blunt in their assessment of what has been found so far. Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) told CNN on Wednesday that \"this is impeachment theater\" and suggested McCarthy was trying to distract from the party's disunity on spending bills.\n\nDemocrats do not seem too worried that the GOP will put together a cogent case for impeachment. Rep. Ted Lieu (D-CA), the fourth-ranking House Democrat, told The Daily Beast there's no planning currently underway by the minority to prepare for a GOP impeachment push.\n\n\"It's been over 200 days since the Republicans controlled Congress and they have not done a single thing to move the American family forward,\" Lieu said. \"Now, they're focused on stupid stuff, like trying to impeach [Homeland Security] Secretary Mayorkas, or President Biden, and there's simply no evidence to go forward with any impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nPublicly, McCarthy has acknowledged the House investigations have not surfaced any proof of wrongdoing, but he has indicated an impeachment inquiry is the best way to obtain the fullest set of facts.\n\nBut such an inquiry would unfold far slower than McCarthy's most problematic members, those in the far-right Freedom Caucus, might like.\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO), who last month used a procedural motion to force a vote on impeaching Biden , made clear to The Daily Beast that she wanted to see another vote-before lawmakers leave for the August recess.\n\nHowever, Boebert acknowledged such a vote would fail. \"I don't think there are enough Republicans for that to pass, so no, I don't think it would be before recess,\" she said. \"Do I want it to be before recess? Yes.\"\n\nBoebert indicated, however, she would gladly act to force the issue again. \"If I feel the impeachment inquiry that has been mentioned by the Speaker and other members of Congress is being slow-rolled,\" she said, \"I have no problem bringing articles of impeachment to the floor under a privileged motion and demanding a straight up and down vote.\"\n\nTo Democrats, the rhetoric from Boebert and her allies-who have the power to call a vote to end McCarthy's speakership-entirely explains his maneuvering on the issue.\n\n\"Anything that Kevin McCarthy says, I look at it this way: When the Freedom Caucus tells him to jump, the response is always, 'How high?'\" said Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA), the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee. \"When they tell him they want to impeach, he'll do it... If they tell him to jump off a bridge, he'll do it.\"\n\nBefore McCarthy's shift this week, it was expected that House Republicans might move forward with impeaching Mayorkas as a way to quench the party's zeal for at least some kind of impeachment action.\n\nThe Homeland Security Secretary, who has become a symbol on the right for the Biden administration's handling of various crises at the U.S.-Mexico border, has been perhaps the GOP's most hated administration official after Biden himself.\n\nMany lawmakers have openly pushed for him to be impeached, alleging his performance in the job has amounted to \"high crimes and misdemeanors,\" the traditional standard for impeachment. No Cabinet official has been impeached in modern times, however, and some Republicans have openly said that \"maladministration\" is not grounds for impeachment.\n\nAccording to CNN , however, McCarthy has been counseled against pursuing impeaching Mayorkas, with advisers arguing that the party should save its energy and focus on going after Biden himself.\n\nBut many Republicans are still clearly expecting action against Mayorkas. On Wednesday, the secretary appeared for testimony on Capitol Hill, where Rep. Troy Nehls (R-TX) told Mayorkas to his face that he looks forward to impeaching him.\n\nRep. Kevin Hern (R-OK), who chairs the influential Republican Study Committee, released a memo on Tuesday which outlined the case for impeaching Mayorkas. He told The Daily Beast he did not believe that pursuing that project would take away from a campaign against Biden.\n\n\"They're two independent investigations,\" Hern said.\n\nImpeaching Mayorkas might have been seen as a politically safer move for the dozens of Republican lawmakers who will have competitive reelections in 2024.\n\nBut moving forward with impeaching Biden-who won 18 congressional districts in 2020 now represented by Republicans-is being greeted with discomfort by members facing the most difficult races.\n\nPotentially reflecting those concerns, Rep. Richard Hudson (R-NC), the chairman of the House GOP campaign arm tasked with protecting their majority, shut down impeachment talk on Tuesday. \"No one is seriously talking about impeachment right now,\" he told the Wall Street Journal .\n\nEven Republicans who are glad to see impeachment movement realize they should tread carefully. After all, they vocally decried Democrats' two impeachments of Donald Trump, arguing they were rushed processes that cheapened the importance of one of Congress's most powerful weapons.\n\nShortly before Republicans took the majority in November 2022, McCarthy himself threw cold water on the prospect. \"I think the country doesn't like impeachment used for political purposes at all,\" he said. \"I think the country wants to heal.\"\n\nIn talking to reporters this week, Republicans alluded to their past opposition of Democrats' impeachment.\n\n\"I think if we're ever going to look at anything with any current or future executive, executive branch person, we've got to be thorough,\" said Rep. Chuck Fleischmann (R-TN), a senior member of the powerful House Appropriations Committee.\n\nAsked if he felt the evidence for impeachment rose to a serious level, Fleischmann demurred.\n\n\"I haven't seen enough,\" he said. \"I haven't really looked at it.\"\n\nZachary Petrizzo contributed to this report.\n\nDeputy Politics Editor\n\nSam.Brodey@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

      "text": "Matt Gaetz Wished Kevin McCarthy Was Still in Congress for Mayorkas Impeachment Vote\n\nBreaking News Editor\n\nAs House Republicans narrowly failed in their effort to pass articles of impeachment against Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on Tuesday night, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) found himself wishing former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy was still in the lower chamber.\n\nThat's the same Kevin McCarthy who resigned from Congress in December two months after he was dramatically ousted from the speakership as a result of a campaign led by Matt Gaetz. Speaking to Eric Bolling on Newsmax on Tuesday, Gaetz said he found himself thinking it would've \"been nice\" to have had McCarthy's vote on his side as the resolution failed in a 216-214 split.\n\nGaetz appeared on the show to commiserate with Bolling as four Republican lawmakers joined with Democrats in rejecting the impeachment. Gaetz explained that Rep. Blake Moore (R-UT) had only changed his vote from \"yes\" to \"no\" in a strategic move to allow the measure to be reconsidered at a later time.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"We didn't have any of our people that were part of the 215 that had voted 'no,'\" Gaetz said. \"So, trust me, Blake Moore wants Mayorkas impeached.\" He then said he wished some of his former congressional colleagues had still been around to help push the resolution over the line.\n\n\"As I'm watching that board and it's 215 to 215, I have never missed George Santos more,\" Gaetz said. He went on to add: \"I also wondered like, wouldn't it have been nice to still have Kevin McCarthy in the House of Representatives? Never thought you'd hear me say that.\"\n\nGaetz bemoaned that McCarthy \"took his marbles and went home\" following his downfall as speaker in October-the first time in American history that the House of Representatives voted to remove a sitting speaker.\n\nAt the time of McCarthy's ouster, Gaetz publicly insisted he'd been motivated to introduce his motion to vacate because McCarthy had breached an agreement made with conservative lawmakers in January during his campaign for the role. The Daily Beast last month revealed that in private, however, Gaetz indicated it was actually revenge for a House Ethics Committee probe into allegations of sex trafficking and other wrongdoing against Gaetz, with the Florida lawmaker holding McCarthy responsible for the investigation's revival.\n\nBreaking News Editor\n\ndan.hall@thedailybeast.com\n\nGot a tip?

The modified spending bill would have funded the government until Oct. 31 while lowering previously-proposed increases in funding for government agencies, and including a slate of border security measures.\n\n\"It's frustrating in the sense that I don't understand why anybody votes against bringing the idea, and having the debate, and then you've got all the amendments [you want to raise],\" he told reporters on Thursday afternoon.\n\n\"This is a whole new concept of individuals that just want to burn the whole place down. That doesn't work.\"\n\nAmong those who tanked Thursday's vote was Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA), who said she opposed the defense bill over its funding for Ukraine. Rep. Eli Crane (R-AZ) said he voted nay because he was trying to \"change the way this town works.\"\n\nThere are still at least nine conservatives who have vowed to kybosh the wider shutdown stopgap bill, chief among them ultraconservative Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL), who has made no secret of his end goal: getting rid of McCarthy.\n\n\"I'm a never [on the spending bill],\" he said Wednesday.\n\nThursday's disaster has plunged House Republicans even deeper into a nasty civil war that has seen members lobbing insults at each other-and the public left to worry about a potentially calamitous shutdown that would be, in the words of Rep. Mike Garcia (R-CA), \"mutually assured destruction.\"\n\n\"We're pretty frustrated,\" Rep. Anthony D'Esposito (R-NY) told Politico as he fumed about ultraconservatives once again holding the party hostage on Thursday.\n\nAdded Rep. Steve Womack (R-AR), \"If you can't do [the defense bill], what can you do?\"\n\nSenior Breaking News Editor\n\nGot a tip? Send it to The Daily Beast here .\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nADVERTISEMENT"

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy ousted as US House speaker by hard-right Republicans\n\nFormer speaker confirms he will not run again as Republicans plan to hold a vote for a new speaker next Wednesday\n\nAfter leading a successful, bipartisan effort to avoid a government shutdown over the weekend, Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday was abruptly removed from his role as US House speaker, ousted by hard-right members of his own Republican party less than a year after his election.\n\nThe ousting of McCarthy represented the first time in US history that a speaker of the House has been removed from office, marking an ignominious end to a short and fraught tenure for the California Republican. It comes as Americans' approval ratings of Congress and the federal government remain near historic lows , with a majority saying they have little or no confidence in the future of the US political system.\n\nThe infighting between Republicans effectively puts a halt to all business in the House of Representatives until the House, which has only a narrow Republican majority, elects a new speaker. McCarthy said Tuesday night that he would not run for speaker again, clearing the way for a new Republican speaker if the party members can reach a consensus.\n\nRepublicans plan to hold a vote for a new speaker next Wednesday, following a closed-door meeting on 10 October to discuss different candidates, Reuters reported.\n\nThe vote to oust McCarthy followed a motion to vacate the chair from the Florida Republican congressman Matt Gaetz . After McCarthy's Republican allies failed to block the motion from moving forward, a final vote was held on Tuesday afternoon. Amid gasps from members in the tense chamber, eight hard-right Republicans joined 208 Democrats in supporting McCarthy's removal, as 210 Republicans tried and failed to keep the speaker in place. McCarthy needed a simple majority of voting members to keep his gavel but failed to cross that threshold.\n\n\"The resolution is adopted,\" congressman Steve Womack, the Arkansas Republican who presided over the session, announced after the vote. \"The office of speaker of the House of the United States House of Representatives is hereby declared vacant.\"\n\nMcCarthy had sat stoically with his hands in his lap but when the vote finished, he threw his head back and chuckled at his own plight, as some members walked over to shake his hand.\n\nFollowing the declaration, congressman Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican, was designated by McCarthy as the acting speaker until a new House leader is elected. Upon taking the gavel, McHenry quickly called for a recess.\n\n\"In the opinion of the chair, prior to proceeding to the election of a speaker, it will be prudent to first recess for the relative caucus and conferences to meet and discuss the path forward,\" McHenry said. House Republicans met Tuesday evening to regroup and finalize plans to, while Democrats will meet on Wednesday morning.\n\nSome Republican leaders condemned McCarthy's removal, with former vice-president and current presidential candidate Mike Pence suggesting it would undermine the GOP in the eyes of voters. \"Chaos is never America's strength and it's never a friend of American families that are struggling,\" Pence said at an event in Georgetown.\n\nFormer speaker of the House Newt Gingrich dubbed Gaetz an \"anti-Republican\" and called him \"actively destructive to the conservative movement\", urging Republicans to vote to expel Gaetz from the House Republican conference.\n\nMultiple Republican members of Congress told CNN that they expected to discuss whether Gaetz should be expelled from the Republican conference as a consequence for his behavior, though they did not say whether they personally would support the measure.\n\nThe eight Republicans who joined with Democrats to vote McCarthy out offered a range of reasons. South Carolina congresswoman Nancy Mace said McCarthy \"has not lived up to his word on how the House would operate\", and argued that the chaos in Congress would be worse with McCarthy in charge than without him. \"We need a fresh start,\" she said.\n\nTim Burchett of Tennessee told CNN that McCarthy had \"said something that I thought belittled me and my belief system\" in a phone call. He said he was open to supporting several \"honorable men\" as McCarthy's replacement, adding: \"They've never openly mocked me, anyway.\"\n\nSpeaking to reporters Tuesday night to confirm that he would not run for speaker again, McCarthy said: \"I wouldn't change a thing.\"\n\n\"I leave the speakership with a sense of pride and accomplishment. And yes, optimism,\" McCarthy said, citing Teddy Roosevelt's quote about the man who \" fails while daring greatly \".\n\n\"I made history, didn't I?\" he said.\n\nMcCarthy dismissed the eight Republicans who voted against him, saying: \"This country is too great for small visions of those eight,\" and calling them \"individuals\" who were not \"looking to be productive\". He noted that he had helped many of the Republicans who voted against him get elected in the first place, quipping to a CNN reporter : \"I should have picked somebody else.\"\n\nGaetz had been motivated by a \"personal\" vendetta against him, related to the Congressional ethics inquiry into his behavior, including allegations of sexual misconduct, illicit drug use and misuse of campaign funds, McCarthy told reporters . He said the Florida congressman was not a true conservative, and that his goal had been to attract attention and campaign donations. \"We're getting email fundraisers from him as he's doing it,\" McCarthy said .\n\nBut the former speaker placed a larger share of the blame for the intra-Republican battle on the opposing party, saying: \"I think today was a political decision by the Democrats.\"\n\nMcCarthy chose not to run for speaker again after being ousted because he \"was not going to negotiate with the Democrats to become speaker\", Republican congressman Kevin Hern told Reuters.\n\nPresident Joe Biden urged the House to move quickly to elect a speaker, with press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre saying in a statement: \"The urgent challenges facing our nation will not wait\".\n\nMcCarthy's removal capped a tumultuous nine months in the House, defined by clashes between the speaker and the hard-right flank of his conference. Despite his repeated efforts to appease them, his willingness to collaborate with Democrats to prevent economic chaos sealed his fate. With the narrowest of majorities in the House, Republicans now face the unenviable task of electing a leader who can win nearly unanimous support across a deeply divided conference.\n\nGaetz sought McCarthy's removal after the speaker worked with House Democrats to pass a stopgap spending bill, known as a continuing resolution, to extend government funding through 17 November. Gaetz also accused McCarthy of cutting a \"secret side deal\" with Joe Biden on providing additional funding to Ukraine, which has become a source of outrage on the right. McCarthy denied the existence of any secret deal.\n\nThe House and the US Senate passed the stopgap bill with overwhelming bipartisan majorities, averting a shutdown that could have left hundreds of thousands of federal workers without pay for an extended period.\n\nSome Republican House members had condemned Gaetz in advance of the vote to oust McCarthy, calling him in interviews with CNN a \"chaos agent\", and \"a fool or a liar\" , and raising concerns that the maneuver might cost Republicans their house majority.\n\nTuesday's vote was the first to remove a House speaker in more than 100 years and the first successful such vote in American history. Other recent House speakers, including former Republican leader John Boehner, had previously been threatened with a motion to vacate but never had to endure a full effort to remove them.\n\nThe referendum starkly illustrated McCarthy's tenuous grasp on the gavel since needing 15 rounds of voting to secure the House speakership in January.\n\nMcCarthy has never won the support of many Republicans to his right. Additionally, many of his fellow Republicans felt McCarthy did not secure their side sufficient concessions in the deal that averted the shutdown.\n\n\"The speaker fought through 15 votes in January to become speaker, but was only willing to fight through one failed [continuing resolution] before surrendering to the Democrats on Saturday,\" Bob Good, a Republican congressman from Virginia, said in a floor speech on Tuesday. \"We need a speaker who will fight for something, anything besides just staying or becoming speaker.\"\n\nBefore McCarthy learned his fate Tuesday, the House Democratic leader, Hakeem Jeffries, indicated his caucus would not help McCarthy save his job. In the end, every present House Democrat voted in favor of ousting McCarthy.\n\n\"House Democrats remain willing to find common ground on an enlightened path forward. Unfortunately, our extreme Republican colleagues have shown no willingness to do the same,\" Jeffries said in a \"Dear Colleague\" letter sent Tuesday. \"Given their unwillingness to break from [Make America Great Again] extremism in an authentic and comprehensive manner, House Democratic leadership will vote yes on the pending Republican Motion to Vacate the Chair.\"\n\nWith the speaker removed, all work in the House will grind to a halt until a new leader is elected.\n\nPramila Jayapal, Washington state representative and chair of the Congressional Progressive caucus, said to CNN that under McCarthy and the Republican majority, the House had \"consistently been chaos, not to mention the division, the polarization, the racism. We don't take any pleasure in this.\"\n\nDavid Smith, Leonie Chao-Fong, Hugo Lowell and Lois Beckett contributed reporting."

He became speaker in January - but only after enduring 15 votes for the role as the far right of his own party held him hostage.\n\nThe gavel secured, he stayed loyal to Donald Trump, the former president who faces 91 criminal charges and assorted civil threats but still dominates his party, the clear frontrunner for the Republican presidential nomination next year.\n\nMcCarthy backed Trump despite his incitement of the January 6 attack on Congress, joining 146 other congressional Republicans in voting to object to results in key states even after the mob breached the walls of the Capitol. Memorably, Trump called McCarthy \"My Kevin\".\n\nNonetheless, in October, after McCarthy leant on Democratic support to keep the federal government funded and open, the same far-right, pro-Trump faction made him the first speaker ever ejected by his own party.\n\nIn his Journal column, McCarthy heralded what he said were his achievements in office - without mentioning that Democratic control of the Senate and White House rendered most of them moot - and claimed that \"No matter the odds, or personal cost, we did the right thing.\n\n\"That may seem out of fashion in Washington these days, but delivering results for the American people is still celebrated across the country,\" McCarthy wrote. \"It is in this spirit that I have decided to depart the House at the end of this year to serve America in new ways. I know my work is only getting started.\"\n\nHe repeated such claims in a video statement released on social media.\n\nMcCarthy was tormented and ultimately ejected by the right of his party, in part because he never enjoyed a majority strong enough to reduce their power.\n\nHis retirement, on the heels of the expulsion last week of the Republican George Santos, will reduce the party's majority still further.\n\nAfter McCarthy steps down, Mike Johnson, the hard-right Louisianan who became speaker after three other candidates failed to attract enough support, will only be able to lose three votes before being unable to operate without Democratic support.\n\nUnder California law the Democratic governor, Gavin Newsom, has 140 days in which to conduct a special election.\n\nIn October, attempting to project defiance after his brutal defenestration by his own party, McCarthy told supporters he would not quit the fight.\n\n\"I'm not resigning,\" he said . \"I got a lot more work to do.\"\n\nBut months of tension in the corridors of power - including an alleged physical attack on Tim Burchett, a Republican rightwinger from Tennessee - only stoked predictions that McCarthy would soon quit.\n\nOn Saturday, Eric Swalwell, a California Democrat and frequent McCarthy antagonist, predicted that \"with Santos gone ... the next GOP member to leave Congress will be [Kevin] McCarthy.\n\n\"No way he stays. A guy who kidney punches his colleagues from behind is too afraid to serve out a full term with them,\" he said. \"I bet he's gone by end of year.\"\n\nAfter McCarthy's resignation came to pass, critics were quick to pass judgment on a congressional career that began in 2007, with McCarthy hailed as a Republican \" Young Gun \", and saw the prodigious fundraiser and glad-hander rise to be whip, majority leader and speaker.\n\nMike Madrid, a Republican consultant from California, said : \"Kevin McCarthy's story is an epic tragedy about the pursuit of power, the compromise of values and how power reveals character. He could have been remembered as a great statesman who did the right thing at a critical moment, but he will go down as the weakest speaker in history.\"\n\nJoe Walsh, a former rightwing congressman now an anti-Trump commentator, said : \"I served in Congress with Kevin McCarthy. He has no core. He's a hollow man. His only reason for being is the pursuit of power, his only guide is his personal ambition. And in the end, this was his undoing.\""

      "text": "California hometown sheds few tears for retiring McCarthy: 'Don't let the door hit you on the way out, Kevin'\n\nLocal Republicans praised the former House speaker but unfashionable Bakersfield largely greeted his exit with a shrug\n\nF or the brief period that he stood at the pinnacle of national politics, Kevin McCarthy cast an odd sort of light on Bakersfield, his unfashionable, hardscrabble home town in southern California that might never have penetrated the national consciousness without him.\n\nThe city has none of the trappings of what we think of when we think of the Golden state - no beaches, no cable cars, no redwood forests, and only an intermittent view of the Tehachapi mountains, depending on the intensity of the smog that rises from the inland oilfields and large tract farms that provide its lifeblood. The Beach Boys never immortalized Bakersfield in song - and neither, for the most part, has anyone else.\n\nYet for the past year, as McCarthy struggled to lead the new Republican majority in the House of Representatives, the city has enjoyed a quirky notoriety as the place that formed the man that wielded the speaker's gavel, albeit for an agonizingly - and historically - short time.\n\nJournalists from national publications have dutifully made the trek up from Los Angeles in search of the sandwich counter that McCarthy ran as a young man inside his uncle's strip-mall yogurt shop (both long gone), or to eat a steak and pasta lunch at Luigi's, which McCarthy once lauded as the kind of place that is reliably hopping by 11am because the good, hardworking people of Bakersfield start their jobs at sunrise.\n\nThe reporters would try to figure out whether the city saw McCarthy as the smiling, happy-go-lucky favourite son portrayed by his friends and allies, or just another ambitious politician more interested in building his power base in Washington DC than in serving his local constituents.\n\nHow much did McCarthy love Bakersfield, and how much did Bakersfield love him back? The responses were mixed then, and they remain mixed now.\n\n\"If you went through the wringer he went through, I suspect there's a little humiliation, a little embarrassment. Maybe he's licking his wounds and wants to go off into the sunset,\" said Greg Perrone, president of the Greater Bakersfield Republican Assembly, an activist group that hews to McCarthy's right. \"Still, I'm a little disappointed that he didn't finish the term that he was elected to serve. That's not what we expect from our elected leaders.\"\n\nThe critical voices that fill the letters column of the local paper, the Bakersfield Californian, have been quite a bit blunter. \"Don't let the door hit you on the way out, Kevin,\" two of them wrote last week. One added : \"You haven't represented us in a very long time.\"\n\nLocal Republican officials have been quick to sing McCarthy's praises since the announcement of his retirement from Congress, calling him optimistic, unafraid of hard work, a patriot, and a \"tremendous advocate for the Central Valley\". But others less beholden to him have been notable mostly by their silence.\n\nBakersfield's mayor, Karen Goh, who has been photographed with McCarthy on passingly few occasions since she took office seven years ago, issued no statement. When invited to comment on ways in which McCarthy had helped the city in his 16 years in Washington, her office told the Guardian she was too busy to respond.\n\nMcCarthy's district, California's 20th, extends well beyond Bakersfield into the farmlands of Kern and Tulare counties and into the suburbs of Fresno, the largest city in the Central Valley. It was redrawn before the last election to make it more solidly Republican, relieving McCarthy of any significant pressure to fight for his own congressional seat. He scarcely visited during last year's campaign, focusing instead on raising hundreds of millions of dollars for more competitive districts in California and the rest of the country.\n\nThat focus has not always gone down well with his constituents, especially in Bakersfield, whose population has grown significantly more diverse since the days when it was a refuge for poor white farmers from the Dust Bowl and their descendants, giving the area an Oklahoma flavor with rock-ribbed conservative attitudes to match. The city is now majority Latino, and party registration between the two major parties is close to even.\n\nStill, the city may be less remarkable for its changing political complexion than for its relative lack of political engagement. In recent election cycles, Bakersfield and Kern county have seen some of the lowest voter turnout rates in California - just 34% for the 2022 mid-terms, and 58% for the presidential race in 2020 when the statewide average was more than 70%.\n\nNothing about the place is friendly to politics, starting with a notable lack of public space. Amid the sprawl of highways and mini-malls and residential subdivisions, most political protests - including recent pro-Israel and pro-Palestinian demonstrations - have been confined to the sidewalks at the intersection of Stockdale Highway and California Avenue, on the western end of town, where the corners are demarcated by a Mobil station, a Shell station, a McDonald's and a Chick-Fil-A.\n\nMost local political offices are in business parks where the doors stay locked to anyone without an appointment. McCarthy's own district office rarely engages with the public or with reporters.\n\nWith McCarthy now on his way out, Bakersfield's political profile is likely to dwindle even further. The city has other, mostly dubious claims to fame - as one of the most dangerous places in America for pedestrians , and as an area with one of the highest incidences of police shootings . The city's website is currently touting a more cheerful statistic - that a financial website named WalletHub has ranked it the 96th best city in the United States to have fun.\n\nThat's slightly less fun than Overland Park, Kansas, in the Kansas City suburbs, but a touch more fun than Toledo, Ohio, where Saturday nights were once infamously described in a John Denver song as \"like being no place at all\". Bakersfield's city leaders are taking that as a compliment.\n\nThis article was amended on 11 and 19 December 2023. It was the office of Bakersfield mayor Karen Goh, not the mayor herself, that said she did not have time to comment on the ways Kevin McCarthy helped the city during his time in Washington. And a description of the financial website WalletHub as \"obscure\" was removed."

      "text": "'He's Bakersfield': Kevin McCarthy's constituents know him better than he knows himself\n\nResidents of this conservative yet rapidly changing inland California city watch the chaos in Washington with patience and resolve\n\nFor two decades, Julie and Jared Vawter have been among the Republicans whose votes for Kevin McCarthy sent him from his conservative inland California hometown of Bakersfield to Sacramento and then Washington DC, where he rose through the GOP's ranks in the House of Representatives and, this year, was elected speaker.\n\nThat climb came to an abrupt end last week, when a small group of rightwing Republicans revolted against McCarthy and, with the help of Democrats, made him the first speaker removed from the post in the chamber's 234-year history.\n\nA week and two days after McCarthy's downfall, the Vawters affixed McCarthy campaign pins and made their way to the monthly meeting of the Greater Bakersfield Republican Assembly (GBRA), a conservative group where some members were partial to the rightwing insurgency and its leader, the congressman Matt Gaetz.\n\n\"He was a man that I feel has integrity,\" Jared Vawter, 64, said of McCarthy. \"And, to me, that's one of the most important things for a congressman, is that he stand up and do what he says and says what he does.\"\n\n\"And reach across the aisle,\" 60-year-old Julie Vawter added in the banquet room of a Bakersfield institution, Hodel's Country Dining, just after the prayer that closed the GBRA's meeting. \"Because we have to have that. We want that from their side. We gotta have that from our side. We can't be the Matt Gaetz, who [has] a solid line and won't budge.\"\n\nStanding on the other side of the hall, Joyce Perrone said she saw McCarthy's downfall as the type of change that may have been a loss for Bakersfield's famed son, but was long overdue for Washington's political class, whom she viewed as derelict in reducing the national debt, and securing the country's border with Mexico.\n\n\"I think we welcome the chaos,\" Perrone said. As for McCarthy: \"He's a good fundraiser, good speaker, he did some things, but I think people are tired of the status quo.\"\n\nThere's no telling what comes next, either for McCarthy or for Congress. House Republicans have found no exit from the power vacuum McCarthy's ouster created, and without a speaker, the chamber is essentially nonoperational.\n\nThere appeared to be a breakthrough on Wednesday, when McCarthy's deputy Steve Scalise won the party's nomination to replace him, but he dropped out a day later after concluding he could not attain the near-unanimity required among House Republicans to win the speaker's gavel.\n\nThe consequences of McCarthy's downfall for Bakersfield are far less apparent. The 58-year-old former speaker says he has no intention of resigning, and the district he represents, which includes about half the city's neighborhoods and portions of the Sierra Nevada mountain range and San Joaquin valley, is considered the most Republican-leaning in the state. But McCarthy's ouster could damage his formidable fundraising operation, while Democrats in Bakersfield and the surrounding Kern county believe they have more momentum than one would think in the traditionally conservative area.\n\n\"Nobody has ever accused Kevin of not working hard, that's for darn sure,\" said Greg Perrone, the GBRA's president. \"He's not a Harvard-educated or Ivy League-educated guy. Nobody has ever said he's a slacker. He's Bakersfield.\"\n\nPolitically conservative, culturally distinct and inland from California's populous and picturesque coastline, Bakersfield has ever-expanding neighborhoods surrounded by the pump jacks and orchards of its two main industries, agriculture and oil - which together make the air there the worst in the nation .\n\nHalf of the city's 400,000-plus residents identify as Latino. Bakersfield is also home to a growing Punjabi Sikh community; to the descendants of the midwesterners who migrated to California during the dust bowl of the 1930s; and to a population of Basque sheepherders who arrived at the dawn of the 20th century. The city's poverty rate, at 16%, is above the national average, according to Census Bureau data , and its rate of youth disconnectedness - the population aged 16-24 who are neither in school nor working - is among the highest in the country, according to the Social Science Research Council .\n\nMcCarthy's origin story involves him winning a $5,000 lottery ticket and, at the age of 21, using the money to open Kevin O's Deli in a corner of his family's store, McCarthy's Yogurt, on Stine Road in south-west Bakersfield. Though he has occasionally fudged the details, a fact-check by the Washington Post found , McCarthy put his experience as an entrepreneur at the center of his pitch as a politician, which began when he applied for an internship with the Republican congressman Bill Thomas while attending California State University, Bakersfield.\n\nThough his parents were Democrats, McCarthy recounted in a 2014 Fox News interview that he contrasted Democratic president Jimmy Carter's plea for Americans to wear sweaters at home to cope with rising heating prices with Republican Ronald Reagan's description of the country as a \"shining city on a hill\", and decided the latter was for him.\n\n\"I knew what I wanted to believe. I believed in an entrepreneur, in greater liberty and freedom,\" he said.\n\nThomas's chief of staff, Cathy Abernathy, turned him down for the position in Washington DC he applied for in 1987, so McCarthy asked to work in his Bakersfield office, and was accepted. He dove so deep into the tasks before him - answering the phones, tracking down delayed passport applications, sorting out constituents' immigration troubles - that Abernathy realized McCarthy needed help.\n\n\"He was on the phone so much and doing so much stuff that ... he had his own intern,\" she recalls.\n\nMcCarthy later joined Thomas's staff as an aide, where he met Mark Martinez, a political science professor at his alma mater. In the late 1990s, before McCarthy would win his first election as a trustee of the local community college, Martinez invited him to address his introduction to American government class.\n\n\"Kevin didn't understand what a lecture was,\" Martinez recalled. \"He came in, and he was actually trying to rally the troops.\" The rhetoric fell flat at Cal State Bakersfield, which, unlike some of California's other public universities, is a commuter school of politically moderate students who are often starting families or looking to change careers, Martinez said.\n\n\"How do you do this?\" McCarthy whispered under his breath to Martinez. \"I said, 'Kevin, this is a lecture - lecture on campaigns.'\" A spokesperson for McCarthy declined to comment about this incident.\n\nBy 2002, McCarthy had won an assembly seat in the state legislature and, by the end of the following year, was made the Republican minority leader.\n\n\"McCarthy leans to the middle. He supports most abortion rights, but opposes spending tax dollars on abortions,\" the Los Angeles Times political columnist George Skelton wrote in a 2003 profile . McCarthy also called for the creation of an independent commission to handle redistricting, because \"the present system protects incumbents and produces extremists\", as Skelton tells it.\n\nThomas opted not to run again in 2006, and that year, McCarthy took over his old seat. By 2014, his colleagues had elected him GOP majority leader in the House, the post just below speaker, making McCarthy the least experienced lawmaker to occupy the job in history, according to a University of Minnesota study .\n\nHe threw his support behind Donald Trump in 2016, developing a close relationship with him during his presidency that included signing on to a baseless lawsuit trying to overturn his re-election loss in 2020. Daylight appeared between them in the wake of the January 6 attack, when McCarthy said on the House floor that Trump \"bears responsibility\" for the sacking of the Capitol but he wouldn't vote to impeach him.\n\nIn an interview with Bakersfield broadcaster KGET two days later, Thomas, McCarthy's former boss, faulted him for \"months of supporting those outrageous lies of the president\" but said he hoped that when Joe Biden takes office, \"the Kevin who spoke during the impeachment ... will be the Kevin leading the Republicans on the floor of the House\".\n\nInstead, McCarthy traveled to Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida to made amends, paving the way for him to emerge as the Republican frontrunner for next year's election, and McCarthy to be elected as speaker - but only after a grueling 15 rounds of voting, thanks to opposition from many of the same GOP lawmakers who would vote to eject him months later.\n\nDuring his rise, McCarthy worked to make sure his roots as a small businessman were publicly known. Every few years or so, his social media accounts would share a photo of the Kevin O's menu, or a shot of a young and mustached McCarthy at work at the deli. But at the strip mall on Stine Road where he once did business, no sign of his family's eponymous shop remains. Today, the L-shaped building is home to a closed-up discount store, a Spanish-language church and a butcher shop where the owner, Abel Roman, is weighing whether to vote for Trump next year, or even vote at all.\n\n\"Right now, I'm not pro-Biden, neither Trump,\" said Roman, who immigrated from Peru 25 years ago. In 2020, he skipped voting because he \"didn't feel it'll make any difference\". Ahead of next year's elections, he's similarly apathetic, and skeptical about whether politicians have the will to address why the costs of goods at his store are rising or why it's so hard to get a loan.\n\nFor the Democratic party in Kern county, McCarthy's ouster could provide another boost in the rise they believe they're on. The city is filling up with new residents from pricier coastal areas, who are bringing their more liberal values with them, said Christian Romo, the county Democratic party chair. The GOP still has the edge in voter registration in Kern county, but only by about 7,000 votes, while Democrats have effective control of the Bakersfield city council, thanks to an alliance with a moderate Republican.\n\nMcCarthy's district is still so thoroughly Republican that Romo views it as unconquerable. But next door to him is David Valadao, a Republican congressman who represents the remaining neighborhoods of Bakersfield and a swath of Central Valley farmland that voted for Biden in 2020. Romo says the spectacle of McCarthy's defenestration will be part of their pitch to independent voters, whom he expects will decide whether Valadao is replaced by a Democrat next year.\n\n\"It's embarrassing that our local leader, right, 'our local hometown guy', had to go through 15 rounds of votes, and now was ... the only speaker to ever be stripped of his power. I mean, that's embarrassing for Bakersfield. It's a scar in Bakersfield,\" he said.\n\nMcCarthy was a prodigious fundraiser , channeling the tens of millions he would reap to Republican candidates in last year's midterms. James Brulte, who was the Republican minority leader in the state senate during McCarthy's time in the assembly, worries about his ability to continue that from the diminished rank of speaker emeritus.\n\n\"I don't think this affects any individual race one way or another,\" Brulte said of his removal. \"But, given McCarthy's prolific fundraising ability, given the fact that there is no Republican speaker right now, every day that goes by, that probably hurts Republicans, collectively, on the margins, primarily because of the fundraising impact.\"\n\nOnly eight Republicans voted for McCarthy's removal, but with the party appearing as disunited with him gone as it was with him as speaker, Martinez thinks he may take a stab at returning to the post, even though he has said he does not want it.\n\n\"He could become a big player and start doing stuff for the community and the region, if he was ... genuinely concerned about doing what representative government is supposed to do. But that's not where he's at,\" Martinez said. \"Kevin, if he stays in Congress, is going to want to become speaker again.\""

And that's illegal and I'm not gonna get in the middle of it.\n\n\"Now, did he do it or not? I don't know. But ethics was looking at it. There's other people in jail because of it. And he wanted me to influence it.\"\n\nThe House ethics investigation of allegations against Gaetz opened in 2021, when Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, was speaker.\n\nThe House investigation was paused when Gaetz was investigated by the US Department of Justice for sex trafficking, over allegations that he paid for sex and had sex with an underage woman. In December 2022, Joel Greenberg, a former Florida tax collector whose arrest led to the investigation of Gaetz, was sentenced to 11 years in prison for offences including sex trafficking a minor.\n\nIn February 2023, prosecutors said they would not issue charges. The House ethics investigation then restarted.\n\nGaetz denies wrongdoing. On Tuesday, he told Politico : \"Kevin is a liar. Which, actually, is why he isn't speaker. Just ask any of the 224 people who voted to remove him.\"\n\nMcCarthy became the first speaker ever ejected by his own party, last October, after Gaetz introduced a motion to vacate and attracted support from seven other Republicans . Because Democrats refused to come to McCarthy's aid, that was enough to show him the door. McCarthy left Congress at the end of last year.\n\nCiting a review of private correspondence, the Daily Beast has reported that Gaetz \"indicated to a friend that his effort to undercut, isolate and ultimately remove McCarthy was, indeed, payback\" for the House ethics investigation.\n\nThe Beast said \"other Republican congressional sources\" also said Gaetz was motivated to move against McCarthy by the ethics investigation, not policy differences.\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\nGaetz told the Beast : \"As I've answered likely 100 times on the record, I led the charge to remove Kevin McCarthy from his role as House speaker because he failed to keep his promises.\"\n\nMcCarthy lost his job shortly after relying on Democratic support to pass a spending package, thereby averting a government shutdown. His successor as speaker, Mike Johnson, now faces a similar threat, a motion to vacate filed by another rightwing extremist, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, but not yet forced to a vote.\n\nAt Georgetown, McCarthy said: \"So then they come out and they say [I was ejected] because I kept government open. I'd do it all over again. We're not going to pay our troops? I'm going to pay my troops, you can do the job ...\n\n\"I think today if you went back for the people that voted [to remove me] they think that was a smart vote? I don't think so ... I made everybody stand up, because I think historically, it'll be viewed as a very bad thing that happened to our Congress.\"\n\nAsked if he thought the same would happen to Johnson, McCarthy said: \"No. The Democrats will never let it happen.\""

The first seeds of destruction had been planted when, days after declaring Donald Trump responsible for the January 6 insurrection, McCarthy went grovelling at Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida and made his pact with the devil.\n\nThen came last year's midterm elections when, thanks to Trump's assault on democracy and his rightwing supreme court's assault on abortion rights, Republicans underperformed and squeezed out only a narrow majority, handing extremists a huge influence.\n\nThe power-hungry McCarthy was elected speaker after an epic 15 rounds of voting and, minutes later, publicly paid tribute to Trump for working the phones to help him secure victory. But he had cut a deal with the far right that would come back to bite him, including rules that made it easier to challenge his leadership.\n\nMcCarthy then spent nine months trying to govern an ungovernable party, described by the former Barack Obama strategist David Axelrod as the \"Lord of the Flies caucus\". As the Democratic minority leader, Hakeem Jeffries, has noted, the House Republican caucus is in a state of civil war.\n\nIt is further proof that the political consultant Rick Wilson was on to something when he wrote a book titled Everything Trump Touches Dies. After sneaking a win in the electoral college in 2016 while losing the national popular vote, Trump has repeatedly been a grim reaper for his party's fortunes in 2018, 2020 and 2022.\n\nThe toadies who have shown extreme loyalty to Trump have usually regretted it. His fixer Michael Cohen went to prison. His vice-president, Mike Pence, could have been hanged on January 6 and is now condemned to the purgatory of explaining to half-empty rooms why he should be president. Rudy Giuliani , Mark Meadows and other January 6 co-conspirators face possible jail time.\n\nNow McCarthy, who purported to be restraining Trump's worst impulses, has become the first speaker of the US House in history to be forced out of the job. Trump did nothing to spare him the humiliation. McCarthy destroyed any hope of being rescued by Democrats by announcing a baseless impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden and blaming them for trying to shut down the government.\n\nMaxwell Frost, a Democratic congressman from Florida, wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter: \"The Speaker did this to himself by lying to both Democrats AND Republicans. Speaker McCarthy will go down in history as the weakest Speaker in the history of our country.\"\n\nNo one who has been following US politics in the self-destructive, nihilistic, eat-one's-own age of Trump will be surprised by Tuesday's events. Words such as \"historic\" or \"unprecedented\" will have to be retired. There is no obvious heir apparent.\n\nThe Lincoln Project, an anti-Trump group, summed it up: \"The Republican party of Trump cannot govern at any level; the Maga parasite is eating them alive. There will be a reckoning for the GOP as the next speaker will be even more of a Maga apologist because that's what the party demands. No one is coming to the rescue who has the courage to tell the truth, only cowards who hide behind the chaos and pretend to look busy.\"\n\nIt is a recipe for more days or perhaps weeks of inertia in Congress, which instead of tackling social inequality or supporting Ukraine will be consumed with factional infighting. America's long march of democratic decay continues."

But, four days after announcing in an opinion column in Wednesday's Wall Street Journal that he was leaving Congress at the end of December, McCarthy appeared on CBS News Sunday Morning and made clear that he backed Trump's attempts to return to power.\n\n\"I will support the president,\" McCarthy told the show's anchor Robert Costa on Sunday while discussing his post-congressional plans. \"I will support president Trump.\"\n\nAfter he confirmed those remarks were an endorsement of the former president, who is grappling with a multitude of pending criminal charges, McCarthy was asked by Costa if he would be \"willing to serve in a Trump cabinet\".\n\nMcCarthy replied, \"In the right position. Look, if I'm the best person for the job - yes.\"\n\nHe went on to say that he worked together with Trump for the Republicans to seize what is now a four-seat majority in the House after a showing in the 2022 midterms that was widely considered to be underwhelming for their party.\n\n\"Look, I worked with President Trump on a lot of policies,\" McCarthy said. \"But we also have a relationship where we're very honest with each other.\"\n\nMcCarthy lost his hold on the House speaker's gavel in October after he relied on Democratic support to keep the federal government funded and open. As retaliation, the far-right, pro-Trump faction in the House that helped make him speaker after enduring 15 votes for the role last year ensured he became the first ever ejected from the role by his own party.\n\nIt was a bitter twist for McCarthy, who had taken the far-right position 146 other congressional Republicans did when they voted to object to Joe Biden's victory over Trump in the 2020 election.\n\nMcCarthy and his GOP colleagues maintained that position after a mob of Trump supporters attacked the US Capitol and breached its walls on 6 January 2021. Trump even received a visit at his Mar-a-Lago home from McCarthy shortly after the failure of the Capitol attack plunged the defeated president into an apparent depression , according to the Liz Cheney book Oath and Honor.\n\nMcCarthy's support at one point prompted Trump to affectionately refer to him as \"My Kevin\" at one point.\n\nAfter his ouster, McCarthy pledged that he would not resign from Congress, saying he had \"a lot more work to do\". But months of behind-the-scenes tension, including an alleged physical attack on the Tennessee Republican House member Tim Burchett, appeared to change his mind and convince him to step away in the coming weeks instead of when his term expires in early 2025.\n\nMcCarthy on Sunday said \"Trump needs to stop\" campaigning on promises of exacting revenge against his political enemies if returned to the Oval Office.\n\nSign up to First Thing\n\nOur US morning briefing breaks down the key stories of the day, telling you what's happening and why it matters\n\nafter newsletter promotion\n\n\"America doesn't want to see the idea of the retribution,\" McCarthy said. \"If it's rebuild, restore and renew, then I think you'll see that.\"\n\nDespite Trump's gloomy message, McCarthy predicted Trump would clinch the White House, help Republicans expand their numerical advantage in the House and retake a majority in the Senate if the Democrats nominate Biden for re-election.\n\nMuch of McCarthy's congressional agenda was blunted by Democratic control of the White House and the Senate, where the party has a 51-49 edge.\n\nTrump faces 91 criminal charges accusing him of election subversion, illegal retention of government secrets and hush-money payments to an adult film actor. He has also contended with civil litigation over his business affairs and a rape allegation deemed \"substantially true\" by a judge.\n\nNonetheless, Trump has emerged as the clear frontrunner to be the Republicans' 2024 presidential nominee, and a Wall Street Journal poll published on Saturday showed Trump leading Biden 47% to 43%.\n\n\"If Biden stays as the nominee for the Democrats, I believe Donald Trump will win,\" McCarthy said. \"I believe the Republicans will gain more seats in the House and the Republicans will win the Senate.\""

It was the far right of the party that ousted McCarthy and will be critical to the election of his replacement, as it is focused on cutting US funding for Kyiv.\n\nThe choice of a new speaker will be all-important for Ukraine's hopes for continued assistance, as they could stop funding bills even reaching the floor of the House for a vote. Joe Biden said at the weekend that US support for Ukraine could not be interrupted \"under any circumstances\", and he can still count on bipartisan support for that position in the Senate, but sentiment among House Republicans is moving steadily against him.\n\nThe contenders for McCarthy's job hold a range of views on supporting Ukraine. The advocacy group Defending Democracy Together rates them on a scale of A to F, with A signifying the strongest support.\n\nSteve Scalise, the number two House Republican and the leading candidate so far, scored a B, one notch up on McCarthy's B-. But other contenders such as Jim Jordan and Kevin Hern scored Fs, as did Matt Gaetz, who led the campaign to topple McCarthy and will be influential in the choice of successor. Jordan said on Wednesday he would not support continued aid to Ukraine if elected speaker.\n\nA poll published on Wednesday by the Chicago Council on Global Affairs showed that six in 10 Americans still support economic and military aid to Ukraine but that support is steadily waning, particularly among Republicans.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of the full-scale invasion last year, support for military aid to Ukraine was about 80%, from Democrats and Republicans alike. Democratic backing has declined only marginally, but enthusiasm among Republicans has plummeted to 50%. Ukraine supporters in the field of Republican presidential contenders are trailing badly, and the members of Congress report an increasing number of calls from constituents, concerned that taxpayers' funding is being squandered in Ukraine, a theme being hammered home in rightwing media.\n\nElon Musk, the owner of the X, formerly known as Twitter, has used the platform this week to ridicule the Ukrainian president, Volodymyr Zelenskiy, for his repeated requests for funding."

Kevin McCarthy vowed to hold Beijing accountable. \"We will create a bipartisan select committee on China to investigate how to bring back the hundreds of thousands of jobs that went to China, and then we will win this economic competition,\" the California Republican said early Saturday morning after a dramatic 15-vote series that elected him to lead the GOP majority in the lower chamber.\n\nOn Tuesday, the House of Representatives made good on McCarthy's promise, voting 365 to 65 to establish the House Select Committee on China, which will be chaired by foreign policy hawk Rep.

Jim Jordan, who Republican holdouts briefly tried to install as an alternative speaker this week, was also referred by the House January 6 Committee; so was McCarthy himself.\n\nThe intraparty battle for control of the House of Representatives is not a fight between pro-Trump and anti-Trump camps. There are no real anti-Trump moderates left in the Republican House caucus. This is not a matter of competing political ideologies.\n\nThe speaker's battle would make a perfect \"Seinfeld\" episode: It is a fight about nothing.\n\nAnd that's what makes it so dangerous.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nNeither the pro-McCarthy camp nor the anti-McCarthy insurgents have any real policy goals for how to make the government more effective. The goal of the insurgents is to stop the government from working at all. Yet that is true of McCarthy and his supporters as well.\n\nThe only thing they are really fighting over is personal political power. Nothing more. And that makes it very difficult for McCarthy to appease the Republicans who oppose him.\n\nIt is fitting that the battle for control of the House comes exactly two years after the January 6, 2021, insurrection. The speakership fight is a continuation of that struggle for personal power. This is an insurrection by other means.\n\nEven if the speakership is decided in the coming days, this battle shows just how paralyzed Congress will be over the next two years.\n\nThis is the paralysis that the Biden administration and the Democrats in Congress tried to prepare for in December, when the frenetic activity in the House gave off an apocalyptic vibe. Every move was hurried, with an eye on the clock and the knowledge that darkness was looming.\n\nDuring the lame-duck session, the House Ways and Means Committee released a report about Trump's long-hidden tax returns; the House January 6 Committee held its final hearing and voted to issue criminal referrals of Trump and others to the Justice Department; Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy addressed a joint session of Congress; and heavily bundled legislation that included continued funding for U.S. aid to Ukraine and new legal protections for the election of American presidents worked its way across Capitol Hill and was signed into law by Biden.\n\nNone of those things could wait any longer. The insurgents were about to take over the House.\n\nIn November, Republicans suffered some of the worst midterm results for an opposition party in modern American history, thanks to their turn toward right-wing extremism. The Republican-dominated Supreme Court had overturned Roe v. Wade , and many Republican candidates in key races were election deniers hand-picked by Trump. The Republican Party lacked a coherent policy agenda other than \"owning the libs.\" Voters were turned off, and, despite high inflation and a worsening economy, Democrats won key races around the country, retaining control of the Senate while losing the House by the narrowest of margins.\n\nYet the great irony is that the very narrowness of the Republican margin of victory in the House is what is now giving outsized influence to the extremist forces that cost the GOP so dearly.\n\nRather than fight back, McCarthy gave in to extremism years ago, and became one of Trump's most prominent enablers. His craven willingness to appease the ex-president and the insurgents in the House means that no one fears him. He is the Neville Chamberlain of the House, and even if he ultimately becomes speaker, he will not really be calling the shots. The insurgents will be in charge, and no one else in the Republican caucus is likely to challenge them.\n\nWith de facto control over the House, they will focus on the right-wing political equivalent of performance art: a national abortion ban that will go nowhere, investigating Hunter Biden's laptop, and other \"anti-woke\" ways to own the libs. They will not focus on governing.\n\nSo if Trump's taxes, hidden throughout his presidency, were ever going to see the light of day, it had to be before the new Congress convened. It took years for the Ways and Means Committee to get the returns, and then only after a lengthy court battle, which ended in November when the Supreme Court refused to block the documents' release. Once the committee prevailed in court, it had to release Trump's taxes and related information before House Republicans had the chance to suppress them.\n\nThe committee voted to release Trump's taxes and also offered some bombshells , revealing that the Internal Revenue Service did not audit Trump during the first two years of his presidency - and didn't begin to do so until the day in 2019 when the House asked for his tax returns and questioned whether any audits of Trump had been conducted. The IRS had failed to audit the sitting president's taxes even though it was mandated to do so, and even though it audited the taxes of both presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden. The committee also found that Trump paid no federal income tax in 2020, while he was president.\n\nThe House January 6 Committee also had to wrap up its business during the lame-duck session or see its work shut down after Republicans took over. In fact, rather than continue to investigate the insurrection, House Republicans are vowing to investigate the January 6 committee itself.\n\nSo after issuing criminal referrals for Trump and others, the January 6 committee released a final report and handed over all its evidence to the Justice Department and the special counsel investigating Trump's efforts to overturn the election. Among the committee's final disclosures was that its star witness, former Trump aide Cassidy Hutchinson, said that her former lawyer advised her not to tell the committee the whole truth.\n\nThe threats posed by House Republicans on so many fronts help explain why many Senate Republicans joined Democrats in December to pass a $1.7 trillion omnibus spending package. That legislation included aid for Ukraine, which many right-wing House Republicans want to block or at least scale back , and changes to the electoral reform act, which governs how presidential elections are finalized and includes changes designed to make it harder for Trump or someone like him to overturn future elections.\n\nSenate Republicans voted for the legislation in the face of furious opposition from their pro-Trump counterparts in the House, perhaps a sign that at least some Senate Republicans no longer fear Trump and his minions.\n\nIn fact, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has become more openly anti-Trump since the midterms, when Trump-backed fringe candidates lost key contests and cost the GOP control of the Senate. While McCarthy was fighting for the speakership in the House this week, McConnell made a move heavy with symbolism: He appeared in Kentucky with Biden to showcase a major federal infrastructure investment in a bridge across the Ohio River.\n\nThe question now is whether Biden can count on a relatively sane Senate to check the worst impulses of the unstable House.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy Must Commit to Government Shutdown Over Raising Debt Ceiling, Says Freedom Caucus Holdout\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nRep. Ralph Norman, a South Carolina Republican, said the debt ceiling fight is a \"non-negotiable item.\"\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy would have to commit to \"shut down the government rather than raise the debt ceiling\" in order to win the support of his opponents, Rep. Ralph Norman, a Republican from South Carolina, told reporters Wednesday afternoon.\n\n\"That's a non-negotiable item,\" said Norman, a leader of the squad objecting to McCarthy, a California Republican, becoming speaker of the House.\n\nA reporter asked Norman if he meant default on the debt, as the debt ceiling and a government shutdown are not directly linked. \"That's why you need to be planning now what agencies - what path you're gonna take now to trim government. Tell the programs you're going to get to this number. And you do that before chairs are picked,\" he said, referring to the process of choosing and installing House committee chairs.\n\nA quirk of parliamentary procedure requires Congress to authorize spending, then appropriate money for those authorized expenditures, and then to authorize the Treasury Department to issue debt in order to pay for that appropriated money. Some constitutional scholars argue that the debt ceiling is unconstitutional, but currently both parties recognize it as a legal and valid restriction on the government's ability to issue debt.\n\nIf the Treasury defaults on its debt, the result could be a global economic crisis, as many companies and foreign governments hold their capital reserves in Treasury notes. If those notes can't be turned into dollars, payments won't be made, producing a cascading collapse of counter-parties that had been expecting those payments, and so on. In 2011, the threat of default downgraded the U.S. government's credit worthiness and led to a major stock market crash, but a deal was struck before the U.S. defaulted.\n\nOriginal reporting.

Democrats declined to take the opportunity to eliminate or raise it further during the lame-duck period when they still controlled the House.\n\nAnother reporter noted to Norman that House Republicans lack the power to dictate those spending terms to Democratic President Joe Biden's White House and a Democratic-controlled Senate, a reality Norman conceded. His band of Freedom Caucus members, however, was willing to use what leverage they had.\n\n\"You play the cards you're dealt,\" he said. \"Biden's gonna veto anything. Can we get a two-thirds vote [to override]? Probably not. But it is what it is. If we do what the American people tell us to do, which is to get this country back on track financially, we will get their support. The insane spending cannot keep up.\"\n\nThe Intercept asked Norman if he thought a potential Speaker Jim Jordan, R-Ohio, whom Norman said he trusts more than McCarthy, would be willing to default on the debt. \"No, he would cut things that have to be cut,\" Norman said. \"Default is only if you keep the spending. We're going to default eventually if we keep going down this path.\" (Jordan did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nAsked what specifically McCarthy had done to lose his trust, Norman said, \"The 14 years he's been here when he's voted for every spending package and this $1.7 trillion omnibus .\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "Republican Freedom Caucus Pushes for New Committee to Investigate the Surveillance State\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nDemocrats fear the committee on \"Weaponization of the Federal Government\" will become a partisan cudgel.\n\nIn the proposed rules package for the new 118th Congress, the Republican Party wants to create a subcommittee to investigate law enforcement and surveillance agencies.\n\nThe pledge to form the new committee on the \"Weaponization of the Federal Government\" is one of the concessions the far-right Freedom Caucus is demanding of Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., in exchange for supporting his bid to become speaker of the House. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., has cited it as a reason to support McCarthy.\n\nFreedom Caucus members routinely rail against the FBI's investigations of President Donald Trump and excessive domestic surveillance. The \"Weaponization of the Federal Government\" committee would give them power to investigate the purported abuses under the auspices of the Judiciary Committee. Freedom Caucus members said they want to model the new body after the Church Committee that ran investigations into intelligence abuses in the mid-1970s, leading to significant reforms.\n\nDemocratic members of the House were quick to condemn the comparison of the \"Weaponization\" subcommittee with the legacy of Sen. Frank Church, the Idaho Democrat who led on intelligence reforms. Rep. Ro Khanna, D-Calif., who lauded the original Church Committee, warned that the rebranded one could be a distraction from passing bipartisan legislation to rein in the very agencies Republicans are probing.\n\n\"To compare these is a total misunderstanding of what the Church Committee did,\" Khanna told The Intercept. \"The question is, if we are going to focus on making sure the government isn't engaged in surveillance, we should be engaged in passing the Internet Bill of Rights and engaged in passing legislation that will prevent that surveillance. I don't want a committee that will start casting political aspersions on law enforcement agencies.\"\n\nThere will be little Democratic buy-in for the panel, according to interviews with minority party members, who cast the committee as one interested merely in embarrassing Democrats. \"I don't think there is any potential merit because it's already tainted,\" said Rep. Raul Grijalva, D-Ariz. \"The preface to this has been all the comments the Republican majority in the House have made relative to the FBI, relative to spying on Trump, relative to going through our mail and conspiracy theories. It's already tainted. It has no value. It's not a Church commission. It's more of a McCarthy commission\" - a reference to the notorious, and notoriously overzealous, investigations into communists run by Sen. Joseph McCarthy in the 1950s.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nThe proposed committee would effectively investigate the \"deep state,\" a term popularized by Trump devotees to refer to machinations of unelected security apparatuses, though the phrase traces its roots to left-wing civil liberties advocates, suggesting at least the potential for some trans-ideological collaboration. Republicans were once closely aligned with the FBI but many turned against the federal law enforcement agency following its investigation into collusion between Russia and Trump's 2020 campaign. In August, dozens of federal agents raided Trump's Mar-a-Lago estate and recovered classified documents taken from the White House. The former president and his supporters in Congress were enraged. In recent months, GOP lawmakers have also called for investigations into the FBI's role in shaping social media discourse around revelations concerning Hunter Biden.\n\nThe outgoing chair of the Rules Committee, Rep. Jim McGovern, D-Mass., echoed the condemnation of comparisons between the new proposed committee and historical reform efforts: \"I think it's insulting to the Church Committee to compare this to that.\"\n\nThe Church Committee oversaw sweeping investigations into agencies with vast surveillance powers including the CIA and FBI. The precursor to the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, the Church Committee, along with its House counterpart the Pike Committee, helped bring to light LSD experiments , propaganda campaigns overseen by the CIA against unwitting U.S. citizens, widespread domestic phone surveillance, and assassination plots against foreign leaders.\n\nDespite Democrats' skepticism toward the \"weaponization\" committee, there are dozens of oversight issues where they could find common cause with Republicans. Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, recently revealed revelations about the FBI's mishandling of hundreds of sexual harassment complaints against employees. In October, The Intercept reported that the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to combat \"disinformation\" could potentially lead to influencing news stories unfavorable to the agency by affecting their distribution.\n\nRep. Lauren Boebert, R-Colo., one of the House GOP members holding out for concessions from McCarthy, refused three attempts for comment, despite her fellow Freedom Caucus members' eagerness to see the committee formed.\n\n\"We've got a lot of oversight to do, and I think there will be a lot of committees involved,\" said Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., one of the most outspoken members challenging McCarthy for concessions. \"This is probably a longer discussion. In the course of a hallway discussion, I'm not sure I can break down the finer points.\" On Tuesday morning, McCarthy said that his opponents had demanded to lead the upcoming committee.\n\nGreene, a Freedom Caucus member friendly to McCarthy's bid, was focused on the sole issue of securing her preferred speaker's leadership position. \"I'm so excited about all those things, but we can't do them until 19 people decide to vote for Kevin McCarthy,\" she said.\n\nRep. Mike Quigley, D-Ill., a long-standing member of the House Intelligence Committee, cast doubt on the prospects for bipartisanship on the \"Weaponization\" committee. \"It's an indication that this isn't going to be about accomplishing anything,\" he said of the Republicans' apparent partisanship. \"I would predict there will be double-digit select committees and special new subs on existing committees. This is all about attacking and going on the offense and very little about what bills are we going to pass.\"\n\nQuigley suggested that the \"Weaponization\" committee would set up a formal structure for the Republican Party's right flank to air its worst conspiratorial views. Quoting the late writer Hunter S. Thompson, Quigley joked, \"When the going gets weird, the weird turn pro.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "How Democrats Paved the Way for Kevin McCarthy's Attack on Ilhan Omar\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nFor years, Republicans made spurious allegations of antisemitism against Rep. Ilhan Omar for her criticisms of Israel - and Democrats joined in.\n\nCongressional Democrats showed an unusually unified front in support of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., as she faced attacks from House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif. As leader of the Republican-controlled House, McCarthy succeeded Thursday in his attempts to strip Omar from her seat on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, where she has been a vocal critic of the war-industrial complex and human rights abuses in which the U.S. has been either a primary actor or a sponsor.\n\nOn Thursday, the House voted on party lines to remove Omar from the committee by a vote of 218 to 211. Despite congressional Democrats' unity, members of the party bear part of the blame for validating McCarthy's broadsides against Omar in the first place.\n\nMcCarthy and his colleagues' attacks on Omar go back to 2019, in her first month in Congress, when he called on Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., then the House speaker, to remove Omar from the Foreign Affairs Committee. McCarthy cited the Minnesota representative's criticisms of Israel's human rights abuses and her support for the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions movement, a Palestinian civil society movement working to build international opposition to Israel's occupation of Palestine.\n\nAt the time, Rep. Lee Zeldin, who was most recently New York's Republican gubernatorial candidate, tweeted that he was disappointed that Omar had also been appointed to a Foreign Affairs subcommittee on oversight and accused her of harboring \"anti-Semitic & anti-Israel hate.\"\n\nShortly afterward, Democrats began to affirm the message from Republicans in their public remarks and congressional letters, laying the groundwork that would set the stage for their most recent salvo: McCarthy's bid to remove Omar from her committee assignments.\n\nSome Democrats, even voting against McCarthy's motion, reportedly continued to justify his actions and rehash old allegations against Omar. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said the vote was about political revenge but that Omar had \"clearly made mistakes\" and used \"anti-Semitic tropes.\"\n\n\"When Democrats were in control of the House, they were often attacking her for the same exact thing and throwing her under the bus when Republicans started criticizing her,\" said Beth Miller, political director of Jewish Voice for Peace Action. \"They have created an environment that shows that they are willing to attack and throw under the bus any member of their own party who calls for Palestinian human rights.\"\n\nMiller, who said she is relieved that Democrats are now supporting Omar, noted that this fight isn't happening in a vacuum. The progressive Jewish American group put out a statement Wednesday connecting the attacks on Omar to attacks on progressives everywhere.\n\nThe GOP, Miller said, is using its power to attack progressives: \"And specifically progressive women of color, because they are effective progressives who are speaking out for Palestinian rights.\"\n\nThe effort to remove Omar based on her criticisms of Israel also comes at a time when Israeli politics are making an unprecedented lurch to the far right and the Jewish state is ramping up its attacks on Palestinians; more than 30 Palestinians have been killed by Israeli security forces so far this year.\n\n\"This circus is happening while the Israeli government is escalating an entirely new phase of state violence against Palestinians,\" Miller said. \"If you actually look at what the Israeli government is doing right now, the mask is off completely.\"\n\n. @SpeakerMcCarthy 's efforts to remove Rep. @Ilhan from the Foreign Affairs Committee is part of the perverse backroom deals he made with the Freedom Caucus to secure his gavel.\n\nWe won't stand for white supremacist efforts to use Islamophobia & racism to silence her.\n\n- Congresswoman Cori Bush (@RepCori) February 1, 2023\n\nThe Democratic pile-on against Omar came just four years ago.\n\nJust over a month after Omar took office as one of the first Muslim women ever elected to Congress, in February 2019, House Democrats swiftly condemned her for a tweet criticizing the relationship between members of Congress and the pro-Israel lobby flagship, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee.\n\n\"It's all about the Benjamins, baby,\" Omar wrote. She clarified that she was referring to AIPAC specifically and later apologized for the tweet.\n\nThe next day, conservative New Jersey Democrat Rep. Josh Gottheimer and then-Rep. Elaine Luria, D-Va., wrote a searing letter to House Democratic leadership that did not mention Omar by name but noted their concern about antisemitic rhetoric in \"reckless statements like those yesterday.\" They called on the caucus to not \"remain silent in the face of hateful speech or actions\" and to \"take swift action\" to address the issue \"by reiterating our rejection of anti-Semitism and our continued support for the State of Israel.\"\n\nIn a statement the same day, House Democratic leaders including Pelosi; Majority Leader Steny Hoyer; D-Md.; Majority Whip James Clyburn, D-S.C.; Assistant Speaker Ben Ray Luján, D-N.M.; Caucus Chair Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y.; and Caucus Vice Chair Katherine Clark, D-Mass., said, \"Omar's use of anti-Semitic tropes and prejudicial accusations about Israel's supporters is deeply offensive.\"\n\nThe House voted on a resolution two days later to condemn antisemitism - a rebuke of Omar - after tacking the measure onto an unrelated resolution on the Saudi war in Yemen.\n\nThe next month, after Omar again raised criticism of the pro-Israel lobby in remarks at a coffee shop in Washington, the House took yet another vote to condemn antisemitism along with Islamophobia and racism in general.\n\nOriginal reporting.

Not a chance, she told him.\n\nOpponents of Rep. Kevin McCarthy's bid for the House speakership are digging in after a tense discussion on the House floor between Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y.\n\nThe pair's conspicuous exchange in the back of the chamber on the first day of the 118th Congress was caught on C-SPAN - and noted by many members in the building. Thanks to Gaetz and his far-right allies, McCarthy, a California Republican, failed to win the speakership on the first round of voting.\n\nGaetz told Ocasio-Cortez that McCarthy has been telling Republicans that he'll be able to cut a deal with Democrats to vote present, enabling him to win a majority of those present and voting, according to Ocasio-Cortez. She told Gaetz that wasn't happening, and also double-checked with Democratic party leadership, confirming there'd be no side deal.\n\nWhat happened here?

Hakeem Jeffries of New York won all 212 of his party's votes, a show of unity that, if it holds, requires McCarthy to win over all but four of his colleagues.\n\nGaetz, who has shown a willingness to break with the GOP establishment, said that his crew of McCarthy opponents was dug in and would continue to resist him, adding that McCarthy has been threatening opponents with loss of committee assignments. A private gathering of Republicans ahead of the vote had been heated, multiple sources said. (Gaetz did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nMcCarthy and Gaetz presented their positions in dueling press conferences Tuesday morning. McCarthy said that Gaetz and his allies had requested plum committee assignments in exchange for supporting his speaker bid. McCarthy also accused Gaetz of telling Republican members that he was willing to elect Jeffries as speaker rather than accede to McCarthy. Gaetz told reporters that he and his allies didn't trust McCarthy.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you.

All 19 McCarthy opponents voted for Jordan in the second round, leaving McCarthy again at 203 votes - 15 short of what he needed.\n\nRep. Paul Gosar , R-Ariz. another McCarthy opponent, also huddled with Ocasio-Cortez in the chamber, where they discussed the possibility of adjourning the House. (Gosar did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nIn the first round, McCarthy won just 203 votes, losing 19 of his colleagues. McCarthy has been insistent on remaining in session, as have his opponents.

The lobbying effort managed to exempt banks the size of Silicon Valley Bank from more stringent regulations, including stress tests aimed at uncovering the type of weaknesses that led to the bank's implosion Friday. Two of the bank's top lobbyists previously served as senior staffers for House Speaker Kevin McCarthy, who himself pushed for the repeal of significant pieces of the landmark Wall Street reform legislation known as Dodd-Frank.\n\nThe meltdown of Silicon Valley Bank represents the second-largest bank collapse in American history and the first since the 2008 financial crisis. Over 90 percent of the bank's deposits exceed the amount federally guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, meaning that those people may either never see their money again or lose substantial amounts.\n\nSilicon Valley Bank President Greg Becker himself pushed for weaker banking regulations, telling Congress to lift \"enhanced prudential standards ... given the low risk profile of our activities,\" as The Lever reported .\n\nA chief culprit, economists say, is legislation President Donald Trump signed into law in 2018, which rolled back key parts of the Dodd-Frank banking regulations passed in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis. That 2018 legislation, called the Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act, passed with strong support from the Republican Party and critical support from some Democrats . Among those leading the charge was McCarthy, then House majority leader.\n\n\"We're going to move this Senate bill directly to the president's desk to ensure these reforms help the economy to grow further by making community banks stronger,\" McCarthy said of the legislation in 2018. \"This is going to free up a great deal of capital and this will help a lot.\"\n\nOriginal reporting.

Mike Enzi, R-Wy.; former Sen. Tom Coburn, R-Okla.; Rep. Joe Courtney, D-Conn.; former Sen. Arlen Specter, D-Pa.; and former Rep. Jay Inslee, now governor of Washington state.\n\nBrian Worth served as coalitions director for McCarthy from January 2011 to May 2014, when McCarthy was House Republican whip. Since March 2017 Worth has been a partner at the Franklin Square Group, where he's worked as a lobbyist for Silicon Valley Bank. Wes McClelland served as a policy adviser and senior policy adviser for McCarthy from April 2011 to September 2015 and joined Franklin Square last January, where he has also lobbied on the bank's behalf.\n\nFranklin Square is the only lobby group that Silicon Valley Bank has used in over a decade and has lobbied on the bank's behalf every year from 2009 to 2023. The only other lobby shops the bank has employed are DLA Piper from 2009 to 2010 and McGuireWoods from 2010 to 2011.\n\nA spokesperson for McCarthy did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nWorth lobbied on the repeal law beginning on October 1, 2017, right up to its passage on May 24, 2018. Then, starting on July 1, 2018, Silicon Valley Bank began lobbying the FDIC - the very same federal agency responsible for insuring bank deposits and was tasked with implementing critical portions of Dodd-Frank.\n\nThough Franklin Square has lobbied on behalf of Silicon Valley Bank since 2009, the 2018 filing represents the first time it had ever lobbied the FDIC.\n\nBeginning on April 20, 2022, McClelland also began lobbying the FDIC for Silicon Valley Bank, which both he and Worth continued right up until the bank's last lobbying filing this year.\n\nThe lobbying disclosures do not provide any more detail about the work. Neither Worth nor McClelland immediately responded to requests for comment.\n\n\"This was a 100 percent avoidable problem,\" economist Dean Baker told The Intercept in an email, pointing to the Dodd-Frank repeal bill. \"That bill raised the asset threshold above which banks have to undergo stress tests from $50 billion to $250 billion. SVB would have been required to undergo regular stress tests before the revision; among the stresses you look at are sharp rises in interest rates, which is apparently what did in SVB. Presumably, if its books had been subject to this test, the risk would have been detected and they would have been required to raise more capital and/or shed deposits.\"\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "That Time Joe Biden Was Banned From Negotiating With Republicans\n\n© THE INTERCEPT\n\nALL RIGHTS RESERVED\n\nBiden negotiating a debt ceiling with Kevin McCarthy was Harry Reid's worst nightmare.\n\nFrom the moment Joe Biden announced his candidacy, the biggest risk the country faced from a potential Biden presidency was that he would wind up in high-stakes negotiations with Republican congressional leaders and those Republicans would fleece him blind.\n\nFor months, Biden insisted that he wouldn't ever be in that room, because he simply wasn't going to negotiate with Republicans over lifting the debt ceiling. But he also poured cold water on invoking the 14th Amendment or minting a trillion-dollar platinum coin, which handed Republicans all the leverage. Biden also had the chance to lift the debt ceiling at any point from January 2021 until last December when Democrats still controlled both houses of Congress. Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., recently told Politico not doing so is one of his biggest regrets.\n\nInstead, Biden went into negotiations with congressional Republicans without a serious offer of his own. He made a few half-hearted suggestions that a better way to cut the deficit is to target hedge fund managers and the superrich. But when Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy objected, he dropped it. Talks continued at the White House between McCarthy and Biden Monday evening. But with Biden now negotiating the size of the cut, Democrats' only hope is that Republicans can't agree and fail to seize the moment.\n\nAll of this is reminiscent of the last time Biden, as vice president, intervened in high-stakes Capitol Hill negotiations. Afterward, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid ordered the White House to never send him down again. He did such a bad job that he got a worse deal out of Minority Leader Mitch McConnell than McConnell had already agreed to give Reid. I covered this moment in my last book, \" We've Got People: From Jesse Jackson to AOC, the End of Big Money and the Rise of a Movement ,\" which was excerpted in The Intercept.\n\nOriginal reporting. Fearless journalism. Delivered to you. Will you take the next step to support our independent journalism by becoming a member of The Intercept?\n\nBy signing up, I agree to receive emails from The Intercept and to the Privacy Policy and Terms of Use .\n\nIt all came at the end of 2012, and the circumstances were similar. President Barack Obama had just stomped Republican Mitt Romney at the polls in a post-Occupy campaign that centered on economic inequality. Democrats picked up two seats in the Senate, expanding their majority to 53 and adding Elizabeth Warren to their ranks. Though Democrats won more House votes nationwide and picked up a net of eight seats, Republicans held onto the House narrowly.\n\nThe major tax cuts pushed through by President George W. Bush were set to expire at the end of 2012, creating what was called a fiscal cliff. If Congress did nothing, taxes would go up on everybody. Reid told me in an interview for \"We've Got People\" that going over the cliff was precisely his plan. Reid said, \"I thought that would have been the best thing to do because the conversation would not have been about raising taxes, which it became, it would have been about lowering taxes.\"\n\nIn other words, let all the rates go up and then bargain with Republicans to reduce taxes just for middle class and poor people. McConnell similarly knew the difficult position going over the cliff would put him in, and in talks with Reid, he agreed to let rates on people making more than $250,000 per year go back up.\n\nReid felt like he had successfully pushed McConnell to the brink; McConnell had a strong sense that Reid intended to go over the cliff and put Republicans up against a wall. It was now Sunday, December 30, 2012, and Democrats only had to hold out until Tuesday to find themselves in a dramatically improved political position, as the dawning of the new year would mean the tax cuts expired and automatically reverted to pre-Bush levels. At that point, it would be Republicans who would be left pleading for rate cuts.\n\nIn desperation, McConnell reached out directly to Vice President Biden, calling him on the phone and explaining that Reid was refusing to be reasonable. Over the course of the day, McConnell and Biden struck a deal. A senior Republican aide told me, \"Biden gave Republicans everything they wanted in exchange for fixing the fiscal cliff problem.\"\n\nJust like today, the fiscal cliff was only a problem because Biden allowed it to be. Reid would have been happy to drive the car off the cliff and then fight it out amid the wreckage.\n\nIn the same way, Biden could have just ignored the debt ceiling, invoked the 14th Amendment, declaring the debt ceiling unconstitutional, and dared Chief Justice John Roberts to blow up the global economy. McCarthy himself would publicly complain but be privately relieved that he had gotten through this moment with his speakership intact. Future presidents would thank Biden. If future Congresses wanted to rein in spending, they could rein in spending. But they could not threaten the global economy to do it.\n\nOn the morning of New Year's Eve back in 2012, Reid was still feeling good about his position, still ignorant of what Biden had given away. Then McConnell took to the Senate floor and announced that he'd been in talks with the vice president, they were progressing well, and he was hopeful that they'd have legislation to move by the end of the day.\n\nAs details of the deal began leaking out, progressive Democratic senators were floored. A large group of them - including Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Jeff Merkley of Oregon, Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island, Al Franken of Minnesota, and Tom Harkin of Iowa - stormed over to Reid's office.\n\nThe deal was awful, they told Reid, and it had to be stopped. Reid told them what had happened, that it was out of his hands and that McConnell had gone around him to Biden. He said he was working on improving it and would be in touch throughout the day.\n\nNone of the senators had any business scheduled - it was New Year's Eve, after all - so Sanders invited them back to his office in the Dirksen building. The Hart building had a popcorn machine, so Harkin asked his staff to bring some by. The crew ended up spending several hours together in Sanders's office, thinking through potential strategies of opposition and waiting to hear from Reid.\n\nInstead, one senator's phone rang, and it was Biden, calling to sell the deal he had cut. In classic Biden fashion, he offered a 10- to 15-minute soliloquy, a meandering argument that largely boiled down to, \"You can trust me; I'm your friend; this is a good deal.\" The senator could barely get a word in before the conversation ended.\n\nMoments after he hung up, another cellphone rang, and it was Biden again. Unaware that the group was all together, Biden proceeded to call each of them, one after the other, delivering the same spiel.\n\nUltimately, it fell to Reid to drag the progressive senators into line. Once it was clear that the White House was on board with Biden's deal and McConnell was all in, that meant that there would be at least 70 or 80 votes for it. The progressive bloc could vote no, but it would only send a message of discord and have no effect on the outcome, Reid told them, coaxing them to support the deal he himself loathed. In the end, all the progressive senators except Harkin voted for the deal. It passed 89-8.\n\nYears later, Reid still regretted how it went down. He told me, \"If we'd have gone over the cliff, we'd have had resources to do a lot of good things in the country - infrastructure development - but it didn't work out that way.\" Letting all the tax rates go back to pre-Bush levels would have yielded the Treasury around $3 trillion over 10 years. Without the deal, taxes on dividend payments to the rich would have been set at 39.6 percent. Under the terms of the deal, they would be set at 20 percent, meaning that the superwealthy would be paying lower tax rates on their passive dividend income than many working people would pay on their wages. It helped fuel the inequality that keeps getting worse and added trillions to the debt at the same time.\n\nNow Biden has another chance to be in the room, and so far, he's getting outmaneuvered by McCarthy.\n\nWAIT!

      "text": "How Kevin McCarthy Set Up His Big Fail 14 Years Ago\n\nJacquelyn Martin/AP\n\nOn April 15, 2009 , Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the California Republican, brought Rep. John Boehner of Ohio, the leader of the House GOP caucus, to a rally in his home town of Bakersfield. It was Tax Day, and in 200 or so cities across the nation, a new political force called the tea party was staging raucous demonstrations. This conservative movement had sprung into existence two months earlier, initially as grassroots opposition to government bailouts enacted to protect the economy after the financial crisis of 2007 and 2008. Yet with the support of right-wing establishment outfits, such as Fox News, the Young Republicans, the Heritage Foundation, and FreedomWorks, it quickly morphed into an angry protest of the new president, Barack Obama, the Democratic-controlled Congress, their economic stimulus plan, and much more.\n\nAt these mad-as-hell events, where suburbanites dressed up in colonial outfits, there was a disturbing element: signs depicting Obama as the bloody-smiling Joker or Hitler. And others: \"Obama Is the Anti-Christ.\" \"The American Taxpayers Are the Jews for Obama's Ovens.\" \"Stand Idly By While Some Kenyan Tries to Destroy America?... Homey Don't Play Dat!!!\" Participants waved Confederate flags. Attendees shared with reporters assorted conspiratorial beliefs that could be summed up in one ominous right-wing fantasy: Obama was a secret Muslim born in Kenya who was in league with shadowy elites and purposefully trying to destroy the nation by increasing the deficit and forcing an economic collapse he could use to impose a totalitarian regime.\n\nThe protesters were a crazy quilt of the right: anti-government advocates, militia people, Christian nationalists, abortion-rights foes, opponents of gun safety measures, libertarians, birthers, social conservatives, and veterans of the so-called Patriots movement of the 1990s. A bit of the old New Right and the Christian right-with even more anger. A central organizing principle appeared to be hatred of Obama and an irrational fear of impending tyranny and doom.\n\nWhen Republican extremists forced McCarthy out of the House speakership on Tuesday, they were following a course that McCarthy himself had set for the GOP this very day. He was steering his party into the waters of far-right radicalism. Years later, he would drown in them.\n\nAt the Bakersfield gathering, McCarthy introduced Boehner, an old-school, country-club conservative, to this new movement propelled by paranoia and extremism. For Boehner, the rally was a wake-up call-or a warning. As journalist Robert Draper later put it, \"Boehner had never seen anything like it-an outcry of anti-Washington vitriol bordering on the elemental-and immediately recognized that he could either board this train or be flattened by it.\" These folks were not looking for the Republicans to legislate. Many tea partiers considered the GOP part of the turncoat establishment that was betraying the nation. They yearned for Republicans willing to wage all-out war against Obama, the commie libs, the corrupt elites, and whoever the hell else was destroying their US of A.\n\nMcCarthy had led Boehner to what looked to be the promised land for the GOP. If Boehner and the Republicans could harness this energy, they could in the coming midterm elections seize control of Congress. To do so, the Republicans would have to accept and encourage foul and conspiratorial currents. That was a price Boehner and McCarthy were willing to pay for power. But doing so would place both men on the path to failure.\n\nAfter the Bakersfield rally, Boehner, McCarthy, and other GOP leaders fully embraced the tea party, despite its extremism and craziness. When Glenn Beck, a Fox host who became an unofficial leader of this movement, railed against Obama, wildly claiming that the president hated white people and was setting up concentration camps for his political enemies as part of his plan to impose a dictatorship, Boehner and other top Republicans appeared on Beck's show and validated him as an important information source for the GOP base. Republican leaders spoke at tea party rallies where protesters held signs with racist and antisemitic slogans. Boehner addressed one crowd that shouted, \"Nazis, Nazis\" at the mention of Democrats, and he echoed the tea party's hyperbolic opposition to Obama's proposed health care plan, calling it \"the greatest threat to freedom I have ever seen.\"\n\nBoehner counseled his fellow Republicans to find ways to court the tea partiers, who were worked up about (nonexistent) \"death panels,\" birtherism, and assorted global conspiracies. After Rep. Bob Inglis, a conservative South Carolina Republican, was defeated in the GOP primary in 2010 by tea party favorite Trey Gowdy, he told me that Boehner's attempt to use the tea party to win the House was perilous: \"It's a dangerous strategy to build conservatism on information and policies that are not credible.\"\n\nMcCarthy was Boehner's wing man on this mission. Boehner assigned McCarthy the task of crafting a \"Pledge to America\" for GOP congressional candidates that would appeal to tea party voters. It called for repealing Obamacare (without proposing a replacement) and slashing federal spending.\n\nThe Boehner-McCarthy plan worked. House Republicans picked up a whopping 64 seats in the 2010 midterms and took control. But there was a rub. Many of the tea party-backed newbies were not interested in legislating. They aimed to disrupt and cause chaos. They precipitated crises, threatening government shutdowns and federal default (by refusing to go along with the routine procedure of raising the debt ceiling). A veteran Republican congressional staffer observed, \"To be sure, like any political party on Earth, the GOP has always had its share of crackpots... But the crackpot outliers of two decades ago have become the vital core today.\" Years later in his memoir, Boehner, looking back on this class of 2010, would say, \"They didn't really want legislative victories. They wanted wedge issues and conspiracies and crusades.\" A chief concern was how their actions played on Fox or on social media. They were, according to Boehner, \"just thinking of how to fundraise off of outrage or how they could get on Hannity that night.\" Their goal was to increase the tribalist toxicity of American politics. And they had been guided into the party by Boehner, McCarthy, and others.\n\nIn the years ahead, the influence of the tea party-ish Republicans within the House GOP caucus grew, and come 2015, Boehner left the speakership before he could be defenestrated by the radicals. (In a 2014 GOP primary contest, a little-known tea party-favored candidate had defeated Rep. Eric Cantor, the No.2 House Republican, after pummeling Cantor for daring to seek a bipartisan agreement on immigration.) When Boehner gave up the gavel, McCarthy expressed his interest in the post, but the House Freedom Caucus-which had been founded by the tea partiers he had helped become House members-opposed McCarthy, and he withdrew his name from consideration. The fellow who won the job, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, had numerous tussles with the extremists and quit in 2018 before the GOP lost the House. McCarthy became something of a speaker-in-waiting.\n\nMeanwhile, the tea party had evolved into Trumpism, and the far-right of the GOP became more extreme, as it embraced Donald Trump, his lies, and his authoritarian impulses and transformed into a cult of personality. (Trump had emerged as a far-right champion by peddling the racist birth conspiracy theory popular among tea partiers.) Responsible and stable governance, respectful discourse, preservation of democratic norms-none of that was a priority. To remain a contender for speaker, McCarthy, after the Trump-incited January 6 insurrectionist riot, had to continue to ally himself with Trump and endorse his Big Lie that the 2020 election had been stolen from him. That meant McCarthy was striving to lead a party predicated on falsehoods and conspiracism that backed a demagogue who had tried to mount a coup and overturn an American election.\n\nAfter the Republicans barely won the House in 2022, McCarthy got what he craved. But he was now the head of a political party rooted in lies, violence, and chaos. Worse, to gain the speakership, he had cut a deal with the most extreme members of the GOP caucus-the sort of Republicans he had welcomed into the party in 2010-and he handed them control of his fate. No one who hopes to govern reasonably can have a lifeline attached to a Trump extremist, such as Rep. Matt Gaetz.\n\nThe tale of Kevin McCarthy is no Greek tragedy. His departure from the third-highest position in the US government was not a sad day for America. It was confirmation of one of the world's oldest platitudes: You reap what you sow. In this case, 14 years ago, McCarthy exploited an eruption of far-right grievance, paranoia, racism, and irrationality. With this move, he and Boehner succeeded in gaining political control but further corrupted the soul of the party (Newt Gingrich, Sarah Palin, and others had earlier encouraged extremism within the party). A straight line runs from the tea party to Trump. And just as the tea party Republicans chased Boehner out of the speakership, the Trumpiest Republicans of today devoured McCarthy, who long ago had opened the gates to this extremism.\n\nIt took over a decade for the cynical calculations of his past to catch up to McCarthy. But with his support of the tea party and, then, Trump he bolstered the conditions that yielded his ruin. He helped turn the Republican Party into a threat to American democracy. It's fitting that he became a victim of his own creation.\n\nPortions of this article were drawn from David Corn's American Psychosis: A Historical Investigation of How the Republican Party Went Crazy , which was recently released in an expanded paperback version.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy Ousted as House Speaker\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) talks to reporters at the Capitol in Washington, Tuesday, Oct. 3, 2023, after Rep. Matt Gaetz filed a motion to oust McCarthy from his leadership role. J. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nIn January, a small faction of right-wing House Republicans relented in their efforts to sink Rep. Kevin McCarthy's bid to become House speaker. Their support came at a price.\n\nAmong several concessions, McCarthy (R-Calif.) agreed to lower the number of Republican members required to initiate the process to oust him from the speakership from five members to one . On Monday night, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) signaled to McCarthy that it was time to pay his bill. The metaphorical invoice came in the form of what the House calls a \"motion to vacate\" that passed by a narrow majority, 216-210, on Tuesday afternoon. Eight Republicans and all Democrats present voted to remove McCarthy.\n\nThe unprecedented events at the Capitol marked the first time in more than 100 years that the House has held a vote on whether to remove a House speaker-and the first time in history that such a vote has led to a speaker actually being removed.\n\nGaetz-who is being investigated by a House Ethics Committee for possible sexual misconduct, potential campaign finance violations, and more-has been threatening to introduce the resolution to fire McCarthy from his leadership role for months. McCarthy working with Democrats and centrist Republicans to pass a bill temporarily funding the government for 45 days on Saturday was the final nail in the coffin; McCarthy's hard-right flank had insisted on across-the-board spending cuts and anti-immigration provisions that would never have survived a Democratic majority in the Senate. With time running out, McCarthy chose to sideline his radical colleagues in order to advance a workable bill and avoid a shutdown that would have furloughed more than a million government employees and frozen billions in disaster recovery efforts, among other things.\n\nHouse Democrats evidently did not think McCarthy's compromise on the temporary government funding bill was enough for them to help him save his gavel. After all, McCarthy had visited former President Donald Trump at Mar-a-Lago just weeks after Trump encouraged his supporters to march to the Capitol while the 2020 election was being certified. McCarthy would later try to discredit the House committee that investigated the resulting January 6 insurrection, refusing to comply with a subpoena and labeling its work \"illegitimate.\"\n\n\"Given their unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism in an authentic and comprehensive manner,\" House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) wrote to his caucus ahead of the motion-to-vacate vote, \"House Democratic leadership will vote yes on the pending Republican motion to vacate the chair.\"\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) argued that it wasn't Democrats' job to intercede on McCarthy's behalf, regardless of McCarthy's actions during the spending fight. \"The Speaker of the House is chosen by the Majority Party,\" she wrote on social media. \"In this Congress, it is the responsibility of House Republicans to choose a nominee & elect the Speaker on the Floor. At this time there is no justification for a departure from this tradition.\"\n\nIn a futile attempt to save McCarthy before the final vote, Rep. Tom Cole (R-Okla.) introduced a motion earlier Tuesday afternoon to table Gaetz's resolution. That vote failed by a 218-208 margin; all present Democrats and 11 hard-line Republicans voted against that effort save McCarthy's speakership.\n\nIt is not clear who will replace McCarthy as House speaker. It will be difficult, if not impossible, for the House to advance legislation in the interim.\n\nMeanwhile, the House and Senate only have until mid-November to pass a longer-term spending package, when the looming shutdown that McCarthy helped temporarily avoid-ultimately at the cost of his gavel-will appear on the horizon once more.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "We're Living in a Kevin McCarthy Doom Loop\n\nJim Lo Scalzo/EFE/ZUMA\n\nFor the second time in three days, a group of far-right House Republicans on Thursday blew up a short-term plan to fund the government, setting fire to efforts to avoid a government shutdown at the month's end.\n\n\"This is a whole new concept of individuals that just want to burn the whole place down,\" House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told reporters after failing once again to advance a spending bill. \"That doesn't work.\"\n\nAnyone who has paid even the smallest attention to McCarthy's leadership, which itself only emerged after a series of historic humiliations and deals with the Big Lie's worst offenders , is unlikely to sympathize. In fact, the top Republican is far more familiar with extremists intent on burning down the government than he lets on, having already caved to these very individuals on multiple occasions. The apotheosis of such self-serving capitulation came earlier this month when McCarthy, under pressure from these hardline Republicans, launched an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden despite clearly lacking the evidence to do so .\n\nBut if McCarthy believed that ordering an impeachment inquiry would satisfy the Matt Gaetz's of the party, they quickly dispelled that magical thinking. \"The impeachment inquiry is right,\" Rep. Bob Good (R-Virginia) told NBC News . Good is one of several Republicans to threaten that even a meritless impeachment inquiry would fail to satisfy them. \"That has absolutely nothing to do with the spending battle,\" he said. \"We can do both at the same time.\"\n\nMcCarthy is one of a few lawmakers who remained in D.C. this weekend to work on a short-term fix . And as of this Sunday writing, six days out from a looming government shutdown, no progress has been made. Perhaps a more productive exercise would be for the speaker to read my colleague Tim Murphy, who explains how a career of bankrupt morals and shameless groveling turned him into one of the most ineffective leaders in recent memory.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy Will Devastate Poor Americans in Order to Win Over the Far-Right\n\nJ. Scott Applewhite/AP\n\nFive days out from an increasingly likely government shutdown , House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) is once again demonstrating a willingness-if not a downright enthusiasm-to cave to the demands of far-right members of his caucus.\n\nThe Washington Post reports on the latest from the spending negotiations, with McCarthy now embracing steep cuts to a slew of safety net programs that provide food assistance for children, veteran housing benefits, and home heating assistance. It's an astonishing proposal that also includes a potential 80 percent cut in funding for low-income schools, as well as the slashing of funding for food assistance for poor pregnant mothers. The list represents yet another attempt to placate the very people McCarthy himself accused last week of being behind a \"whole new concept of individuals that just want to burn things down. \" (As I said this weekend, the assertion is laughable; McCarthy is far more familiar with these people than he lets on.)\n\nWill these latest concessions convince his fractured party to play ball? Who knows. Even if McCarthy succeeds in flipping the far-right, his plans are dead on arrival at the Senate and White House, proving that the top Republican is unserious about avoiding a shutdown. But regardless of how negotiations shake out, it's McCarthy's eagerness to screw over some of the most vulnerable people in society that shouldn't be forgotten. For all the talk of a new GOP, Republicans are pushing for the same thing as usual: cutting programs that help poor people.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Why Are Republicans Like This?\n\nInae Oh November 16, 2023\n\nMarkwayne Mullin and Kevin McCarthy, two brawling members of Congress this week. Tom Williams\n\nI watch the news for a living and come across moments of political dysfunction at a regular clip.\n\nSo, I was not shocked to learn that Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), who until last month was second in the presidential line of succession, shoved a congressman in a \"clean shot to the kidneys.\" Nor was I particularly outraged to learn that on the same day across the Capitol, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, the Oklahoma Republican, challenged a union leader to a brawl, only to later go on Fox News and claim more members of Congress should normalize physical fights in order to maintain \"respect\" for the institution.\n\nThe episodes this week, equal parts reprehensible and dumb, were not aberrations on the right, where viral shitposting has effectively replaced public service. As I started to eye-roll the latest fisticuffs out of my brain, I recalled a 2019 conversation my colleague Tim Murphy had with Yale historian Joanne Freeman , an expert on congressional violence during the antebellum era. After January 6, I had been wondering how we should separate the performance of violence from the real thing, and what is risked when weaponized incompetence replaces enforcement of the most basic rules.  I called Freeman to learn more. The following interview is edited for length and clarity.\n\nWhat was your initial reaction to the Kevin McCarthy and Markwayne Mullin incidents?\n\nMy initial thought, as a historian who's spent a lot of time focused on physical violence in Congress in the 19th century, was that this sort of thing happens in the modern Congress every now and again but what happened yesterday, all in one day, felt to me like a really obvious indication of the fact that the Republican Party is not a party right now.\n\nBecause if there was a functional party there, they would impose some discipline. They would have some kind of shared purpose or cause that would be keeping people in line and cooperating.\n\nLashing out happens from time to time. Maybe not as publicly or as often as it's happening right now. But still, some of what we're seeing now is explicitly because there are no brakes on the Republican Party. There are people who are extreme and are pushing things in an extreme direction. And others aren't really saying very much about what's going on. In some cases, silence is compliance.\n\nLet's talk about lawmakers like Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), people who frequently invoke violence and name-calling against their perceived opponents. What do they suggest about Congress in 2023?\n\nLooking back in time, the violence and the threats that happened in the 1830s, 40s, and 50s mostly came from Southerners who were willing to do or say anything to protect the institution of slavery. They didn't necessarily care about the rules. What that meant was you had a group of people who were willing to engage in this violent bullying mode of politics. Not only were they not called to account for it but some of their constituents cheered them on for it.\n\nOn the other hand, you had mostly Northerners sometimes who did not like that kind of behavior-who very often after a bad incident, would [invoke] the rules. Now, strikingly, that's what Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) did yesterday-when Mullin seemingly took his wedding ring off, stood up, and was ready to engage in a fistfight.\n\nRight now, there's not a lot of respect, particularly on the right, for the institution of Congress. Republicans don't seem to be allowed to cooperate, to compromise, to do anything in league with the other side.\n\nMullin was later on Fox News where he invoked Andrew Jackson and the history of \" caning \" in the Senate to suggest that more members of Congress should normalize this behavior. What do you think of that?\n\nThere were so many aspects of yesterday that hit me over the head as a historian and that was one of them. In the days of dueling, the argument among those who approved of it echoed what Mullin asserted: That if people are afraid they are going to get shot for what they say, then they're going to be careful of what they say. Once you had the Civil War, and the Southerners came back to Congress, many of them assumed that they would march right back in and behave that way again. But Northerners, having won that war, you saw them stepping in and saying: We're a different kind of country now. We don't operate that way anymore. That's not acceptable.\n\nAnother interesting thing that Sen. Mullin said is that his constituents want him to behave this way. There was a member of Congress named Henry Wise , a great opponent of John Quincy Adams and a supporter of slavery from Virginia. Wise got involved in more fights than anyone else and [Mullins' argument] was essentially his argument too. In the same way that Mullin supposedly removed his wedding ring, Henry Wise would roll up his sleeves and get ready to fight at any given moment.\n\nHenry Wise\n\nLibrary of Congress\n\nAt some point, someone said to him: You should be ashamed of yourself. Your constituents should just boot you out . His response, and I'm paraphrasing, was something like: Go ahead, throw me out because you know what my constituents put me here to do that. They put me here to fight in whatever way I need to fight for their rights.\n\nHenry Wise was reelected six times. So he was right; there was an audience and support from Southerners for that kind of behavior.\n\nIn any other working environment, you would be fired for this type of behavior. It's crazy to me that Congress lacks similar rules.\n\nWell, they have the rules. They're just not enforced.\n\nExactly.\n\nThere's such a long history of people in government behaving in corrupt and inappropriate ways and having absolutely no accountability for that. What's happening now is in part because of social media. We see these moments that spread very quickly. There was a similar moment in the late 1840s and early 1850s with the telegraph, when suddenly the entire nation could learn something that happened in Congress within 45 minutes without congressional spin. Suddenly, members of Congress realized that whatever they did, it was going to go out into the world and that they couldn't control it.\n\nThe telegraph meant that whatever happened in Congress became national property very quickly, and that scrambled democratic politics very quickly. We are very much living in a similar moment. Democratic politics relies on communication between the people and those in government, so any form of technology that scrambles that kind of conversation scrambles democracy.\n\nOne thing that struck me reading your conversation with my colleague Tim Murphy from a few years ago is the idea that, for the most part, people in government making these types of threats don't truly want to inflict real harm. Has your opinion on that changed since January 6?\n\nI still believe that most of the goals around this type of behavior, both today and in the period I write about, are not to be violent. It's to frighten people off. To silence them and force them into compliance. As long as the threat is credible, you don't necessarily have to be violent to have an impact.  We are living in such a moment of crisis of accountability, in which no one wants to be held accountable for anything. You have election denial. You have people who feel free to be able to say anything. One of the core components of a democracy is that people with power are held accountable for the ways they use that power. That's why free and fair elections and voting rights are core elements of a functioning democracy, and we're watching them get eroded.\n\nHow do we separate the performance of violence from actual physical violence?\n\nIt's hard to do. Some of this is and always has been performative, even in the period that I have written about. Back then, they did what they did, and then behind the scenes, they would try and talk things out. The problem right now is you don't get the sense that there's a lot of behind-the-scenes going on.\n\nHenry Wise at one point threatened John Quincy Adams during a debate by telling him, \"If you weren't who you are, you would feel more than the force of my words.\" (Adams in his diary later wrote, \"So Wise, just threatened to kill me!\") But apparently, not long after Wise's threat, he personally walked over to Adams and asked if they could talk it out. So clearly, some of that was obviously performance to both members of Congress and performance to the public. But right now, I'm not sure that the line is so obvious.\n\nAll of this-especially with anti-abortion extremists in government and a new speaker who believes in covenant marriage -feels plagued by masculinity and machismo.\n\nIt's all about manhood and power. The brute force, chest-beating, and threat-tossing. That's part of what we're seeing.\n\nThe other part of what we're seeing is that we are in a moment when the people who have power want to keep power and do not respect the rights of people who are not like them. When other people gain power-whether it's demographically or democratically-they see it as an attack. It doesn't represent more people having rights. It represents them losing what they feel that they deserve. They feel so absolutely entitled to power and they behave in a way that is manly, that allows them to pose as strong.\n\nBut it's fundamentally a posture of fear and weakness.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

After days of negotiations and 14 failed ballots-the most since 1860 -Republican Kevin McCarthy was officially elected speaker of the House early Saturday morning. In exchange for the necessary votes to get him elected, the congressman had to beg, barter, and plead with a group of hardline Republicans who held out for a litany of concessions.\n\nSince Wednesday , McCarthy and his supporters have been negotiating with several far-right GOPers, including some who have been implicated in Donald Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election, as my colleague Dan Friedman previously reported . House members like Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), Rep.

      "text": "Santos Fundraiser Indicted for Impersonating Top Aide to Kevin McCarthy\n\nRep. George Santos (R-N.Y.) attends an April rally outside New York criminal court on the day of former President Donald Trump's first arraignment. Lev Radin/AP\n\nSam Miele, a fundraiser for Rep. George Santos' (R-N.Y.) 2020 and 2022 campaigns, has been indicted in federal court for impersonating then-Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's former chief of staff while soliciting donations for Santos.\n\nThe indictment , which was unsealed Wednesday, charges Miele with four counts of wire fraud and one count of aggravated identity theft. It states that in 2021 Miele falsely impersonated a high-ranking aide to a member of Congress as part of a scheme to raise money for Santos, who is referred to as \"Candidate #1.\" As CNBC reported earlier this year, that person was Dan Meyer, who worked at the time as chief of staff for the current House Speaker.\n\nMiele pleaded not guilty Wednesday and was released on $150,000 bond. Miele's attorney, Kevin Marino, said in a statement that his client \"looks forward to complete vindication at trial as soon as possible.\"\n\nMiele, who is 27, was a novice in the world of political fundraising. He is a relatively insignificant target on his own, but the indictment signals that the investigation into Santos, who was indicted in May for other alleged schemes, is likely not over.\n\nThe May indictment largely sidestepped Santos' campaign finance practices. As Mother Jones has reported , many of the top donors to Santos' 2020 campaign do not appear to exist. A relative told me they did not make the contribution attributed to them during the most recent campaign. Both are potential violations of federal campaign finance law.\n\nAs part of the identity theft scheme, Miele allegedly created a fake email address that included Meyer's first initial and last name and signed emails with Meyer's full name and title. Miele also impersonated Meyer during phone calls. He is accused of soliciting money from more than a dozen people while pretending to be McCarthy's chief of staff. The donors he tried to con are not named in the indictment.\n\nMiele received a 15 percent commission on donations he brought in. The Santos campaign paid him or his LLC, the One57 Group, more than $90,000 over the course of the two campaigns, according to federal records.\n\nMcCarthy's staff reportedly learned Miele was impersonating their boss in August 2021. Miele wound up getting fired by the Santos campaign and received his last payment in January 2022.\n\nIn September 2022, Miele wrote a letter to Santos in which he admitted to what he'd done. By way of an explanation, he wrote that he was, \"high risk, high reward in everything I do.\"\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "What GOP Lawmakers Were Up to Today: Shoving, Chasing, and Threatening to Brawl\n\nTom Williams/AP\n\nAs House Speaker Mike Johnson makes progress in his first test to avoid a government shutdown, his predecessor, the historically humiliating Kevin McCarthy , is being accused of shoving a fellow congressman in a \"clean shot to the kidneys.\"\n\nThe alleged altercation, as witnessed by an NPR reporter, sparked a chaotic chase down the halls of Congress on Tuesday, with McCarthy's target, Tenessee Rep. Tim Burchett, one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy from the speakership last month, reportedly shouting at the former speaker that he has no \"guts.\"\n\nHave NEVER seen this on Capitol Hill:\n\nWhile talking to @RepTimBurchett after the GOP conference meeting, former @SpeakerMcCarthy walked by with his detail and McCarthy shoved Burchett. Burchett lunged towards me. I thought it was a joke, it was not. And a chase ensued...\n\n- Claudia Grisales (@cgrisales) November 14, 2023\n\n\"He is a bully with $17 million and a security detail,\" Burchett told CNN. \"He is the type of guy that when you are a kid, he would throw a rock over the fence and run home to hide behind his mama's skirt.\"\n\nThe incident, exceedingly juvenile and yet shocking, is the latest entry into Congress' workplace hostilities -conflicts that would surely, in nearly all other professional environments, prompt swift dismissals. But even for Congress, a body of government that continues to tolerate the likes of Marjorie Taylor Greene, physical altercations like the one involving McCarthy and Burchett are relatively rare. (McCarthy has since denied that it was intentional. You can read Grisales' account above and judge for yourself.) Yet, they're emblematic of a larger rot plaguing Congress thanks in part to lawmakers-overwhelmingly Republicans-who shitpost with abandon and take to CrossFit videos to rail against policies they don't support. Consider that McCarthy's incident wasn't even the only violent threat on the Hill today.\n\n\"This is a time, this is a place. We can be two consenting adults. We can finish it here,\" Sen. Markwayne Mullin, a former mixed martial arts fighter, told Teamsters president Sean O'Brien at a Senate hearing, in what appeared to be a challenge to a physical fight.\n\n\"You want to do it now? Stand your butt up then,\" Mullin continued before Sen. Bernie Sanders interrupted, reminding Mullin that he was a US senator.\n\nSen.

And much of these antics go back to lawmakers believing that their constituents want to see their elected officials threatening violence, which certainly resonates in our Trumpian times.

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy Is Fundraising Off Trump's Indictment Lies\n\nAlex Brandon/AP\n\nThere is no better representative of the moral slide of the Republican Party in the Trump years than House Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nThis congressman from California, as the ranking House Republican, excoriated Donald Trump after the January 6 insurrectionist assault on the Capitol, declaring that Trump \"bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters.\" He also declared at that time that Joe Biden had won the 2020 election, challenging Trump's false and dangerous claim that victory had been stolen from him by an evil cabal of Democrats, the media, and Deep State schemers. Yet soon after-when it became obvious that the GOP base was sticking with Trump despite (or because of) his lies and incitement of violence-McCarthy scurried to Mar-a-Lago and made nice with Trump. Ever since he has been another GOP Trump zombie, offering excuses for and defending the now twice-indicted former president who leads the polls in the 2024 GOP presidential race.\n\nOne reason-perhaps the paramount reason-that McCarthy bent the knee was that he realized a tussle with Trump would harm GOP fundraising efforts. With Trump maintaining a magnetic hold on many GOP voters and low-dollar donors, disavowal of Trump from the Republican establishment would likely prompt a Trump retaliation that would cause a sharp decline in contributions to various Republican organs. So McCarthy cowardly dropped all talk of Trump and January 6 and kept the spigot open. His pursuit of the speaker's gavel led to greater groveling, as he looked to win the support of MAGA Republicans, most of all, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), the promoter of assorted bonkers conspiracy theories who once amplified a call to assassinate Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi and who last year spoke at a white nationalist conference led by an admitted fan of Hitler.\n\nSo it should come as no surprise that this week McCarthy is fundraising off Trump's 37-count felony indictment on federal charges of retaining classified material, obstructing justice, and lying to investigators.\n\nIn an email soliciting donations for his own campaign fund, McCarthy proclaimed Tuesday a \"dark day in the United States\" and repeated Trump's lies about the case. He huffed, \"It was unconscionable of President Joe Biden to INDICT the leading candidate opposing him as he himself kept classified documents for DECADES.\"\n\nThis was Trumpish BS. It was not Biden who indicted Trump; it was a grand jury of Florida citizens. And as countless legal experts have pointed out, there is no comparison between Biden's retention of documents and the Trump case. Biden, for instance, turned over a handful of classified documents once they were found in his vice presidential papers and did not try to block government efforts to retrieve them, as Trump did.\n\nMcCarthy was particularly wrong to suggest that Biden held on to secret documents for decades. Biden left the vice presidency only six years ago. McCarthy was apparently referencing one of Trump's main lies these days about Biden. Trump has repeatedly stated that Biden is hiding 1850 boxes of his papers. These are records from his 36-year-long career as a US senator. But they are not hidden. They are archived at the University of Delaware, and the FBI has conducted at least two searches of the material looking for classified records. So far, according to public reports, no classified documents have been found. Moreover, congressional records are not part of the system of classified records maintained by the executive branch. Senators and representatives own the papers from their stints in Congress and can do whatever they want with them after they leave office. Yet in the right-wing echo chamber, a favorite talking point is that Biden has been sitting on nearly 2000 boxes of classified material for decades.\n\nMcCarthy knows that is not true. Just as he knows it was absurd for him to defend Trump's storage of boxes with classified documents in a bathroom at Mar-a-Lago: \"A bathroom door locks.\" Yes, the second-in-line to the commander-in-chief said this.\n\nIn his fundraising email, McCarthy lays it on thick: \"Every American who believes in the rule of law should stand with President Trump against this grave injustice. You may be sitting at home wishing that you could do something. I understand the feeling-but I am also here to tell you that there IS something that you can do.\"\n\nSo what is it that you folks at home can do? You can send McCarthy money.\n\nThat's not exactly how he puts in the note. Instead, he tells recipients: \"We need every patriot reading this message to GO ON THE RECORD to defend the ideals that make this country great. Take 2 minutes to add your name to stand with House Republicans to END the witch hunts against President Trump.\" This makes it seem as if McCarthy is asking Trump supporters to sign a petition declaring their disgust. And there's a big button: \"ADD YOUR NAME.\"\n\nYet if someone clicks on that, he or she is transported to a page requesting a contribution to McCarthy's campaign committee. You have to read the fine print to know this money is going to McCarthy. There is no way to \"add your name\" without making a donation.\n\nOn Wednesday, Trump's campaign announced that it had raised $6.6 million since news of his federal indictment broke. As always, Trump has been able to profit off his perfidy (or alleged perfidy). And McCarthy and other Republicans want in on this gold rush. This is a reminder that the GOP stands with Trump for the money. The party's base is an important source of campaign cash, and it has been radicalized over the past few decades and, most recently, Trumpified.\n\nThe GOP establishment cannot break with the Trumpsters. That would be bad for business. For McCarthy, the federal indictment of Trump is not a serious matter to ponder and discuss responsibly. It is a craven opportunity to echo Trump's disinformation in order to fatten his own campaign's bank account.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy Is Cutting Deals With the Big Lie's Worst Offenders\n\nKevin McCarthy won support Friday from Rep. Ralph Norman, who on Jan. 17, 2021, urged Trump to invoke \"Marshall Law.\" Andrew Harnik/AP\n\nHouse Republicans are celebrating the anniversary of the January 6 attack by making it clear that they are not, in actual practice, against it.\n\nWould-be House Speaker Kevin McCarthy spent Friday morning and preceding days hurling concessions at some of the same far-right members of Congress who helped Donald Trump incite the riot and tried to overturn a democratic election. After a dozen ballots, McCarthy's genuflecting finally won him support from House Freedom Caucus chair Scott Perry (R-Pa.). Perry, as my colleague David Corn points out , is known for his central role in a scheme to have the Justice Department falsely claim to have found evidence supporting Trump's election fraud lies. That effort is the subject of an especially robust part of the sprawling DOJ criminal investigation that includes FBI agents searching Perry's phone. The scandal does not seem to have affected Perry's position as a power broker in the House GOP. Exactly what concessions McCarthy offered to win over Perry and his allies remains to be detailed. But an agreement by the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC linked to McCarthy, to refrain from opposing hard-right candidates in open GOP primaries may have smoothed the path to Perry's reversal.\n\nMcCarthy on Friday also won over Rep. Paul Gosar (R-Ariz.), who-along with Rep. Andy Biggs (R-Ariz.), former Rep. Mo Brooks (R-Ala.) and Stop the Steal maestro Ali Alexander-\" schemed up ,\" in Alexander's words, a plan to put \"maximum pressure on Congress while they were voting\" on certifications of the presidential election on January 6. McCarthy had already agreed to restore to Gosar committee seats he lost in 2021 after participating in a white nationalist conference and posting an animated video that showed him killing Democratic Rep. Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez. McCarthy likewise had vowed to restore the committee postings of QAnon-friendly Rep. Majorie Taylor Greene. Greene had previously been booted from her committees over outlandish rhetoric, like saying Jewish space lasers cause wildfires. Unlike Perry and Gosar, Greene has been a vocal McCarthy backer since the midterm elections.\n\nAnother holdout who joined McCarthy's camp Friday was Rep. Ralph Norman (R-S.C.). Following the January 6 attack, Norman urged Trump to impose \"Marshall law\" to stop Joe Biden from taking office. Also supporting McCarthy on all the votes this week: Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), who is expected to become House Judiciary Committee chairman. Jordan, who received 20 votes for speaker from McCarthy foes on Tuesday, helped Trump plot his self-coup attempt and has never explained phone calls he exchanged with Trump on January 6.\n\nMcCarthy's litany of concessions to his party's far-right includes a vow to gut the House Ethics Committee. Last month, the House January 6 committee asked the Ethics Committee to investigate Jordan, Perry, Biggs, and McCarthy himself for refusing to comply with subpoenas from the panel.\n\nRegardless of their stance on McCarthy, the GOP members who sought to overturn the 2020 election remain largely unrepentant. Few have acknowledged that Trump attempted a coup, or that supporting his effort was a mistake. They face little pressure to do so. The coercion runs the other way.\n\nMcCarthy himself joined in voting to throw out the Electoral College results, even after the insurrection. He said , days after the attack, that Trump \"bears responsibility for [the] attack on Congress by mob rioters.\" But he quickly retreated from that clarity to appease his party's right flank. He similarly backed the idea of a bipartisan commission to investigate January 6, but he then reversed course and worked to undermine the committee that then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi eventually established. He helped oust former Rep. Liz Cheney from GOP leadership-and eventually from the House itself-as retribution for her insistence on holding Trump accountable for January 6.\n\nThe Republican meltdown this week follows years of GOP dysfunction caused by relying on the votes of radical members opposed to governing. But the party's failure to coherently oppose January 6 and Trump's coup attempt is no a mere continuation of a trend. It is a new nadir.\n\nThe fact that this failure has continued into 2023 is especially notable because it is clearly against Republicans' collective self-interest. GOP devotion to the Big Lie is one reason the Republican majority is so narrow. And the narrowness of that majority is, in turn, the reason why the party's most vocal Big Lie proponents have been able to hold their party leadership hostage this week. The insurrectionist wing is exploiting a problem it helped cause. McCarthy probably knows this better than anyone, but he is appeasing them anyway.\n\nMcCarthy clearly calculated that his personal ambition required him to cleave to Trump, despite the ex-president's recent call for the \"termination\" of constitutional provisions preventing him from being illegally re-installed as president. This is the prevailing position of members of the House GOP caucus. The majority surely know that the party has been hurt politically by its loyalty to Trump and the Big Lie lost-causers. But many of their districts and short-term interests give them cause to avoid getting out ahead of any effort to quit the crazies. They can score points by opposing it. Republicans have a world-historic collective action problem.\n\nThat requires leadership to overcome-leadership they aren't getting.\n\nOn Friday morning, as House members gathered to mark the two-year anniversary of January 6, only one GOP member, Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (Pa.), was there. The rest were on a conference call regarding the speaker fight. Read into that what you will. But the symbolism matters less than actual repudiation. Supporting American democracy means choosing to back its rules when you lose. Republicans, two years after January 6, remain beholden to the Big Lie and its tellers. Priorities are revealed in actions. By such standards, House Republicans are still siding with the people who stormed the Capitol and with the former president who incited them. The call is coming from inside the House.\n\nSubscribe to the Mother Jones Daily to have our top stories delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nBy signing up, you agree to our privacy policy and terms of use , and to receive messages from Mother Jones and our partners.\n\nMother Jones was founded to do journalism differently.

Everyone seemed to be ready to forget that the last of \"The Young Guns\"-the moniker once adopted by McCarthy along with fellow failed Republican leaders Paul Ryan and Eric Cantor-had ridden out of town. McCarthy says he plans \"to serve America in new ways.\" In reality, McCarthy is serving McCarthy, shamelessly setting himself up for what most observers expect will be a new career as an influence peddler, er, lobbyist .\n\nBut McCarthy's departure was notable for one amusing, and politically significant reason. With the end of his tenure as the representative from California's 20th Congressional District, McCarthy-in what appears to be a fit of pique-screwed over the House Republican Caucus that he had led until his unceremonious removal from the speakership last fall. By choosing to quit at the end of 2023, McCarthy took with him the one thing he had to offer his fellow partisans: protection for their rapidly dwindling majority.\n\nWith the expulsion of New York Representative George Santos on December 1 of last year, the Republicans were left with a four-seat cushion in the House-one of the narrowest majorities in the chamber's history. And Republicans knew that majority was going to get even narrower, as Ohio Representative Bill Johnson had indicated months ago that he would be resigning early in 2024 to take up a lucrative position as president of Youngstown State University.\n\nWith McCarthy's kiss-off to the caucus, and with Johnson's planned exit on January 21, Republicans will be left with a nail-bitingly narrow 219-213 majority-meaning that, if just two Republican representatives fail to show up for a party-line vote, or if they reject the party whip for whatever reason, the Democrats could get the upper hand.\n\nPractically, what this means is that House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and his fractious caucus, find themselves in a historically precarious position as Congress prepares to take up a wide range of contentious domestic and foreign policy issues-including the question of whether the federal government will literally shut down. It's true that special elections that will be held in coming months could build out the GOP majority a bit. But that's not guaranteed; indeed, Santos's seat could very well flip to the Democrats.\n\nThere's simply no question that the GOP's circumstance in the House has been made worse by McCarthy's decision to put his personal bitterness ahead of party loyalty.\n\nHow much worse?\n\nFlorida Representative Matt Gaetz , McCarthy's archnemesis, answered that question in a series of social-media posts and interviews where he ripped the former speaker-whose ouster Gaetz helped facilitate-for creating a \"very real math problem\" for a caucus that is struggling to function. \"His unwillingness to stay and vote for even the most basic Republican priorities until the end of his term may imperil our ability to get the job done,\" complained Gaetz .\n\n\"This is not an act of patriotism or moving on to the next fight,\" argued Gaetz. \"It is an act of abject selfishness. And it is revealing that, if Kevin McCarthy can't swing the gavel and be in charge and make the decisions, then he's not willing to be a team player.\"\n\nSo infuriated was the Florida Republican that he even suggested that former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) was a more honorable politician than McCarthy.\n\n\"Nancy Pelosi, for all of her flaws, and they are many, she at least stuck around,\" said Gaetz. \"She didn't hurt her team by saying, 'Well, if I can't be the quarterback, I'm just going to take the ball and go home.'\"\n\nWhen Kevin McCarthy has Matt Gaetz saying nice things about Nancy Pelosi, you can rest assured that the former speaker has done his caucus some serious damage.\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Activate your online access\n\nThe former House speaker is currently spouting a wildly inaccurate take on the history of American empire.\n\nKevin McCarthy used his brief tenure as speaker of the US House of Representatives to wage a culture war against what he decried as \"woke indoctrination in our schools.\" Borrowing a page from Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and other right-wing firebrands, the Republican speaker went out of his way to attack critical race theory and the honest teaching of American history.\n\nMcCarthy is no longer second in the presidential line of succession, but the former speaker is still trying to replace facts with fantasy.\n\nOn Sunday, McCarthy posted a video of himself explaining that \"in every single war that America has fought, we have never asked for land afterward-except for enough to bury the Americans who gave the ultimate sacrifice for freedom.\"\n\nA crowd of fans applauded the assertion, which undoubtedly fit their right-wing worldview. The problem, of course, was that they were applauding a claim that-even by the diminished standards for veracity associated with House Republicans-was wildly inaccurate.\n\nThe United States, which took its current form via a \"westward expansion\" that displaced native peoples from coast to coast, has a very long record of making postwar land claims. The Revolutionary War was settled with the 1783 Treaty of Paris in which, according to the US Department of State, the United States \"succeeded in obtaining Newfoundland fishing rights [and] a western border that extended to the Mississippi River with rights of navigation.\" Ensuing centuries would see the US take control of Puerto Rico, Guam, and, for a time, the Philippines.\n\nBut the war-related land claim that McCarthy should be most familiar with is closer to home. The House district he represents is in California, a state that was a part of Mexico until the US invaded and took it.\n\nThe US-Mexico War of the mid-1840s, which was launched amid a barrage of lies from President James K. Polk, ultimately seized a vast stretch of northern Mexico in an imperialist land grab so blatant that abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison said \"every lover of Freedom and humanity\" should oppose it. Among the many critics of the war was a one-term US representative from Illinois named Abraham Lincoln, who with other members of the former Whig Party decried it as a crude scheme by Polk-a Tennessean who has been aptly described by the White House Historical Association as \"a profit-hungry slave owner\"-to expand slavery into newly conquered territories. Henry Clay, one of McCarthy's predecessors as speaker of the House, declared, \"This is not a war of defense, but one of unnecessary and offensive aggression.\" A US Army lieutenant in the war, Ulysses S. Grant, would observe years after its conclusion that, \"For myself, I was bitterly opposed to the measure, and to this day regard the war, which resulted, as one of the most unjust ever waged by a stronger against a weaker nation.\"\n\nA young writer from Concord, Mass., was so horrified by the invasion of Mexico that he refused to pay war taxes. After being arrested and jailed for his protest, Henry David Thoreau wrote \"Civil Disobedience,\" the broadly influential essay in which he declared that \"when a sixth of the population of a nation, which has undertaken to be the refuge of liberty, are slaves, and a whole country [Mexico] is unjustly overrun and conquered by a foreign army, and subjected to military law, I think that it is not too soon for honest men to rebel and revolutionize.\"\n\nMcCarthy may not have read Thoreau quite as closely as did Mahatma Gandhi or the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. But he might at least have recognized that, in the Golden State's Kern County, which he has represented for decades in the state legislature and the US Congress, President Polk's war of conquest made vast swaths of land that had been on the northern cusp of Mexico-including Ranchos Los Alamos Y Agua Caliente, Rancho El Tejon, and Rancho Castac -a part of the new American state of California.\n\nBut, of course, he didn't. That has inspired a flurry of offers from American historians who are prepared to give him a refresher course, including Columbia University professor Karl Jacoby, who said Monday, \"Wanted to thank ex-speaker McCarthy for reassuring me that Americans needs my forthcoming book on the U.S.-México War.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

But not the man he once called \"My Kevin.\" Even as the former House speaker slinks out of Congress in humiliation this month, his leadership doomed by his attempts to kowtow to both Trump and the anti-Trumpers in his caucus, Kevin McCarthy says he'll be voting for the ex-president next year. It's just a formality: While McCarthy stayed technically neutral while he was speaker, he embraced Trump at every opportunity. But on CBS News Sunday Morning he formally endorsed him, and he even said he'd take a Trump cabinet role \"if I'm the best person for the job.\" Let Liz Cheney, Mitt Romney, and Adam Kinzinger leave Congress with their self-respect intact. I guess since McCarthy long ago learned to live without his, he can imagine working under Trump's thumb. Two other guys whose leadership was ruined by Trump, former House speakers John Boehner and Paul Ryan, wasted no time distancing themselves from the man who's now calling himself a \"day one\" dictator. (Ryan was recently further humiliated by Trump, when he was caught publicly lobbying a Wisconsin ally, Representative Mike Gallagher, to endorse Nikki Haley only to have Gallagher quickly back Trump.) Let McCarthy's willingness to serve Trump stand as another example of what we're likely to see in a second Trump term. As all of those articles warning that Trump would assume dictatorial rule made clear over the last week, one big reason Trump's power would likely go unchecked is that he'd fill his administration with DC lackeys.

That was arguably the most eloquent thing Gaetz has done in his frontal assault on House Speaker Kevin McCarthy: Even after the math in Tuesday's vote on his motion worked to Gaetz's advantage, with a 216-210 floor vote to remove McCarthy, there's far from a clear path to maneuver the GOP majority into recruiting a McCarthy successor, and getting the business of governance at least notionally on track. Now that a grand total of eight GOP lawmakers have managed to unseat the most powerful Republican leader in Washington, the only sure thing is that Republicans can't really count on anything.\n\nAs the House recovers from the mayhem of the budget accord that sparked the outrage of Gaetz and other hard-right members, an even greater surge of chaos may be in store. The GOP's narrow five-vote majority means that a small faction of lawmakers on either side of the aisle can theoretically designate a new speaker. But what happens then, and who emerges from all the entropy reasonably intact, is anyone's guess.\n\nThe House Democratic caucus, which is marginally smaller but infinitely more disciplined, stood firm against any deal that would have saved McCarthy's chair. Any such arrangement was always a long shot, given McCarthy's own record of badgering and baiting the loyal opposition; even after his caucus dithered through budget negotiations and brought the government to the precipice of a shutdown, McCarthy still baselessly and arrogantly blamed the Democrats for nearly triggering a shutdown. That's on top of a long litany of McCarthy provocations, from his spineless approval of a trio of House impeachment probes targeting President Biden amid his intra-caucus shutdown negotiations to his shameful pandering to Trump after the failed coup of January 6 once he realized his short-lived repudiation of the MAGA insurrection entailed a modicum of actual courage. It was thus no surprise that House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries circulated a statement prior to this afternoon's vote declaring that \"it is...the responsibility of the GOP members to end the House Republican Civil War. Given their unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism in an authentic and comprehensive manner, House Democratic leadership will vote yes on the pending Republican Resolution to Vacate the Chair.\"\n\nWith a Republican majority determined to make the most of its own self-inflicted ideological wounds, the Democrats mostly just have to stand aside-and they had strong political incentive to do so, on the cusp of an election cycle where it behooves them to depict Republicans as a party of extremist dysfunction. \"Democrats default toward the cult of the savvy, but unless there's a clear strategic play, Democrats should not 'save' a figure whom they rightly despise for issues of both ideology and character,\" says Jeff Hauser, head of the Revolving Door Project, an executive watchdog group, \"Could there be an even worse Republican who achieves 218 votes? Maybe! But Democrats should fight for their own party to control Congress and force the nominal moderates of the Republican Party to choose between Speakers McCarthy, Scalise, etc-and Jeffries. Vindicating the myth that McCarthy is meaningfully better than Gaetz undermines every single Democrat seeking to unseat a Republican who is not a member of the Freedom Caucus.\"\n\nWith all the preexisting bad blood in the Democrats' dealings with McCarthy, there was never a strong likelihood that the Democratic leadership would reach a substantive deal to preserve the speaker's gavel. For one thing, McCarthy's speakership became embattled because he made a series of spending deals with Democrats; any further agreement to, say, drop the farcical Biden impeachment initiatives in three House committees would simply plunge him into greater MAGA disrepute. For another, McCarthy would have been hard-pressed to muster his fractious, ideologically rigid caucus behind any such arrangement. \"What deal can McCarthy make that doesn't undermine his authority in his own party?\" asks Matthew N. Green, Catholic University political science professor and former house Democratic aide.\n\nFrom the moment when a motion to table Gaetz's resolution was narrowly voted down, the Republican caucus was in a new political world, where no clear agenda, leadership alliance, or legislative path forward could gain traction. As California GOP representative and McCarthy loyalist Mike Garcia said during the debate prior to the motion-to-vacate vote, the anti-McCarthy faction was \"running with scissors,\" in pursuit of an objective only known to them-if that.\n\nIn the wake of McCarthy's ouster, don't look for any semblance of regular order to emerge any time soon. \"One dynamic that could occur is they vote to vacate the chair, and the Republicans would be facing a period of time without a speaker,\" says Norman Ornstein, senior fellow emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute. \"Which would actually be more productive than a period of time with McCarthy as speaker.\"\n\nOne major unresolved issue that could fall to the spread of anarchy in the GOP caucus is funding for the war in Ukraine, which McCarthy stripped out of the final continuing resolution he got passed at the verge of a government shutdown. McCarthy \"had a deal, as best I can tell, with the Democrats that there will be a separate vote on Ukraine,\" Ornstein says. \"A new speaker wouldn't be bound by that deal.\"\n\nMcCarthy could still conceivably mount a bid to regain his post-but like his 15-vote crucible to gain the speakership in January, it would entail still more capitulation to a hard-right faction of his caucus that is determined to be as performatively destructive as possible. The core problem the GOP faces doesn't have to do with finding an ideal-type leader; it has to do with a caucus that's ideologically committed to being ungovernable. \"The same ones who held out for 15 ballots to get McCarthy his speakership to begin with are the ones who hold the balance of power now,\" Ornstein notes. \"They could vacate, go back to the conference and get McCarthy to make even more ridiculous concessions.\"\n\nYet that's pretty much the same tactical playbook that's produced McCarthy's dismissal-and it was always the likeliest outcome of his foundational deal with the hard right to win the speakership, which included the procedural rule that became his downfall. \"McCarthy put himself in this impossible position where just one member could do a motion to vacate,\" Ornstein says. \"McCarthy gave up everything in order to get the speakership, and now the chickens have come home to roost.\"\n\nThe appeasement-first approach has also yielded decidedly diminishing returns for McCarthy and the GOP caucus alike. \"Rank-and-file Republicans don't want to work with the Democrats, they don't want more liberal legislation,\" Green says. \"At the same time, though, McCarthy brought them a continuing resolution that had all these red-meat spending cuts in it, and Republicans still voted no.\"\n\nBut such policy reckonings count for little in the MAGA GOP's scrum for congressional power. As North Dakota GOP Representative Kelly Armstrong ruefully noted in one of the last pro-McCarthy speeches prior to the vote, the old incentive structure of conservative governance no longer exists. \"We have descended to a place where clicks, TV hits, and the never-ending quest for the most mediocre taste of celebrity drives decisions and encourages juvenile behavior,\" he said. Reviewing McCarthy's record of backing core right-wing bills and spending priorities, Armstrong further noted that the speaker's policy legacy failed to register among Gaetz and his allies for one simple reason: \"That doesn't deliver to his opponents what they crave most: attention.\" The GOP insurgents now have plenty of that-and like most of the other recent chapters in Republican power-brokerage, it promises to be yet another object illustration of the old cautionary adage, \"Be careful what you wish for.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts.

But an impasse over spending legislation may trigger a shutdown.\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy gestures towards the newly installed nameplate at his office after being sworn in as speaker of the 118th Congress in Washington in January 2023.\n\nAs Congress reconvened this this week after its six-week summer recess, the House GOP majority is nearing maximal conditions of chaos. The primary order of business on its agenda is to reach a deal to continue funding the government by the end of the month-yet many Republican House members are only interested in exploiting that deadline as leverage to initiate ill-specified impeachment hearings against President Joe Biden, continue tantrum-throwing probes of the president's son Hunter, and implement draconian and xenophobic \"border security\" measures. In other words, the House GOP caucus is eager to barter away its mandate to govern with a semblance of adult responsibility for the privilege of transforming the Capitol into a rolling spectacle of inquisitorial culture warfare.\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy, being Kevin McCarthy, has already started to hew to this harebrained agenda, granting a provisional go-ahead to three House committees to launch vibes-based impeachment inquiries against President Biden. (How threadbare is the case that hard-right members of the GOP caucus are looking to compile against Biden? Well, this threadbare: South Carolina Representative Nancy Mace confessed to CNN's Kaitlan Collins that the pending impeachment inquiries won't be tasked with scrutinizing existing evidence, but rather will try \" to get more evidence \"-a backward-spooling model of legal process that the terms \"fishing expedition\" and \"kangaroo court\" were coined to describe.)\n\nWeary followers of the House's escapades may recall that a preliminary version of this guignol took place a mere three months ago, when McCarthy cobbled together a deal to prevent the country's spending deficit from blowing by its arbitrary debt-ceiling limits. But the pending budget drama will play out on a different order of magnitude, since a failed spending deal would spark a full-scale government shutdown. As McCarthy well knows, prior shutdown crises played a major role in derailing the speakerships of his predecessors Newt Gingrich, John Boehner, and Paul Ryan. And House members clustered around the smash-and-grab Freedom Caucus know just as well that the threat of a shutdown is a golden opportunity to extract still more concessions from the epically invertebrate McCarthy.\n\n\"Kevin McCarthy has less spine than all the previous Republican speakers put together,\" says Norman Ornstein, senior fellow emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute. In dealing with the rabid impeach-and-see-what-happens Freedom Caucusers, McCarthy is in a no-win bind, Ornstein argues: \"There's nothing he can do that's going to get them to be fearful of him or respectful of him. He's put himself in a box, where he's tried to dance around things like a shutdown and the debt-ceiling issue. But it's like throwing a pack of rabid, vicious, hungry dogs whatever bone you can find, which in this case is the impeachment inquiry.\"\n\nFormer GOP insiders concur. \"Once he won the speaker fight, even if the most irrational, insane, and performative boobs in the caucus were aligned against him, he had the leash,\" says Tim Miller, communications director for the 2016 Jeb Bush campaign. But, Miller notes, the perverse calculus of power in today's GOP is that the more you let actual governing that occurs on your watch, the more you're treated as a traitor to the sacred cause of tearing shit down: \"The more of those deals you do over the objections of the MAGA side of the caucus, the more vulnerable you become.\"\n\nTo compound the perverse logic here, McCarthy knows that courting a shutdown would likely spell doom for his narrow five-seat House majority come the next election cycle. \"The debt-ceiling thing, voters don't really vote on things like this,\" Miller notes. \"To the extent that there's an image there, it's more about the vibe: You can explain it to them in a way that makes it seem rational that we should be making some spending cuts. But a government shutdown is a totally different thing.\" Hard-right representatives \"are not even trying to make an argument that would appeal to the median voter. They're nihilists. And as we've seen with Boehner and Gingrich, Republicans are going to have to hold the bag on a shutdown. They become the gang that couldn't shoot straight.\"\n\nThat's no deterrent for the true-believing members of the Freedom Caucus, who all hail from deep red districts, many of them gerrymandered by Republican state legislatures for the precise purpose of insulating their representatives from any meaningful accountability for their actions. \"A lot of these people on the MAGA right want to destroy government; they would be delighted with a shutdown,\" Ornstein says. \"Some of this mindset reminds me of the George W. Bush administration and the occupation of Iraq. They all said then that 'when we bring down Saddam, we'll have a flourishing democratic government that will be free,' which was of course total nonsense. And what the MAGA right says now is that if we can blow up government, people will taste freedom and will not go back. So the willingness to go through an extended shutdown is there.\"\n\nAll of which leaves McCarthy pretty much in the same position he was in January, when he realized his cherished career ambition to be House Speaker in a crushing marathon of 15 caucus votes, with the restive nihilists in the Freedom Caucus securing concession after concession. One key giveaway was the poison pillf known as a motion to vacate-a procedure that permits a single House member to challenge McCarthy's speakership at any time. That threat is a professional sword of Damocles, wielded by some of the most obstreperous and demented characters imaginable. Even before Congress returned, bomb-throwing hard-right Florida Representative Matt Gaetz had been canvassing Democratic House members to back a prospective challenge to McCarthy's speakership.\n\nStill, Gaetz's challenge is unlikely to gain traction for the same reason that McCarthy prevailed in the Freedom Caucus hazing over his initial speaker vote: No one else could plausibly stomach the job of leading the House Republican caucus. \"You can't beat somebody with nobody,\" Miller says. Maybe if [House Judiciary Chairman] Jim Jordan decided if he was going to stand, that could be a credible threat, but he won't. So until and unless that changes, they don't have anybody to beat him with. And McCarthy has shown he'll bend over backward to appease the most insane members of his caucus.\"\n\nThanks to the dual logic of insular gerrymandering and unhinged Kulturkamp confrontation, the insane House nihilists will keep driving the GOP agenda. Miller relates how The Bulwark -the Never Trump publication he now writes for-has conducted focus groups among MAGA voters that have highlighted a grassroots drive to create ever greater levels of performative chaos in the halls of Congress. \"You ask them, and you know, for a governor, they want someone who can actually govern. But when MAGA voters are discussing their House representatives, they want to know why they can't be more like Marjorie Taylor Greene. When it comes to Congress, what MAGA voters want is burning the house down-targeting the perceived excesses of liberalism and the deep state. That's always the focus.\" With that as a de facto mandate, it's no surprise that it takes someone of Kevin McCarthy's unsightly quisling temperament to serve as the GOP's notional legislative leader. \"This is not a political party anymore,\" Ornstein flatly says. \"It's a radical cult, and it's ungovernable.\"\n\nThe chaos and cruelty of the Trump administration reaches new lows each week.\n\nTrump's catastrophic \"Liberation Day\" has wreaked havoc on the world economy and set up yet another constitutional crisis at home. Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

Can our contestant withstand the procedural hazings engineered by the House Freedom Caucus ? Will he strike a provisional blow for decorum over the \" let's all look at a naked Hunter Biden \" faction? And in our next episode: Is he going to get the keys to Doc Brown's time machine and schedule votes to expunge Donald Trump's two impeachments in the 116th and 117th Congresses? McCarthy's most recent dilemma arises from his noncommittal posture in the pending 2024 GOP presidential primaries-which is to say, from a position of insufficient fealty to Trump, who was reportedly enraged at the news that McCarthy wasn't tendering him a rapid and adoring endorsement. Indefatigable quisling that he is, McCarthy walked back some critical comments about Trump's candidacy-and then further sought to placate the tantrum-prone Caligulan party leader with an alleged pledge to get the expungement votes before the House. McCarthy now denies that he reached any such agreement with the former president, but that scarcely matters. Every time the speaker plays at asserting something like independence from Trump, he is ritually humiliated into submission. The basic narrative was established in the immediate aftermath of the failed January 6 coup, when McCarthy briefly indicated he might support a censure of Trump for trying to break the American political system in order to establish himself as permanent MAGA dictator. That flirtation with principle cost McCarthy dearly; he was summoned to Mar-a-Lago to abase himself before Trump. Ever since, McCarthy's been a stooge and sycophant-so much so that he now says he supports the expungement of Trump's January 6 impeachment, during which he'd originally instructed his caucus members to vote their conscience, on the transparently laughable grounds that the proceedings transpired on \"the basis of no due process.\" (Apparently worried that this sound bite hadn't been sufficiently steeped in MAGA epistemology, McCarthy also called for Trump's first impeachment-for using military aid to extort a Hunter Biden conspiracy narrative from Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy-to be cleared because it \"was not based on true facts.\") All of which to say that McCarthy's version of voting one's conscience is to bend to the prevailing winds of Trumpian power, wherever they may lead. The political press reports that the speaker actually wants to sidestep expungement votes to help save the seats of more moderate members of his majority who represent districts that might lean Democratic. In reality, though, McCarthy's leadership quandary is another empty spectacle that is of a piece with the GOP's broader political plight, as the party seems to be coasting toward the nomination of an arraigned criminal awaiting at least two more reckonings with the justice system. Trump's stranglehold on the GOP base makes it impossible to create any conditions for long-term governance-or anything like a coalition for a new GOP majority.

Trump has transformed the entire Republican Party into a rolling hustle, and the way to wield power and influence within it is always to play along. \"Donald Trump doesn't like being called 'twice impeached,' when the media people he pretends not to watch on cable say that about him,\" says Tim Miller, the former communications director for Jeb Bush's 2016 presidential campaign. So the expungement measures-which are unprecedented, and likely moot in view of the fact that the Senate voted to acquit Trump both times he was impeached-are simply exercises \"in Trump ego-stroking, trying to make him feel better, and coddling him,\" Miller adds. The alleged agons of McCarthy are but a subset of that mandate. \"I think McCarthy's being confronted with this partially from his past crimes-'crimes' being in quotation marks-against MAGA,\" Miller says. \"It's also just part of the deal he made with Trump in order to get the speakership. If Trump had turned on him, he wouldn't have been the speaker. There are certain things Trump doesn't care about, like the debt-ceiling negotiations. He doesn't care enough about things like that to take McCarthy down over them. So that means in certain areas McCarthy can operate freely, while in other respects he has to do what Trump says.\" Miller also notes that the bid to obtain a get-out-of-impeachment-free vote for the former president is a familiar sort of MO for House Republican leaders. \"I just think that there are a lot of privileged guys who had their permanent records expunged in high school, so they now think they can expunge Trump's permanent record from January 6.\" You could call McCarthy's deal with the MAGA power elite a Faustian bargain-except that Faust was a tragically divided figure in search of ultimate knowledge, while Kevin McCarthy is, to put things generously, a moral nullity. Even his ballyhooed debt deal soon plunged him into fresh rounds of recriminations from the Trumpified Freedom Caucus, who effectively shut down Congress for a good stretch of June in protest. Meanwhile, the party that McCarthy ostensibly helps to lead just continues to do its crime-boss leader's bidding on autopilot. \"We've gone from 2020 election denial to a broader reality denial,\" says William Kristol, the former chief of staff for Dan Quayle and former editor of The Weekly Standard . \"Which I suppose was inevitable.\"\n\nMcCarthy's most recent dilemma arises from his noncommittal posture in the pending 2024 GOP presidential primaries-which is to say, from a position of insufficient fealty to Trump, who was reportedly enraged at the news that McCarthy wasn't tendering him a rapid and adoring endorsement.

Plainclothes officers continue to abduct university students off the streets. So-called \"enemy aliens\" are flown abroad to a mega prison against the orders of the courts. And Signalgate promises to be the first of many incompetence scandals that expose the brutal violence at the core of the American empire.\n\nAt a time when elite universities, powerful law firms, and influential media outlets are capitulating to Trump's intimidation, The Nation is more determined than ever before to hold the powerful to account.\n\nIn just the last month, we've published reporting on how Trump outsources his mass deportation agenda to other countries, exposed the administration's appeal to obscure laws to carry out its repressive agenda, and amplified the voices of brave student activists targeted by universities.\n\nWe also continue to tell the stories of those who fight back against Trump and Musk, whether on the streets in growing protest movements, in town halls across the country, or in critical state elections-like Wisconsin's recent state Supreme Court race-that provide a model for resisting Trumpism and prove that Musk can't buy our democracy.\n\nThis is the journalism that matters in 2025.

But he did, by passing a 45-day continuing resolution with the same contours as one that had overwhelming support in the Senate, except for one thing: It zeroed out aid to Ukraine, at least this time around. Whoever's idea that was, it was pretty smart. Even staunch Democratic backers of Ukraine support weren't going to shut down the government for it. And they didn't. McCarthy's maneuver passed the House with 91 votes against it-and 90 of them were Republicans'. The lone Democrat, Mike Quigley of Illinois, chairs the Ukraine caucus and represents a district with a lot of Ukrainian immigrants. Democrats declared victory, since what they passed contained none of the cruel domestic budget cuts and draconian border measures McCarthy had tried to push through on Friday. In a press conference following the vote, McCarthy claimed victory too, saying he didn't want to make the military work without pay because Congress couldn't get its act together. He also chided reporters: \"I'm sure every bet you had was that the government would shut down. I don't know how many times you're gonna count us out.\" He peppered his remarks with barbs and even insults about the gathered media. More From Joan Walsh A Trump Baby Boom?

First, he slammed President Biden: \"Our president never once talked to any of us during this challenge of the government shutting down\"-adding nonsensically, \"He has been to more dinners with Hunter Biden's business partners than he has to the border,\" and later falsely claiming the president got $3 million for it. \"House Democrats showed zero leadership,\" GOP conference chair Elise Stefanik added with a straight face, after more Democrats than Republicans voted for the stopgap bill. McCarthy got even more brazen with Face the Nation 's Margaret Brennan on Sunday morning: \"I wasn't sure it was gonna pass. You know why? Because the Democrats tried to do everything they can not to let it pass.\" An exasperated Brennan couldn't let that pass: \"Democrats were the ones who voted for this!\" That seems especially stupid because McCarthy is almost certain to need Democratic support again soon, to survive Representative Matt Gaetz's promised attempt to topple him as speaker. McCarthy himself agreed to a House rules change that lets a sole member move to \"vacate\" the speaker in order to get the job. Gaetz has repeatedly threatened to do that-but this time reporting suggests he'll make good on the threat. McCarthy's lies about them didn't sit well with Democrats.

It's hard to imagine how Democrats would find a way to support him. Sure, they can try to exact concessions from him-that he drop demands for harsh domestic budget cuts in next month's shutdown showdown, or halt the House's impeachment inquiry into Biden. But why would anyone trust him? He reneged on the deal he made with congressional Democrats and the White House in raising the debt ceiling just last May. Biden nodded to that history in his remarks after the vote. \"We should never have been in this position in the first place. Just a few months ago, Speaker McCarthy and I reached a budget agreement to avoid precisely this type of manufactured crisis,\" Biden said. \"House Republicans tried to walk away from that deal by demanding drastic cuts that would have been devastating for millions of Americans.

Moderate House Democrats could buoy McCarthy without voting for him, by merely voting present, or skipping the vote altogether, which would lower the threshold he'd need to keep his job.

He repeated it on Friday. McCarthy never gives up, all right-never gives up on trying to placate the wing nuts in the GOP caucus, in order to hold on to his office at the expense of the country. The shutdown is almost certain to begin at midnight Saturday night. Even nihilist Newt Gingrich, the GOP House speaker who triggered the 1995 shutdown after President Clinton wouldn't let him leave Air Force One via the front steps, called this one \"nuts.\" Roughly 1,000 news cycles ago, I wrote about McCarthy's desperate cynicism after he suddenly changed his mind about impeaching President Joe Biden. Only a few news cycles earlier, McCarthy said the House would have to vote to authorize an impeachment inquiry. Suddenly, he was authorizing it himself, but everybody knew he was doing it as a sop to the wing nuts, hoping he'd get some help on avoiding a shutdown. But he knew even when he did it that it wouldn't work. As I said about McCarthy at the time: \"His eyes looked dead. He took no questions, and turned on his heels to face the flags behind him. Maybe he already saw that it wouldn't be enough to appease his most determined haters.\" Related Article Americans Have Already Lived Through a Shutdown Chris Lehmann Indeed, Florida Man Matt Gaetz immediately said it wasn't enough and claimed he would move to oust McCarthy from the chair. That was two weeks ago, and he still hasn't so moved. First of all, there's no one to take McCarthy's place. Also, Gaetz loves to watch McCarthy squirm. He's like a sadistic bully boy pulling the wings off flies. Nevertheless, McCarthy continues to try to placate, if not Gaetz-they seem to openly hate each other now-his lunatic-fringe allies. But it cannot be done. Gaetz and friends said they'd never support a continuing resolution to give Congress a few more weeks to negotiate. So McCarthy spent all week pretending to try to pass individual budget bills, but that didn't work either. On Thursday, the House Oversight Committee held its first impeachment hearing, which the doomed speaker had authorized. It went really well: One of the GOP's lead witnesses, Kenneth Starr stooge (and George Washington University law professor) Jonathan Turley, admitted that he hadn't seen evidence that would justify impeachment. California Democratic Representative Robert Garcia, who came prepared with big posters of Ivanka and Jared Kushner (as long as we're talking about grifting presidential children), told CNN that Republicans entered a \"freak out\" mode because Turley was one of their \"star witnesses.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Want to Understand the New Cold War?

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Current Issue View our current issue Great work, My Kevin. On Friday, after the Senate passed a compromise continuing resolution to keep the government open, with less disaster relief and aid to Ukraine than its majority or Biden wanted, McCarthy finally put a continuing resolution of his own on the floor, defying Gaetz. But it was larded with ugly domestic budget cuts, and no Democrats supported it. Sadly for McCarthy, his moderate members did-but it failed nonetheless when the Gaetz caucus rejected it. So if you're keeping score at home, McCarthy put his moderate members at risk -by moderate, I mean they're in districts Biden won in 2020, so they've got to be a little less crazy-to appease the nihilist caucus, who didn't vote for the cruel CR anyway. These moderates, by the way, almost to a person voted for McCarthy as speaker on the first ballot. For all that Gaetz was heralded as the gatekeeper when McCarthy won on the 15th ballot, remember that after all that wrangling and all that animosity, Gaetz merely voted \"present,\" shaving the number My Kevin would need to prevail by one. Prevail he did, but at what cost? To the country, and to his soul? A mighty big one. W hile progressives debated whether to panic about President Joe Biden's poll numbers this week (I'm still firmly in the \"don't panic\" camp), the actually disturbing poll results had to do with the shutdown. A Monmouth University poll said Americans were evenly divided on which party deserves blame for it, which is delusional. Every shutdown for in modern history has been triggered by the GOP, this one included. Maybe that's because the media has covered it poorly? That happens. Maybe it's a Democratic messaging issue. That happens, too. Whatever your analysis, Biden shifted things, a bit, when he reminded the media that McCarthy was reneging on the agreement he made with Biden at the end of May to avert breaching the debt ceiling. \"We made a deal,\" Biden said, emphasizing that he negotiated directly with McCarthy. \"Now they come along and say...we didn't mean it.\" The GOP wing nut caucus didn't like it at the time, but neither did the House Progressive Caucus, many of whose members voted against it. That's the nature of compromise, which I accept even if I don't like the details. He followed it up with a series of tweets (I'll never call that hellsite X), including this one: If the government shuts down, that means members of our U.S. military are going to be on duty, unpaid. There's no reason for us to be in this position. Just a few months ago we reached a bipartisan budget agreement on spending. We shook hands. Now, they're reneging on the deal. -President Biden (@POTUS) September 26, 2023 I'm not saying Biden's remarks changed the terms of the debate-but I can't say they didn't. On Thursday, Politico 's Playbook had this analysis: \"Speaker Kevin McCarthy's choice to go back on the deal he made with the president is about to plunge the federal government into chaos.\" \"Biden has a point here,\" MSNBC's Sahil Kapur told anchors later that day. It's the only way Democrats should frame this destructive stalemate. McCarthy is still bleating that Biden should meet with him. And I'm still watching cable news reporters ask House Democrats what they can do to rescue My Kevin. To a person, including moderates and conservatives, they say something to the effect of \"nuh-uh, not ever happening.\" As well they should. In fact, Democrats should strive in this crisis and beyond, whatever beyond is, to oust McCarthy. My poor Kevin could end this at any time by going to House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, who kept his caucus together through those 15 grueling January votes, and making a reasonable deal. The Senate has already agreed to less than the debt-ceiling deal even provided. Again, there's an easy compromise that could even survive if Gaetz and his fellow bullies and principled progressives voted against it. But he's not doing that. Now he's trying one last, last dodge, with one last vote, sometime late Friday: He told reporters that any House Republicans who oppose it are \"siding with Biden.\" I don't think any of them are dumb enough-and some are really dumb-to believe it.\n\nThe shutdown is almost certain to begin at midnight Saturday night.

Books & the Arts / Brett Christophers This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame This Executive Order Reveals the Trump-Musk Endgame Elie Mystal Current Issue View our current issue Great work, My Kevin. On Friday, after the Senate passed a compromise continuing resolution to keep the government open, with less disaster relief and aid to Ukraine than its majority or Biden wanted, McCarthy finally put a continuing resolution of his own on the floor, defying Gaetz. But it was larded with ugly domestic budget cuts, and no Democrats supported it. Sadly for McCarthy, his moderate members did-but it failed nonetheless when the Gaetz caucus rejected it. So if you're keeping score at home, McCarthy put his moderate members at risk -by moderate, I mean they're in districts Biden won in 2020, so they've got to be a little less crazy-to appease the nihilist caucus, who didn't vote for the cruel CR anyway. These moderates, by the way, almost to a person voted for McCarthy as speaker on the first ballot. For all that Gaetz was heralded as the gatekeeper when McCarthy won on the 15th ballot, remember that after all that wrangling and all that animosity, Gaetz merely voted \"present,\" shaving the number My Kevin would need to prevail by one. Prevail he did, but at what cost? To the country, and to his soul? A mighty big one. W hile progressives debated whether to panic about President Joe Biden's poll numbers this week (I'm still firmly in the \"don't panic\" camp), the actually disturbing poll results had to do with the shutdown. A Monmouth University poll said Americans were evenly divided on which party deserves blame for it, which is delusional. Every shutdown for in modern history has been triggered by the GOP, this one included. Maybe that's because the media has covered it poorly? That happens. Maybe it's a Democratic messaging issue. That happens, too. Whatever your analysis, Biden shifted things, a bit, when he reminded the media that McCarthy was reneging on the agreement he made with Biden at the end of May to avert breaching the debt ceiling. \"We made a deal,\" Biden said, emphasizing that he negotiated directly with McCarthy. \"Now they come along and say...we didn't mean it.\" The GOP wing nut caucus didn't like it at the time, but neither did the House Progressive Caucus, many of whose members voted against it. That's the nature of compromise, which I accept even if I don't like the details. He followed it up with a series of tweets (I'll never call that hellsite X), including this one: If the government shuts down, that means members of our U.S. military are going to be on duty, unpaid. There's no reason for us to be in this position. Just a few months ago we reached a bipartisan budget agreement on spending. We shook hands. Now, they're reneging on the deal. -President Biden (@POTUS) September 26, 2023 I'm not saying Biden's remarks changed the terms of the debate-but I can't say they didn't. On Thursday, Politico 's Playbook had this analysis: \"Speaker Kevin McCarthy's choice to go back on the deal he made with the president is about to plunge the federal government into chaos.\" \"Biden has a point here,\" MSNBC's Sahil Kapur told anchors later that day. It's the only way Democrats should frame this destructive stalemate. McCarthy is still bleating that Biden should meet with him. And I'm still watching cable news reporters ask House Democrats what they can do to rescue My Kevin. To a person, including moderates and conservatives, they say something to the effect of \"nuh-uh, not ever happening.\" As well they should. In fact, Democrats should strive in this crisis and beyond, whatever beyond is, to oust McCarthy. My poor Kevin could end this at any time by going to House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, who kept his caucus together through those 15 grueling January votes, and making a reasonable deal. The Senate has already agreed to less than the debt-ceiling deal even provided. Again, there's an easy compromise that could even survive if Gaetz and his fellow bullies and principled progressives voted against it. But he's not doing that. Now he's trying one last, last dodge, with one last vote, sometime late Friday: He told reporters that any House Republicans who oppose it are \"siding with Biden.\" I don't think any of them are dumb enough-and some are really dumb-to believe it.\n\nChris Lehmann\n\nIndeed, Florida Man Matt Gaetz immediately said it wasn't enough and claimed he would move to oust McCarthy from the chair. That was two weeks ago, and he still hasn't so moved. First of all, there's no one to take McCarthy's place. Also, Gaetz loves to watch McCarthy squirm. He's like a sadistic bully boy pulling the wings off flies. Nevertheless, McCarthy continues to try to placate, if not Gaetz-they seem to openly hate each other now-his lunatic-fringe allies. But it cannot be done. Gaetz and friends said they'd never support a continuing resolution to give Congress a few more weeks to negotiate. So McCarthy spent all week pretending to try to pass individual budget bills, but that didn't work either. On Thursday, the House Oversight Committee held its first impeachment hearing, which the doomed speaker had authorized. It went really well: One of the GOP's lead witnesses, Kenneth Starr stooge (and George Washington University law professor) Jonathan Turley, admitted that he hadn't seen evidence that would justify impeachment. California Democratic Representative Robert Garcia, who came prepared with big posters of Ivanka and Jared Kushner (as long as we're talking about grifting presidential children), told CNN that Republicans entered a \"freak out\" mode because Turley was one of their \"star witnesses.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Want to Understand the New Cold War?

On Thursday, Politico 's Playbook had this analysis: \"Speaker Kevin McCarthy's choice to go back on the deal he made with the president is about to plunge the federal government into chaos.\" \"Biden has a point here,\" MSNBC's Sahil Kapur told anchors later that day. It's the only way Democrats should frame this destructive stalemate. McCarthy is still bleating that Biden should meet with him. And I'm still watching cable news reporters ask House Democrats what they can do to rescue My Kevin. To a person, including moderates and conservatives, they say something to the effect of \"nuh-uh, not ever happening.\" As well they should. In fact, Democrats should strive in this crisis and beyond, whatever beyond is, to oust McCarthy. My poor Kevin could end this at any time by going to House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries, who kept his caucus together through those 15 grueling January votes, and making a reasonable deal. The Senate has already agreed to less than the debt-ceiling deal even provided. Again, there's an easy compromise that could even survive if Gaetz and his fellow bullies and principled progressives voted against it. But he's not doing that. Now he's trying one last, last dodge, with one last vote, sometime late Friday: He told reporters that any House Republicans who oppose it are \"siding with Biden.\" I don't think any of them are dumb enough-and some are really dumb-to believe it.\n\nThese moderates, by the way, almost to a person voted for McCarthy as speaker on the first ballot. For all that Gaetz was heralded as the gatekeeper when McCarthy won on the 15th ballot, remember that after all that wrangling and all that animosity, Gaetz merely voted \"present,\" shaving the number My Kevin would need to prevail by one. Prevail he did, but at what cost? To the country, and to his soul? A mighty big one. W hile progressives debated whether to panic about President Joe Biden's poll numbers this week (I'm still firmly in the \"don't panic\" camp), the actually disturbing poll results had to do with the shutdown. A Monmouth University poll said Americans were evenly divided on which party deserves blame for it, which is delusional. Every shutdown for in modern history has been triggered by the GOP, this one included. Maybe that's because the media has covered it poorly? That happens. Maybe it's a Democratic messaging issue. That happens, too. Whatever your analysis, Biden shifted things, a bit, when he reminded the media that McCarthy was reneging on the agreement he made with Biden at the end of May to avert breaching the debt ceiling. \"We made a deal,\" Biden said, emphasizing that he negotiated directly with McCarthy. \"Now they come along and say...we didn't mean it.\" The GOP wing nut caucus didn't like it at the time, but neither did the House Progressive Caucus, many of whose members voted against it. That's the nature of compromise, which I accept even if I don't like the details. He followed it up with a series of tweets (I'll never call that hellsite X), including this one: If the government shuts down, that means members of our U.S. military are going to be on duty, unpaid.

The one animating principle of Kevin McCarthy's immaculately unprincipled career has been the pursuit of maximal congressional power-but power in today's Trumpified House GOP caucus is almost entirely a function of self-dramatizing grievance. In a political conclave made up of Twitter main characters, there's no room for an aspiring content moderator-even one as cheerfully invertebrate as McCarthy. The sheer unsustainability of the GOP's ascension to power was on excruciating display in the past 48 hours, as the House of Representatives failed to designate a speaker to inaugurate a new session for the first time in a century; five successive roll call votes failed to land McCarthy in his coveted leadership spot. As the chaos unspooled, far-fetched scenarios began to seem more plausible. Hard-right Florida Representative Mathew Gaetz reportedly declared that he'd be fine with Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries as speaker. Q-Anon-supporting Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene went after Gaetz and other \"Never Kevin\" incendiaries in the name of... pragmatism? Jim Jordan, the Trumpier-than-thou Ohio representative whom McCarthy had successfully romanced with the chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee, started the day by delivering McCarthy's nominating speech; he ended it as the speaker candidate endorsed by the Never Kevin faction. The House GOP caucus never had a sure grasp on consensual reality to begin with, but they opened the second session of the 118th Congress somewhere well beyond the far side of the looking-glass. As McCarthy saw his shot at the House speakership recede, and as more and more traction built up behind the party's hard-right faction clustered around the Freedom Caucus, he had to be regretting the many substantive and procedural concessions he had granted in advance to the ignoble opposition: pledges to disarm the House Ethics committee, to torpedo individual spending measures and fire government officials; stiffer language about pursuing Inspector Javert-style inquiries into the infamies contained on Hunter Biden's laptop, counter-investigations into the select committee on the January 6 insurrection, and-oh, why not?-probes of the CIA and the FBI for ongoing, unspecified affronts to the MAGA faithful. In a stirring 11th-hour capitulation, McCarthy also gave in to a Freedom Caucus demand to permit spot votes on his own prospective speakership-a guarantee of permanent ineffectualness at best, and a sword-of-Damocles death warrant at worst. McCarthy's litany of obsequiousness was all for naught: The right flank of the House Republican caucus wasn't having his leadership bid because... well, they just weren't , that's all. \"Look, this is not the Tea Party,\" former Republican strategist Tim Miller says of McCarthy's opposition. \"The Tea Party might have been performative, but at least they had an ethos. There was at least a policy objective to what the Tea Party was doing. Here, there's no overarching policy objective-they're just motivated by clicks and TV hits. It's a party of charlatans, and they're increasingly gaining power. I mean, you just have to look at these districts and the people who ran and won in 2018, 2020, and 2022, saying they wanted to be more like Trump.\" Now, in the opening act of the 2023 Congress, \"they just want to have a performative fight\" over McCarthy's speakership, Miller adds. \"So even if Kevin cuts another deal with them to impeach [Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro] Majorkas, that won't be enough. Nothing is enough.\" Popular \"swipe left below to view more authors\" Swipe → A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump A \"60 Minutes\" Resignation Highlights the Corporate Media's Surrender to Trump Jeet Heer The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller The Cruel World According to Stephen Miller Books & the Arts / David Klion Want to Understand the New Cold War?

Now we're seeing it play out on the floor of the House.\" The way to understand the fight, Green says, is \"the problem of the governing Republicans versus the grievance Republicans.\" I ndeed, in the perverse logic of the conservative movement's flight from governance, McCarthy has largely demonstrated his unsuitability to lead the right by wanting the gig so overtly. \"Part of the problem is that for at least some of these lawmakers it appears to be personal,\" Green says. \"One of the digs on McCarthy from the conservative movement is that he only cares about power, not policy. They're not convinced that McCarthy is on board with the conservative agenda.\" Of course, the agenda on the right doesn't have a great deal to do with policy-making either, as McCarthy's own half-hearted effort to marshal the party behind his hand-waving 2022 \" Commitment to America \" program made painfully clear. Still, the trick in the transactional-power world of Washington is not to seem excessively needy, and McCarthy exudes neediness out of every pore. When Gaetz was putting forward Jordan's candidacy, Green notes,\"he said that Jordan is modest to a fault, and that he's not willing to sell shares of himself,\" in a far-from-subtle callout to McCarthy's campaign for the post. \"There's a balancing act to be struck,\" Green says. \"You want more power, but you don't want to wear it on your sleeve.\" Current Issue View our current issue It's true that McCarthy assiduously wooed potential dissenters in advance-getting the initial support of Jordan himself and reviving the congressional career of Marjorie Taylor Greene, who had previously been stripped of her committee assignments for bigoted and conspiratorial outbursts such as the claim that a string of forest fires in California had been ignited by \"Jewish space lasers.\" But as Green notes, \"those were individual members, not efforts to address the broader, deeper concerns of the caucus. You contrast this with what Pelosi did in 2018. She was in real trouble then, when more Democrats said they'd oppose her. But she was very systematic in targeting members most likely to flip and making deals with them.\" While McCarthy does appear to have gone into deal-cutting overdrive at the outset of negotiations, he has only the scorn of Matt Gaetz to show for all his bowing and scraping at the moment of decision. \"McCarthy was making all these concessions but still had Republicans saying they wouldn't vote for him,\" Green says. \"The whole point of a concession is getting something in return.\" Then again, it could well be that the only fate worse for McCarthy than a failed speakership would be a successful one. \"The key point, even if somehow he cobbles together the vote, he is completely castrated,\" Miller says. \"He's even weaker than Boehner was at the end. The first time he needs to get Democratic votes to get a budget passed or a bill through, he's done. It's the barbarians in charge.\"\n\nThe sheer unsustainability of the GOP's ascension to power was on excruciating display in the past 48 hours, as the House of Representatives failed to designate a speaker to inaugurate a new session for the first time in a century; five successive roll call votes failed to land McCarthy in his coveted leadership spot. As the chaos unspooled, far-fetched scenarios began to seem more plausible. Hard-right Florida Representative Mathew Gaetz reportedly declared that he'd be fine with Democratic minority leader Hakeem Jeffries as speaker. Q-Anon-supporting Georgia Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene went after Gaetz and other \"Never Kevin\" incendiaries in the name of... pragmatism? Jim Jordan, the Trumpier-than-thou Ohio representative whom McCarthy had successfully romanced with the chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee, started the day by delivering McCarthy's nominating speech; he ended it as the speaker candidate endorsed by the Never Kevin faction. The House GOP caucus never had a sure grasp on consensual reality to begin with, but they opened the second session of the 118th Congress somewhere well beyond the far side of the looking-glass. As McCarthy saw his shot at the House speakership recede, and as more and more traction built up behind the party's hard-right faction clustered around the Freedom Caucus, he had to be regretting the many substantive and procedural concessions he had granted in advance to the ignoble opposition: pledges to disarm the House Ethics committee, to torpedo individual spending measures and fire government officials; stiffer language about pursuing Inspector Javert-style inquiries into the infamies contained on Hunter Biden's laptop, counter-investigations into the select committee on the January 6 insurrection, and-oh, why not?-probes of the CIA and the FBI for ongoing, unspecified affronts to the MAGA faithful. In a stirring 11th-hour capitulation, McCarthy also gave in to a Freedom Caucus demand to permit spot votes on his own prospective speakership-a guarantee of permanent ineffectualness at best, and a sword-of-Damocles death warrant at worst. McCarthy's litany of obsequiousness was all for naught: The right flank of the House Republican caucus wasn't having his leadership bid because... well, they just weren't , that's all. \"Look, this is not the Tea Party,\" former Republican strategist Tim Miller says of McCarthy's opposition. \"The Tea Party might have been performative, but at least they had an ethos. There was at least a policy objective to what the Tea Party was doing. Here, there's no overarching policy objective-they're just motivated by clicks and TV hits. It's a party of charlatans, and they're increasingly gaining power. I mean, you just have to look at these districts and the people who ran and won in 2018, 2020, and 2022, saying they wanted to be more like Trump.\" Now, in the opening act of the 2023 Congress, \"they just want to have a performative fight\" over McCarthy's speakership, Miller adds. \"So even if Kevin cuts another deal with them to impeach [Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro] Majorkas, that won't be enough.

      "text": "What Kevin McCarthy Will Do to Gain Power\n\nOn the afternoon of November 15th, a congressional intern in a suit and tie sprinted down a wing of the Capitol carrying a cardboard box with a slit on the top for paper ballots, then disappeared into an auditorium. Inside, the House Republican conference was electing its new leaders. This was the first of two votes. The second will come on January 3rd, on the floor of the House of Representatives. There still wasn't a clear majority for either party, but it was likely that the Republicans would flip the chamber, and the winner of the voting would become the front-runner for Speaker, second in line for the Presidency. Dozens of journalists sat on the floor outside, preparing for a long afternoon. Two more staffers carrying ballot boxes ran past. \"Stop the steal!\" a reporter shouted after them.\n\nFour hours later, Kevin McCarthy, a fifty-seven-year-old congressman from Bakersfield, California, emerged with an exaggerated smile. McCarthy, who has more than a decade of service in the G.O.P. leadership, has feathery gray hair and was wearing a tailored navy suit. He had received a hundred and eighty-eight votes, about eighty-five per cent of the conference. \"I'm proud to announce the era of one-party Democrat rule in Washington is over,\" he said.\n\nFor the past two years, his colleagues had been calling McCarthy the \"Speaker-in-waiting.\" \"Nobody knows the inside game better,\" Paul Ryan, the previous Republican Speaker, has said. When Kevin Spacey was preparing for the role of Frank Underwood, the Machiavellian schemer on the Netflix show \"House of Cards,\" he shadowed McCarthy. (McCarthy joked that he agreed to it after learning that Underwood would be a Democrat.) Outgoing and personable, he is intensely social, \"a happy warrior,\" in the words of his friend the pollster Frank Luntz. Patrick McHenry, a House Republican and a confidant of McCarthy's, once asked, \"If Kevin McCarthy is alone, does he exist?\" From the start of his career, in the late nineteen-eighties, as a congressional staffer at a district office in the Central Valley of California, his ambition was to reach the House; once he arrived in Washington, it was to become Speaker. The House is where he's most himself. He likens spending time there to \"having breakfast at a truck stop.\"\n\n\"Everyone knows the joke,\" a former House staffer told me. \"All Kevin McCarthy cares about is Kevin McCarthy. He is the man for this moment.\" His main strength has always been his malleability. There are no red lines, core policy beliefs, or inviolable principles, just a willingness to adapt to the moods of his conference.\n\nIt is perhaps for this reason that no one in the Republican leadership has tied himself to Donald Trump more closely than McCarthy. In 2016, McCarthy supported Trump for President unwaveringly, even when the rest of the Party establishment had doubts. On October 8th, the night before the first Presidential debate, he joined a conference call with prominent Party members. The \"Access Hollywood\" tape had just leaked, and the Republicans were discussing whether to pull their endorsements. \"What the hell are you guys doing?\" McCarthy asked, according to an account in \"The Hill to Die On,\" by Jake Sherman and Anna Palmer. \"How can you do this and hurt our nominee?\" Soon, he and Trump were speaking multiple times a day. Trump called him \"my Kevin.\"\n\nTwo years later, after the Democrats took the House, forcing the Republicans into the minority, McCarthy became the Party's leader, one of its youngest ever. In 2020, though the G.O.P. lost the Presidency and the Senate, House Republicans picked up fourteen seats. Very few Republicans disputed Trump's claims about the election having been stolen; the majority stayed silent. McCarthy went on Fox News to say, \"President Trump won this election. . . . We cannot allow this to happen before our eyes.\" That December, when the Texas attorney general petitioned the Supreme Court to contest the results in four states, McCarthy initially declined to sign an amicus brief in support of the lawsuit, but reversed himself hours after the list of signers went public and Trump got angry; McCarthy cited a \"technical glitch.\" On the night of January 6, 2021, after the insurrection at the Capitol, he voted against certifying the election. A week later, he voted against impeachment. \"I'll take this to the grave-Kevin McCarthy is responsible for the rise of Donald Trump again,\" Adam Kinzinger, the outgoing Republican congressman from Illinois, told me. \"He was so close to being dead.\"\n\nA President's party typically suffers midterm losses in Congress; this year, the combined effect of high inflation and low approval ratings for Joe Biden led strategists to believe that Republicans could gain a twenty- to thirty-seat advantage in the House. \"I look at Democrat incumbents right now,\" McCarthy told Punchbowl News, in October. \"I think they're in denial.\" On Election Night, however, McCarthy was forced to delay his appearance at a victory party in Washington, emerging at two in the morning to speak to a sparse crowd.\n\nAn election that was supposed to be about Biden had turned into a referendum on Trump and G.O.P. extremism. \"Kevin and Trump, they're not going to be separated by much,\" Fred Upton, the retiring Michigan congressman and one of ten Republicans in the House who voted to impeach Trump in January, 2021, told me. \"Like it or not, Trump's the face of our party right now. He's still very angry.\"\n\nThe Speaker's race is McCarthy's to lose, and yet he could lose it still. During the first round of voting, McCarthy's only official competitor was Andy Biggs, a legislator from Arizona, who received thirty-one votes but who vowed to fight on. Biggs is part of a far-right faction called the Freedom Caucus. The group, which has about forty members, has been a wrecking ball since its creation, in 2015, when it forced out John Boehner as Speaker and sabotaged McCarthy, who was running to replace him. Two years earlier, congresspeople who became core members of the Freedom Caucus had shut down the government and tried to force a federal default, in order to make a point about excessive federal spending. Its ranks have grown with election deniers, QAnon conspiracists, and diehard Trumpists. Sarah Longwell, a Republican strategist, told me, \"The Dems' extreme people are extreme on progressive policies. The Republicans' extreme are extreme on the level of the insane taking over the asylum.\"\n\nWhen the full election returns started to come in, later in November, the Party looked to have a razor-thin majority-five votes. Five outer-fringe Republicans immediately said that they'd block McCarthy from becoming Speaker. The Freedom Caucus wants McCarthy to make changes to House procedure that will allow them to obstruct future legislation. Even if McCarthy concedes, members of the Freedom Caucus profit from attacking him: the far right is no longer beholden to the Party for money, since it raises its own online by going nuclear. All of them represent increasingly conservative districts where their constituents don't want them to compromise. Although McCarthy has done more than any other top Republican to accommodate Trumpism, he is still the establishment. \"The thin ice that he's been on is even thinner than he thought,\" Norman Ornstein, of the American Enterprise Institute, told me. \"When your margin is small, the problem is you're held hostage.\"\n\nIn front of the cameras last month in the Capitol, McCarthy put on a brave face. \"We got to listen to everyone in our conference,\" he said. \"I respect each and every one. I respect them equally.\" He continued, \"One thing I've always learned-they don't hand gavels out in small, medium, and large.\"\n\nA few minutes later, the size of McCarthy's gavel was on display, whether he accepted it or not. Marjorie Taylor Greene-the Georgia congresswoman, QAnon true believer, and fanatical Trump acolyte-stepped up to the microphones in tan heels and a black flared coat. Last year, after journalists uncovered a string of racist and anti-Semitic comments that Greene had made, the House stripped her of her committee assignments. (Among other things, she suggested that California wildfires were ignited by a space laser fired by the Rothschilds, the Jewish banking family.) McCarthy responded by threatening Democrats that he'd come after them once Republicans retook the majority. After Democrats sanctioned Paul Gosar, of Arizona, for tweeting a video depicting him killing the New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, McCarthy said he'd give Gosar and Greene \"better\" committee assignments.\n\nLink copied\n\nThe antic cast of the Republican Party makes it easy to overlook just how flexibly McCarthy negotiates and renegotiates his position. Trent Lott, the former Mississippi senator, who held top Party jobs in both chambers of Congress, used to say that he led \"by being led.\" McCarthy has made an art of this mantra; in a world of professional survivors, he has a special talent for staying alive. \"I think he's underestimated,\" Eric Cantor, the former Republican House Majority Leader, told me. Along with Paul Ryan and McCarthy, Cantor was a member of a photogenic triumvirate of conservative ideologues known as the Young Guns, who, in 2010, were meant to represent a new generation in Congress. Cantor aligned himself with the insurgent members of the Party, frequently at the expense of his boss, John Boehner. Still, Cantor lost a primary in the spring of 2014, to a candidate from the Tea Party. Four years later, Ryan was gone, too, a casualty of Trumpism. \"Think about the transformation and what has occurred in the time that he's been in Congress,\" Cantor said, of McCarthy. \"Any kind of criticism of him falls short in terms of recognizing the ability to keep standing and to keep going and to keep leading in this kind of environment.\"\n\nFor months, Greene had hinted that she might oppose McCarthy when he ran for Speaker. At the very least, she wanted to extract something in exchange for her support, which McCarthy likely needed if he wanted to win over the Trump wing of the Party. Now she had decided to endorse McCarthy for Speaker. \"He is listening to all of our voices,\" she told the assembled press. Many of her talking points were identical to his, down to the phrases he'd used.\n\nAs Greene finished, she said, \"We have to have the gavel, because the gavel means subpoena power.\" G.O.P. hard-liners are pushing for two years of revanchism to set the stage for 2024: unrelenting investigations into the Biden family, inquiries into Cabinet members, threats of impeachment. These actions will probably play poorly with voters. McCarthy knows it. Yet he now has a Speaker's race to win, and a small and fractious majority to hold together. \"You're not there because people see you as a tough guy or because they see you as a strategist or as brilliant,\" Ornstein told me. Many of McCarthy's members \"are happy to have a Speaker who's this weak.\"\n\nI followed Greene after her speech and asked what McCarthy had promised her. We were walking briskly in the direction of the House floor. Her press aide was filming our exchange with his phone. \"I'm looking forward to serving on the Oversight Committee,\" she said, naming a House committee likely to lead congressional investigations into the Biden Administration. \"That'll start in January.\"\n\nMcCarthy was one of three children born to modest, middle-class Bakersfield Democrats. His mother was a homemaker and his father was an assistant fire chief, whose job in the public sector offered generous health insurance. Kevin's brother had glaucoma and needed multiple operations before he turned two. Until the fifth grade, Kevin suffered from a speech impairment that required therapy.\n\nBakersfield is an oil and agriculture town, one of the reddest parts of the state; its flat, desiccated landscape, just west of the Sierra Nevada, more closely resembles that of the Oklahoma plains or the scrublands of West Texas than the rest of California. As a teen-ager, McCarthy was affable and athletic. At Bakersfield High School, he played tight end for the football team, the Drillers.\n\nHis political awareness began after he graduated, when he won five thousand dollars in a state lottery. It was 1984, the height of the Reagan era. McCarthy had been enrolled in community college in Bakersfield, but he dropped out, investing part of his winnings in the stock market and using the rest to open a deli he called Kevin O's. Later, he said that the experience showed him \"what all small businesspeople learn: that the work is hard, the margins are thin, and the government is too often an obstacle, not an aid, to success.\" When he sold the business, some two years later, he used his earnings to pay for college and business school at Cal State Bakersfield, where he joined the California Young Republicans, eventually becoming the organization's chairman.\n\n\"Walking through campus, he was always chitchatting with people,\" Susie Aspeitia, a friend who met him in a marketing class, told me. \"His personality was so inviting. Everyone knew him. And, if you didn't, before you knew it you knew him.\" Aspeitia, whose family is Mexican American, had grown up surrounded by Democrats but considered herself largely apolitical. McCarthy, who was dating his high-school girlfriend and future wife, Judy, brought Aspeitia and her boyfriend into the Young Republicans. \"He was right there with all of us, cleaning up glasses and dishes after events,\" she said. \"He was the president, but it didn't feel like we were in a big political group.\"\n\nIt was inevitable that someone like McCarthy would find his way to the office of Representative Bill Thomas, a former political-science professor at Bakersfield College and a Republican, who entered the U.S. House in 1979. Bright and acerbic, Thomas was a dealmaker and a pragmatist with a reputation for having more enemies than friends. But he was regarded as a serious legislator in Washington, where he later became the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee and mentored Paul Ryan, Eric Cantor, and Devin Nunes, who headed the House Intelligence Committee before leaving Congress to work for Trump.\n\nIn California, where moderates and conservatives were battling for Party primacy throughout the nineties, Thomas's office was an influential hub. \"The fight was usually over guns, babies, and taxes,\" Ray Haynes, a former Republican assemblyman and state senator, told me. \"Thomas tended to take the more moderate side.\" His chief of staff, Cathy Abernathy, turned McCarthy down when he applied for a position in Washington, in 1987, but she gave him a chance as an unpaid intern in the district office. He was twenty-two. Within three months, she told me, \"I had to hire an intern to be his intern.\"\n\nIn October, Abernathy and I met for French toast at Pappy's, a diner in Bakersfield with an oil theme-hard hats, gas pumps, miniature rigs. On the wall behind her, photographs of George W. Bush, Ronald Reagan, and John Wayne hung beside an antique rifle and the mounted head of a buffalo. When McCarthy worked for Thomas, his district extended from east of Bakersfield to San Luis Obispo, near the coast. McCarthy's job, Abernathy said, \"was working the district\": attending meetings as Thomas's emissary at local clubs, fixing problems, helping constituents. \"He genuinely likes people. People like him,\" Abernathy said. \"He wants to be your friend. If there's friction, he tries to smooth it out.\"\n\nMcCarthy worked for Thomas for fifteen years. During that time, he climbed the ranks of the national Young Republicans, becoming the chairman in 1999. \"He was someone with that boardroom presence,\" Mike Madrid, who served as the political director of the California Republican Party in the late nineties, told me. \"He'd walk into a meeting and the conversation would stop. He spoke for Bill Thomas. Everyone respected him.\"\n\nCalifornia was in the midst of a political realignment. In 1994, Pete Wilson, the Republican governor, was trailing his Democratic challenger by double digits when he embraced an anti-immigrant ballot measure called Proposition 187, which barred undocumented immigrants from using certain public services. The state was rapidly diversifying, and, though the passage of the proposition paid off in the short term by capitalizing on white anxiety (Wilson won reëlection), it contributed to a long Republican decline. \"The California Republican Party is as conservative and white and rural as any party in the country,\" Madrid said. \"It's seventy per cent white in a state that is thirty-five per cent white, not counting Hispanics.\" Thomas and McCarthy were \"fierce advocates for moderating the Party\" and \"making it more inclusive\" in order to win. \"They revelled in fighting with conservatives,\" he said. \"They knew California was not Bakersfield.\"\n\nWith Thomas's endorsement, McCarthy ran for the state assembly in 2002, and, when he won, his warm, conciliatory style endeared him to his new colleagues, including conservatives who distrusted his former boss. Dick Ackerman, a veteran state senator and assemblyman, took him aside to offer some friendly advice. \"Kevin was using 'Bill' every other word,\" he said. \"I told him, Kevin, half the people here hate Bill Thomas. I wouldn't use that to sell yourself.\"\n\nIn Sacramento, a few weeks after the election, there was an orientation for incoming members of congress. It was held at a hotel and lasted a few days. One evening, a Democrat named Fabian Núñez, who'd just been elected to a district representing Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley, went to the bar with McCarthy. \"We didn't know each other until we got elected, but we hit it off right away,\" Núñez told me. \"Kevin says to me, 'I think I'm going to be Republican leader and you're going to be Democratic leader.' I asked him what made him think that. He said, 'Look, people gravitate toward us. People look up to us.' There was no arrogance to it. It was just an observation of someone with a real political lens.\"\n\nAbout a year later, McCarthy ran for leader of his party in the assembly, against Ray Haynes, who was older, more experienced, and more conservative. When Haynes tried to strike a deal with McCarthy, offering to alternate in the job, McCarthy replied, \"No, let's just fight.\" There were thirty-two members, nineteen conservatives and thirteen moderates; to win, McCarthy needed four conservatives. \"He knew how to deal with them,\" Haynes said. Once Haynes realized that McCarthy had their votes, he withdrew his candidacy. \"I was a rival, but not an enemy,\" he said.\n\nIn an assembly dominated by Democrats, McCarthy faced a bind. Because conservatives outnumbered moderates in the minority, there wasn't a strong appetite for compromise. Yet the Republicans lacked the power to pass legislation. Jim Brulte, who was the minority leader in the state senate at the time, told me, \"When you're the minority leader in the California State Assembly, you can only lead by sheer force of personality.\" McCarthy distributed books (Newt Gingrich on politics), iPods, and watches; he planned Party retreats and organized weekly bipartisan basketball games at a Sacramento gym. He had presents ready for members' birthdays and their children's graduations. When Núñez, the Democrat, became the speaker of the assembly, he kept a binder with biographical information on his members. McCarthy paged through it once, while the two were chatting in the state capitol. \"I have the same thing,\" he told Núñez. \"Except I have wedding anniversaries in mine. You don't.\"\n\nThree months before McCarthy took over as the Republican leader of the assembly, the Democratic governor, Gray Davis, who was almost a year into his second term, was recalled. The winner of the vote to replace him was Arnold Schwarzenegger. \"All of a sudden, the government changes and all the people Kevin knows are on the executive staff,\" Richard Costigan, Schwarzenegger's secretary of legislative affairs, told me. \"The whole field shifted with the recall.\" For McCarthy, a moderate Republican governor who happened to be a celebrity was a political lifeline. It helped that McCarthy was telegenic and celebrity-obsessed. Republican members used to rib him for not wearing a hat at softball games because it would mess up his hair. He also had a habit of collecting photos with celebrities on his cell phone. Schwarzenegger kept a nine-pound sword from the movie set of \"Conan the Barbarian\" in the governor's office; his staff was too nervous to touch it. But one day McCarthy led some constituents into the office, picked up the sword, and started waving it around. Schwarzenegger walked in on him through a back door. \"Conan the Barbarian was standing next to the minority leader,\" Costigan said. \"People wanted to be around the Governor, and Kevin helped to facilitate that.\"\n\nMcCarthy served as minority leader in the assembly until 2006, when Bill Thomas announced his retirement from Congress and McCarthy ran for his seat, winning it handily. By then, he'd amassed a record in the assembly of helping pass budgets and securing modest legislative concessions, which the Republicans and the Democrats I spoke to seemed to praise equally, albeit for different reasons. \"The Republicans went through leaders like I go through black flat shoes,\" Susan Kennedy, a Democrat at the time, who served as Schwarzenegger's chief of staff, said. \"Kevin was one of the only ones who knew how to find compromise and still win politically. His DNA was tactical.\" Dick Ackerman said that McCarthy helped \"remind Schwarzenegger that he was a Republican.\"\n\nBill Thomas, who is eighty-one years old and lives in Bakersfield, is still capable of making news. Last year, a week and a half after the insurrection at the U.S. Capitol, Thomas went on a local TV station to blast his longtime protégé as a hypocrite. McCarthy, he said, \"built his new credentials as best he could\" by parroting Trump's \"phony lies\" about a stolen election.\n\nTwo days before Thomas spoke, McCarthy gave a brief speech on the House floor. \"The President bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters,\" he said. It was the first and last time McCarthy publicly crossed Trump. On the broadcast, Thomas said he hoped that \"the Kevin who spoke during the impeachment, notwithstanding the fact he didn't vote for it, will be the Kevin leading the Republicans on the floor of the House and not the 'my Kevin' \" who \"had been supporting, nurturing the lies of the President.\"\n\nOn a warm October afternoon in Bakersfield, Thomas picked me up in a red BMW Z3, and we went out for lunch at a fish-and-chips restaurant attached to a bowling alley. A Washington magazine that ranked Congress members by intelligence and temperament routinely gave Thomas high marks for \"brainiest,\" \"meanest,\" and \"hottest temper.\" He was proud of all three. \"Meanest?\" he said. \"The reason was I said no. You have a cockamamie idea, I'm not going to put it up at midnight or at noon. The most popular people have round heels. They'll roll over for anything.\" When we arrived, he sat with his back to the front door so that we wouldn't get interrupted by people who might recognize him and come over to chat.\n\n\"The Kevin McCarthy who is now, at this time, in the House isn't the Kevin McCarthy I worked with. At least from outward appearances. You never know what's inside, really,\" Thomas said. \"Kevin basically is whatever you want him to be. He lies. He'll change the lie if necessary. How can anyone trust his word?\" He went on, \"At some point, you have to look at where you started and how you got to where you are, and I would ask you, How do you feel about yourself? I know what his answer would be, but it wouldn't be the truth.\" What would the answer be? I asked. \"It was all worth it.\"\n\nLink copied\n\nWhen McCarthy served in the California assembly, it was common knowledge among state pols that he had national aspirations. \"I can't recall a time when he came into the office to talk about a substantive political issue,\" Thomas told me. \"The political goal as he moved up the district structure\" was \"to build up\" relationships. \"He's the guy in the college fraternity that everybody liked and winds up selling life insurance, convincing people they need it.\"\n\nAt lunch, Thomas preferred talking policy to politics, mostly because he was passionate about the details, but also because it illustrated his conviction about the nature of true influence and longevity in Congress. A terminal of the Bakersfield airport is named for him, as is a large public fund financing ongoing construction of highways and freight corridors in the region. Thomas refers to legislation as \"product\" and so can sound like a drug dealer when discussing road-improvement programs. In his view, the business of legislating is foreign to McCarthy. \"He's already said, 'As soon as I become Speaker, I'm going after the Attorney General,' \" Thomas told me. \"Why would you want to spend your whole life trying to be Speaker to go after somebody? What are you for ?\"\n\nThomas had been willing to use his power not just to pass bills but to settle partisan scores. What struck him now was a tactical dilemma: if everyone in the conference knew that McCarthy would do anything to hold the Speakership, then he'd have no way of enforcing discipline. \"Everything is focussed on becoming Speaker,\" Thomas said. \"What do you do after?\" As the Party's chief congressional fund-raiser, McCarthy could help get members elected. \"You can't hold the money over them anymore,\" Thomas went on. \"Now you're in. What have you got that keeps them tied to you?\"\n\nOn April 15, 2009-Tax Day-McCarthy took John Boehner to a Tea Party rally in Bakersfield, where thousands of anti-government demonstrators had gathered near the town's full-size replica of the Liberty Bell to protest high taxes and government spending. One of their principal targets was the seven-hundred-and-eighty-seven-billion-dollar federal stimulus bill, passed two months before by a Democrat-controlled Congress, but their rage was broad, bipartisan, and generally anti-establishment. Boehner was seen as the last man standing from the Newt Gingrich era. In 1994, the Republicans had won the House for the first time in forty years, led by Gingrich, the Georgia congressman, who campaigned on a platform he called the Contract with America. Boehner told Republican politicians to go to Tea Party rallies-not to stand up and make speeches, but to listen. He tasked McCarthy with drafting a Pledge to America. Forty-eight pages long, it outlined the Republicans' top priorities: repealing Obamacare, ending tax increases, and cutting federal spending by a hundred billion dollars.\n\nMcCarthy had quickly joined Republican leadership in the House by applying a lesson he'd learned from his years on Thomas's staff: since his was a safe seat, he generated good will by plowing much of his campaign money into other candidates' races across the country. In California, where a Republican governor was comfortable striking deals with Democrats, McCarthy had positioned himself as a more moderate dealmaker. But now, at the national level, the path to power ran through redoubled conservatism and strong opposition to President Obama. On the night of Obama's first Inauguration, a group of influential Republican Party members had met for dinner at a Washington steakhouse to plot the course. \"If you act like you're the minority, you're going to stay in the minority,\" McCarthy said, according to \"When the Tea Party Came to Town,\" by Robert Draper. \"We've gotta challenge them on every single bill and challenge them on every single campaign.\"\n\nFor the 2010 election cycle, McCarthy worked with Paul Ryan and Eric Cantor to recruit candidates and to lead the campaign effort. Each was part of the Republican establishment, yet they sold themselves as outsiders with big ideas. After a conservative journalist anointed them the Young Guns, in an article in the Weekly Standard , they published a book with the same name; its precepts, which were based on slashing federal spending and rewriting the tax code, became their template for signing up candidates who were motivated by the rising populist tide to enter politics. \"Boehner hadn't even been told about the Young Gun manifesto,\" a senior G.O.P. staffer told me. \"They tried to be the three amigos.\" Ryan was the policy expert, Cantor the political leader, and McCarthy the strategist. \"It really was all Kevin,\" Cantor told me. \"He was always, again, playing on his strength of understanding where members are, knowing their families, understanding what their districts were like.\"\n\nThat November, the Republicans retook the House by winning sixty-three additional seats, and conference members chose Boehner as Speaker and Cantor as Majority Leader. McCarthy became the Whip, whose job was to corral votes for Boehner and Cantor. Boehner wanted to lower spending by reaching a grand bargain with President Obama involving tax increases, a strategy that many Republican freshmen abhorred. Cantor and McCarthy supported the insurgents' position. \"There weren't a lot of people back then who wanted us to deal with the White House,\" Cantor told me.\n\nMcCarthy had a compulsion to be liked, and he identified with the freshmen he'd helped recruit. In his office, according to Draper, he put up black-and-white photos of the new congresspeople next to those of senior members. He hosted movie nights and took the congress members on field trips to the office building that housed the Bureau of Public Debt. During an election, he pulled aside Scott DesJarlais, a bald Tennessee physician who ran in 2010, to give him some pointers on his facial hair. \"Michael Phelps shaves his entire body to get one-tenth of one second faster,\" McCarthy told him. \"I think that goatee is costing you five per cent of the vote.\"\n\nWhile the Republicans remained divided, Congress passed a series of temporary measures to keep the government open. But the tension grew, in large part because McCarthy and Cantor were stoking unrealistic expectations. \"Boehner's view was, You're not going to repeal Obamacare. Stop telling the Tea Party people that you can,\" the G.O.P. staffer said.\n\nMcCarthy played both sides. He was protective of the new members, but he had a job to do. In March, 2011, according to reporting by Draper, McCarthy tried to rally the members to compromise by pitching a provisional spending deal as a way for Republicans to keep the pressure on Obama. \"When you're coming around a corner and you see your friend in a fight, what do you do?\" he said. \"First, you jump in and you help beat up the other guy. And then when it's all over you can ask, 'Hey, what was that fight about?' \"\n\nThe next few years were unstable and rancorous. In an effort to emphasize that Republicans had ideas of their own, Mitt Romney chose Paul Ryan as his running mate in the 2012 Presidential campaign, elevating a hyper-conservative agenda on spending and tax cuts. \"We didn't just want to be against what Obama was doing,\" Cantor told me. \"It turns out we were rebuffed.\" By now, the forces he and McCarthy had indulged in the Republican conference were becoming unmanageable. \"I forget how many times they voted on repealing Obamacare, but that was never enough,\" the staffer lamented. At one point, in December, 2012, Boehner opened a Party meeting by reciting the Serenity Prayer. In October, 2013, the government shut down for sixteen days, and a large faction of House Republicans refused to raise the debt ceiling, risking a default. To reopen the government, Boehner was eventually forced to find votes among Democrats. After that, it became impossible to regain control of the Party. At a G.O.P. retreat at a hotel in Maryland, in January, 2014, Boehner presented a set of Republican principles. \"It didn't go well,\" one attendee told me. \"I could see McCarthy staff and Cantor staff celebrating. They were huddled in the corner kind of laughing over the failure.\"\n\nThe Freedom Caucus emerged at the start of 2015, partly as a consequence of the growing rift between Tea Party members and the House Republican leadership. On July 28th, one of its founders, Mark Meadows, the North Carolina congressman who later became Trump's White House chief of staff, walked onto the House floor and filed a motion to \"vacate the chair,\" initiating a vote to oust Boehner as Speaker. After Boehner stepped down, the vote to replace him, which took place in October, was supposed to be pro forma and uneventful. With Cantor no longer in the House, McCarthy was the obvious front-runner.\n\nRepublican members had already gathered to vote when McCarthy appeared with his wife and family and announced that he was withdrawing from consideration. \"The meeting was immediately adjourned,\" Carlos Curbelo, a former two-term Republican congressman from Florida, told me. \"Everyone was shocked. No one saw it coming.\" Speculation about what the precipitating event might have been persists to this day. One explanation was that McCarthy had committed a significant gaffe in an interview with Sean Hannity, in September, when he suggested that the House's special committee on Benghazi was trying to sink Hillary Clinton. This was common knowledge, but in Washington you weren't supposed to say it out loud. Ultimately, though, it was the Freedom Caucus that blocked him. It opposed anyone from the Party's existing leadership structure, and McCarthy hadn't yet consolidated enough support among other members to compensate for the lost votes. \"He called Paul Ryan right before the press conference and said, 'I'm dropping out of the race and endorsing you for Speaker,' \" a former senior Hill staffer told me. Ryan was in good standing with the Party's different factions, making him the most viable alternative. \"In order for Kevin to stay in his role and stay relevant, it had to be seamless,\" according to the staffer. But Ryan, who didn't want the position and hadn't yet conferred with his family, was blindsided. It took more than two weeks-and a pressure campaign mounted by Boehner and others-to persuade him to take the job. The staffer told me, \"Paul said, 'You cannot do that. You can't put me in that position.' \"\n\nOn January 6, 2021, when Capitol Police evacuated the House chamber, McCarthy went to his office, accompanied by Bruce Westerman, a Republican congressman from Arkansas. Once the rioters breached the building, security officers took McCarthy to a military base, where he joined Mitch McConnell, Nancy Pelosi, and Chuck Schumer. Westerman, who stayed behind, grabbed a Civil War sword from a display in McCarthy's office and hid in the Minority Leader's private bathroom.\n\nOf the top four leaders in the House and the Senate, McCarthy was the only one on regular speaking terms with Donald Trump. Members were texting McCarthy, begging him to tell the President to call off the rioters. When he reached Trump by phone, the President reportedly said, \"Well, Kevin, I guess these people are more upset about the election than you are.\"\n\nBefore the insurrection, McCarthy had told his members that the vote to certify the election would be a \"vote of conscience\": there wasn't a party-line position, so no one would be punished for how he voted. But this also meant that members were on their own at a time when many of them were receiving death threats from constituents. The only member of the Republican House leadership to take a strong stance against the President's lies was Liz Cheney, of Wyoming. At first, McCarthy refused to clarify his position and wouldn't answer when members asked him for direction. The factions weren't clearly divided along ideological lines. A group of fierce conservatives, including Chip Roy, a congressman from Texas and a member of the Freedom Caucus, thought it was a bad idea to oppose certification. When another congressman asked McCarthy how the leadership saw the vote, he responded sharply, \"You want me to give you your voting card?\"\n\nOn January 3rd, McCarthy made his position clear-and went a step further. According to \"Unchecked,\" by Rachael Bade and Karoun Demirjian, he allowed staffers for Jim Jordan-a former nemesis from the Freedom Caucus, a rabid Trumpist, and a vociferous election denier-to set up a special area next to the House floor to recruit votes against certification. When House moderates and some of McCarthy's own staff objected, the journalists write, he \"dismissed their concerns out of hand.\" (McCarthy's office denies this.)\n\nIn private, McCarthy criticized Trump for inciting the insurrection, according to recordings obtained by the Times reporters Jonathan Martin and Alexander Burns. On a conference call with House Republican leaders, on January 8th, McCarthy said, \"What the President did is atrocious and totally wrong.\" Two days later, he said, \"I've had it with this guy. What he did was unacceptable. Nobody can defend that and nobody should.\" At one point, he broached invoking the Twenty-fifth Amendment, telling colleagues that he might ask the President to resign.\n\nFor most of January, Trump's standing in the Party teetered. Moderate members were ready to break with him, and those on the far right had dug in. But the majority weren't sure how to position themselves. \"At this point, we don't know where this is going to go,\" Adam Kinzinger told me. \"So let's take the middle, 'Let's just all get along, I just want to get elected to my little district in Kentucky' guy. He's our bellwether. He's kind of sitting there, keeping his head down, trying to figure out what's going to happen.\" Then, on January 28th, McCarthy travelled to Mar-a-Lago to pay obeisance and pose for a photo. \"As soon as he went to Mar-a-Lago, you felt that person shift,\" Kinzinger said. \"That person shifted to begrudgingly defending Donald Trump, and from then it was just off the cliff.\"\n\nPeter Meijer, a freshman Republican from Michigan, joined the group of ten Republican congresspeople who voted to impeach. \"I would love it if leadership shared my minority views. But they are minority views,\" he told me, a few months after losing his primary. \"There are times when followers look to leaders, and there are times when leaders look to followers.\"\n\nKinzinger had entered Congress with the Tea Party class, in 2011. He was an Air Force pilot who flew missions in Afghanistan and Iraq; McCarthy featured him in an extended profile in the book \"Young Guns.\" \"We had a great relationship until recently,\" Kinzinger said. McCarthy repeatedly told him that he considered Trump crazy and that his job was \"to keep him from doing something super-duper crazy,\" Kinzinger went on. But it wasn't lost on him that McCarthy would \"light up talking about how often Trump called him.\"\n\nOn February 3rd, the Republican conference gathered in the auditorium of the U.S. Capitol Visitor Center. Onstage, McCarthy sat in the middle of the leadership team, taking questions and comments on two orders of business. The first was whether Liz Cheney should be kicked out of the Party leadership for insisting that the election had not been stolen. The second was what to do about Marjorie Taylor Greene, then a new freshman. A week before, evidence had surfaced that she had called for the execution of Nancy Pelosi and claimed that the 2018 massacre of seventeen people at a high school in Parkland, Florida, had been staged.\n\nThe meeting lasted more than four hours. \"We're expecting Kevin McCarthy to say some stuff about Marjorie Taylor Greene,\" Kinzinger said. \"I didn't expect that he was going to kick her out of our committees, but I did expect that he was going to take a stand that Jewish space lasers was a bit of a line too far.\" Cheney survived her vote by a secret ballot, with McCarthy giving a perfunctory speech in her defense. He made a more spirited pitch on behalf of Greene. \"They're going after Marjorie for things she said before she even got here,\" he told the crowd, according to an audio recording obtained by Draper. \"They're coming at you next.\" Kinzinger walked up to one of the corner microphones. \"I unleashed,\" he told me. \"The Party has lost its damn mind,\" he said to the group. McCarthy spent \"more time defending Marjorie Taylor Greene than saying a word about Liz Cheney.\" McCarthy sat with his arms folded while Kinzinger spoke. \"He just didn't give a shit,\" he told me.\n\nLink copied\n\nMonths later, Kinzinger was in the middle of a conversation near the House floor when McCarthy bumped him hard from behind. \"He shoulder-checks me,\" Kinzinger told me. \"This is the most junior-high place since junior high. And he's the most junior-high leader.\" Kinzinger went on, \"I thought it was a good relationship, but you also realize he's a pretty vacuous, hollow guy who makes everyone think they have a great relationship with him.\" (A spokesman for McCarthy called Kinzinger \"ridiculous\" and \"outlandishly vitriolic toward Kevin,\" referring to Kinzinger's criticisms of McCarthy as \"unhinged tirades.\")\n\nWhen congresspeople raised concerns about the Party's increasingly violent extremism, McCarthy blocked them. Steve Womack, a conservative and a military veteran, resigned from a Republican leadership committee in protest. In the spring of 2021, McCarthy deputized John Katko, a moderate from a pro-Biden district in upstate New York, to negotiate the terms of a bipartisan January 6th commission with House Democrats. The idea had never appealed to McCarthy, but he floated it to keep his options open. In May, Katko came back with a deal: the commission would have subpoena power, and there would be five members from each party. \"Katko got a hundred per cent of what Kevin asked for,\" Fred Upton told me. (Katko declined to speak to me.) But, after Trump criticized the commission as a \"Democrat trap,\" McCarthy withdrew his support and voted against it. \"I had one Republican tell me the day or two before, 'Fred, you won't believe me, but I'm actually going to vote for this. I think that it's fair,' \" Upton said. \"At the end of the day, he voted no because of Trump-Kevin wasn't going to take him on.\"\n\nCheney brought up her opposition to Trump any time she could, and because she was the third-highest-ranking Republican she frequently appeared alongside McCarthy when she did so. The last time they spoke together in public was after a press conference in late February, when a reporter asked if Trump should speak at an upcoming meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference. \"Yes,\" McCarthy said. Cheney said, \"I don't believe that he should be playing a role in the future of the Party or the country.\" \"On that high note, thank you very much,\" McCarthy said, and walked off.\n\nIn a second vote that May, with McCarthy in the majority, Cheney was ousted from the leadership. He then campaigned against her in her primary that summer. \"McCarthy went out of his way to make an example out of Liz,\" a Republican who is close to both of them told me. \"He did so because he knew she was going to lose. It was unprecedented to back the opponent of a member of the leadership team. The message was, If you go against Kevin, there are going to be consequences.\"\n\nIt's easy to imagine a scenario in which Kevin McCarthy was the Republican hero of 2022. Had the Party won more seats in the House, he could have claimed that he built a decisive majority by controlling the middle and the extreme right, defying the laws of political gravity. Last winter, he confronted an old friend, Jaime Herrera Beutler, of Washington, who voted to impeach Trump and eventually lost to an election denier in the primary. McCarthy had told her about the call he'd had with the President on January 6th, which she later shared with the press. \"I alone am taking all the heat to protect people from Trump!\" McCarthy told her. \"I alone am holding the Party together!\" (Herrera Beutler and McCarthy disputed this account when it was first reported, by Bade and Demirjian.)\n\nJust as he had in 2010, McCarthy recruited a diverse and promising class of candidates in 2022, uniting them under a broad and usefully nondescript platform called Commitment to America. He also helped raise five hundred million dollars, including two hundred and sixty million dollars for the Congressional Leadership Fund, the Party's largest House super PAC . It spent heavily to support moderate candidates against far-right challengers. Herrera Beutler received money, as did David Valadao, a McCarthy ally, who represents a largely Hispanic district next to his that went for Biden in 2020. The bet made by the Republican establishment, Peter Meijer told me, \"was that you can split the difference between traditional Republicans and pathways to the majority while also humoring Trump. I don't think that's a bet that paid off.\" Although Valadao became one of only two of the ten Republican impeachers to win reëlection, after McCarthy persuaded Trump not to attack him, Herrera Beutler's seat went to a Democrat for the first time in eleven years.\n\nMcCarthy has spent the past seven years, since he last ran for Speaker, working to shore up his support on the right. Previously, Freedom Caucus members were not given the top jobs on committees, because Party leadership considered them too extreme. McCarthy has brought figures such as Jim Jordan into the establishment-Jordan will soon have one of the most prestigious jobs in the conference, the chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee, where he'll have the power to harass the Administration.\n\n\"The way he maneuvers is he gives everyone what they want,\" the senior Hill staffer said, of McCarthy. \"It's all about member management. His constituents are the members of the Republican conference.\"\n\nYet now McCarthy is going to the January 3rd floor vote on a knife's edge. The day that he won the first round of voting for the Speakership, Don Bacon, a pragmatic Republican congressman from Nebraska, issued a threat of his own. Why should the Freedom Caucus be calling all the shots? Bacon considers McCarthy the only serious contender for Speaker. But, if the conference failed to coalesce around him, Bacon said, \"I'm going to work with like-minded people across the aisle to find someone agreeable for Speaker.\"\n\nMcCarthy had recruited Bacon to run for Congress in 2015, after hearing him give a speech in support of a candidate who went on to lose his race. The day after the election, Bacon told me, \"I got two calls, one from the county chairman. Got another guy said he wanted to be my campaign manager. I wasn't even thinking about running.\" Bacon is a member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus and the Main Street Republicans, whose numbers, Bacon said, are larger than those of the Freedom Caucus. The problem is that their unwillingness to wreak general havoc makes it harder to \"flex our muscles.\" He said, \"We're not going to let a minority of a minority of our party-it's a small number-just hold the rest of Congress and the country hostage. At some point, people like me are going to say, Enough is enough!\"\n\nMcCarthy seized Bacon's threat to strike a deal with Democrats as a way of scaring the far right into backing him; it may be the strongest argument he has. \"If we don't do this right, the Democrats can take the majority,\" he told Newsmax. \"If we play games on the floor, the Democrats can end up picking who the Speaker is.\"\n\nIn October, when the prospective majority looked bigger, McCarthy was careful not to oversell an agenda based on vengeance. He was sending a message to congresspeople such as Bacon, who badly wants to legislate. Before the midterms McCarthy said, \"I think the country doesn't like impeachment used for political purposes at all. . . . I think the country wants to heal and . . . start to see the system that actually works.\"\n\nSince then, he's issued threats about investigating Biden and his Cabinet, signalled that he's willing to oppose raising the country's debt ceiling, and suggested that he'll investigate the January 6 Committee. On November 22nd, he travelled to El Paso to deliver a menacing speech about immigration and the Secretary of Homeland Security, Alejandro Mayorkas: \"If Secretary Mayorkas does not resign, House Republicans will investigate every order, every action, and every failure to determine whether we can begin impeachment inquiries.\" A number of Republicans I interviewed said that impeaching Mayorkas would count as a \"moderate\" outcome in the 118th Congress.\n\n\"The debt limit scares the shit out of me,\" Kinzinger told me. \"Because here's the thing. In the past, Boehner or Ryan can eventually cut a deal and rely on fifty of us to vote for it. . . . It's going to be hard for McCarthy to cut deals. That freaks me out.\"\n\nIt is an indication of the state of the Republican conference that McCarthy's most clear-eyed critics still see him as the only rational check left. He may embody a vast range of contradictory identities and principles, but at least one set of them dates to the pre-Trump era. Mike Madrid, who worked with McCarthy in California and went on to co-found the Lincoln Project, the anti-Trump group, told me that McCarthy was \"the last person I felt comfortable being critical of.\" He had trouble believing that \"my Kevin\" was his Kevin, he said. \"Which guy was he all along?\"\n\nRecently, McCarthy has been in marathon meetings with members of the Freedom Caucus, trying to reach agreements on changes to the House rules. The one demand he has actively resisted is the \"motion to vacate the chair,\" the strategy that pressured Boehner: it would allow a single member to force a vote on McCarthy's ouster. It's the only deal breaker for McCarthy because it's the only one that directly threatens his Speakership. He appears to be flexible on nearly everything else. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "How Kevin McCarthy Defied the Freedom Caucus and Averted a Shutdown\n\nOn Saturday morning, Kevin McCarthy surprised everyone in Washington, including members of his own divided conference, by turning to Democrats to pass a stopgap funding measure to avert a government shutdown. This had been the only path forward for several days, if not weeks. But he resisted it, mostly because his own political survival was at stake. Not only had about twenty members from the rogue right flank of his party opposed any compromise with the Democrat-controlled Senate but several of them had threatened McCarthy outright: if he capitulated, they'd strip him of the speakership. One member, Matt Gaetz , who's always been more of a chaos agent than an ideologue, made it clear that he'd try to oust McCarthy regardless. A Republican staffer referred to Gaetz as the leader of the \"we-just-hate-Kevin coalition.\"\n\nMcCarthy's leadership style has long been a point of strength and of weakness: he is a conciliator, not an agenda-setter. \"The way he maneuvers is he gives everyone what they want,\" a senior Hill staffer once told me. \"It's all about member management. His constituents are the members of the Republican conference.\" For the past nine months, McCarthy has done everything possible to appease the far-right faction, known as the House Freedom Caucus. His most notable concession was to reinstate a procedural mechanism called the motion to vacate the chair, which allows a single member to call a vote to oust the Speaker. He's also given Freedom Caucus members more control over House rules and created, at their insistence, a subcommittee on \"the weaponization of the federal government.\" On September 12th, when representatives returned to Washington after the summer recess, McCarthy caved again, and announced a formal impeachment inquiry into the President. \"We will go wherever the evidence takes us,\" he said.\n\nDespite his best efforts, a clash with the Freedom Caucus was unavoidable. Since its creation in 2015, its members have warred with G.O.P. leadership, moving to oust John Boehner, blocking McCarthy's bid to succeed him, and then antagonizing Paul Ryan after he took over. Boehner famously called them \"legislative terrorists.\" On Friday, I spoke with a former G.O.P. leadership staffer who delivered a grave prognosis for McCarthy's speakership. In prior Republican Congresses, the Freedom Caucus was more unified but less powerful. \"We had a bigger majority, so the H.F.C. had to act in unison to have leverage, and they had one list of demands,\" the former staffer said. \"Now everyone has a different list of demands, and they all have individual power.\"\n\nThe G.O.P. has a five-vote majority in the House, so McCarthy has been vulnerable from the start. In January, he suffered an embarrassing setback when twenty conservative Republicans, nearly all from the Freedom Caucus, blocked his election as Speaker. It took fifteen rounds of voting for McCarthy to earn the support of a majority. The holdouts relented only after he made several promises behind closed doors. These were hand-shake agreements, but some of them were explicit and widely reported on. McCarthy, for example, appointed Freedom Caucus members to key committees and leadership posts, essentially bringing them into the fold. \"They've been used to never having a seat at the table,\" one Republican told me at the time. \"They'd bitch and moan about it, and go on Fox. That's changed since the Speaker's vote.\"\n\nThis spring, during a battle over raising the debt ceiling , House conservatives were willing to force a federal default to cut government spending. The bill that McCarthy used to negotiate with the White House was shaped by the Freedom Caucus. But, when he modified it, as everyone knew he would, in order to reach a deal that was announced on Memorial Day weekend, members of the Freedom Caucus felt betrayed. Dan Bishop, a representative from North Carolina, told reporters that, in response, he was prepared to vote against McCarthy's speakership. \"It is inescapable to me,\" he said . \"It has to be done.\" The rest of the caucus, though, wasn't ready. On a members-only phone call, its chairman, Scott Perry, of Pennsylvania, reportedly said, \"Let's see. It's premature.\"\n\nChip Roy, of Texas, a prominent Freedom Caucus member, was disappointed by the debt-ceiling increase, but when we spoke last month he was still reluctant to burn his relationship with the Speaker. \"We ran into disagreement on Memorial Day,\" he told me. \"We've been trying to work hand in hand with the leadership team to honor what we generally were agreeing to.\" There were specific policy outcomes Roy wanted, though they were all non-starters in the Senate; he has publicly embraced the idea of shutting down the government to make his point. A few days ago, he called for significant spending cuts and a continuing resolution tied to \"the single strongest border-security measure we've ever seen.\" More broadly, he and his colleagues were trying to achieve \"a directional shift, a trajectory shift,\" he had told me. For the first time, in his view, leadership wasn't managing the conference with top-down directives. There was a new measure of openness that allowed the most conservative members to have their say. \"It's not a 'you didn't adhere to X, so down with you!' \" Roy said. \"The fact is, what we're trying to seek is change.\" He added, \"We have largely done that.\"\n\nThe vote to shut down the government, which was about next year's federal budget, was a continuation of the conflict from the spring. House Republicans didn't have a policy or a principle to justify the extremity of their position on the eve of the shutdown. It would have been the result of their own infighting. Earlier this week, once it was clear that the Party's recalcitrant members were immoveable, McCarthy attempted to resurrect a pretext for what his conference was about to do. He attached funding for border security to a continuing resolution in the House to keep the government open. In large part, the idea was to try to lure outliers into supporting the measure. \"If they want to stand with the President by keeping the border open, I think that'd be a wrong position,\" he said. But it was also a transparent ploy to put Democrats on the defensive by making it seem like the shutdown had something to do with actual policy. The resolution had no chance of passing the Senate, and soon it was moot anyway: McCarthy's own members voted it down. \"A CR, is, in my very definition, a continuation of Nancy Pelosi spending, and it's Joe Biden's policies,\" Matt Rosendale, a Montana Republican, said . \"I voted against these things for two years. So I'm not going to now turn around and vote for a continuation of those.\"\n\nOn Saturday morning, after another stopgap measure had failed, as predicted, the Republicans held a meeting to air their grievances. The government was due to shut down by the end of the day. The last time that happened, in 2019, four hundred and twenty thousand public employees were forced to work without pay, and another three hundred and eighty thousand were furloughed. This time, the economic and social consequences would be vast. Each week could cost the national economy roughly six billion dollars, according to one projection , and ten thousand low-income students would lose access to Head Start programs. Funding for SNAP benefits, or food stamps, could dry up. Because the cause of a potential shutdown was an internecine political conflict, rather than a disagreement on policy, there wasn't an obvious compromise that could end it. Members expected it to last for weeks, if not longer.\n\nA group of moderates from toss-up districts stated their case that a protracted shutdown would destroy their reëlection prospects. One of them compared the path the Party was on to a bike route down a Bolivian mountain known as the Death Road. According to CNN , McCarthy cut in to ask his members, \"Do we want to jam the Senate?\" There were cheers from everyone but the most conservative members. McCarthy was referring to a continuing resolution to keep the government open for another month and a half. The Senate had already proposed a \"clean C.R.\" to buy time with a bill that had few strings attached; McCarthy now wanted to offer another one that didn't include additional funding for Ukraine. Any \"clean\" bill was anathema to the Freedom Caucus, since it meant keeping the government open without any major concessions from the Senate or the White House.\n\nRight after the meeting concluded, a new bill was on the floor, introduced through an obscure procedure requiring a two-thirds vote for it to pass. The Democrats, who claimed not to have seen the text of the bill until McCarthy introduced it, pleaded for more time. Their motion to adjourn was voted down, so Hakeem Jeffries, the Democratic Minority Leader, delivered a winding speech while members of his party scoured the bill. It passed easily once the Democrats were on board, and McCarthy went out to address the press. \"If somebody wants to make a motion against me, bring it,\" he said. \"There has to be an adult in the room. I am going to govern with what's best for this country.\"\n\nWas this actually an about-face for McCarthy, or was it an act of self-preservation? The irony of his surprise move on Saturday was that it was his only play all along. Certain members of the Freedom Caucus were going to try to oust him irrespective of what he did. A Matt Gaetz confidant told Politico, \"He wants Kevin . . . That's it, and everything else revolves around that.\" Gaetz's allies against the Speaker included others such as Rosendale and Bishop, whose calculus was more ideological than Gaetz's but similarly unyielding. Before Saturday, however, in a sign of the fractiousness roiling the Republican conference, the campaign against McCarthy alienated other members of the Freedom Caucus. \"Not everyone's on board with the motion to vacate,\" a senior Republican staffer told me Friday. \"This is not a united H.F.C. position.\"\n\nMcCarthy had surely hoped to buy good will among House conservatives by exhausting every other option to fend off a shutdown. But now it does seem likely that he's lost the support of ideologues who may find Gaetz distasteful but were nevertheless ready to shut down the government to advance their agenda. On Sunday, Gaetz went on CNN's \"State of the Union\" to announce that he would introduce a motion to vacate the chair in the coming week. \"Speaker McCarthy made an agreement with House conservatives in January and since then he's been in brazen, repeated material breach of that agreement,\" he said. \"This agreement that he made with Democrats to really blow past a lot of the spending guardrails we set up is a last straw.\" The sentiment is widely shared in the Freedom Caucus, but it's unclear how many backers Gaetz will have. According to a report in Politico, there may be as many as a dozen Republicans willing to vote against the Speaker.\n\nIn July, 2015, when Mark Meadows, then a far-right representative from North Carolina, stepped onto the House floor and introduced a motion to vacate the chair against Boehner, the Freedom Caucus did not have enough votes to remove him, and everyone else knew it. Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican from Pennsylvania, was standing near the front of the chamber, watching Meadows launch what Dent later told me was \"a little kamikaze mission.\" Dent went to Boehner's staff to suggest a countermeasure. \"Have a vote,\" he said. \"Let's throttle this little baby of an insurrection while it's still in the bassinet.\"\n\nUltimately, Boehner grew exasperated with the Party's worsening factionalism and decided to step down. But, had he wanted to fight back to reassert his position, he could have. McCarthy simply may not have the votes to stay alive. Enough far-right Republicans seem to oppose him now that he'll need Democrats to reach a majority and keep the speakership. That's another potential rationale behind his last-minute decision to avert a shutdown: at the final possible moment, he was showing that, when necessary, he could abandon his intractable hyper-partisanship.\n\nBut will that be enough to win over skeptical Democrats? The question came up earlier this week in an internal Democratic caucus meeting. \"I thought a riot was going to break out,\" a senior aide in attendance told me. \"Our members were in no mood for that.\" When I asked why, the aide mentioned resentment over the impeachment inquiry. The first hearing was Thursday, in the final hours before the government appeared to be headed toward a shutdown. The Republicans' own witnesses had to concede that there was no evidence against the President. On Sunday, with a shutdown no longer in the offing, the aide and I spoke again. The Democrats, he said, were in a \"wait-and-see mode.\" If McCarthy winds up needing their votes, the aide doubted whether the Democrats would come to his rescue. \"It's a stretch to expect that Dems would bail him out just because he did the right thing by keeping the government open. That's one of Congress's most basic functions. That's not a sufficient price to help save his job given that he's been a big impeachment cheerleader.\" ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "McCarthy's Ouster Is Proof, Once Again, That Appeasement Doesn't Work\n\nThe overthrow began, on Monday evening, with a fittingly juvenile exchange of public taunts. \"Bring it on,\" House Speaker Kevin McCarthy posted, at 7:31 P.M. \"Just did,\" Representative Matt Gaetz replied. Gaetz is the latest in a series of increasingly confrontational Republican members of Congress who have, during the past dozen years, made the job of Speaker in a G.O.P.-controlled Congress one of the capital's most impossible positions. (See: Boehner, John; Ryan, Paul.) This, however, turned out not to be just another episode of the House Republicans' rolling soap opera of dysfunction but an assault by a punk from Florida serious enough to go down in the history books. Gaetz, an acolyte of Donald Trump , followed through on months of threats on Tuesday, using the weapon that McCarthy himself had provided back in January to win the speakership in the first place, when he agreed to a rule allowing a single member to force a vote on a motion to vacate the chair. This was akin to giving Gaetz a loaded gun; it was inevitable that he would pull the trigger. The last time there was a vote on a motion to vacate was in 1910; Joseph Cannon survived and went on to become one of Congress's legendary figures, an iron-fisted ruler whose name today adorns one of the House's three main office buildings. No one, it's safe to conjecture, will be naming any buildings for Kevin McCarthy.\n\nBefore the vote on Tuesday afternoon, it seemed possible that McCarthy could win outright, or lose but survive after more rounds of voting failed to produce a viable alternative. But no one had any idea what would happen if he lost and bowed out. Much would hinge on what the Democrats decided: Would they bail out the Speaker, who, with a mere five-seat House majority and more than five Republicans prepared to vote against him, suddenly needed their votes to remain in power? The answer, Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said in a letter that he released shortly before the floor drama began, was no. This was a \"Republican Civil War\" that Republicans themselves would have to resolve. Other Democrats were even more adamant about rejecting an agreement with McCarthy, whom they reviled not only for years of toadying up to Trump but for breaking his word in recent months to President Biden . How, after all, do you compromise with a man whom Abigail Spanberger, a moderate Democrat from Virginia, called \"likely the most unprincipled person to ever be Speaker of the House\"? Then again, this was Washington, so the possibility of a deal with Democrats could not be entirely ruled out.\n\nThe rebellion, such as it was, consisted of Gaetz and his small coterie of allies ranting about McCarthy's sins. Much of their immediate anger concerned McCarthy's decision, on Saturday, to avert a government shutdown , by passing a forty-five-day continuing resolution that would temporarily keep the U.S. open for business while Congress worked to pass the rest of its annual spending bills. Such last-minute maneuvers are commonplace on Capitol Hill and hardly a reason to take the unprecedented step of removing a Speaker. McCarthy's capital sin, according to Gaetz, was working with Democrats, which gave the proceedings an especially absurd flair, given that Gaetz would be relying on Democratic votes to oust McCarthy and was himself making this point from the Democratic side of the aisle, having been blocked by McCarthy's allies from speaking from any of the Republican-controlled microphones. As for the Democrats, they stayed silent for the entirety of the debate, adhering to the wise political rule that when your opponents are busy shooting themselves in the foot, it's best to give them room to do it.\n\nIn the end, it took only around two hours and a mere eight members of the Republican conference to render McCarthy the shortest-serving Speaker of the House since 1876, when Michael Kerr died, of tuberculosis, after only nine months in office. By 7:30 P.M. , McCarthy was holding a press conference that sounded a lot like a eulogy for himself-long on self-praise, short on self-examination. As for what comes next, an election for a new Speaker is currently scheduled for next Wednesday, but, the truth is, no one really knows what will happen. The U.S. House has ceased to function. Republicans have an ungovernable majority and a small minority bent on obstruction. Gaetz and company are rebels without a real cause, except that of chaos itself.\n\nThe political-obituary writers will not be as kind to McCarthy as he was to himself. The fifty-fifth Speaker of the House turned out to be one of the weakest America has ever had, a man whose overriding ambition seemed merely to have been obtaining the job itself and whose willingness to make a bad deal to get it proved to be his predictable undoing.\n\nBy nature an accommodationist , McCarthy was brought down by the surging Trumpist forces within his caucus that he had sought for years to placate. His humiliation, in that sense, is the Republican Party's writ large-the humiliation of bowing to Trump again and again, only to be met with more and more outrageous demands. McCarthy is modern proof that appeasement doesn't work.\n\nThe record of his suck-uppery to Trump and the Trumpists is too long to recount in full. Perhaps it's enough to recall that Trump nicknamed him \"my Kevin,\" and that, during Trump's Presidency, McCarthy was reported to have sent over to the White House a jar of Trump's favorite Starbursts, carefully culled of all but his favorite red and pink candies. It was McCarthy's egregious behavior in the aftermath of the January 6th attack on the U.S. Capitol by a pro-Trump mob, however, that really proved him to be a hopeless stooge.\n\nMcCarthy was reportedly enraged by the events of the day, calling Trump in a fury and blaming him for the rampage. He continued to criticize Trump, in public and private, during the following days-\"I've had it with this guy,\" he huffed, on tape, as it turned out, to fellow Republican leaders. And yet he voted, along with a large majority of his conference, to go along with Trump's campaign of lies about nonexistent voter fraud and refused to certify Biden's election. Within weeks, McCarthy was flying to Mar-a-Lago to pose with the defeated ex-President-a visual that spoke to the Republican Party's decision not to exorcise Trump once and for all but to stick with him.\n\nAnd yet, for all that McCarthy did for Trump, it was no surprise that Trump declined to step in and do anything to save McCarthy's tenuous speakership. On the contrary, Trump publicly cheered on those like Gaetz, who were pushing for a government shutdown over McCarthy's frantic efforts to stop it. As the coup unfolded, Gaetz gleefully told reporters that he had spoken with the ex-President.\n\nThe damage that McCarthy did to the House in his vain attempts to stay in power will not be measured only in abstractions. His concessions were all too real. Take, for example, the flip-flop he did last month in opening an impeachment inquiry into Biden, based on years of unproved allegations that Biden might have benefitted from the dubious foreign business dealings of his son Hunter . This had long been one of the main demands of Trump and his most vocal supporters in the House. But McCarthy had promised not to take such a step without a vote of the full House, and then, when he did not have the votes, did so unilaterally anyway. The inquiry will not just magically disappear now that McCarthy is gone. On the contrary, one of its main proponents-the Ohio Republican Jim Jordan -on Wednesday became the first declared candidate to replace McCarthy as Speaker.\n\nThe same is true of McCarthy's dangerous brinkmanship with funding for the war in Ukraine . He claims to be a strong supporter of Ukraine's, but, faced with rising opposition to continued financial support for Ukraine within his conference-again, fuelled by Trump-he stripped out the Ukraine dollars that were in the continuing resolution proposed by the Senate to avert the shutdown. He also refused to act on a supplemental appropriation of twenty-four billion dollars for Ukraine that the Biden Administration sent to Congress in August. Is a new Speaker really going to want to confront the rebels right away by going to bat for Ukraine?\n\nIt's all part of the McCarthy mess. And don't believe anyone who says it will be easy to clean up.\n\nMcCarthy himself, in his valedictory press conference, was asked what advice he would have for a new Speaker. \"Change the rules,\" he said, smiling.

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy's Hollow Victory Will Have Economic and Political Consequences\n\nEarly Saturday morning, amid scenes redolent of the nineteenth century, when brawls occasionally broke out on the floor of the House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy was elected Speaker of the 118th Congress. After it was all over-after McCarthy had angrily confronted the holdout Matt Gaetz in full view of the C- SPAN cameras; after a fellow-congressman had to grab the McCarthy ally Mike Rogers, of Alabama, around the throat to keep him from lunging at Gaetz; after enough of the holdouts had finally agreed to end this four-day political debacle in a fifteenth ballot-after all that, the best the fifty-seven-year-old Californian could manage, when his Democratic opponent Hakeem Jeffries finally handed him the wooden gavel, was a lame wisecrack, followed by a telling admission. \"That was easy, huh?\" McCarthy said. \"I never thought we'd get up here.\"\n\nBe careful what you wish for. Perhaps the most revealing image of the ugly night came shortly after the final ballot had been completed. As McCarthy sat waiting for the official tally, Marjorie Taylor Greene, the far-right election denier and conspiracy theorist who represents Georgia's Fourteenth District, crouched down beside him to take a cheek-to-cheek picture with the soon-to-be Speaker. In February, 2021, eleven House Republicans voted with the Democrats to strip Greene of her committee assignments. McCarthy wasn't among them, but he did issue a statement \"unequivocally\" condemning some of her incendiary statements, which included endorsing political violence against Democrats and suggesting that some school shootings had been staged. After McCarthy's tortuous elevation, things are very different. In return for backing McCarthy, Greene will likely receive new committee assignments and be treated, by Party leaders, as an important ally, despite the fact that just last month she said the January 6th insurrection would have succeeded if she and Steve Bannon had been in charge of it. Based on his own self-serving modus operandi, McCarthy doesn't have much choice but to comply; if he is to get anything done over the next two years, he will need to retain the support of Greene and many other far-right extremists.\n\nThis prospect is already raising alarms on Wall Street, where attention is focussing on the need to raise the debt ceiling and prevent a U.S. government default-an imperative that will probably become pressing by the summer. Earlier this week, Representative Ralph Norman, of South Carolina, who is a member of the Freedom Caucus, called on McCarthy to \"shut down the government rather than raise the debt ceiling,\" adding that this demand was \"a non-negotiable item.\" In this instance, it would be a mistake to focus exclusively on the MAGA crazies: months ago, McCarthy and Senator John Thune, of South Dakota, both made clear that they favored using the debt limit to force big cuts in spending. But McCarthy's humiliation has made clear how little flexibility he will have in managing his own caucus during the debt-ceiling brinkmanship.\n\nA repeat of the 2011 debt-ceiling crisis, in which the G.O.P.-led House of Representatives defied President Barack Obama, now seems likely, and it could be a lengthy one. Ultimately, perhaps, even the members of the Freedom Caucus won't want to be held responsible for a financial crash that tanks their voters' 401(k) plans and endangers the mighty dollar, especially at the start of another Presidential-election campaign. But who really knows?\n\nMore immediately, McCarthy's hollow victory opens the way for months more of G.O.P. performance art, which will likely encompass passing legislation that has no chance of being enacted by the Democratic-controlled Senate and holding innumerable conspiracy-theory-stoking hearings into the COVID -19 pandemic, Hunter Biden, and anything else that might garner favorable coverage on Fox News and Newsmax. Along the way, the enduring fealty of many House Republicans to Donald Trump is also likely to become clear.\n\nThe new rules agreement for the 118th Congress, to which McCarthy acceded in order to win over the MAGA holdouts, and which will almost certainly be voted through on Monday, calls for the establishment of three new investigative subcommittees. The first would look into the origins and handling of the pandemic, and would surely zero in on Anthony Fauci, a frequent target of right-wing attacks. The second would examine \"the Strategic Competition Between the United States and the Chinese Communist Party.\" And the third would address the \"Weaponization of the Federal Government\"-more or less the adoption of a far-right slogan that implies the \"Deep State\" is targeting ordinary American citizens.\n\nIn a letter to his fellow-Republicans last week, McCarthy said this third panel would be modelled on the nineteen-seventies Church Committee, which examined abuses by the F.B.I., the C.I.A., the I.R.S., and the National Security Agency. Characterizing it this way makes a mockery of history. Senator Frank Church, the Idaho Democrat who led the bipartisan Church Committee, was an Army veteran who turned against the Vietnam War and also campaigned for environmental protection. The new subcommittee would operate under the auspices of the House Judiciary Committee, which Jim Jordan, the right-wing Ohio firebrand who led Trump's impeachment defense in January, 2021, is expected to chair. Under the proposed rules agreement, the subcommittee would have the authority to examine \"how executive branch agencies collect, compile, analyze, use, or disseminate information about citizens of the United States, including any unconstitutional, illegal, or unethical activities committed against citizens of the United States.\" The agreement also states explicitly that this authority would extend to \"ongoing criminal investigations.\" On Saturday, Politico reported that this reference appeared to have been added to the rules during last-minute negotiations between McCarthy and his ultra-right opponents. Although Trump is not named explicitly, the added language would appear to give the new subcommittee license to look into, and perhaps hold up, the Justice Department's investigations of his efforts to overturn the 2020 election and his post-Presidential mishandling of hundreds of classified documents. In a televised interview, David Jolly, a former Republican congressman from Florida, said that the establishment of the committee was almost like legitimizing the January 6th insurrection.\n\nThat helps explain why Trump supported McCarthy to the end. (During the drama on Friday night, the Lear of Mar-a-Lago called several MAGA holdouts to ask them to support the beleaguered Californian.) But it doesn't explain how the Republican Party has been reduced to this sorry state, or why McCarthy would still want the job of Speaker in these circumstances. For some questions, there are no good answers.  ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy and the Republicans' Rocky Road Ahead\n\nThe simplest thing, usually, for a new congressional majority to do is elect a Speaker of the House. Often, the choice has been made in advance: the candidate grins, the chyron gives the tally, a press conference announcing the legislative agenda awaits. This month, the House Republicans, who won a slim majority in November, took fifteen votes and nearly a week to settle on Kevin McCarthy , even though he has led the Party since 2019 and had no serious opponent. The holdouts were about twenty members of the Party's far-right wing, but, even as each vote ended and the next one began, no one really seemed able to say what the conflict was about. John James, whose election in November made him the first Black Republican to represent Michigan in Congress, and who supported McCarthy, pointed out that the last time it had taken so many votes to pick a Speaker was in 1856. \"The issues today are over a few rules and personalities,\" James said. \"While the issues at that time were about slavery and whether the value of a man who looks like me was sixty per cent or a hundred per cent of a human being.\"\n\nThe dividing line between the large number of Republicans backing McCarthy and the smaller, obstinate group standing in his way wasn't exactly ideological. Each camp included some of the prominent election deniers of the House Freedom Caucus. Ohio's Jim Jordan, long one of the most prominent hardliners, was in position to chair the Judiciary Committee, and had allied with McCarthy; so had the Georgia conspiracist Marjorie Taylor Greene , who had reportedly been promised a top committee assignment. The rebels included the Stop the Steal stalwarts Paul Gosar and Scott Perry, as well as the media-focussed right-wingers: Lauren Boebert, of Colorado, who faced calls to be stripped of committee assignments after making anti-Muslim slurs about her Democratic colleague Ilhan Omar; and Matt Gaetz, of Florida, who has been the subject of a federal investigation for sex trafficking but has not faced any charges. Up close, the distinction between these factions sometimes collapsed into personal grievances or turf war. The most dramatic moment came when the McCarthy ally Mike Rogers, of Alabama, lunged toward Gaetz, and was physically restrained. Only later did Politico report that Gaetz had been lobbying to run a subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, which Rogers was set to chair.\n\nThis mess of personality conflicts and power struggles reflects a core Republican problem right now. The style of the Party is thoroughly Trumpist, and yet its agenda is no longer defined by Trump's specific fixations and fights. Before the fourth vote, the former President issued a statement urging all Republicans to support McCarthy; that failed to move anyone. In the final phase, Greene got Trump on speakerphone and tried to persuade one holdout, Montana's Matt Rosendale, to talk with him. Rosendale, who is enough of a Trump stalwart that he had voted against awarding a Gold Medal to the police officers who defended the Capitol on January 6th, just waved Greene and the former President away.\n\nIn many ways, the G.O.P. has underprepared for the post-Trump era. In 2020, Republicans declined to put forward any formal platform, and they went light on policy in the 2022 midterm campaigns, hoping instead that a reaction against economic inflation and President Biden's unpopularity would sweep them to big majorities. Even Newt Gingrich, interviewed in the Times this month, drew a pointed distinction between the Republican insurgents whom he organized around the Contract with America, in 1994, and the current generation. \"We weren't just grandstanders. We were purposeful,\" Gingrich said. (He also accused Gaetz of \"essentially bringing 'Lord of the Flies' to the House of Representatives.\") In addition to a murky agenda, the Republicans have a weak leader in McCarthy, who is neither especially well known among his party's voters nor especially well liked by them. A Monmouth poll last month found that just twenty-nine per cent of Republicans approved of McCarthy, twenty per cent disapproved, and about half had no opinion.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, the way that McCarthy eventually won over his opponents may provide a clue to how he will operate. Mostly, he traded leverage away for support. He agreed to lower the threshold for replacing a Speaker, and to keep a McCarthy-aligned super PAC from picking sides in Republican primaries. Substantively, he agreed to establish a new select subcommittee on the \"weaponization\" of the federal government which Jordan is expected to lead, and is likely to begin with investigations into the Obama-era classified documents that recently turned up in an office that President Biden had used and at his home. (The new Speaker has also agreed to consider formally expunging Trump's impeachment.) More ominously, McCarthy agreed not to raise the debt ceiling without extracting offsetting spending cuts. That concession suggests that the House's year, which seems set to start with investigations into Hunter Biden and border policy, may be punctuated with a standoff over the debt ceiling, in which Republicans threaten to default on the government's debt in the name of small-government principle. And he gave opponents the committee seats they wanted. Fox News asked Byron Donalds, a second-term Black congressman from Florida, whom the insurgents had repeatedly nominated for Speaker, \"What did you get?\" The answer was a spot on the Party's steering committee. Gaetz said that the opposition to McCarthy's election stopped because \"we ran out of stuff to ask for.\"\n\nIf this is, in fact, how the new Speaker has to govern, by cutting individual deals in order to preserve his majority, then his tenure is likely to move from crisis to crisis and may well be short. Already there are little fires everywhere in the caucus: some moderates have balked at the concessions made to the Gaetz faction, at the possibility that McCarthy's debt-ceiling commitments will mean sharp defense cuts, and even at the caucus's extreme line on abortion, which South Carolina's Nancy Mace, a McCarthy ally, denounced as \"tone deaf.\" The main preoccupation of McCarthy's first week as Speaker was the case of the freshman Representative George Santos, of New York, who, in his bid for office, appears to have made up just about every element of his biography: a sterling business record, Jewish heritage, even a star turn on the Baruch College volleyball team. (He was also wanted for fraud in Brazil.) Both the Nassau County G.O.P. and the five other freshman Republicans from New York have called for him to resign, but not McCarthy, whom Santos supported and who doesn't have the margin to cut loose even an obvious liability. It might seem like good news for Democrats that the Republican leadership is this weak-except that weak Republican leadership is what paved the way for Trump in the first place. ♦\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

      "text": "The Risky Gamble of Kevin McCarthy's Debt-Ceiling Strategy\n\nEarlier this month, when Kevin McCarthy announced that House Republicans had drafted a bill to raise the debt ceiling, Party members began showing up at his office to make demands and extract concessions. Republicans have a five-vote majority, so any holdout wields outsized influence. The parade of visitors to the Speaker's office included extremists from the Freedom Caucus, the entire Iowa delegation, and Nancy Mace, a legislator from South Carolina who'd been pushing for a clearer plan to balance the federal budget. They entered as nos and left as yeses. Even the Party's most recalcitrant members said that they felt \"heard.\" On Wednesday evening, the bill passed the House, with four Republican members voting against it. McCarthy claimed victory and said it was now up to the President to prevent a catastrophic government default. \"We lifted the debt limit. We've sent it to the Senate. We've done our job.\"\n\nIn January, far-right Republican representatives threatened to block McCarthy's Speakership and, after fifteen rounds of voting, emerged with plum committee assignments and the power to easily remove him from his post. This time, a principle of mutual self-interest made it slightly easier on him. House Republicans are using the threat of a government default as leverage to force Joe Biden and the Democrat-controlled Senate to agree to a litany of conservative spending cuts. \"The President does not want to negotiate unless he can see that the Republicans can get two hundred eighteen votes,\" Don Bacon, a Republican from Nebraska and self-described pragmatic conservative, told me. Passing a bill \"shows Biden that we're serious.\" Without a bill, the conference would be completely irrelevant. How could Democrats negotiate over a nonexistent proposal? \"They know we get screwed if we don't get something,\" a senior Republican staffer told me. A former G.O.P. leadership aide said that Republicans \"have to pass [the bill]. If not, they're fucked, and there's no Plan B.\"\n\nThe bill's text, according to Politico , was the product of a coördinated campaign by members of the Freedom Caucus which began immediately after McCarthy became Speaker. Knowing that the debt-ceiling fight would be the defining event of McCarthy's Speakership, they wanted to press their advantage. Their bill would include strict work requirements for Medicaid and food stamps, major slashes to discretionary spending, and the elimination of unused pandemic aid. In exchange for some hundred and thirty billion dollars in cuts to next year's budget, the Republicans would agree to raise the debt ceiling until March, 2024. The proposals came out of a series of conversations with competing factions inside the House conference known as \"the five families.\" But the conservatives who've given McCarthy the greatest trouble are the ones he seemed to have paid the most attention to. \"The leadership just picked up the House Freedom Caucus plan and helped us convert it into the legislative text,\" Matt Gaetz, a Freedom Caucus member from Florida, said .\n\nAnd yet the Freedom Caucus's demands kept mounting. Eventually, the three-hundred-page bill-the Limit, Save, Grow Act-turned into an attack on the Inflation Reduction Act , arguably Biden's crowning legislative achievement. The Republican bill would, among other things, gut the I.R.A.'s green-energy tax incentives, endangering at least a hundred thousand jobs , the vast majority of which were bound for Republican districts. This week, McCarthy pared back some of the bill's measures in response to objections from other members. But the crux of it remained intact. \"There wasn't a strategy,\" a Democratic House staffer told me. \"They cut where they could get votes. It's all posturing.\" Chuck Schumer, the Senate Majority Leader, said the bill \"might as well be called the Default on America Act, because that's exactly what it is: D.O.A., dead on arrival.\"\n\nThat the bill will go nowhere in the Senate was the reason McCarthy could wrangle support for it in the first place. It was an opening gambit. \"What we'll end up with will look different,\" Bacon, the Nebraska Republican, told me.\n\nA government default, which would likely plunge the U.S. into recession and sink the world economy, was politically unthinkable until 2011. At the time, Republicans controlled the House and Democrats controlled the Senate, and a new conservative movement called the Tea Party was ascendant. \"They said right from the get-go, egged on by Kevin McCarthy and Eric Cantor, that they were going to use the debt ceiling as a hostage with a series of non-negotiable demands,\" Norman Ornstein, an emeritus scholar at the center-right American Enterprise Institute, told me. \"John Boehner knew that if we breached the debt ceiling it would be catastrophic, but it was the beginning of the end of his Speakership.\" To avert disaster, Boehner eventually cut a deal with the Obama White House-apostasy in the eyes of his rank and file-but the U.S.'s credit rating was downgraded for the first time in history. \"Just because we came close,\" Ornstein said.\n\nThe current course is much more worrisome. The Republican majority is far slimmer than it was in 2011, meaning the extremists have more sway. The Freedom Caucus didn't exist before 2015, when they coalesced around Boehner's ouster from the Speakership; their members, Ornstein said, \"make the Tea Party people look like statesmen.\" Last October, when I spoke to Representative Adam Kinzinger, an old McCarthy ally who became a bitter critic, he told me , \"The debt limit scares the shit out of me.\" Previous Republican Speakers were willing to make deals with Democrats and could rely on a critical mass of pragmatists in the G.O.P. \"It's going to be hard for McCarthy to cut deals,\" Kinzinger predicted. Part of the problem, the former leadership aide told me, comparing 2011 with 2023, is that \"Boehner gave a shit about something other than himself.\"\n\nMcCarthy is a careerist with a flexible set of principles and a history of catering to the far right. \"He's great at putting people in a room,\" a Republican lawmaker told me. \"When it comes to hardball, that's not Kevin's forte.\" His preference has always been to find ways of giving his colleagues what they want, a quality that has earned him the loyalty of many members but also made him vulnerable. In 2015, after Boehner was forced from the Speakership , McCarthy was a heavy favorite for the job. When he ran, the Freedom Caucus blocked him at the eleventh hour. \"You have to understand this about Kevin McCarthy,\" Carlos Curbelo, a Florida Republican who served in the House at the time, told me, \"Most people who would have gone through that experience ultimately wouldn't have survived it. They would have left Congress or certainly left the leadership team. Kevin stayed and was able to remain because he has built so much good will at a personal level with members.\" At times, that has meant elevating old enemies and rivals. Jim Jordan-who opposed McCarthy for Speaker in 2015 and unsuccessfully challenged him for Minority Leader three years later-is the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. Marjorie Taylor Greene, whom McCarthy has brought into the establishment fold, has become one of his most prominent boosters.\n\nCongressional Republicans and the White House are now operating on a set of clashing assumptions. McCarthy thinks Biden will feel pressured to start negotiating; the President expects Republicans to blink. At the White House, officials have been looking at 2011 polling data, which showed that voters ultimately blamed congressional Republicans, and not the President, for the debt-ceiling fight. An economic analysis by Moody's projected that the Republican budget would result in the loss of nearly eight hundred thousand jobs. \"They're in Congress threatening to undo all the stuff that you helped me get done,\" Biden told union workers in Maryland last week. \"You and the American people should know about the competing economic visions of the country that are at stake right now.\" He called McCarthy's plan \"the MAGA economic vision.\" Before the House passed its budget proposal, the White House said that it would refuse to negotiate on spending if the Republicans tied the talks to the debt ceiling. Its line was unchanged after Wednesday's vote. \"I'm happy to meet with McCarthy, but not on whether or not the debt limit gets extended,\" the President said. \"That's not negotiable.\"\n\nWith a majority as tenuous as McCarthy's, every member matters, but those who matter most are the ones who are least willing to compromise. During the Speaker's race, moderate Republicans were frustrated that a relatively small number of extremists could effectively hold everyone hostage. This week, with the passage of a spending bill that had been shaped by the conference's most conservative members, I expected a similar sentiment. Yet the moderates I spoke with were more focussed on the President than their Party's right flank. \"Most of the big spending negotiations took place during the debt-ceiling negotiations,\" David Joyce, an Ohio Republican who chairs the Republican Governance Group, a moderate coalition, told me. He pointed out that Biden, as Vice-President, had led the Obama Administration's debt-ceiling negotiations in 2011. \"He said at the time, 'We got to make some real progress on the long-term debt,' \" Joyce said. \"Back then, our national debt was fourteen trillion dollars. Today, it's over thirty-one. And now you refuse to negotiate?\"\n\nBacon, who is a member of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus, helped lead a round of talks earlier this spring about a framework for moving forward if the White House and McCarthy remained at odds. \"We're sixty-four people that know we need to negotiate,\" he said. \"We wanted to provide more of a decision framework versus hard numbers.\" Ultimately, they proposed lifting the debt ceiling and then creating a long-term commission to study deficit spending. \"Congress is too fractured to do a proposal on its own,\" he said. But, he added, that only made it more urgent for Biden to broker a deal. \"Reasonable Americans know we should negotiate,\" Bacon said. \"We can't get everything we want. And I hope Biden understands that he can't get everything he wants.\"\n\nMeanwhile, there's a danger that the White House and congressional Republicans will begin to look equally implicated in the impasse. Ornstein, who considers the Republicans to be the obvious instigators, told me that \"many of them understand that the mainstream press isn't going to treat this as a reckless terrorist act by House Republicans. They're going to normalize this. They're going to say, 'Why isn't Biden negotiating?' \"\n\nThe White House's dilemma is real. Some congressional Democrats have already called on Biden to begin talks with McCarthy. There are a few potential areas of compromise: the government could institute modest caps on future spending and it could reform permitting requirements for fossil-fuel and other energy projects, issues that, the former leadership aide told me, \"have been bipartisan in the past or are now.\" If Biden doesn't come to the table, the country is at the mercy of an erratic Republican majority that the Speaker himself can barely control. If he does, the Republicans will have got him there through sheer bullying. And then what? No one expects hard-line House Republicans to give any ground. McCarthy would have to be willing to cut a deal that risks his Speakership.\n\nThe morning after the House bill passed, I spoke with Steny Hoyer, a veteran Democratic congressman from Maryland and a former House Majority Leader. When Nancy Pelosi was Speaker, she refused to deal with McCarthy, whom she called a \" moron ,\" so Hoyer was his main interlocutor with Democratic leadership. \"I don't think anyone has any illusions about that bill,\" Hoyer told me. \"It was part of a process.\" He cited McCarthy's recent speech at the New York Stock Exchange, where he had said that a default wasn't an option. That was the \"most relevant part,\" Hoyer said. \"I think that's what he believes.\" But the fates of John Boehner and Paul Ryan, who broke with the fringes of their conference and left Party leadership, are not lost on McCarthy. \"What he's trying to do is find some sort of sweet spot where he can rationalize without losing the Speakership,\" Hoyer said. \"He's pretty pragmatic. That's as kind a way as I can say it.\" ♦\n\nAn earlier version of this article misstated the makeup of the U.S. Senate in 2011.\n\nA husband in the aftermath of his wife's unfathomable act .\n\nThirteen ways of looking at a Black man .\n\nThe end of children .\n\nThe radical woman behind \"Goodnight Moon.\"\n\nThe scientist who refused to spy .\n\nHow \"The Last of Us\" became prestige TV .\n\n\"Welcome to Los Angeles\"?

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nHow McCarthy got into this mess, who'll be speaker next, and more.\n\nby Nicole Narea and Andrew Prokop\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has endorsed Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH), a conservative firebrand and the powerful chair of the House Judiciary Committee, to be the next House speaker.\n\nIn a Friday post on his social media platform Truth Social , Trump said Jordan \"is STRONG on Crime, Borders, our Military/Vets, & 2nd Amendment ... He will be a GREAT Speaker of the House.\"\n\nTrump's endorsement will likely help Jordan, but may not be enough to ensure he defeats his chief rival for the speaker position, Louisiana's Rep. Steve Scalise, the Republican majority leader. At the moment, both appear to be struggling to capture the 218 votes needed to become the next speaker.\n\nAs each lawmaker works to solidify support, legislative business in the House has ground to a halt at a moment when lawmakers are staring down a fast-approaching November deadline to fund the government for the next year.\n\nAll this comes after House Republicans ousted Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) as speaker in an unprecedented vote, leaving them scrambling to pick a replacement who can unify a caucus that has recently struggled to agree on key legislative priorities.\n\nThe party's more conservative and far-right members had long been a thorn in McCarthy's side and finally brought about his downfall less than 10 months after he won a hard-fought contest for the speakership. Democrats refused to save McCarthy after he ruled out making concessions in exchange for their support.\n\nThe speakership drama has been yet another display of congressional dysfunction wrought by the GOP, just days after Republican hardliners prepared to shut down the government over a laundry list of unattainable demands. And it raises doubts about whether anyone can keep the Republican caucus in line enough to carry out the basic functions of the House - or if chaos will continue regardless of who's in the speaker's chair.\n\nHere are your biggest questions about the fallout from McCarthy's ousting and what could happen next, answered.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) led the charge to strip McCarthy of the speakership after he cut a deal with Democrats to fund the government for another 45 days - just before it would have otherwise shut down at the hands of right-wing rebels in the caucus. Gaetz brought a motion to vacate on the House floor, a procedural move that had never before been successfully used to oust a speaker.\n\nThis time, however, was different.\n\nAlthough McCarthy had most of his caucus behind him, he needed a majority of the House to vote against his removal to stay in power. At the moment, the GOP has a four-vote majority, and on October 3, a total of eight Republicans joined all present Democrats in voting to depose McCarthy. Five of them - Reps. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Ken Buck (R-CO), Eli Crane (R-AZ), Bob Good (R-VA), and Matt Rosendale (R-MT) - are members of the ultra-conservative House Freedom Caucus.\n\nThat was it for McCarthy.\n\nThe key thing to know here is that McCarthy came in as a weak speaker who got the top job by making promises that would ultimately be difficult to keep - and concessions that would lead to his undoing.\n\nHis elevation to speaker took place after an excruciating four days and 15 ballots of voting this January - the messiest speaker election since 1860 . During that process, he had the loyalty of most House Republicans but struggled to lock down support from about 20 right-wing holdouts. Eventually he got enough of them, in part by making various promises about how spending bills would be handled. He also agreed to a rule that lets any House member force a vote on his ouster at any time - handing his critics a powerful weapon, the \"motion to vacate the chair.\"\n\nThen McCarthy had to actually govern the House in a time of divided party control of government. With Republicans unable to pass any laws on their own, the issues that inevitably rose to the top of the agenda were the \"must-pass\" measures Congress perpetually grapples with: the debt ceiling , and funding of the federal government. Many conservatives hate voting for both of these, and they especially hate any deal with Democrats struck over them. But actually breaching the debt ceiling or keeping the government shut down forever would be a disaster for the country and likely a political disaster for the GOP.\n\nSo McCarthy tried to convince the far right that he was driving as hard a bargain as he could with President Joe Biden and Senate Democrats on those matters. He kept his GOP conference united through the debt ceiling talks, eventually arriving at a pretty reasonable compromise in late May that lifted the debt ceiling.\n\nBut the government still had to be funded by September 30 or a shutdown would ensue. And that's where things went off the rails. McCarthy could not fulfill the various promises he'd made about how spending bills would be handled, and couldn't get many of the same GOP holdouts who wouldn't support his speakership bid to back anything halfway realistic.\n\nAs the deadline approached, McCarthy made various attempts to unite Republicans around a negotiating strategy, all of which failed. He also threw some red meat to the base - for instance, by announcing last month that he was opening an impeachment inquiry into President Biden - which many viewed as an attempt to pacify the hard right before the inevitable ugly spending deal.\n\nGaetz sharply critiqued McCarthy's efforts throughout the entire process, eventually saying he and his allies wouldn't back any short-term deal that would keep the government open as full-year spending negotiations continued. With hours to go before a shutdown, McCarthy finally put up exactly the sort of stopgap bill Gaetz was against for a vote. It passed due to Democratic backing, averting a shutdown for 45 days.\n\nAfter that, Gaetz struck, saying McCarthy had been a failed leader, and used the motion to vacate to force a vote on McCarthy's ouster.\n\nMost of the eight Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy cited the 45-day government funding bill, saying it was a symptom of his broader failure to secure big enough conservative wins and change the way things are done in Washington.\n\nMany of McCarthy's opponents want to see spending cuts that seem clearly unrealistic, and wanted to have extended debates on full-year spending bills there was simply no time for (unless these discussions were held while the government was shut down).\n\nBut some had other motivations. Gaetz, who led the charge, has reportedly blamed McCarthy for letting a congressional ethics investigation into him proceed. The Justice Department had investigated Gaetz over a purported sexual relationship with a 17-year-old, but the probe ended in no charges for him. But the House Ethics Committee's probe of Gaetz continued this year, focusing on \"allegations that he may have engaged in sexual misconduct, illicit drug use, or other misconduct,\" per CNN . McCarthy has repeatedly said Gaetz wanted him out as revenge for the ethics investigation , something Gaetz has often denied .\n\nMeanwhile, Rep. Matt Rosendale (R-MT) is expected to run for the Senate , and this could conceivably help him appeal to the GOP base in a primary. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-SC) was a surprising defector with a complaint from the left; she claimed McCarthy didn't do enough for women in the post- Roe era. But the others - Reps. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), Tim Burchett (R-TN), Eli Crane (R-AZ), Bob Good (R-VA), and Ken Buck (R-CO) - have been pretty consistent anti-spending hardliners.\n\nAs Gaetz's motion to vacate loomed, Washington was full of speculation over whether Democrats would save McCarthy, who after all had just helped keep the government open.\n\nIt is unclear whether McCarthy engaged in any serious effort to make a deal with Democrats to keep his job. Jake Sherman of Punchbowl News reported that McCarthy called House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) the night before the vote, and that he told his Democratic counterpart he wasn't open to making any concessions to save himself. After his ouster, though, McCarthy told the GOP conference ( per Sherman ) that the Democrats came to him trying to make a deal, but that he didn't want to.\n\nDemocrats had a lot of say over what happened to McCarthy - his narrow majority meant he'd be able to keep his job if even just a handful of Democrats decided to back him. In the end, though, none did. The party voted instead to kick him out, providing 208 of the 216 votes for his ouster.\n\nBad blood is one reason. Many Democrats simply dislike McCarthy and think he's been a terrible speaker. Grievances include his kicking some Democrats off committees , opening the impeachment inquiry into Biden, and generally minimizing both Trump's attempt to steal the election and the January 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol.\n\nFar from thanking McCarthy for keeping the government open, many Democrats were furious about how he handled things - they complained about him jamming a bill they hadn't read on them at the last minute and about a TV interview in which he preposterously tried to claim that it was Democrats who really wanted a shutdown.\n\nDemocrats also likely believe that headlines about messy GOP House chaos are good for Democrats politically. The party's goal is to beat the GOP and win back their own majority, not to help them be more reasonable.\n\nYet the risk is that they've traded the devil they know for one they don't. Say what you will about McCarthy, he did avoid a debt ceiling breach and a government shutdown. The next speaker, seeing what happened to McCarthy, may well feel compelled to cater even more to the hard right's demands.\n\nMcCarthy is the first speaker to be deposed in this way, but Speaker John Boehner was also headed for that fate in 2015 - he just resigned before the motion to oust him was voted on.\n\nInternecine warfare and revolts against the speaker have been a common feature of House GOP politics in recent years, in a way that precedes Donald Trump 's rise to power and that we simply don't see replicated among Senate Republicans or Democrats in either chamber. We can think of the problem in three parts.\n\nFirst, there has long been a rump faction of the House GOP that is uninterested in governance or compromise - because they hold extreme policy views, because they want to pander to the conservative base for political reasons, or both. (The leftmost members of the Democratic Party, by contrast, have generally been willing to cut deals and to back party leadership when asked.)\n\nSecond, some quirks of House rules give that rump outsize power. The speaker is elected by the whole 435-member House of Representatives, not just its GOP members. So if McCarthy couldn't win over any votes from Democrats, that means, if all members are present and voting, he would need 218 Republicans to back him to be speaker. That's why he struggled so much back in January to win the speakership in the first place.\n\nThere is no similar mechanism in the Senate, where party leaders are elected privately by senators of their own party. Additionally, the motion to vacate the chair rule allows any troublemaking member to essentially force a vote of no confidence in the speaker before the full House - McCarthy had hoped to raise the threshold , but gave in to holdout Republicans who have now used this tool to force him out.\n\nThird, because Democrats did better than expected in last year's midterm elections, the Republican House majority was historically small - just 222 Republicans were elected. That means that, again, unless McCarthy won over Democrats, he needed to hold onto almost all of the hardest of the GOP's hardliners to be elected speaker or to survive the motion to vacate. He actually did a decent job of pacifying most of them, but in the end, eight were enough to fire him.\n\nThe House cannot function as normal without a speaker. Rep. Patrick McHenry (R-NC) was appointed interim speaker as Republicans work to figure out who will lead their caucus, and the House, from here. But he can't bring legislation to the House floor as speaker pro tempore.\n\nThat means that regular business in the House will be interrupted until a new speaker is selected. And that, if the past is predictive, could take days.\n\nAgain, it took four days, lots of concessions, and 15 rounds of voting before McCarthy finally won the speakership. Given that divisions between those conservatives and moderates in the GOP conference are deeper than ever - with some McCarthy allies even crying on the House floor and suggesting that there may have been physical altercations had the chamber not adjourned immediately after McCarthy's ouster - this vote could play out similarly. Democrats, for their part, plan to vote for Minority Leader Jeffries, meaning that Republicans will have to reach near-consensus on a new speaker.\n\nThe search for a new speaker threatens to delay several key legislative priorities, including a deal to prevent the government from shutting down in November and funding for the war in Ukraine .\n\nFinancial analysts have projected that the likelihood of a government shutdown when the temporary stopgap funding expires on November 17 has increased now that there is a leadership vacuum in the House. The next speaker faces the difficult task of balancing the demands of conservative hardliners with the reality of having to pass a spending bill that Democrats in the White House and Senate would support.\n\nFunding for the war in Ukraine has also proved a sticking point in the spending fight amid waning public support for continuing to aid the country's war efforts against Russia . Conservative hardliners - including possible replacement Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) - have opposed sending further funds, and the stopgap funding deal that McCarthy negotiated did not include funding for Ukraine, which is running low on money and munitions .\n\nThough the House can't bring legislation to the floor, other business in the chamber can proceed - albeit potentially on a delayed basis. That includes House Republicans' impeachment inquiry of Biden, which had a bumpy start during a hearing in which Republicans struggled to tie the president to the alleged misdeeds of his son, Hunter Biden.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee is continuing to review documents, records, and communications relating to the impeachment inquiry and will take further action in the coming days, according to an aide for the committee. Committee chair James Comer (R-KY) himself insisted after McCarthy was deposed that the speaker fight \" doesn't change anything .\" However, Rep. Jason Smith (R-MO) said it would actually \"stall and set back efforts to hold President Biden accountable.\"\n\nScalise was the heir apparent to the speakership, but some in the House worried a cancer diagnosis could derail those plans. He did announce in September that he has pursued aggressive treatment for his multiple myeloma, which has significantly improved his long-term prognosis, and has emerged as one of the leading candidates in the speakership race.\n\nScalise was among multiple people who were injured when a gunman fired at lawmakers on a baseball field in 2017, and he has been touting himself as a strong fundraiser : In 2022, his reelection campaign raised nearly $19 million, second among House Republicans only to McCarthy's reelection campaign, which raised over $28 million.\n\nHowever, McCarthy allies are reportedly trying to torpedo Scalise's candidacy. That would advantage Jordan, who previously challenged McCarthy for the speakership but had since become one of his biggest supporters on the party's right flank. He raised more than $14 million in 2022 , making him the fourth-most prolific fundraiser among House Republicans. His endorsement from Trump could be a boon, especially among the caucus's further right members.\n\nBoth Scalise and Jordan may still struggle to capture moderate support, potentially leaving an opening for other candidates. McHenry has apparently ruled out running for the speakership, despite occupying the position temporarily.\n\nOther potential contenders include Republican Study Committee head Rep. Kevin Hern (R-OK) and Rep. Tom Cole (R-OK), the Rules Committee chair. Hern was previously nominated during the January speaker fight, but received only a few votes and voted himself for McCarthy.\n\nCole, a bipartisan operator who has been an ally of the past three Republican speakers, warned that removing McCarthy would result in chaos and criticized his party's right wing for seeking his demise.\n\nSome Republicans have even floated former President Donald Trump for the speakership. There has never been a House speaker who wasn't already a sitting member, but outsiders are technically allowed to run. Trump has declined to run in the past, and but told Fox News he'd consider stepping in as an interim speaker should it become clear that no one else could get 218 votes. At the moment, he would be barred from becoming speaker by House Republicans' own rules, given that he's been charged with felonies that carry potential prison sentences of two or more years; those rules, however, could be changed.\n\nAfter saying he wouldn't seek the speakership again in the days after his deposal, McCarthy suggested recently that he would be open to taking his old job again, saying, \"whatever the conference wants, I will do.\" Some of his allies argue he's the only member of the GOP caucus with a real shot at getting the votes needed to take the gavel, though he'd face massive opposition from those who worked to remove him.\n\nIt's hard to see right now how any of these candidates have a clear path to the speakership, and how whoever becomes speaker will be able to wrangle a divided caucus. Republicans are scheduled to begin the selection process on Tuesday in a private candidate forum, where a majority of Republicans would have to vote to endorse a candidate before voting on the House floor.\n\nThe West Wing fantasy for the way this all ends: Enough reasonable Republicans are so disgusted at their colleagues' extremism that they cut a deal with Democrats to provide votes for a new moderate speaker, resulting in much saner governance.\n\nIn our polarized and partisan reality, it's a different story. One of the first acts of speaker pro tempore McHenry was to order former Speaker Nancy Pelosi to clear out of her office space in the Capitol, in an obvious act of resentful retribution aimed at Democrats for supporting McCarthy's ouster. And so far, Republicans have uniformly said that the choice of the next speaker will be made by the GOP conference, not by Democrats. Most in the GOP may be furious at Gaetz and his compatriots, but the only thing worse than winning them over is dealing with Democrats.\n\nThe vast majority of Republican members of Congress are Republican partisans who rely on campaign money from Republican donors and party leaders, represent Republican districts, cater to Republican-aligned activists, socialize with other Republicans, and need to win Republican primaries. Breaking out of that ecosystem is difficult and risky, and usually means the end of one's political career, as former Rep. Liz Cheney found out. The incentives to keep politicians on the team are likely too powerful to overcome.\n\nIn the short term, the House looks more dysfunctional than ever. McCarthy being deposed due to failure to appease the far right pretty obviously sets the stage for further dysfunction and crisis as far-right members try to flex their muscles even more.\n\nBut much remains uncertain about the longer-term consequences. Things could play out in a few ways.\n\nOne big question for the rest of this year and 2024 is whether McCarthy's successor will manage to somewhat stabilize things in the GOP. That may seem unlikely, but it's not impossible. After Boehner was effectively pushed out in 2015, his successor Paul Ryan never faced a comparable revolt from the right. Hardliners appeared to feel that they'd made their point, and they chilled out a bit. Of course, things could always get worse, too.\n\nAnother question is what this means for the 2024 elections . Democrats shouldn't count on internal GOP drama leading them to victory. In recent presidential cycles, congressional election results have pretty closely followed what happens at the top of the ticket. The presidential matchup will likely be far more important in determining the House majority than the House's own internal machinations will. And the size of that next majority will help determine whether tactics like Gaetz's will be likely to succeed again.\n\nStill, it's clear that none of this is particularly good for the stability of American governance. The incompetence and extremism on display throw the basic functioning of the federal government into question. It's not a good place for American democracy to be.\n\nUpdate, October 10, 9:25 am: This story, originally published October 4, has been updated several times, including with news that Trump endorsed Jordan for the speakership and that McCarthy is willing to be considered for the speakership again.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Congress just avoided a shutdown. Kevin McCarthy's fight is just beginning.\n\nIn a world with too much noise and too little context, Vox helps you make sense of the news. We don't flood you with panic-inducing headlines or race to be first. We focus on being useful to you - breaking down the news in ways that inform, not overwhelm.\n\nWe rely on readers like you to fund our journalism. Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nMcCarthy, Matt Gaetz, and the motion to vacate, explained.\n\nby Ellen Ioanes\n\nCongress finally managed to squeeze out a deal to fund the government for 45 days on Saturday, but the eleventh-hour resolution is already causing trouble for Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz of Florida indicated Sunday that he will call for a motion to vacate - a vote to toss McCarthy from leadership for passing a continuing resolution that Gaetz says violates the terms of McCarthy's speakership deal. For the rest of the country, a fight over the speakership takes away from the work of passing a long-term funding deal, as well as negotiating the future of aid to Ukraine.\n\nGaetz has led the charge against McCarthy's leadership since January , when Gaetz and a crew of right-wing holdouts refused to vote for McCarthy until he made major concessions to the group - including restoring the ability of any one member of the House of Representatives to call for McCarthy's removal, among other promises. Now, the question for McCarthy - assuming the motion to vacate forges ahead - is whether he'll be able to get the support he needs from Democrats to retain the speakership while also retaining the support of more moderate Republicans.\n\nThat may not be so simple, as McCarthy seems to frustrate different critical factions while trying to please everyone. While Congress has avoided a shutdown that was seen as all but inevitable until the legislation actually passed, some Democrats are frustrated about the lack of support for Ukraine written into that legislation, while Republicans - especially Gaetz's right-wing group - are furious that their proposed funding cuts didn't make it through to the final legislation.\n\nThat puts McCarthy in a tenuous position, potentially fighting for his job despite the fact that he averted a government shutdown. What's more, proposing a motion to vacate distracts Congress from the crucial work of funding the government for the next year - something they have just six weeks to do before the continuing resolution runs out.\n\nBack in January, McCarthy went through a grueling 15 rounds of votes to win his speakership. Because Republicans have such a narrow majority in the House - 221 Republicans to 212 Democrats - the defection of 19 extreme right-wing Republicans, including Gaetz, Rep. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, and Rep. Chip Roy of Texas, represented a serious problem for McCarthy's ambition to finally take the speaker's gavel. To win over his naysayers, McCarthy ultimately agreed to a deal that left him vulnerable to an ouster, as Ben Jacobs wrote in January :\n\nPart of their demands include efforts to weaken the office of speaker generally and enable rank-and-file members of the House - and, in particular, rank-and-file members of the House GOP - to have more influence over legislation. In recent years, speakers from both parties have centralized more and more authority in their own hands. This has meant members have less opportunity to introduce amendments, that most key legislation is negotiated by leadership in both parties, and it is presented for a vote in a handful of comprehensive bills such as the 2022 social spending bill Democrats dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act .\n\nThose who want McCarthy gone all dislike him for their own reasons, from the political to the personal. Gaetz has accused McCarthy of breaking his pledges to the right-wing group that ultimately delivered his speakership win, particularly surrounding the debt ceiling debate back in May .\n\nMuch like avoiding a government shutdown, passing legislation to avert a default on the US's debts was critical for the economy and for the government's ability to serve its function. But for Gaetz in particular, any effort McCarthy makes to work with Democrats seems to renege on the January bargain, as Politico pointed out .\n\n\"Speaker McCarthy made an agreement with House conservatives in January and since then he's been in brazen, repeated material breach of that agreement,\" Gaetz told CNN's Jake Tapper on State of the Union Sunday . \"This agreement that he made with Democrats to really blow past a lot of the spending guardrails we set up is a last straw.\"\n\nOnce the legislation passed the House on Saturday - mostly with Democratic support - Gaetz tried to get the floor, ostensibly to call for a motion to vacate, but was rebuffed. The motion to vacate will come this week, Gaetz has promised, and he could be counting on quite a bit of Democratic support, particularly in the Congressional Progressive Caucus, as Politico Playbook pointed out Sunday . But that's far from a guarantee that McCarthy will lose the speakership, particularly if Jeffries doesn't convince the entire Democratic caucus to vote against McCarthy. Furthermore, there are plenty of GOP members who would vote to keep McCarthy in power, denying Gaetz's effort the majority it would need to remove McCarthy from office.\n\nGaetz has thus far remained mum as to who he sees as a viable replacement for McCarthy, particularly given that Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the second most powerful Republican in the House, is being treated for cancer.\n\n\"The problem is - and this is the same problem we saw with the 15 ballots at the beginning of the year - it is my belief that there is nobody at this point in time that has the majority votes in order to become speaker other than Kevin McCarthy,\" Rep. Morgan Griffith, a Freedom Caucus member from Virginia, told Politico on Friday , though Majority Whip Tom Emmer's name has been floated, the Washington Post reported Thursday.\n\nBut the stakes for the government are significant, too. Despite opposition from both the right and the left, McCarthy has managed to push through agreements on the debt ceiling and a continuing resolution, two significant challenges with serious, long-ranging national consequences. Those deals are far from perfect, but both seemed impossible until they were actually done.\n\nThough 45 days may sound like plenty of time to pass a spending bill, it's not, particularly given the major partisan divide over government spending . Most Republicans, and especially the hard-right Republicans like Gaetz, are demanding spending cuts across the board and much more stringent border controls, at odds with most Democrats. Anything that distracts from coming to an agreement over a full year of government funding increases risk of a shutdown come November 17, when the current deal expires.\n\nAs far as funding for Ukraine is concerned, most members of Congress support sustained aid and Senate leadership from both parties indicated Saturday that the Senate will work to protect that funding . Democrats, including Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado , who held up the Senate vote on Saturday's funding bill over Ukraine aid , maintain that support against Russia 's illegal invasion and occupation is critical to defend democracy against an authoritarian foe.\n\nWhatever happens to McCarthy, he'll likely continue to find himself beholden to interests other than his own, whether that comes from his own party or not. And even if he survives this motion, it's possible, given Gaetz's animosity and promises to take McCarthy down, that he'll face another challenge sometime in the future.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nKevin McCarthy faced either a shutdown or a right-wing push to kick him out of his job. He chose the latter.\n\nby Ben Jacobs\n\nWith only hours to spare, Congress on Saturday narrowly avoided a government shutdown. The Senate approved a bill to keep the government open for the next 45 days by a vote of 88 to 9 after a dramatic reversal by House Speaker Kevin McCarthy ensured an overwhelming House vote to keep the government open.\n\nMcCarthy had spent weeks trying to find a path that would both keep the government open and protect himself from an internal coup by hardliners within the House Republican conference . Ultimately, McCarthy opted to fund the government and challenge the hardliners to do their worst - opening him up to attempts to remove him from the House's top job.\n\nMcCarthy had tried Friday to get his caucus to support a short-term measure - known as a continuing resolution - that was loaded up with major spending cuts to appeal to House right-wingers. But after that failed, the California Republican punted on Saturday after accepting that he could not pass any short-term funding measure with Republican votes alone.\n\nInstead, he allowed the House to vote on legislation that would continue current government spending for the next 45 days, along with disaster aid. The only major provision desired by Democrats not included in the legislation is additional aid to Ukraine. The short-term bill passed with all but one Democrat supporting it. However, 90 Republicans were opposed.\n\nMany of those Republicans were opposed to a continuing resolution on principle. They believed McCarthy had made a commitment to funding the government through 12 individual appropriations bills rather than a single legislative vehicle. As Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX) put it on Friday, \"We got to break the fever. This is how business has been conducted for the past 33 years in this country, which coincidentally are close to $30 trillion in debt.\" He added, \"if we don't break this right now, if you don't do this right now, it's gonna be business as usual next year, and the year after the year after.\"\n\nThe challenge for McCarthy is whether he can survive his shift in tactics. Speaking to reporters after the vote , he offered a challenge to those dissidents: \"If somebody wants to make a motion against me, bring it.\"\n\nMcCarthy's position has always been precarious. The California Republican was finally elected speaker after 15 ballots and had a four-seat majority in the House. If a motion to oust McCarthy were brought to the floor, it would require 218 votes to pass, and McCarthy could need support from Democrats to keep his job if more than a handful of Republicans vote against him.\n\nMatt Gaetz, a longtime critic of McCarthy and one of the ringleaders of the effort to block him from becoming speaker in January, told reporters: \"I've said that whether or not Kevin McCarthy faces a motion to vacate is entirely within his control because all he had to do was comply with the agreement that he made with us in January. Putting this bill on the floor and passing it for Democrats would be such an obvious, blatant, and clear violation of that. We would have to deal with it.\"\n\nBut not all the skeptics of continuing resolutions in the conference were ready to strip McCarthy of the speaker's gavel.\n\nRep. Troy Nehls (R-TX), who was one of the 21 Republicans who voted against McCarthy on Friday, expressed sympathy for the speaker. He told reporters that McCarthy had the \"most impossible job in the world and the United States.\"\n\nA potential government shutdown will be averted for the next six weeks. That gives Republicans more time to try to advance the remaining appropriations bills through the House. But anything they pass will go to a Democratic-controlled Senate with very different priorities and without the same attachment to the traditional appropriations process possessed by doctrinaire House conservatives.\n\nBut it also means McCarthy will have to thread the same needle then. The question remains: Will he be able to keep the government open and also remain speaker? One longtime conservative critic, Rep. Bob Good of Virginia, expressed fundamental dissatisfaction with McCarthy's leadership on Saturday morning to reporters. Describing the speaker's approach, he said, \"the bus is going 100 miles off the cliff with the Democrats, let's slow it down to 95 and we get to drive the bus off the cliff.\"\n\nEarlier this week, Liam Donovan, a longtime Republican operative and Washington lobbyist, told me that the goal of Republican dissidents was to force a showdown and have McCarthy face a reckoning within his conference. After all, regardless of whether it happened without a shutdown or with one, McCarthy's exit strategy was always to work with Democrats to pass legislation that would fund the government. It was simply a question of which parliamentary approach he would take and what the collateral damage would be. As of late Saturday night, the showdown had happened and the government would remain open. But, at least for a day, the reckoning would wait.\n\nThere are still a number of other possibilities for Congress to provide additional funding to Ukraine, including through a supplemental appropriations request or by attaching it to future must-pass legislation, such as the next resolution to fund the government.\n\nBut this bill marks a key demarcation in the political debate over Ukraine on Capitol Hill. Coming only days after a majority of Republicans voted - for the first time - for an amendment to strip funding for Ukraine, it's a clear indication that there is a growing sentiment on the right against further US aid to the Eastern European country. While McCarthy was willing to punt on almost every other issue in order to avoid a government shutdown, he still didn't include additional funding for Ukraine in the continuing legislation.\n\nWhile there were rhetorical fireworks among Republicans on Saturday, there was a literal fire alarm pulled by a Democrat. Rep. Jamaal Bowman (D-NY) pulled an alarm in a House office building on Saturday . In a statement, a spokesperson for the Democrat said, \"Congressman Bowman did not realize he would trigger a building alarm as he was rushing to make an urgent vote. The Congressman regrets any confusion.\" Bowman later told reporters , \"I thought the alarm would open the door.\"\n\nHowever, Republicans suggested that Bowman may have done so intentionally. The alarm was pulled at a time when Democrats were trying to delay a House vote in order to read the legislation introduced by Republicans and ensure they found it acceptable.\n\nRep. Nicole Malliotakis (R-NY) is already preparing legislation to expel the New York Democrat. Such a proposal would require significant Democratic support to reach the necessary two-thirds majority vote. Other possibilities for discipline, including a formal reprimand or censure, would only require simple majorities.\n\nMcCarthy condemned Bowman. \"This should not go without punishment,\" he said . The speaker added that he expected the House Ethics Committee to investigate and planned to speak with House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) about Bowman's behavior.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA fractured GOP could be good news for Democrats.\n\nby Li Zhou\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy has become speaker of the House , but only did so by offering offered a series of concessions that effectively mean his speakership will consistently be under threat from his own caucus.\n\nMcCarthy's agreement to weaken the role of the speaker is likely to lead to extreme gridlock within the ranks of the GOP. But it could also present an opening for Democrats. If far-right lawmakers in the GOP follow through on their promises to hold up pivotal spending and debt ceiling legislation, Republicans may well have to rely on Democrats' help to get any bills across the finish line - a dynamic Democrats could capitalize on.\n\n\"The deal is, if they want to get stuff done, they're going to have to work with us,\" says Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA), the top Democrat on the House Rules Committee. \"And we're not going to be a cheap date.\"\n\nGiven Republicans' narrow 222-person majority, they can't really pass much if they lose any more than five votes in their own conference. Since conservatives have been vocal about their commitment to blocking key bills, like an increase to the debt ceiling, in order to get the spending cuts they want, Republicans will likely need Democratic votes to keep essential government functions and services running if they want to do so.\n\nAdditionally, given the number of Freedom Caucus members added to the House Rules Committee, Democrats could theoretically join with the conservatives on the panel to block or slow bills favored by House GOP Leadership.\n\nThe situation gives Democrats more leverage to put forth their own demands, if Republican leadership is actually interested in getting anything done. Of course, there's a high chance that they aren't, a reality Democrats are preparing to confront as well.\n\n\"I think there is an opportunity,\" says Rep. Mark DeSaulnier (D-CA), a member of the Rules Committee. \"But it's just such an unusual time - and it's so hard for so many of them to reach across the aisle.\"\n\nRepublicans can only lose a handful of votes before any bill falls short of the simple majority it needs to advance, which gives Democrats an opening.\n\nIn the last decade or so, there have been times when House Republicans have relied on Democratic support when their conference has similarly fractured. In 2011 and 2014 , Republican House Speaker John Boehner needed Democratic votes to approve spending bills to fund the government, for example.\n\nThat same dynamic could play out this term, with Republicans relying on Democratic help to make up for the support they're missing in their own caucus. \"These people who are causing all this nonsense right now - you can't work with them. They can't ever get to yes,\" said McGovern.\n\nUltimately, House Republicans will need to get a majority to pass bills including an increase to the debt ceiling, spending legislation, the farm bill - which authorizes many Agriculture Department programs - and a defense bill that lays out funding for the military. Were conservative members to withhold their support for such policies, the GOP wouldn't be able to pass the bills on their own. If they aren't able to, they risk scenarios like the country defaulting on the national debt and causing an economic crisis, as well as a potentially interminable government shutdown.\n\nAs Republicans have shown in the past, after the US nearly defaulted on its debt in 2011, and when it went into a shutdown in 2013 , members of the party could well be okay with those scenarios playing out. In both those cases, however, House Republicans also garnered significant public backlash for their role in causing these debacles, and eventually passed agreements that were reached with Democratic support.\n\nAs Vox's Andrew Prokop noted , however, any Republican attempts to reach across the aisle this term could also prompt blowback from the conservative wing, who may threaten the speaker as a result. As part of his bid to become speaker, McCarthy reportedly offered a rules change that will allow any one Republican to force a vote of \"no confidence.\"\n\nKnown as the motion to vacate, this would allow a single member to call a vote on the speaker's ousting if they weren't happy with how he was handling a particular bill or issue. Theoretically, a single far-right member could punish any collaboration with Democrats by submitting a motion to vacate, forcing a vote against the speakership. A majority of members would still have to agree to remove him, though. Some Democrats warned that the rule changes McCarthy agreed to in order to become speaker could blunt collaboration for fear of reprisals.\n\n\"It does feel like they may need to get in the middle more to get anything done. But I'm not sure that giving more weapons to the most extreme folks is going to promote that goal,\" Rep. Mary Gay Scanlon (D-PA), a member of the Rules Committee, told Vox.\n\nThe best case for Democrats is that they're able to slip a few of their priorities into must-pass legislation. But, as Scanlon alluded to, there's a worst-case scenario as well: utter gridlock.\n\nIn addition to the change on the motion to vacate, which could cause GOP leadership to shy away from bipartisan dealmaking, McCarthy's concessions included adding multiple members of the Freedom Caucus to the Rules Committee, which plays a key role in deciding what bills make it to the floor and what amendments get considered. Should three ultraconservative Republicans be added to that committee, something McCarthy agreed to , they'd be able to delay bills and push more extreme versions of policies.\n\nThat's led some Democrats to worry these changes will empower Republicans' conservative flank to use the panel for obstruction. \"We have a small faction basically holding Congress hostage,\" Scanlon says. \"Many of the rules changes that are being proposed by this kind of extreme faction have the same goal.\"\n\nRep. Norma Torres (D-CA), a member of the Rules Committee, notes that conservatives could gum up the process on bills by forcing debate on amendments, whether or not they are germane to the legislation at hand. \"It's impossible to legislate from that perspective,\" she said.\n\nInterestingly, Democrats could use potential rules changes to their advantage, too, argues Daniel Schuman, a policy expert at the progressive advocacy group Demand Progress. Although Democrats aren't able to use the motion to vacate in the same way as Republicans, they would be able to offer their own amendments to bills like appropriations legislation if those changes came to fruition.\n\n\"They're creating a lot of veto points for legislation, and more opportunities to amend that legislation,\" says Schuman. \"And those opportunities, in many circumstances, will be available to all members, not just to Republican members.\"\n\nAdditionally, as Prokop explained, the appointments of Freedom Caucus members to the Rules Committee could give Democrats the ability to form unexpected coalitions and throw their weight around. Previously, the Rules Committee had 13 members, nine in the majority and four in the minority. Were McCarthy to use that same breakdown, and give three seats to Freedom Caucus members, there would be nine Republicans, three of whom would be hardline conservatives, along with four Democrats. In that instance, the Democrats and hardline conservatives could theoretically work together to form a seven-person majority.\n\nIt remains to be seen how likely any kind of bipartisan collaboration would be given how polarized the two parties are. Republicans' narrow margins, however, could lead to Democrats using their numbers in interesting ways.\n\n\"The Freedom Caucus could build an alliance with some or all the Democrats, the McCarthy faction could build an alliance with some or all the Democrats, or the McCarthy faction and the Freedom Caucus could build an alliance with each other,\" says Schuman.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nFour ways Kevin McCarthy's historically bungled bid for House speaker could be resolved.\n\nby Ben Jacobs\n\nAfter three days and 11 ballots, there is no speaker of the House and no prospect of one emerging anytime soon. On Thursday the House held five separate votes to select the next speaker and got the same result every time, and each time Republican Kevin McCarthy came up short.\n\nAll 212 Democrats supported Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY), while 20 dissident Republicans cycled through an array of candidates including Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL), Rep. Kevin Hern (R-OK), and Donald Trump. Rep. Victoria Spartz (R-IN) simply voted present. McCarthy remained stuck at 200 or 201 votes depending on attendance. The House is scheduled to meet again at noon Eastern time on Friday after members adjourned for ongoing negotiations in hopes of finding a resolution. These are the four possible scenarios.\n\nWhile some of the rebels - largely from the House Freedom Caucus - are considered to be \"Never Kevin,\" others are amenable to supporting McCarthy if sufficient concessions are made. Rep. Ralph Norman (R-SC) told reporters that he needed the California Republican to display sufficient fiscal conservatism. \"Is he willing to shut the government down rather than raise the debt ceiling? That's a non-negotiable item.\" (Norman seems to have conflated raising the debt ceiling, which involves the Treasury's ability to issue new debt and would otherwise result in credit default by the United States, with the actual funding of the government.)\n\nA lot of the key issues focus on whether the rebels feel that McCarthy will be sufficiently constrained to block the type of bipartisan spending bills that are anathema on the right. These include placing conservatives on the powerful House Rules Committee, which sets the terms of how bills can be debated in chamber and changing House procedure to allow just a single member to offer a motion to declare the office of speaker vacant and hold a new election. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) suggested to reporters that McCarthy's opponents had \"gotten themselves out on a ledge, and they need to figure out how to come back.\" She thought that as they \"start to realize that they'd never had a plan in the first place,\" they might finally come to terms with McCarthy.\n\nThis could also end up being a stalemate of a size and scope that has a lot in common with the Western Front in World War I. There is much drama and great sound and fury with no real forward movement in either direction. After 11 votes, McCarthy is still not speaker but his tally has only dropped despite national attention and a press gallery overflowing with reporters, plus the intervention of former President Donald Trump on McCarthy's behalf.\n\nThere is no reason this cannot continue indefinitely. Just as McCarthy's opponents are steadfastly against him, a number of his backers have sworn to support the California Republican until the very end. Mike Lawler of New York, a newly elected Republican from a Democratic district in New York, told Vox that he was prepared to back McCarthy \"to the last vote.\" There is no reason for McCarthy not to fight on ballot after ballot in hopes of grinding his opponents down. After all, having dropped out of the race to succeed John Boehner as speaker in 2015, this is likely McCarthy's last shot at wielding the gavel.\n\nHowever, he hasn't gained a single vote over the past three days, and there's little reason to think that he can make sufficient concessions to appease the necessary number of dissidents.\n\nMcCarthy could also just give up. He could concede at this point that he has no path to becoming speaker and drop out of the race in the hope that Republicans can rally around an alternative candidate.\n\nThe most likely candidate at that point would be Steve Scalise, McCarthy's No. 2. The Louisiana Republican has long been mooted as the most likely Republican alternative to McCarthy. However, Rep. Ken Buck (R-CO) cautioned reporters Tuesday that Scalise may also face some of the same criticism as McCarthy as a longtime member of Republican leadership. \"I think a lot of people perceive Steve very similar to Kevin, but he may be that alternative that could bridge the gap.\"\n\nOther possibilities who might appease McCarthy critics include Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Rep. Jim Banks (R-IN). However, they might alienate some moderates who have been staunch McCarthy allies. Further, McCarthy dropping out would call into question a lot of the concessions that he had already made to conservatives about rules changes and lead to a renewed battle over the power of the next speaker versus that of the rank and file.\n\nThe possibility of \"a unity candidate\" has been floated: that somehow Democrats and at least some Republicans could unite to find a mutually acceptable candidate. However, such a scenario still seemed more suitable for The West Wing fan fiction than real life, even as former Michigan Rep. Justin Amash, a former Republican now in the Libertarian party, has hung around the floor in case the implausible happened. While some moderate Republicans have scoffed at the idea of such a deal, it seems to have been put forth more as a mechanism to scare recalcitrant conservatives into supporting McCarthy than a serious proposal. Rep. Jim McGovern (D-MA) told reporters late Wednesday afternoon, \"I don't think that there's been any really serious talk going on about that.\" In the meantime, it does serve as an excellent way to fill airtime on cable television.\n\nUpdate, January 6, 11:10 am: This story was originally published on January 4 and has been updated with new details about Thursday's voting and possible outcomes for the speaker of the House.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nA mutiny last week among the GOP's far-right faction spells trouble for Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and everyone else.\n\nby Ellen Ioanes\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy's compromises with far-right members of his own Republican party to gain leadership of the House in January may be coming back to haunt him.\n\nLast week, 11 members of the far-right GOP contingent known as the House Freedom Caucus expressed their displeasure with McCarthy, voting with Democrats to block a procedural vote on two Republican bills to limit regulations on gas stoves , as well as halting business on the House floor for days in what has been described widely as a revolt.\n\nSeemingly innocuous legislation restricting regulations on gas stoves would, in theory, be popular among Republicans. Scientific findings suggesting that such appliances can cause health problems became a major touchstone in the right's culture war earlier this year, with Republicans falsely claiming that the government would ban gas stoves .\n\nThose bills, however, became collateral damage, at least for now, in the ongoing fight between McCarthy and the far-right wing of the Republican party - a fight that has threatened to boil over since McCarthy and the White House managed to avoid a cataclysmic national default with their debt limit deal late last month. With House Republicans in disarray, leadership announced it would meet Monday to attempt to move forward with planned votes .\n\nUltimately, the drama isn't just about a vote to advance legislation on gas stoves; it's a referendum on McCarthy's leadership, and whether he can keep his conference on his side to maintain his position and pass critical legislation as the end of the government's fiscal year draws nearer.\n\nMcCarthy's power is contingent on a number of compromises he made with Freedom Caucus members in January, including a concession to the motion to vacate. That would allow any one member to offer a motion to \"vacate the chair,\" initiating a new election for speaker at any time, according to Vox's Andrew Prokop . Now that possibility hovers in the background as the House's ultraconservatives continue to withhold their support from McCarthy in their quest to move their party further to the right.\n\nRepublicans had hoped for greater spending cuts as part of a deal to suspend the debt limit ; in exchange for suspending it until 2025, Republicans wanted increased work requirements for people to access Medicaid and the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP), and sought caps on non-defense spending through 2033. The compromise legislation did change work requirements for some SNAP recipients and will end the three-year pause on student loan repayments by the end of the summer.\n\nWith just a 10-seat majority in the House and a Democratic majority in the Senate, however, McCarthy and Republican leadership have had to concede to their Democratic colleagues to get anything done, spiting the far-right Republicans, particularly Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX).\n\nBut even the legislators trying to disrupt McCarthy and Congress can't seem to agree on what it is they actually want to move the voting process forward this week, according to McCarthy and other leaders. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) said on Thursday, however, that his faction had had \"encouraging\" talks with House Majority Leader Steve Scalise (R-LA).\n\nThe battle puts McCarthy in a particularly difficult position. Any concession to the far-right risks alienating more moderate Republicans, some of whom are already very publicly frustrated with the mutiny in their ranks.\n\n\"This is, in my opinion, political incontinence on our part. We are wetting ourselves [...] and can't do anything about it,\" Rep. Steve Womack (R-AR) told the Washington Post. \"This is insane. This is not the way a governing majority is expected to behave, and, frankly, I think there'll be a political cost to it.\"\n\nMcCarthy's mandate to lead has never been strong; you might remember January's dramatic 15 rounds of voting for the speakership , caused in part by opposition from his party's ultraconservative caucus.\n\nMcCarthy had, through developing a relationship with far-right Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , sought to court that extreme wing of his party in order to avoid the pitfalls of the previous Republican speakers, John Boehner and Paul Ryan . But his relationship alone with Taylor Greene, the former QAnon follower elected to Congress in 2020, could not win his GOP opponents - McCarthy had to agree to several measures , including restoring a rule that allows any single member of the House to trigger a recall vote on the speaker.\n\nNot every part of the agreement between McCarthy and the Freedom Caucus holdouts has been made public, but as Vox's Prokop wrote in January, those agreements fall into three major categories: government spending, including on appropriations and the debt ceiling; the snap-election rule change; and committee assignments for Freedom Caucus holdouts, including on the influential Rules Committee.\n\nAny legislation to adjust the debt ceiling was going to be deeply contentious. The GOP has long used the nation's debt, and efforts to raise the debt limit, as a cudgel to attempt to pass aggressive spending cuts for social programs. During President Obama's first term , House Republicans tried to enact dollar-for-dollar spending cuts for debt ceiling increases; that failed, but the administration eventually agreed to deep spending cuts in exchange for three debt limit increases .\n\nRoy had worked alongside Republican leadership to draft far more extreme debt ceiling legislation than what ultimately passed last month. Roy called the final deal a \" betrayal \" of conservatives and the agreement the Freedom Caucus members made with McCarthy to advance his speakership.\n\nAs Vox's Li Zhou wrote before the debt limit vote, any compromise with Democrats and perceived betrayal of Roy and the Freedom Caucus agreements over the debt ceiling deal were likely to spell trouble for McCarthy:\n\nLooming over the vote is also an unspoken threat against McCarthy's leadership, which, according to House rules, can be challenged if just one member wants to do so. A majority of the House, however, would have to vote to remove him as Speaker, and it's unclear whether there are enough votes from either party to achieve that.\n\nThis week's obstruction by Roy and his compatriots falls conspicuously short of calling for McCarthy to vacate the chair but reminds McCarthy of the sway they hold not just over his leadership, but the work of Congress, too.\n\nMcCarthy has outwardly expressed confidence that the different factions of his party will come to an agreement and get the Republican agenda back on track. \"We've been through this before; you know we're in a small majority,\" McCarthy said Wednesday . \"I don't take this job because it's easy. We'll work through this, and we'll even be stronger.\"\n\nFor now, it seems as though McCarthy's power is even further blunted by the far-right contingent in his own party - and it's not clear how he'll bring them into the fold without alienating more moderate factions of his own party, much less the Democrats he'll need to pass future legislation.\n\nIndeed, some more moderate Republicans are already frustrated with the party's move to the right, as Politico reported Wednesday . A plan to put forward a bill codifying restrictions on federal spending on abortion - commonly called the Hyde Amendment - reportedly angered South Carolina Rep. Nancy Mace , who has argued that the party needs to move toward the center on some issues to avoid alienating voters.\n\nWhether McCarthy can manage the opposing factions of his party - and indeed, if he can keep his tenuous grip on the speakership - is unclear. That will have significant consequences in the long term if the pattern of obstruction continues, particularly when it comes to funding the government and avoiding a shutdown in the fall.\n\n\"I've got serious concerns as we go into the appropriations process about how antics like this taking down a rule can impact the ability for us to do our basic job of funding the government,\" Womack told the New York Times Wednesday. \"It was already going to be a pretty heavy lift, but it is a lift that is going to be made heavier if this is what we are going to be facing.\"\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

And while that was a low point for them, things arguably went downhill from there.\n\nSince then, the GOP followed up its first wave of speaker drama with another equally tumultuous contest , expulsion votes on one of its own members , failed attempts to get much of its policy agenda out the door , and floundering investigations of President Joe Biden .\n\nSpending a year dealing with political and personnel problems left the party with little to show for itself policy-wise ahead of an election year in which Republicans hope to expand on their narrow House majority. And it has given Democrats plenty of ammunition to use in making the case the GOP shouldn't be trusted to govern.\n\nAccording to the New York Times, this is the most unproductive the House has been in years, even compared to other instances of divided government. In 2023, the House passed just 27 bills that became law, a far lower figure than the 72 it passed in 2013 when Congress was similarly split.\n\nIt was always going to be difficult for Republicans to leave a mark given Democratic control of the Senate and White House, but in the past, parties in the GOP's position have stayed better united on their policy priorities and put pressure on the administration while sticking together on their demands. Although there's still time to turn things around next year, at this point in the term, it seems as though this House will be remembered for being the one in which Republicans were seriously in disarray. Below is a rundown of some of the moments that defined that mayhem.\n\nFor four days, members of the House's right flank like Rep. Matt Gaetz refused to back Rep. Kevin McCarthy for the role of speaker because, they argued, he hadn't sufficiently committed to their interests and wasn't conservative enough.\n\nThat led to round after round after round of failed votes. On the 15th round of voting, McCarthy was finally able to secure the majority he needed to ascend to the role, but not without making some serious concessions that greatly diluted his power .\n\nThose concessions included putting multiple members of the Freedom Caucus on the Rules Committee, an agreement to curb government spending, and changes to a policy known as the motion to vacate, which would allow any one member to introduce a resolution to remove McCarthy from the job.\n\nThat last concession would come back to haunt McCarthy later in the year, when House conservatives would use it to protest his handling of government funding legislation. The whole speakership debacle also foreshadowed the ideological divides that would come to plague Republicans for the duration of this year and make not just keeping a leader, but producing concrete legislation, difficult.\n\nA segment of the House Republican conference has long threatened to refuse to raise the debt ceiling - something that could spark economic calamity - if they don't get the spending cuts they demand.\n\nThe debt ceiling is the limit that the US is able to borrow, and if the country defaults on it, it's unable to pay its bills. Congress has to either raise or suspend the debt ceiling every few years to ensure that the US doesn't default. If it were to do so, there'd likely be cascading negative effects on the US and global economies: The US could have a lower credit limit, interest rates could go up, and unemployment could surge. Despite these concerns, fiscal conservatives have long suggested they'd be open to defaulting if it meant that they could secure the social spending changes they demand.\n\nThis year, those lawmakers, which include members of the Freedom Caucus, urged then-Speaker Kevin McCarthy to take a hard-line stance in negotiations with Democrats. Specifically, they called for major cuts to climate spending and new work requirements for Medicaid in exchange for any willingness to raise the debt limit.\n\nMcCarthy did take a strong position in negotiations, to the point that questions were raised about whether the US , which typically comes down to the wire on debt ceiling deals, might actually default this time. In the end, with days to spare, GOP leaders wound up settling for a debt ceiling deal that didn't include many of these requests. While they were able to secure some Republican wins - like the repurposing of roughly $20 billion in IRS funding and a cap on non-defense spending - the cuts wound up being far less than what some members had urged. The deal was generally seen as a compromise for all involved ; not a loss for the GOP, but not a win, either.\n\nConservatives were incensed, setting the stage for later confrontations between the party's right-most members and the rest of the caucus. \"The concessions made by the speaker in his negotiations with President Biden fall far short of my expectations,\" Rep. Wesley Hunt (R-TX), a Republican who opposed the deal, wrote on Twitter .\n\nOne of Republicans' chief promises when they entered office was that they'd be launching a series of investigations , including many that centered on the Biden administration and alleged biases the federal government has against Republicans.\n\nThese investigations have focused on everything from Twitter's handling of a story about Hunter Biden's laptop to the White House's withdrawal from Afghanistan to the purported \"weaponization of the federal government.\"\n\nBy and large, as Vox's Christian Paz has reported , many of the investigations have been nothing short of flops. The laptop investigation failed to find anything incriminating President Biden in misconduct, and the Afghanistan investigation didn't turn up any useful knowledge to use against Democrats the way the Benghazi investigation did years earlier. Overall, not only have inquiries into President Biden failed to turn up any concrete evidence linking him to wrongdoing, these endeavors haven't generated a lot of discourse, and the impeachment effort in particular has been unpopular.\n\nAccording to a December Marist poll , voters were split on Biden's impeachment inquiry, with just 48 percent approving of it . That figure is lower than the percentage of voters who approved of Trump's two past impeachment inquiries, according to the Washington Post .\n\nAlthough some of these efforts, like Republicans' recent launch of Biden's impeachment inquiry, might help rally the GOP base, they also endanger battleground members given they aren't especially backed by the broader public. That makes these actions more risky for House Republicans, whose ability to maintain a majority hinges on these battleground members, 17 of whom are in districts that Biden also won .\n\nAs if the January drama wasn't enough, Republicans had yet another speaker debacle in October when the far-right faction of the GOP conference joined with Democrats to oust McCarthy from the speaker's job .\n\nThe trouble began when McCarthy opted to work with Democrats to pass a short-term spending bill that kept the government open. Each year, Congress has to pass 12 appropriations bills, often consolidated into a larger package, to allocate the funds needed to keep the government running. Conservatives had hoped that McCarthy would leverage a potential government shutdown to force Congress to pass individual long-term spending bills that contained the cuts to programs like SNAP and Medicaid they wanted.\n\nMcCarthy's decision to avert a shutdown followed other actions that had upset these far-right members, including the concessions he had previously made on the debt ceiling deal.\n\nAs a result, Gaetz opted to use the motion to vacate to force a vote on removing McCarthy, which was ultimately successful.\n\nAfter McCarthy was booted, Republicans faced even more problems as the far right opposed other speaker options that were proposed, and moderates opposed the conservative options the far right wanted. Multiple people were floated as potential options, including longtime leadership member Rep. Steve Scalise from Louisiana and former Freedom Caucus Chair Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan . None were able to get the support needed to become speaker.\n\nAll of this culminated in the election of conservative member, election denier, and relative unknown Rep. Mike Johnson (R-LA) to the position.\n\nThe same fault lines that sparked the McCarthy drama, however, haven't disappeared. Instead, they're expected to re-emerge in 2024 when the House will have to figure out how to handle the passage of long-term spending bills as another funding deadline approaches in January.\n\nJohnson will have to navigate these tensions on those bills - as well as on the Biden impeachment inquiry - as different factions of the party push for competing paths forward.\n\nBeyond investigations into Biden, House Republicans kicked off their term with a laundry list of goals they hoped to achieve.\n\nChief among these were policies that would restrict abortion rights. Like the investigations, however, this goal proved fraught and revealing of the divisions in the caucus. Though some far-right members agitated for a national abortion ban, there was rapid blowback to such harsh proposals -with poll after poll after poll showing that Americans are in favor of at least some abortion access. In lieu of considering a national abortion ban, the House voted on a slate of abortion bills that would put limitations on federal funding for abortions and require care for infants if an abortion failed.\n\nThese had no chance of making it through the Democrat-controlled Senate.\n\nA similar dynamic played out on legislation like the annual defense bill , which lays out the military budget that the US has each year. House Republicans used their version of the bill to restrict funds that the federal government can provide for servicemembers to travel for an abortion, and to limit funding for gender-affirming surgeries for trans servicemembers. Those amendments did not make it into a final compromise bill with the Senate.\n\nWhile both bills were wins for a chamber that has struggled to pass even basic legislation, they also marked another failure by House Republicans to get their policies into law.\n\n\"I want my Republican colleagues to give me one thing - one - that I can go campaign on and say we did. Anybody sitting in the complex, if you want to come down to the floor and come explain to me, one material, meaningful, significant thing the Republican majority has done,\" Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), a far-right member said in November during a floor speech criticizing Republicans' failures on spending cuts.\n\nAfter the 2022 midterms , the House GOP's majority was narrow: In those contests, Republicans only won a nine-seat majority, after winning 222 seats to Democrats' 213.\n\nA combination of circumstance, bad luck, and misconduct have further winnowed that majority thanks to the scandals of former New York Rep. George Santos and some lawmakers' decision to leave the House of their own volition.\n\nSantos's expulsion was the latest embarrassment for the GOP, and marked the first time a House lawmaker had been expelled in roughly two decades. His removal followed a 23-count federal indictment, extensive coverage of the lies he told about his work and educational history, and a scathing review by the House Ethics Committee.\n\nIn addition to Santos's departure, there have been many other resignations on the Republican side. Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) has said he'll leave his post before the end of 2023, and Bill Johnson (R-OH) has said he'll leave his post in 2024, meaning their seats will be vacant until they can hold special elections in their districts (though both are expected to eventually be replaced by Republicans).\n\nThat means Republicans could be operating with fewer votes to spare in the new year . With McCarthy gone, they're only able to lose three votes to keep their majority. Those narrow margins could give any small group of GOP lawmakers outsize control over policy or force them to keep relying on Democratic votes for key bills. \"Hopefully no one dies,\" Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) lamented in a tweet on this issue .

But after five hours and three separate ballots, they adjourned without a speaker being chosen and with members not yet officially sworn in. Despite winning the majority of votes, Republican Kevin McCarthy was unable to muster the absolute majority constitutionally necessary to be elected speaker. It was the first time in a century that Congress required more than one ballot to elect a speaker, and left McCarthy facing a seventh ballot on Wednesday with little prospect of making headway.\n\nThe California Republican faced a rebellion from the hard-right members of his conference who made a series of interlocking demands that mixed the political, the procedural, and the personal. While Democrats held united and voted for their leader, Hakeem Jeffries, Republican dissidents split their votes. Ten voted for Rep. Andy Biggs (R-AZ), who ran as a stalking horse opponent against McCarthy in an internal ballot of the GOP conference in November. Nine scattered their votes for candidates like Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH) and Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL).\n\nThe rebels were members of the House Freedom Caucus, many of whom had been loyal supporters of Donald Trump and backers of an uncompromising brand of conservative politics. While some had roots in a Tea Party brand of conservatism like Rep. Chip Roy (R-TX), many were MAGA bomb-throwers who have come to political prominence more recently, like Rep. Lauren Boebert (R-CO). However, not all of the three dozen or so members of the House Freedom Caucus members were opposed to McCarthy. Some, like Reps. Majorie Taylor Greene (R-GA) and Jordan, have been vocal supporters.\n\nOn the second ballot, the rebels consolidated around Jordan, even though the Ohio Republican gave a speech nominating McCarthy. All 19 anti-McCarthy Republicans voted for Jordan while all Democrats remained united around Jeffries, and McCarthy's supporters stood by the California Republican. The margins remained almost unchanged on the third ballot, with Rep. Byron Donalds (R-FL) voting for Jordan after supporting McCarthy on the first two ballots. This set the stage for a political impasse that is unprecedented in modern history.\n\nThe short answer is less power for McCarthy and more power for the right wing of the House Republican Conference. Part of their demands include efforts to weaken the office of speaker generally and enable rank-and-file members of the House - and, in particular, rank-and-file members of the House GOP - to have more influence over legislation. In recent years, speakers from both parties have centralized more and more authority in their own hands. This has meant members have less opportunity to introduce amendments, that most key legislation is negotiated by leadership in both parties, and it is presented for a vote in a handful of comprehensive bills such as the 2022 social spending bill Democrats dubbed the Inflation Reduction Act.\n\nThey also want to increase their leverage on McCarthy. One key point of contention has been a procedural question called the \"motion to vacate,\" which allows for an up or down vote on whether the position of speaker should be declared vacant and a new vote held. This was used by Republican rebels in 2015 to force out then-Speaker John Boehner. At the time, any individual member could force a vote on this question. Boehner was managing a fractious House GOP conference then, albeit with a far larger majority than Republicans have now.\n\nUnder House Democrats, the House rules were changed so that only party leaders could offer the motion. McCarthy's critics want to return this precedent. With Republicans holding a nominal majority of five in the House, the motion to vacate threat functions as a sword hanging over any speaker. It means that a mere handful of Republicans would have the leverage to oust McCarthy from the speakership at any moment. Needless to say, McCarthy had been dead set against this. However, a recent offer he made to win critics was to lower the threshold to five for a motion to vacate. In other words, five members would have to jointly offer the motion to force a vote.\n\nBut more than this, they also want to shape the GOP agenda with hard-right members on influential committees and guaranteed votes on priorities like term limits, a balanced budget, and border security. From their perspective, past Republican Congresses have failed to hold Democrats accountable. Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) told reporters before the vote, \"Our position is that if Kevin McCarthy is the Speaker of the House, and we don't have an ability to ensure that there is oomph behind the agenda and energy behind our oversight, [then not much else matters].\" Gaetz went on, \"I'm not here to participate in some puppet show where we pass a bunch of messaging bills, send them to the Senate, watch them die, fail to use leverage, and don't hold the Biden administration accountable.\"\n\nMost rank-and-file Republicans are not happy. Speaking to reporters before the vote on Tuesday, Rep. Kat Cammack (R-FL) said of McCarthy's critics, \"[I]t was all about controlling the committees and trying to fundamentally put people in positions where they can raise more money. This has nothing to do with bettering our country.\" She described those willing to vote against the Republican leader as \"the radical 2 percent.\" Rep. Mike Gallagher (R-WI) expressed frustration that this could delay Republicans from getting started trying to pass their agenda as well. \"You really have to go out of the gates fast in that first quarter to have an effect ... so there's no time to waste right now.\"\n\nVoting resumed Wednesday at noon with McCarthy buoyed by a renewed endorsement from former President Donald Trump on his Truth Social website and Gaetz, a top McCarthy critic, embracing a derisive comparison of him and his allies to the Taliban. After all, as Gaetz noted on Twitter , the Taliban eventually won.\n\nSpeaking to reporters before Tuesday's vote, McCarthy said, \"I have the record for the longest speech ever on the floor. I don't have a problem getting a record for the most votes\" held in a speaker election. The record is 133 rounds of voting, which were cast over two months in 1856 to pick a new speaker. As of now, with this many votes for someone else that would need to swing his way, it looks as though McCarthy has a chance at exceeding that distinction, too.\n\nUpdate, January 4: This story was originally published on January 3 and has been updated multiple times to reflect the latest developments.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

Will you support our work and become a Vox Member today?\n\nThe US House is acting like a parliament. That's not great for America - or for you.\n\nby Ben Jacobs\n\nThe vote to oust Speaker Kevin McCarthy last week was another clear indicator that the House of Representatives is becoming something un-American. It's not that the vote inherently undermined national security , nor did it somehow betray the fundamental values that have underpinned the US political system for nearly 250 years. Instead, it was a stranger turn. The vote was downright parliamentary.\n\nIt was a de facto no-confidence vote offered by eight dissident Republicans and backed by House Democrats as a bloc. It is not unusual in a parliamentary system for a gang of rebels joining with the opposition to bring down the party leader, but in American politics, it is a foreign concept.\n\nIt's not that there is anything inherently wrong with a parliamentary system of government. After all, some of America's best friends have it.\n\nBut here in the United States, our institutions aren't designed for this. The Constitution created a system of checks and balances. For centuries, Congress has functioned as a bicameral legislature composed of members of two ideologically diverse parties, where local parochial interests were often of far greater concern than national interest groups.\n\nFurther, for generations in Washington, lawmakers guarded their own power, and their chamber's, against others. That ethos was embodied in the apocryphal quote from a House member, who explained: The other party was simply the opposition, but the Senate was the enemy.\n\nIn practice, this led to a politics where political coalitions would come and go depending on individual issues, presidents would openly clash with congressional leaders of their own parties, and the result of congressional votes wasn't always preordained before the gavel rang down.\n\nThat certainly doesn't ring true anymore.\n\nInstead, American politics has transformed into a political structure where major legislation can at times be pushed through when the same party controls both chambers of Congress and is typically dictated top down. Party leaders call the shots, and backbench members fall in lockstep behind them. The problem is that the American system of governance is not designed for this, and in recent years, when one party does not have unified control of government, the result is gridlock.\n\nThe result is a politics where there is increasing pressure for things to take place speedily along strict party lines in a system designed for slow compromise. These contradictions become increasingly apparent at moments like the present, when control of government is divided and House majorities are narrow, leading to breakdowns like what happened last week.\n\nRep. Brendan Boyle (D-PA) told Vox that while \"we don't have a parliamentary system, we now have two parties that act like those in parliamentary democracy.\" He noted how much parties had shifted over the past century - whereas once they were \"ideologically heterodox, which made it much easier to have cross-party voters ... you now have almost 100 percent ideological purity on both sides.\"\n\nThis was echoed by Joshua Huder, a senior fellow at the Government Affairs Institute at Georgetown University, who noted that \"the parties have gotten so polarized from one another, we are about as close as we can get to a parliamentary system. He went on to argue that \"the House isn't broken. There's nothing wrong with it as an institution. The House is a majority body that has traditionally allowed the majority to do whatever they want to do ... it's a party problem.\"\n\nFormer Republican Rep. Tom Davis of Virginia told Vox that Congress \"is continuing to act more like a parliamentary institution than a balance of power structure, with Democrats not acting as minority shareholders but as the opposition.\"\n\nHe noted that Democrats made the decision to oust McCarthy despite the likelihood of worse policy outcomes in the short term on issues like Ukraine and government funding. Instead, Davis argued that Democrats \"made the calculated decision to remove the top Republican fundraiser in McCarthy.\" He understood why, though. After all, \"the job of the minority is to become a majority.\"\n\nHuder argued there were limits to just how much Congress could resemble legislatures in foreign countries. \"One of the problems we have in the American system is that we don't have elections based on parties at all, so we can never have that kind of parliamentary-style accountability.\" As he pointed out, \"what happened [last] Tuesday was not a no-confidence vote in the way that you would see in a parliamentary election. It didn't start an election. There is no new governing coalition, and we are sort of stuck. And, in some ways, nothing has changed in the House.\"\n\nThe breakdown of parties was already demonstrated earlier this year when 20 Republican rebels forced McCarthy to go through 15 ballots to be elected speaker - even though he had been overwhelmingly ratified as the choice of the GOP conference in a vote two months earlier. Although there had been a trend in recent years where members declined to back their party's choice for speaker in the formal floor vote, it had not made a difference until January.\n\nAs Davis noted, members increasingly come from safe congressional districts where the November general election \"is nothing more than a constitutional formality\" and are elected by voters who get their news from partisan echo chambers.\n\nYet the institutions have shifted with the parties. Congressional leaders have become increasingly important and have centralized power, leaving committee chairs and rank-and-file members with far less sway, just as in a parliamentary system where power is concentrated in the hands of the party leader.\n\nDavis noted that the increasingly parliamentary nature of the House created a self-reinforcing feedback loop. \"Leaders have become more powerful, as it is the only way the place can operate,\" he said. He noted that if the minority party considers themselves the opposition rather than minority shareholders, then \"bills have to be written in the speaker's office, because the other party is going to put in poison pills\" as amendments in the open process that once governed the House in the days before it became not just a majoritarian institution but a top-down one.\n\nThe result is that Congress has stopped functioning the way it's nominally supposed to via political science textbooks and Schoolhouse Rock cartoons. The idea of a budget being passed to lay out the framework of 12 different appropriations bills, which then go on to pass both chambers, with any differences being negotiated via conference committee, is as archaic as the spittoons that still sit on the floor of the Senate.\n\nThis means that basic government tasks are increasingly pushed off, with Capitol Hill seeing repeated last minute showdowns over funding the government and avoiding a default on the national debt . It also means that bipartisan legislation can face real obstacles, with Republicans relying on what they call the \" Hastert Rule ,\" which requires a majority of the majority party GOP conference to approve any legislation that reaches the floor. This has become an obstacle to Ukraine funding in recent weeks: Skeptics within the GOP have argued that aid to that country no longer has support of the House Republicans, although it still has strong support both in the Senate and nationally.\n\nInstead, the parliamentary nature of the congressional parties, particularly in the House, has simply created greater dysfunction, as, increasingly, major legislation is done in a handful of gargantuan bills. The result is a muddled mess where the type of bipartisan coalitions that once moved major legislation are politically impossible in a polarized environment in which leaders have to build majorities solely from within their caucuses and face political doom when one intraparty faction proves intransigent.\n\nThe question is quite how one-sided all of these new norms are. Democrats have been relatively more tractable in recent years than Republicans - although part of that may simply be because Nancy Pelosi eliminated the procedure from the rules of the House when she was speaker. Boyle argued that \"being Republican leader means you have a short shelf life. At least on the Republican side, motion to vacate is now a permanent part in which norms have changed in this generation and this is now the new normal. In contrast, he argued on \"the Democratic side, it's very difficult to imagine a situation where anyone would ever utilize\" it.\n\nHowever, it created a precedent, and there's no guarantee what House rules might look in the future or how tractable congressional Democrats might be. Speaking Tuesday after the vote to remove McCarthy, Tom Cole (R-OK) wondered what would happen in the future: \"Anytime you do something that is unprecedented, you have to worry that it becomes easier in the future. That's probably something that some of my Democratic friends are pondering right now.\"\n\nBut that's not a problem for Hakeem Jeffries now. After all, he's still just the leader of the opposition.\n\nUnderstand the world with a daily explainer plus the most compelling stories of the day, compiled by news editor Sean Collins.\n\nExamining what's underneath the \"Republican makeup\" look.\n\nThe arrest escalates the Trump administration's fight with local municipalities over deportations.\n\nImmigration is Trump's best issue.

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy has been ousted as speaker of the House. Here's what happens next.\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  October 5, 2023 / 6:03 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nWashington - The House on Tuesday voted 216 to 210 to remove California Republican Kevin McCarthy from his position as House speaker , a historic move that comes days after he reached an 11th-hour deal to avert a government shutdown with the help of House Democrats.\n\nThe ouster came after Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz acted Monday night to force a vote on a motion to vacate the office of the speaker, following through on a threat he made last week to take the gavel from the California Republican while the threat of a shutdown loomed.\n\nWhile other speakers throughout history have stepped down after losing the support of their party, McCarthy is the first to be ousted through a vote of the full House in the middle of a congressional term.\n\n\"It's uncharted territory because we've never done that in the history of the United States,\" Matthew Green, a politics professor at Catholic University, told CBS News.\n\nThe unprecedented removal of a speaker in the middle of a congressional session has raised questions as to what will happen next and who will be selected to succeed McCarthy. While the situation is fluid and changing quickly, here's what we know so far:\n\nThe rules of the 118th Congress state that \"in the case of a vacancy in the office of speaker, the next member\" named on a list submitted by McCarthy to the clerk of the House in January will become speaker pro tempore until a speaker is elected. A House reading clerk announced immediately after the vote that Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina was the first name on McCarthy's list and therefore was appointed speaker pro tempore.\n\n\"Pending such election, the member acting as speaker pro tempore may exercise such authorities of the Office of Speaker as may be necessary and appropriate to that end,\" the rules state. The requirement of a list appears to have originated with the 108th Congress that convened in January 2003 .\n\nAfter the speaker pro tempore takes over, \"presumably, the next order of business would be to choose a speaker,\" Green said. He pointed out that \"it's unlikely the House would continue to operate as usual without a new speaker being selected.\"\n\nIn his first remarks as speaker pro tempore, McHenry announced that \"the office of the speaker was rendered vacant pursuant to the adoption of House Resolution 757,\" and added that \"prior to proceeding to the election of a speaker, it would be prudent to first recess for the relative caucus and conferences to meet and discuss the path forward.\"\n\nHe then declared the House in recess.\n\nAt this point, it's unclear who can garner enough support to win the gavel. McCarthy told Republican colleagues Tuesday night he will not run for speaker again .\n\nBy Wednesday, several names had emerged as possible successors to McCarthy , including Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Rep. Kevin Hern of Oklahoma.\n\nJordan, the chairman of the powerful House Judiciary Committee, announced he is running Wednesday morning, telling reporters at the Capitol that he had heard from \"a lot\" of members urging him to mount a bid.\n\nScalise announced his own bid later in the day, telling colleagues in a letter that he has \"a proven track record of bringing together the diverse array of viewpoints within our Conference to build consensus where others thought it impossible.\"\n\nRepublicans have a narrow majority of 221 to 212, and McCarthy only managed to become speaker by making a series of concessions to the most conservative members. The full House votes to elect the speaker. If Republicans can't coalesce around a consensus candidate, Democrats could attempt to build a coalition with Republicans, Green said.\n\nUnlike in January, when the House could not begin its work until a speaker was elected, McHenry will serve in the role temporarily until a new speaker wins the gavel.\n\nCasey Burgat, an assistant professor at George Washington University, said it may be difficult to find a candidate to succeed McCarthy who can garner a consensus of support and who wants the gavel.\n\n\"It's hard enough as a leader, especially with a four-seat majority, but then you start having the infighting here,\" Burgat said. \"It's also a pretty terrible job when no one is behind you consistently.\"\n\nThe Constitution doesn't specify that the speaker of the House must be a current member of the House, but it always has been, according to the office of the House historian . On Tuesday, Texas Rep. Troy Nehls said on social media that he will nominate former President Donald Trump for speaker. Trump is currently running for president and facing a total of 91 criminal counts in four different jurisdictions. He has also been appearing in New York state court this week for a trial in a civil fraud case brought by the New York attorney general.\n\nIt's unclear how soon after McCarthy's ouster the Republican majority will begin the process for electing a successor. In January, when the 118th Congress convened and Republicans took power, it took 15 rounds of voting across four days for McCarthy to secure the support he needed to win the gavel.\n\nHis victory followed days of negotiating with the far-right members of the House Republican conference, and in order to win their backing, McCarthy agreed to a number of their demands. Chief among them was lowering the threshold for the motion to vacate, which allowed a single member to call for a vote to remove the speaker.\n\nLike with the effort to oust McCarthy that played out Tuesday, Gaetz was at the center of the dispute over the California Republican's quest to win the speakership in the first place. He angered some of his Republican colleagues when he voted \"present\" on the 14th round, blocking McCarthy's bid and forcing another ballot.\n\nRep. Tom McClintock, a California Republican, warned that McCarthy's removal would bring the House to a standstill as lawmakers work to elect a new speaker.\n\n\"If this motion carries, the House will be paralyzed,\" McClintock said in remarks on the House floor. \"We can expect week after week of fruitless ballots while no other business can be conducted.\"\n\nGreen said while some believe the speaker pro tempore could continue to preside over the House for legislative business, it would be difficult for Republicans to advance legislation without a speaker in place.\n\n\"The reality is that the Republicans look to the speaker for all kinds of things, like setting the agenda and negotiating between factions in order to figure out what comes to the floor,\" he said. \"So without somebody in charge, it's hard to see the House Republicans being able to bring much to the floor in the first place.\"\n\nCaitlin Yilek and Kathryn Watson contributed to this report.\n\nMelissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy to retire from Congress at end of the year after historic ouster as House speaker\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  December 6, 2023 / 7:37 PM EST / CBS News\n\nWashington -  Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is resigning from Congress at the end of the month, he announced Wednesday, ending weeks of speculation about his future after he was ousted from his leadership role in October.\n\n\"I have decided to depart the House at the end of this year to serve America in new ways,\" McCarthy wrote in an op-ed for the Wall Street Journal . \"I know my work is only getting started.\"\n\nMcCarthy's departure makes him the latest member to retire amid growing polarization that has made it difficult for Congress to operate. His decision comes a day after Rep. Patrick McHenry, who briefly served as temporary speaker following McCarthy's ouster, also announced he would leave Congress.\n\nWithout McCarthy, the Republicans' slim majority - already weakened after Rep. George Santos was expelled from Congress - will shrink yet again, with Republicans holding 220 seats to Democrats' 213. A special election has been set for Santos' seat for Feb. 13, with the district considered a toss-up by the Cook Political Report .\n\n\"Hopefully no one dies,\" Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene said about the party's majority after McCarthy announced his retirement.\n\nMcCarthy represents California's 20th District in the central part of the state, stretching from the San Joaquin Valley and the southern tip of the Sierra Nevadas to the Mojave Desert. It's a reliably red district that includes his hometown of Bakersfield.\n\nMcCarthy recently indicated that he's been going through stages of grief since his ouster and did not want to make a rash decision about his future.\n\n\"If I decide to run again, I have to know in my heart I'm giving 110%. I have to know that I want to do that,\" McCarthy said recently at the New York Times' DealBook Summit . \"I also have to know if I'm going to walk away, that I'm going to be fine with walking away.\"\n\n\"If you just got thrown out of speaker, you'd go through different stages, would you not?\" he added. \"I want to know that it's the right thing to do. And then if I'm walking away from something that I spent two decades at, I don't want to look back and say I made an emotional decision.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre congratulated McCarthy on his long career in Congress.\n\n\"The president wishes Speaker McCarthy well, and congratulates him on a career of service. While they have important differences about policy, the president appreciates that they were able to work across the aisle,\" Jean-Pierre said.\n\nMcCarthy, who was elected to Congress in 2006, held the top post for nine months before a deal he made to secure the speakership led to his downfall. His fight to win the gavel when Republicans took control of the House in January included 15 rounds of votes, and foreshadowed the limits of his power over a fractured party.\n\nTo win the support of far-right Republican holdouts, he agreed to a rule allowing a single member to trigger a no-confidence vote to remove the speaker. That came back to haunt him when fellow Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida introduced a resolution to do just that after McCarthy relied heavily on the votes of House Democrats to temporarily avert a government shutdown in September. Eight Republicans voted with all Democrats to remove McCarthy, making it the first time in U.S. history a House speaker was ousted by such a motion.\n\nHis successor, House Speaker Mike Johnson, has made similar decisions since taking over, including relying on Democrats to avert a shutdown in November, but has so far avoided McCarthy's fate.\n\n\"I wish him well,\" Gaetz said of McCarthy's retirement. When asked if he was responsible for driving McCarthy out, Gaetz said, \"I didn't force him to resign. He made the decision.\"\n\nMcCarthy has not hidden his disdain for the Republicans who voted for his removal, telling CNN last month that Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina did not deserve to be reelected, and the Republican Party would benefit \"tremendously\" if Gaetz was not in Congress. He also questioned the motives of Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee.\n\n\"They care a lot about press, not about policy, and so they seem to just want the press and the personality,\" McCarthy told CNN.\n\nBurchett later accused McCarthy of elbowing him in the back in a Capitol Hill hallway in retaliation for the vote, which McCarthy denied.\n\n\"If I were to hit somebody, they would know I hit them,\" McCarthy said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Johnson praised McCarthy for helping Republicans secure the majority and lifting restrictions that had been implemented in Congress during the COVID-19 pandemic. He wished McCarthy the best, saying he \"served faithfully and sacrificed substantially for the good of our country and our cause.\"\n\n\"It's like losing Michael Jordan,\" Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma said.\n\nMajority Leader Steve Scalise of Louisiana said Wednesday that McCarthy's leadership would \"be missed around here.\" McCarthy did not give him a heads up about the announcement, he said.\n\n\"I would have liked him to stay. But it's kind of hard to ask somebody to stay after they're weighing some longer-term decisions,\" Scalise said. \"He was going to have some really good options in the next phases of his life.\"\n\nNikole Killion, Scott MacFarlane and Alejandro Alvarez contributed reporting.\n\nCaitlin Yilek is a politics reporter at CBSNews.com, based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "What Congress accomplished with McCarthy as speaker of the House\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  October 5, 2023 / 12:08 AM EDT / CBS News\n\nMost House Republicans, even some of the most conservative, supported Kevin McCarthy and praised his leadership on the House floor in the hours before his ouster.\n\n\"As the only member who's serving here who took every chance to vote against Speaker Boehner, and to vote against Speaker Ryan, I can tell you that this chamber has been run better, more conservatively, and more transparently, under Mr. McCarthy than any other speaker that I have served under,\" said hardline conservative Rep. Thomas Massie from the House floor before Tuesday's vote on the motion to vacate.\n\nHere is what McCarthy did - and didn't - accomplish in his mere nine months as speaker.\n\nCongress was able to avoid shutting down the government after McCarthy put a 47-day funding resolution on the floor Saturday, hours before funding for the government would expire. It won the support of every Democrat but one, and 90 Republicans voted against it. The bill was overwhelmingly passed by the Senate and signed by President Biden.\n\nThe temporary spending authority will run out in mid-November, and the House will need a new speaker in place in order to address the next looming shutdown crisis.\n\nRepublicans - led in part by McCarthy's temporary successor, Rep. Patrick McHenry - brokered a debt ceiling agreement with Democrats this summer.\n\nThe final agreement, signed by President Biden on June 3, suspends the debt limit until Jan. 1, 2025, after the next presidential election. Without a deal, the economic consequences could have been catastrophic.\n\nUnder McCarthy, the House voted to require the director of national intelligence to declassify information related to the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic. The House approved the measure by unanimous consent, the Senate approved it, and President Biden signed it.\n\nHouse Republicans also established the Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Pandemic, chaired by Republican Rep. Brad Wenstrup, a doctor.\n\nThe committee aimed to get to the bottom of the origins of the COVID-19 pandemic, and the federal response to the outbreak.\n\nIntelligence agencies are divided on whether the pandemic began because of natural transmission or a lab accident. Although the president in March signed the legislation requiring \"any and all of\" the findings about COVID's origins to be declassified within 90 days, the director of national intelligence has so far released only a 10-page report that says the intelligence community has found no evidence of a \"biosafety incident\" or pre-pandemic presence of the virus in a laboratory in Wuhan, China.\n\nAccording to a coronavirus subcommittee , an unidentified, senior CIA whistleblower claimed the CIA offered hush money to cover up findings that the pandemic likely originated in a laboratory in Wuhan, China.\n\nThe House in March passed H.R. 1, the Lower Energy Costs Act, with support from all but one Republican and four Democrats. Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania was the only GOP lawmaker to oppose the measure.\n\nThe legislation aims to boost domestic energy production, reform the permitting process for certain projects, such as natural gas pipelines, and unwind several of the Biden administration's energy policies.\n\nWhile Republican leaders cheered the bill's passage, it's dead in the Senate, and the White House said President Biden would veto the measure .\n\nCongress has so far failed to enact any of the appropriations bills that fund the government, although this is not unusual. It has only managed to pass all 12 spending bills on time in four years, and that last occurred in 1997.\n\nIn most years, Congress passes some of the individual appropriations measures before the end of the fiscal year in September and pushes through a short-term continuing resolution to keep government running while lawmakers wrap the rest into one big \"omnibus\" package for the next fiscal year.\n\nThis year, none of the 12 bills were passed before the end of September, threatening to shut the government down over the weekend when funding dried up. McCarthy's continuing resolution now gives lawmakers until mid-November to finish their appropriations work, but it cost him his speakership.\n\nBy the end of last week, the House had passed four appropriations bills, but they contain cuts that Democrats and the Biden administration are sure to reject, as well social policy riders that Democrats on the committee said were \" irrelevant\" and \"harmful. \"\n\nThe military construction and veterans affairs appropriations bill passed the House in July. While it's $800 million above what President Biden requested, the bill cuts what the bill summary says is \"wasteful spending,\" banning the use of funds \"to promote or advance critical race theory\"  or to implement or enforce any of Mr. Biden's executive orders on diversity, equity and inclusion.\n\nThese three appropriations bills passed in late September. Republicans cut $20 billion from the defense bill, much of it by defunding \"this Administration's divisive social agenda,\" according to the bill summary.\n\nThe House defense appropriations bill bans funding for gender-affirming medical procedures, and it also removes funding for travel expenses for abortion services. And it makes cuts to the Pentagon's civilian personnel and climate-related programs\n\nThe bill description also contains a line stating that security clearances are to be denied \"for any individual listed as a signatory in the statement titled 'Public Statement on the Hunter Biden Emails' dated October 19, 2020.\" This is a reference to a statement made by 51 former top intelligence officials who stated that the release of alleged emails from what was purportedly data from Hunter Biden's laptop \"has all the classic earmarks of a Russian information operation.\"\n\nAmid ongoing investigations by three GOP-led committees into Hunter Biden, Mr. Biden's son, and his overseas business dealings, McCarthy announced last month the opening of a formal impeachment inquiry into the president.\n\nMcCarthy alleged members of Mr. Biden's family made millions of dollars from foreign firms and argued that the allegations show corruption on the part of the president and his family members. Despite the accusations, House Republicans have yet to uncover direct evidence of wrongdoing by Mr. Biden.\n\nThe House Oversight Committee held the first hearing of its impeachment inquiry last month, though it may not have done much to bolster Republicans' claims that Mr. Biden committed high crimes and misdemeanors that warrant his removal. One of the GOP's witnesses, George Washington University law professor Jonathan Turley, testified that he did not believe the \"current evidence\" would support articles of impeachment.\n\nBut House Republicans were investigating the Bidens long before an impeachment inquiry began. In particular, they have been probing the business dealings of Hunter Biden, trying to connect any actions or alleged actions of the president's son to the president himself. Multiple committees, including the House Judiciary Committee and House Committee on Oversight and Reform, have been investigating the Bidens, issuing subpoenas and holding hearings.\n\nOne of the first measures passed by Republicans in January was a resolution establishing a select subcommittee \"on the weaponization of the federal government.\"\n\nThe panel investigates federal investigators, and its establishment stemmed from criticism by Republicans of the Justice Department's investigations involving former President Donald Trump, which include the probe into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election,Trump's handling of sensitive government documents recovered from his South Florida property, Mar-a-Lago, and the August 2022 court-authorized search executed by the FBI at the property.\n\nThe committee is led by Rep. Jim Jordan and composed of 21 members, 12 Republicans and nine Democrats. It's held five hearings so far focusing on alleged politicization of the FBI and its treatment of whistleblowers, as well as accusations of censorship by Twitter, now known as X, and other social media companies.\n\nIn July, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer announced a bipartisan effort to add an amendment to the annual defense spending bill that would require agencies to hand over records dealing with Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAPs), also referred to as UFOs.\n\nFollowing this decision, McCarthy said in July that he'd \"love to see what other facts and information see what we have. I'm very supportive of letting the American public see what we have.\"\n\nA week later, the House Oversight Committee's national security subcommittee then held a public hearing with three former military officers about their alleged encounters with UAPs. The blockbuster hearing inspired a bipartisan group of lawmakers to ask McCarthy to create a select committee to investigate UAPs.\n\nMcCarthy had overwhelming bipartisan support in establishing the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party in January. The House voted 365-65 in favor of creating the committee, with 146 Democrats joining all Republicans.\n\nThe committee has been a rare show of bipartisanship on Capitol Hill, highlighting threats Republicans and Democrats believe are posed by China's government.\n\n\"You have my word and my commitment, this is not a partisan committee,\" McCarthy said on the House floor in January.\n\nThough committee members haven't agreed on all aspects of U.S. policy toward China, they have been able to work together .\n\nMelissa Quinn is a politics reporter for CBSNews.com.

Historic, but looking at how his tenure began, hardly a shock. Back in January, it took McCarthy 15 ballots - more than any Speaker dating back before the Civil War - to win the gavel.\n\nMcCarthy said, \"When you go into the Senate, it's like being in a country club - not a lot of people around. The House is like you walk into a truck stop to have breakfast. But that's the way the founders designed it. We're a microcosm of society, so everything good and bad in society is gonna be here.\"\n\n\"It's rough. Truck-stop rough,\" said Costa.\n\n\"But it's good.\"\n\n\"But eight of them kicked you out of the Speakership,\" Costa said. \"[And] there are still those in the ranks who want to burn the House down.\"\n\n\"I never said it'd be fair ,\" McCarthy replied. \"But, you know, I give as good as I get.\"\n\nSince he was elected to Congress in 2006 and rose as a so-called \"Young Gun,\" McCarthy has made no secret of his ambition. And he claims, during the protracted votes for Speaker last January, he never said to himself, Maybe I don't want this job .\n\n\"I love the challenge,\" McCarthy said. \"I knew at the time I probably wouldn't be able to end the job, I mean, not on my terms. I knew who I was dealing with. I think history will say they were wrong in that decision.\"\n\nNow, the 58-year-old McCarthy is quitting Congress a year before his term is out. He leaves Republicans with a slim majority that is struggling mightily to find consensus.\n\nOn Friday McCarthy sat down with \"CBS News Sunday Morning\" for his first TV interview since announcing his retirement from Congress.\n\nCosta asked, \"Let me read you a quote from the famous Speaker Sam Rayburn: 'Any jackass can kick a barn down, but it takes a carpenter to build it.' Is he right? Especially when it comes to this place, the House of Representatives?\"\n\n\"Yeah,\" McCarthy replied. \"And it takes a lot of builders. I mean, I've had the privilege of being here 17 years, and I got to be a part of building two majorities.\n\n\"I come from California. I grew up in a family that were Democrats. I applied for [an] internship in a Congressional seat. I got turned down. And now, I got elected to that seat I couldn't get an internship for, and I got to be the 55th Speaker of the House. Tell me any other country is that possible in?\"\n\n\"But at the same time, how do you reconcile all of that good feeling with the eight who pushed you out?\" Costa asked. \"And they showed the country they don't really want to govern. They like chaos.\"\n\n\"That's true, but you're gonna have that in any industry, in any place that you live.\"\n\n\"I think this is pretty particular to this place.\"\n\n\"Yes, but remember this: For everybody in America, we don't get to hire who works with us, and we don't get to fire who works with us,\" replied McCarthy.\n\nBut it wasn't hard for rank-and file Republicans to fire him . In October, when McCarthy struck a deal to keep the government funded, eight Republicans responded by pushing him out. His chief antagonist: a Congressman from Florida.\n\nCosta asked, \"When you hear the name Matt Gaetz, what word comes to mind?\"\n\nMcCarthy laughed. \"Uhm, I think history will show who Matt Gaetz really is,\" he replied.\n\n\"Will you support a primary challenge against him, and the others who went against you, in 2024?\"\n\n\"I'm not focused on that.\"\n\n\"You're not ruling it out?\"\n\nMcCarthy said, \"Look, we have too many challenges. And you know what? That doesn't determine the future.\"\n\nOf course, McCarthy does have a focus these days on the prospects of another Florida resident.\n\nCosta asked, \"Will Donald Trump be the nominee?\"\n\n\"Yes. In the Republican Party? Yes,\" McCarthy replied. \"And if Biden stays as the nominee for the Democrats, I believe Donald Trump will win, I believe that Republicans will gain more seats in the House, and the Republicans will win the Senate.\"\n\n\"Can he count on your support?\"\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"That's an endorsement?\"\n\n\"I will support the pres - I will support President Trump,\" McCarthy replied.\n\n\"Would you be willing to serve in a Trump cabinet?\" Costa asked.\n\n\"In the right position. Look, if I am the best person for the job, yes,\" McCarthy said. \"Look, I've worked with President Trump on a lot of policies. We worked together to win the majority. But we also have a relationship where we're very honest with one another.\"\n\nThat relationship with Trump has become a central part of McCarthy's own political story. His stark reversal after the January 6th insurrection - going from blaming Trump (stating on the House floor on January 13, 2021, that \"The president bears responsibility for Wednesday's attack on Congress by mob rioters\"), to standing with him two weeks later at Mar-a-Lago - drew scorn from Democrats, and some Republicans, who saw him rehabilitating a dangerous figure.\n\nCosta said, \"You went to visit Trump at Mar-a-Lago. You threw him a lifeline. He might've been finished if you didn't go. Would you do it again?\"\n\n\"Well, that's your opinion,\" McCarthy replied. \"Look, I know a lot's been written about that. I think at the day, I'll write a story all about it in the book.\"\n\n\"What are you holding back?\"\n\n\"I'm not holding anything back!\" McCarthy said.\n\nCosta asked, \"You praise Trump's policies. You say he's a good guy. But many Americans, they look at his language, they listen to his speeches, and they hear an authoritarian . Some say even a fascist on the horizon in this country. What do you say to those people who have those real concerns?\"\n\nMcCarthy replied, \"Look, I don't see that, and this is what I tell President Trump, too. What President Trump needs to do in this campaign, it needs to be about rebuilding, restoring, renewing America. It can't be about revenge.\"\n\n\"He's talking about retribution , day in, day out.\"\n\n\"He needs to stop that,\" McCarthy responded. \"He needs to stop that.\"\n\n\"You think he's going to listen to you saying, 'Stop that. Stop that'? He hasn't listened to anybody before.\"\n\n\"That's not true,\" said McCarthy. \"He will adapt when he gets all the facts.\"\n\n\"He's not backing away from his calls for retribution,\" said Costa.\n\n\"Yeah, but remember, you have a check and balance system. And I think, at the end of the day-\"\n\nCosta asked, \"Where's the check and balance on him in the Republican Party?\"\n\n\"America doesn't want to see the idea of retribution,\" said McCarthy. \"If it's rebuild, restore and renew, then I think you'll see that. And look - that's him. But I'm not gonna change who I am. And I'm not gonna stop giving him the advice. And look, I lost the job of Speaker. Maybe I don't have the best advice. But I know one thing is, I love this country. I want tomorrow to be better than today. And I'm gonna do everything in my power, and I'm gonna be engaged in the process to make it better.\"\n\nStory produced by Ed Forgotson, Robert Marston and Alisa Wiersema Lucaci.

The measure passed the House with the support of all the Democrats except one, and lost the votes of 90 Republicans.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz , Republican of Florida, who says he plans to file a motion to oust McCarthy as speaker within days, spoke on the House floor Monday, demanding to know \"what was the secret side deal on Ukraine?\"\n\nHe accused McCarthy of \"cutting a side deal to bring Ukraine legislation\" to the floor in a vote separate from the short-term spending bill.\n\nThe president himself certainly fueled the idea, when CBS News asked him on Sunday, \"Are you going to be able to trust Speaker McCarthy when the next deal comes around?\"\n\n\"We just made one about Ukraine,\" he replied. \"So, we'll find out.\"\n\nThe removal of $6 billion in Ukraine funding from the temporary spending bill caused Sen. Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado, to put a hold on the bill when it arrived at the Senate a few hours before a shutdown would take effect if the resolution were not passed. He dropped his hold after Senate leadership released a statement saying, \"In the coming weeks, we expect the Senate will work to ensure the U.S. government continues to provide critical and sustained security and economic support for Ukraine.\"\n\nWhen McCarthy was asked about the existence of a side deal Monday at the Capitol, he told reporters, \"There is no side deal going on.\"\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre dodged several questions Monday from reporters seeking clarity on whether there's a deal with McCarthy to pass Ukraine funding soon. She pointed out there has been \"overwhelming support\" for Ukraine in Congress and noted McCarthy has said he supports providing Ukraine with the weapons it needs. \"We expect him to keep his word on that,\" she said.\n\nBut continuing support for Ukraine has divided House Republicans, and last week, a supplemental Ukraine security bill had more GOP opposition than support, with 117 Republicans voting against it and 101 voting for it.\n\nAfter a White House event Monday afternoon, reporters shouted questions to the president about the existence of a Ukraine deal.

      "text": "Why oust McCarthy? What Matt Gaetz has said about his motivations to remove the speaker of the House\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  October 3, 2023 / 8:14 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nThe House is now without a permanent speaker, after Florida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz's motion to vacate the speaker's chair proved successful in a historic vote on Tuesday, removing California Rep. Kevin McCarthy from the role.\n\nBut why Gaetz would aim to remove McCarthy as speaker of the House at a time when voters far prefer Republicans than Democrats to handle the economy, and when Republicans only narrowly control the House, is a complicated question. The answer can be traced back to when McCarthy became speaker in the first place, just nine months ago.\n\nHere is why Gaetz said he wanted McCarthy out, and why McCarthy thinks Gaetz wanted him out:\n\nBack in January, when Republicans took control of the House, McCarthy was struggling to win the backing of a majority of the House to become speaker. A group of Republican holdouts led by Gaetz withheld their support to extract several concessions from him.\n\nOne of their most pressing complaints was the process by which Congress funds the government, which they say enables runaway government spending.\n\nIn theory, executive branch departments - like the Pentagon, the Justice Department, Homeland Security - are funded through a dozen individual appropriations bills that set spending levels for the year ahead. These bills typically must be passed by Congress and signed by the president by the start of the new fiscal year on Oct. 1 to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nIn practice, Congress has missed that deadline with growing frequency in recent years. To buy more time, lawmakers pass what's known in Washington as a \"continuing resolution,\" which funds the government at current levels for a certain period of time, usually until the holidays. They then use this time to lump all of the individual spending bills together into one massive piece of legislation called an \"omnibus\" that funds the various departments until the following October, when the cycle repeats again.\n\nGaetz and his fellow GOP holdouts wanted to put an end to that practice, and return to \"regular order\" - the consideration and passage of the individual, annual spending bills. This, the argument went, would allow them to extract deeper spending cuts than would otherwise be possible through an omnibus bill, which is often hastily approved with less popular provisions tied to must-pass items.\n\nAs that Oct. 1 deadline approached this year, McCarthy brought up and the House passed four individual spending bills but said a continuing resolution would be needed to avoid a shutdown. Gaetz and about a dozen other Republicans saw this as McCarthy reneging on the terms of their deal to support him in the speaker's election and refused to go along with a funding extension.\n\nGaetz warned that he would call a vote for McCarthy's job if he worked with Democrats on a funding extension.\n\n\"A vote for a continuing resolution is a vote to continue the Green New Deal, a vote to continue inflationary spending, and the most troubling of fashions, a vote for a continuing resolution is a vote to continue the election interference of Jack Smith,\" Gaetz said in remarks on the House floor on Sept. 12. \"We told you how to use the power of the purse: individual, single-subject spending bills that would allow us to have specific review, programmatic analysis and that would allow us to zero out the salaries of the bureaucrats who have broken bad, targeted President Trump or cut sweetheart deals for Hunter Biden.\"\n\nMcCarthy defied Gaetz's threat and brought up what's known as a \"clean\" CR - an extension that maintains funding at current levels. (It also included $16 billion in disaster relief funds, but did not have funding for Ukraine or a border security measure, two issues that had been sticking points in talks between the parties.)\n\nThe legislation passed with wide Democratic support and avoided a government shutdown, but Gaetz followed through on his threat. In an interview with CNN's \"State of the Union\" on Sunday, he announced he would be moving to oust McCarthy and accused the California Republican of repeatedly going back on the deal he made with conservatives in January in his bid for the gavel.\n\n\"Speaker McCarthy made an agreement with House conservatives in January. And, since then, he has been in brazen, repeated material breach of that agreement,\" Gaetz said. He introduced his motion to vacate on Monday night, teeing up Tuesday's vote.\n\nAll of the House Democrats present and and seven other Republicans, in addition to Gaetz, voted for McCarthy's removal:\n\nThe first thing Gaetz said on the House floor Monday, when he suggested his motion to oust McCarthy would be coming soon was, \"What was the secret side deal on Ukraine?\"\n\nCiting a comment President Biden made Sunday, Gaetz accused McCarthy of making a \"secret deal\" to provide more funding for Ukraine in a separate measure, which many Republicans oppose. Continuing to provide support for Ukraine has divided House Republicans - last week, a supplemental funding bill for Ukraine had more GOP opposition than support, with 117 Republicans voting against it and 101 voting for it.\n\nGaetz told CNN that McCarthy was \"baiting Republicans to vote for a continuing resolution without Ukraine money, saying that we were going to jam the Senate on Ukraine\" while at the same time making a \"secret deal.\"\n\nMcCarthy has flatly denied negotiating a deal with Democrats on Ukraine funding.\n\nAs Gaetz rallied support online for his motion to oust McCarthy, he summarized his demands on X: \"No more for Ukraine. No CR's. Cut Spending.\"\n\nGaetz says that McCarthy has lost everyone's trust.\n\n\"We need to move on with new leadership that can be trustworthy,\" he told CNN. \"Look, the one thing everybody has in common is that nobody trusts Kevin McCarthy.\n\n\"He lied to Biden. He lied to House conservatives. He had appropriators marking to a different number altogether,\" he added. \"And the reason we were backed up against the shutdown politics is not a bug of the system. It's a feature.\"\n\nAfter filing his motion to vacate on Monday night, Gaetz denounced to reporters McCarthy as a figure compromised by special interests.\n\n\"He's the product of a corrupt system that rewards people who collect large sums of special interest money and then redistribute that money in exchange for political loyalty and political favors,\" Gaetz said.\n\n\"The reason Kevin McCarthy went down today is because nobody trusts Kevin McCarthy,\" Gaetz told reporters after the vote. \"Kevin McCarthy has made multiple contradictory promises, and when they all came due, he lost votes of people who maybe don't even ideologically agree with me on everything.\"\n\nHe may have been talking about Rep. Nancy Mace, a South Carolina congresswoman who was one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust McCarthy. She said in a statement that her vote was \"about trust and keeping your word.\" Mace, who supported McCarthy for speaker in January - and knocked Gaetz for blocking him - said that McCarthy \"has not lived up to his word on how the House would operate.\"\n\n\"No budget, no separate spending bills until it was too late, a [continuing resolution] which takes spending power out of the hands of the people and puts all the power into the hands of a select few,\" she added. Mace was also unhappy about broken promises she said McCarthy made to her about legislation on women's issues and making communities safe. \"There has been no action,\" she wrote.\n\nOn Sept. 12, Gaetz announced on the House floor he was serving notice to McCarthy to tell him he was \"out of compliance with the agreement that allowed you to assume this role,\" and he warned that he had to come into total compliance or be removed by a motion to vacate.\n\nGaetz rattled off a list of issues McCarthy had agreed to put to a vote and criticized him for reaching a deal with Mr. Biden this summer to lift the debt ceiling .\n\n\"We've had no vote on term limits or on balanced budgets, as the agreement demanded and required. There's been no full release of the Jan. 6 tapes, as you promised. There has been insufficient accountability for the Biden crime family,\" the Florida Republican said. \"Instead of cutting spending to raise the debt limit, you relied on budgetary gimmicks and rescissions so that you ultimately ended up serving as the valet to underwrite Biden's debt and advance his spending agenda.\"\n\nHe complained that eight months into the GOP-led House, investigators \"haven't even sent the first subpoena to Hunter Biden.\"\n\n\"Mr. Speaker, dust off our written January agreement. You have a copy. Reflect on the spirit of that agreement,\" he said. \"Begin to comply. No continuing resolutions. Individual spending bills or bust. Votes on balanced budgets and term limits. Subpoenas for Hunter Biden and the members of the Biden family who've been grifting off this country, and the impeachment of Joe Biden that he so richly deserves. Do these things or face a motion to vacate the chair.\"\n\nMcCarthy has said Gaetz's vendetta against him is personal and that Gaetz is targeting him over a House Ethics Committee investigation opened in 2021 .\n\n\"He's blaming me for an ethics complaint against him that happened in the last Congress,\" McCarthy said on CNBC Tuesday. \"I have nothing to do with it.\"\n\nCNN reported in July that the House Ethics Committee in July had revived a probe into allegations against Gaetz that include sexual misconduct and drug use. Gaetz has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The Justice Department in February told witnesses in the sex trafficking investigation into Gaetz that it would not bring charges against the Florida congressman. The department had been investigating Gaetz to determine if he violated sex trafficking laws or obstructed justice during its probe.\n\nMcCarthy has not yet disclosed his future plans, but he did announce to his conference he would not run again for speaker. He told reporters Tuesday night he hasn't thought about leaving the House.\n\nCaitlin Yilek is a politics reporter at CBSNews.com, based in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "House Speaker Kevin McCarthy says \"I don't see the support in the House\" for Senate measure to fund government\n\nWatch CBS News\n\nUpdated on:  September 27, 2023 / 5:01 PM EDT / CBS News\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Wednesday the Senate's proposed continuing resolution to fund the government is unlikely to advance in the House as a shutdown grows more likely.\n\n\"I don't see the support in the House\" for the Senate bill, McCarthy told reporters.\n\nThe Senate on Tuesday unveiled a stopgap funding measure that would fund the government through Nov. 17 and was negotiated on a bipartisan basis.\n\nThe Senate measure, which advances a House-passed bill to reauthorize the Federal Aviation Administration, includes $6.2 billion in Ukraine aid and $6 billion for natural disasters. The bill would be the vehicle for a continuing resolution.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday said McCarthy is letting \"MAGA radicals\" drive his decisions, and said the bipartisan stopgap measure is \"the only way to avoid a shutdown.\"\n\nHouse Republicans have also indicated they want to force the White House and Democrats to come up with a new plan on border security . McCarthy said Tuesday that night he would not support any continuing resolution without border security provisions. Ukraine aid is also a sticking point for a group of right-wing Republicans.\n\nRep. Bob Good of Virginia, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, told reporters Wednesday that McCarthy told the GOP conference that he would not take up the Senate's proposed continuing resolution, or CR. Other Republicans shared similar sentiments.\n\n\"My sense is the Senate CR is dead on arrival,\" said GOP Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota. \"I just don't get the sense that there's any meaningful support in the Republican conference for that Senate CR.\"\n\nBoth the White House and Republican Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell have endorsed the Senate's stopgap spending measure.\n\n\"We can take the standard approach and fund the government for six weeks at the current rate of operations or we can shut the government down in exchange for zero meaningful progress on policy,\" McConnell said Wednesday.\n\nMcConnell also noted that those concerned about border security would be forcing Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement employees to work without pay if the government shuts down.\n\nMcCarthy, meanwhile, reiterated Wednesday that he plans to have the House take up a continuing resolution on Friday, ahead of the hard deadline Saturday night to approve new funding. If new funding is not approved, the government will shut down while the House considers its full-year appropriations bills.\n\nMcCarthy said Tuesday that his measure would include border security provisions and would drop funding for Ukraine.\n\n\"If they want to put focus on Ukraine and not focus on the southern border, I think their priorities are backwards,\" McCarthy said Tuesday about the Senate measure.\n\nWith Republicans' narrow majority in the House and Democrats united in opposition to deep spending cuts, McCarthy can only afford to lose four votes to pass any bill. The support of Senate Republican leadership for the stopgap measure puts pressure on McCarthy - and could force him to get Democratic support to pass it. However, far-right members of his party have threatened to oust him if he were to do that.\n\nIn an effort to appease hard-line Republicans, the House on Tuesday voted to advance four bills that would fund the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security, State and Agriculture for another year. Even if the bills pass the House, they are not likely to be considered in the Senate.\n\nIf both chambers can't pass a bill to fund the government by 11:59 p.m. on Saturday night, then the government will shut down. A government shutdown will cause thousands of federal employees to go without pay, and federal services that are deemed non-essential will be closed.\n\n\"The American people need our Republican friends in the House of Representatives to do their job, President Biden said Wednesday. \"Fund the government.\"\n\nEllis Kim, Willie James Inman, Alan He and Alejandro Alvarez contributed to this report.\n\nCaroline Linton is an associate managing editor on the political team for CBSNews.com.

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy is haunting Mike Johnson\n\nHouse Speaker Mike Johnson can blame his problems on his predecessor, former Speaker Kevin McCarthy .\n\nAnyone may have struggled to wrangle this slim Republican majority. But it's the concessions that McCarthy made to achieve his long-held ambition that made it near impossible for Johnson, or likely anyone else, to be an effective speaker.\n\nIn January 2023 , McCarthy and his allies were forced to cut a deal with the 20 holdouts that ground business in the chamber to a halt by refusing to accept the California Republican as their leader. To break the stalemate, McCarthy offered a series of concessions.\n\nTwo of the biggest carrots have since become powerful sticks for conservatives to swing against him and now Johnson. The House Freedom Caucus cares so much about protecting the power these agreements gave them that they have tapped a crack team, known as the Floor Action Response Team (FART) , to monitor any potential changes.\n\nThe most noticeable was making it possible for any single lawmaker to file a motion to vacate, the formal process by which the House can rid itself of a speaker. McCarthy reportedly once viewed such a low threshold as a redline, but still agreed to the rules change. Rep. Matt Gaetz, a Florida Republican, later made history by taking advantage of the rule to force McCarthy's ouster. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene , a Georgia Republican, has started the process to oust Johnson.\n\nBut congressional experts at the time were as worried about another part of McCarthy's deal. He offered three seats on the powerful House Rules Committee to more conservative members. It may not seem like much, but the panel, known as the Speaker's Committee, is how the speaker maintains control of the floor.\n\nThe speaker should be able to guarantee the outcome he or she wants because they get to pick the committee's members. The rules committee determines the procedures for how legislation reaches the floor, wielding power to limit potential poison-pill amendments and to limit debate. For those reasons, conservatives have clashed with the panel recently because they want more open debate. McCarthy, and just about every other recent speaker, has pledged more debate on the floor, but in practice, that can be a hard promise to keep.\n\nThe Rules Committee keeps the House moving, but Johnson has been forced to maneuver around it in the face of likely opposition to major bills. But the end around comes with a steep cost, the requirement that legislation receive two-thirds support instead of just a simple majority. As a result, Johnson has been forced to rely on House Democrats to avoid partial government shutdowns, fund the Pentagon, and pass a $79 billion bipartisan tax bill.\n\nMcCarthy wasn't trying to make his life harder. Rep. Tom Cole, an Oklahoma Republican who until recently chaired the Rules Committee, told Politico that the Californian wanted to know about potential problems earlier on.\n\n\"The reality is, I mean, this is McCarthy's idea is that if I'm going to have a problem, I want to see it in the Rules Committee and not on the floor,\" Cole said. \"We've never had a problem in passing a rule.\"\n\nCole stressed that the problem was not with his panel but with what happened later on the floor. It is worth noting that Johnson has had to bypass the panel completely. And when the panel's work reaches the floor, the chaos deepens. Since Republicans took control in 2022, the GOP has failed seven times to pass the rule on the floor, which is an important legislative step as after passing the rule, debate on the actual legislation can begin. In comparison, the House went over two decades without such a failure, per CNN.\n\nAll of these headaches, and the need for McCarthy's deals in the first place, are exacerbated by the reality the House GOP has one of thinnest majorities in history. Republicans began the current Congress with a 221 to 218 majority. Since then, the GOP's numbers have been whittled down by former Rep. George Santos ' expulsion and early resignations by members who have tired of the daily drama. Unlike the Senate, states cannot appoint someone to fill a vacant seat. Instead, states must hold special elections. It can take months for that process. And in the case of Santos, the GOP could also lose the seat. Johnson will soon only have a one-vote majority for any party-line legislation.\n\nFormer House Speaker Newt Gingrich summed up Johnson's reality rather grimly.\n\n\"Well, he has the narrowest majority in modern times, and it's not a true majority, because he's got six or eight narcissists - people who think that they individually get to screw up everything,\" Gingrich told Politico.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Mike Johnson has frustrated the GOP in similar ways as Kevin McCarthy. But he's hanging on to his leadership role - for now\n\nSpeaker of the House Mike Johnson has been in his leadership role for less than six months. Still, he's already made the same political moves that led to former Rep. Kevin McCarthy's historic ousting in October 2023. As a result, Johnson recently received a \"motion to vacate\" of his own.\n\nBut unlike McCarthy, Johnson appears to be hanging on - for now.\n\nIn the middle of the House of Representatives' vote to keep the government funded on March 22, Republican firebrand Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene filed a motion to the clerk to oust Johnson.\n\nUnlike McCarthy's removal, Greene's motion to vacate was not \"privileged,\" meaning there is no immediate timeframe to bring it to a vote on the House floor. Instead, Greene said was meant to be \"more of a warning.\"\n\nGreene's motion didn't completely come out of the blue.\n\nAs she noted to a scrum of journalists, in passing the funding legislation, Johnson ignored the 72-hour mandate McCarthy set at the beginning of his speakership to give members time to read bills before they're brought to the floor, much like how McCarthy broke it in September 2023 to narrowly avoid a government shutdown.\n\nSeveral congressional Republicans also warned Johnson against bringing continuing resolutions to votes, arguing doing so only \"keeps old Democratic policies in place\" that were established when  Rep. Nancy Pelosi served as speaker, just as McCarthy had done. Nevertheless, Johnson's already passed several continuing resolutions.\n\nJust as far-right Republicans cautioned McCarthy against turning to Democratic votes to avoid a shutdown in 2023, which he did, Johnson relied on Democrats to keep the government afloat in March.\n\nThough she called it a warning, Greene said she intended to take the first steps in replacing Johnson from his leadership role.\n\n\"It's time for us to go through the process, take our time, and find a new speaker of the House that will stand with Republicans and our Republican majority,\" she said.\n\nIt remains unclear how successful Greene will be.\n\nShe has yet to float any new names to fill Johnson's spot, and after the Republican Caucus spent weeks deadlocked trying to find a replacement for McCarthy, several Republican representatives told Business Insider they were against replacing Johnson.\n\nWith this in mind, Johnson can sleep soundly - probably in his office - knowing his job is still secure for the time being.\n\nJump to"

His problem is age,\" McCarthy said during a discussion on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\nMcCarthy, who last December retired from the House following his ouster as speaker in October , painted a less-than-stellar picture of Biden's presidential abilities at the White House.\n\n\"I have personally been in situations where I walked out not telling the press what has transpired but was deeply upset as an American of what I saw just transpire,\" the California Republican said. \"Just hoping that he doesn't have any interaction with another world leader with the interaction I just had with him.\"\n\n\"So yes, there is a real concern here and I think that would be on top of everything else,\" he added.\n\nAs Biden has ramped up his reelection campaign, he's had to contend with questions about his mental acuity given that he'd be 82 years old at the start of a second term and 86 at the end of said term.\n\nThe questions were amplified after a special counsel report on Biden's handling of classified documents didn't recommend charges against him but described his memory as \"hazy\" and \"poor.\" After the report was released, Biden firmly pushed back against that characterization in a fiery speech at the White House.\n\nVice President Kamala Harris leaped to the president's defense, blasting the special counsel's claims regarding Biden's memory as \"inaccurate and inappropriate.\"\n\nRepublican Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah earlier this month told The Huffington Post that while age would be a \"huge issue\" in the expected rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump, he hadn't witnessed an overly concerning situation regarding the president's mental acuity.\n\n\"I've worked with the president, and I haven't seen anything that's abnormal before,\" Romney, who was a key player in crafting the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure bill, told the news outlet.\n\nTrump's age has also been raised as an issue, as the 77-year-old has sometimes made rambling remarks on policy issues and mixed up the names of prominent figures.\n\nFormer South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, Trump's remaining major Republican primary opponent, has said that American voters want to move beyond a Biden-Trump rematch, pointing to her candidacy as one that represents a new generation of GOP leadership.\n\nBut so far, Republican voters remain solidly behind Trump, as he's won every major statewide primary or caucus since January.\n\nJump to"

McCarthy, on the other hand, chose to resign at the end of 2023 after Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida led a group of Republicans to oust him from the speakership.\n\nIt didn't take long for the reality of their absence - both men likely would've voted to impeach Mayorkas - to set in.\n\n\"I've never missed Santos more. Whoever he is,\" Gaetz wrote on Twitter, quoting a photo from Santos of the Mayorkas vote tally from inside the House chamber that appeared to be taken by a member of Congress.\n\nI've never missed Santos more. Whoever he is. https://t.co/oCtNPjIPdB\n\nAnd Republican Rep. Anna Paulina Luna of Florida told The Independent that her party should consider whether \"expelling George Santos was actually worth it.\"\n\nSantos himself posted a tirade against the New York Republicans who spearheaded his expulsion, declaring that America is \"stuck with Mayorkas for 6 more weeks\" due to his own expulsion.\n\nNot pulling back! @nicklalota @ANTHONYDESPO @lawler4ny @GarbarinoforNY you did this! America call these vermin and remind them what they did! pic.twitter.com/SltGw3ZKdQ\n\nAs for McCarthy, opinions seem to differ.\n\nIn an appearance on Newsmax, Gaetz described McCarthy's decision to resign after his ouster as an act of \"abject selfishness.\"\n\n\"Kevin McCarthy, after being dislodged as speaker, took his marbles and went home,\" said Gaetz. \"He would've been a reliable vote for impeachment, but if he wasn't speaker, he wasn't willing to stick around.\"\n\nRep. Thomas Massie of Kentucky, on the other hand, said that removing McCarthy in the first place has been an \"unmitigated disaster.\"\n\n\"Our majority has shrunk,\" wrote Massie.\n\nGetting rid of Speaker McCarthy has officially turned into an unmitigated disaster. All work on separate spending bills has ceased. Spending reductions have been traded for spending increases. Warrantless spying has been temporarily extended. Our majority has shrunk.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "A GOP congressman says he has 'zero concerns' about the wave of departures from the House: 'We probably need a few more retirements'\n\nIn recent months, members of both parties have lamented the wave of retirements from Congress, with some influential members calling it quits at the height of their congressional careers.\n\nBut for GOP Rep. Bob Good of Virginia - the conservative Freedom Caucus chair who was one of the eight Republicans who voted to oust then-Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California as speaker last year - the departures have been a welcome turn of events.\n\n\"I think the retirements are a wonderful thing,\" Good recently told CNN . \"I have no concerns, zero concerns. We probably need a few more retirements.\"\n\nMcCarthy recently hinted that the retirements are a desire of GOP figures like Good and Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who both made his life incredibly difficult when he wielded the speaker's gavel and were instrumental to his removal as speaker .\n\nThe Californian declined to run for reelection after his ouster and resigned from the House in December 2023, over a year before his term was set to end in January 2025.\n\n\"It's unfortunate because you think of the brain trust you are losing. I blame a lot of the 'crazy eights' led by Gaetz,\" McCarthy told CNN. \"They want to make this place dysfunctional to try to wear people out. It's very sad.\"\n\n\"It makes it more difficult for getting people to run in the current climate,\" he added.\n\nHowever, Good dismissed concerns about congressional turnover, even as Republicans control the House, albeit narrowly.\n\n\"Brain drain? Why don't you survey the country and see if there is any brain to drain in Congress,\" he told CNN. \"Congress has a 20% approval rating. Most of what we do to the country is bad.\"\n\nAs of Tuesday, 21 GOP lawmakers have chosen not to run for reelection this year or are running for another public office.\n\nSome of the highest-profile Republican retirements in recent months have come from members like Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, who chairs the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party, and Rep. Mark Green of Tennessee, the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee.\n\nEven after muscling through a successful impeachment vote for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas - a longtime goal of House GOP leaders - Green is headed for the exits. (Gallagher was one of just three Republicans, along with Rep. Tom McClintock of California and retiring Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, who opposed Mayorkas' impeachment.)\n\nGOP Rep. Debbie Lesko of Arizona, who last year announced she wouldn't seek reelection, remarked to CNN that gridlock has played a role in some members choosing to move on from Congress.\n\n\"You give up your family, sacrifice being without your family all the time, in exchange for thinking we're really going to accomplish something and get something done,\" she told the network. \"And when that doesn't happen, you start thinking, 'Well, is it worth it?'\"\n\nJump to"

      "text": "Rep. Adam Kinzinger slams House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's leadership in GOP, says somehow 'the crueler you are, the more likely you are to win a primary'\n\nGOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger on Sunday criticized House Minority leader Kevin McCarthy, saying that the GOP lacks leadership.\n\n\"I think Republicans are in some real trouble because we have no leadership, this is a problem,\" Kinzinger said on NBC's \"Meet The Press.\" \"Kevin Mcarthy isn't leading. He's asking what does Marjorie Taylor Greene want me to do. Mitch McConnell is just trying to save the Senate. He is probably not going to do that.\"\n\nKinzinger, who will leave Congress after this session, has been a vocal critic of his party while also drawing the ire of former President Donald Trump by calling out his false claims of election fraud and being one of the few Republicans participating in the January 6 investigation.\n\nThe Illinois congressman has repeatedly criticized the Republican party under Trump's influence.\n\n\"It's not the party I ever joined. It's around a person, and it's kind of creepy to be honest with you,\"  Kinzinger said earlier this month .\n\nKinzinger on Sunday also pointed to the Republican party's shifted stance on abortion post-Roe v. Wade, pushing for bans without exceptions .\n\n\"I've always taken the position of rape, incest, life of the mother, and, you know, certain weeks up until 15 weeks or whatever,\" Kinzinger said. \"And that was actually a fairly common thing in the Republican Party. Even Donald Trump said, 'Rape, incest, life of the mother exceptions.'\n\n\"And now you've been seeing these Republicans go, 'There is absolutely no exception,' because somehow in the Republican party the crueler you are, the more likely you are to win a primary.\"\n\nKinzinger attributed the lack of leadership resulted in his party believing in whatever former President Donald Trump said.\n\n\"We have no leaders. And no wonder our base basically believes everything Donald Trump says,\"  Kinzinger said.\n\nThough Trump has not announced his official plans, reports say he plans to run for in 2024. McCarthy previously said he encouraged Trump to hold his announcement until after the 2022 midterms in November.\n\nJump to"

      "text": "A Republican leader spoke out in support of the pro-democracy protestors in Hong Kong, but some say he's actually hurting the cause\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday expressed solidarity with pro-democracy protesters in Hong Kong who appeared to wave American flags and sing the US national anthem, but some experts say McCarthy's comments could harm the protesters' cause.\n\n\"To the thousands of young people in Hong Kong who are speaking UP for human rights and speaking OUT against the Communist Party of China: we see you waving the American flag, and we hear you singing our national anthem,\" McCarthy wrote on social media . \"America stands for freedom. America stands with Hong Kong.\"\n\nMcCarthy was likely referring to footage that appears to show pro-democracy protesters singing the American national anthem while waving American flags in the streets of Hong Kong. The viral clip was shared on Twitter by Chrystal Neria, a singer, model and Trump campaign adviser who goes by Kaya Jones.\n\nScott Kennedy, a senior adviser at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, called McCarthy's comments \"inaccurate and damaging\" because it \"feeds paranoia in Beijing\" that the US is behind the protests.\n\n\"The protest movement doesn't have anything to do with the US - it's all about the relationship between Hong Kong and China,\" Kennedy told INSIDER.\n\nHe said the footage of protesters waving American flags and singing the anthem was \"not a reflection of the protest movement, either in its origination, the dynamics, the motivations for it, the source of its strength or longevity.\"\n\nThe Chinese government has accused the US of aiding the protesters, which the regime is targeting with an aggressive disinformation and propaganda campaign. And CCTV has reportedly promoted a \"What Is America Up To?\" hashtag on Chinese social media.\n\n\"Some senior U.S. politicians and diplomatic officials met and engaged with anti-China rabble-rousers in Hong Kong, criticized China unreasonably, propped up violent and illegal activities, and undermined Hong Kong's prosperity and stability,\" a spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry, Hua Chunying, said in a statement on the ministry's website.\n\nJorge Guajardo , a former Mexican ambassador to China, called McCarthy's tweet \" the most irresponsible statement imaginable.\"\n\nHe added, \"It puts every protester in danger of being labeled a foreign agent by the Chinese government.\"\n\nAnd Washington Post foreign affairs columnist Ishaan Tharoor tweeted that the conservative lawmaker's comments were \"frankly, stupid.\"\n\n\"Beijing literally wants everyone to believe these protests are US-manufactured. They are not,\" Tharoor wrote. \"But for an elected US official to lend credence to that idea for the sake of jingoism is quite something.\"\n\nA spokesman for McCarthy didn't immediately respond to INSIDER's request for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, President Donald Trump has stopped short of expressing support for the protesters or criticizing the Chinese government in recent days.\n\n\"The Hong Kong thing is a very tough situation. Very tough,\" Trump told reporters on Tuesday. \"We'll see what happens. But I'm sure it'll work out ... I hope it works out for everybody, including China. I hope it works out peacefully. I hope nobody gets hurt. I hope nobody gets killed.\"\n\nThe US State Department struck a different tone in a statement this week describing the US's \"support for freedom of expression and freedom of peaceful assembly in Hong Kong.\"\n\nJump to"

Sánchez\n\n,\n\nJuana Summers\n\nKevin McCarthy became the first speaker removed by a U.S. House vote. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nKevin McCarthy became the first speaker removed by a U.S. House vote.\n\nKevin McCarthy's run as speaker was relatively short and anything but sweet.\n\nOn Tuesday, he was taken down from both sides of the aisle, as eight Republicans joined all Democrats in a historic 216-210 vote to vacate the seat .\n\nBy the end of the night, an interim speaker had been named but there was little certainty about who would ultimately be elected to the role.\n\nHere are four takeaways from a day of turmoil at the Capitol.\n\nMcCarthy was defiant but resigned before the vote on Tuesday. Mangel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nMcCarthy was defiant but resigned before the vote on Tuesday.\n\nFirst, a bit of context.\n\nMcCarthy was elected speaker in January after 15 rounds of voting. He managed to finally secure the gavel, in part by agreeing to demands from a fringe group of Republicans to change the rules on who can propose a resolution to remove the speaker - allowing just one member to do it.\n\nEnter Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz.\n\nGaetz never supported McCarthy for speaker, and on Tuesday led the charge against him. He cited McCarthy's decision to pass a short-term spending bill with Democratic support as evidence he had not \"fulfilled his promises\" to conservatives.\n\nAs McCarthy's allies urged calm during Tuesday's debate, saying a vote to vacate the speaker could \"plunge [the House] into chaos,\" Gaetz was quick to turn blame around.\n\n\"Chaos is Speaker McCarthy. Chaos is somebody who we cannot trust with their word,\" Gaetz said.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., led the charge against McCarthy. Win McNamee/Getty Images hide caption\n\nWhile Gaetz is the face of the rebellion and the de facto leader of the opposition Republicans who voted against McCarthy, the majority of members of the Republican conference in the House stood by their elected leader.\n\nIowa Rep. Mariannette Miller-Meeks, a McCarthy supporter, told All Things Considered the vote to vacate the speakership was \"disappointing and frustrating,\" adding that she believed Gaetz was driven by personal animosity and was President Biden's \"favorite Republican\" because \"he's siding with the Democrats.\"\n\nThe House will be forced to hold a vote on a new speaker, but it's not clear who could win enough votes to secure the position.\n\nMcCarthy said he won't run for speaker again. Majority Whip Tom Emmer indicated to reporters he would not run. And House Majority Leader Steve Scalise said he does not have any announcement to make at this time.\n\nMembers told reporters that they expect to hold a candidate forum next Tuesday ahead of votes on a speaker, possibly as early as Wednesday.\n\nRepublican strategist Ron Bonjean told All Things Considered this isn't how most Republicans would have liked to see this play out.\n\n\"I am really shocked on one hand, and on the other hand, it's rather surprising that [McCarthy] lasted this long considering the current dynamics in the House,\" he said.\n\nHe said he didn't believe the group of eight Republicans that voted with Democrats to oust McCarthy had a plan beyond that move.\n\n\"And I think that's what's most concerning of all, is that they did this out of retribution for him going ahead and funding the U.S. government,\" Bonjean said, in reference to the short-term spending bill that was agreed to at the weekend.\n\nIt's a point echoed by Miller-Meeks, who said her Republican colleagues asked Gaetz who he wanted to replace McCarthy as speaker, but didn't get a name.\n\n\"He has no individual. He has no person,\" Miller-Meeks said.\n\nBefore the vote, there was some speculation that Democrats might step in to save McCarthy by voting \"present\" rather than in favor of the motion to vacate.\n\nBut in the end, McCarthy didn't offer them any concessions and Democrats voted to have him removed.\n\nDemocrats say they will now put forward Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries for speaker - as they did in the rounds of voting in January - but he will almost certainly fall short again in the Republican-majority House.\n\nLeon Panetta, a former Democratic House member and director of the CIA, told All Things Considered that McCarthy was a \"failed leader.\"\n\n\"The reason he failed is because too often he capitulated to his opponents, and ultimately lost his credibility and his trust as a result of that, in the hope that ultimately his opponents would somehow be loyal to him,\" he said. \"I think in doing that, he really undermined his credibility as speaker and that cost him.\"\n\nFor his part, McCarthy said he leaves the speakership \"with a sense of pride, accomplishment and yes, optimism.\"\n\n\"I hope you realize that every day I did the job, regardless whether you underestimated me or not, I wanted to do it with a smile,\" he told reporters after the vote.\n\nFor now, business in the House will come to a standstill.\n\nNorth Carolina Rep. Patrick McHenry has been named \"speaker pro tempore,\" the interim speaker.\n\nRep. Patrick McHenry has been named \"speaker pro tempore,\" the interim speaker. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images hide caption\n\nHe was handpicked by McCarthy to move up in the line of succession to the speakership if the seat was vacated by a death or a vote to vacate.\n\nThe size and scope of McHenry's authority will be played out as the House shakeup will lead to a new permanent leader.\n\nBut whoever is elected as the 56th speaker of the House will have to find a way to fund the government and work with Democrats, knowing the more conservative wings of the party can try to take them down in a single vote.\n\nRepublican strategist Bonjean said that will need to change.\n\n\"There are plenty of Republicans that could do a great job at leading,\" he said. \"It's what they just witnessed which would give many people pause in terms of whether they would actually want to do this job, because it's virtually untenable unless they changed the ability for a small group of Republicans to toss out their leader at a whim.\"\n\nVincent Acovino, Gurjit Kaur, Kelsey Snell and Patrick Jarenwattananon contributed to this report.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

For more than a decade he's represented people in the area of Bakersfield, Calif.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Kevin McCarthy made history this year as the only House speaker to be removed in a vote by his colleagues. MICHEL MARTIN, HOST: And now he has decided to leave Congress entirely, announcing this week that he will resign by the end of this year, which means he won't be finishing his term. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEVIN MCCARTHY: We did our part. And when the stakes were the highest, we rose to the challenge. We were willing to risk it all, no matter the odds, no matter the personal cost. INSKEEP: So that's how McCarthy cast his departure. But what do people think in his district around Bakersfield, Calif., which McCarthy represented for more than a decade? Joshua Yeager covers that area for our member station KVPR, and he's on the line. Good morning. JOSHUA YEAGER, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: What are you hearing around the district? YEAGER: Well, a colleague and I ran around talking to constituents here. McCarthy may be a political lightning rod nationally, but here he's really well liked. Some voters were disappointed to see his own party throw him out. Len Reinhart (ph) is a Republican, and he questioned the party's direction. LEN REINHART: I just don't like their future. Just, like, they're too bickering in there, and they're just not as strong as they used to be, I think. YEAGER: In recent months, though, some Trump supporters I spoke to in Bakersfield had begun to sour on McCarthy. He was caught between the factions of a deeply fractured party. INSKEEP: OK. But who wants to replace him now? YEAGER: A lot of people. As soon as he was removed as speaker this fall, candidates began lining up to challenge him. McCarthy's loss of support within his party has unleashed a political feeding frenzy here. Candidates on both sides of the aisle lined up to run for this hotly contested seat after he was removed as speaker. There are about half a dozen - some Democrat, some Republican. David Giglio is one of them. He's a self-described \"America First\" Republican, and I called him up. DAVID GIGLIO: Kevin represents everything that's wrong with politics. He's made a lot of promises, and he really hasn't delivered much for the Central Valley and for the nation. YEAGER: All of these candidates were planning to run for the seat in 2024. Now that McCarthy is leaving, the governor could call a special election sooner. That's up to him. Candidates who want to run for the congressional term that would start in January 2025 have until next week to file, according to the California Secretary of State office. Adding to the uncertainty over who will succeed McCarthy is whether or not California Governor Gavin Newsom decides to hold a special election once McCarthy officially exits. INSKEEP: OK. So there's a lot of uncertainty here, but what we do know is that McCarthy was a big figure in his party for a moment. What does his departure mean for Republicans? YEAGER: Well, in Congress, it makes the House Republicans' majority even smaller. McCarthy has also been a fundraising giant for the party. He says he plans to continue supporting Republican candidates across the country, but the GOP will no doubt feel their purse strings tighten come this next election season. Now, Democrats may be tantalized by the possibility of flipping a seat held by a former Republican leader and House speaker, but their chances are slim. Even with McCarthy gone, this district is still one of the reddest in California. Trump carried by some 10 points here in 2020. INSKEEP: Joshua Yeager of KVPR, thanks so much. YEAGER: Thank you.

YEAGER: In recent months, though, some Trump supporters I spoke to in Bakersfield had begun to sour on McCarthy. He was caught between the factions of a deeply fractured party. INSKEEP: OK. But who wants to replace him now? YEAGER: A lot of people. As soon as he was removed as speaker this fall, candidates began lining up to challenge him. McCarthy's loss of support within his party has unleashed a political feeding frenzy here. Candidates on both sides of the aisle lined up to run for this hotly contested seat after he was removed as speaker. There are about half a dozen - some Democrat, some Republican. David Giglio is one of them. He's a self-described \"America First\" Republican, and I called him up. DAVID GIGLIO: Kevin represents everything that's wrong with politics. He's made a lot of promises, and he really hasn't delivered much for the Central Valley and for the nation. YEAGER: All of these candidates were planning to run for the seat in 2024. Now that McCarthy is leaving, the governor could call a special election sooner. That's up to him. Candidates who want to run for the congressional term that would start in January 2025 have until next week to file, according to the California Secretary of State office. Adding to the uncertainty over who will succeed McCarthy is whether or not California Governor Gavin Newsom decides to hold a special election once McCarthy officially exits. INSKEEP: OK. So there's a lot of uncertainty here, but what we do know is that McCarthy was a big figure in his party for a moment. What does his departure mean for Republicans? YEAGER: Well, in Congress, it makes the House Republicans' majority even smaller. McCarthy has also been a fundraising giant for the party. He says he plans to continue supporting Republican candidates across the country, but the GOP will no doubt feel their purse strings tighten come this next election season. Now, Democrats may be tantalized by the possibility of flipping a seat held by a former Republican leader and House speaker, but their chances are slim. Even with McCarthy gone, this district is still one of the reddest in California. Trump carried by some 10 points here in 2020. INSKEEP: Joshua Yeager of KVPR, thanks so much. YEAGER: Thank you.

Now that McCarthy is leaving, the governor could call a special election sooner. That's up to him. Candidates who want to run for the congressional term that would start in January 2025 have until next week to file, according to the California Secretary of State office. Adding to the uncertainty over who will succeed McCarthy is whether or not California Governor Gavin Newsom decides to hold a special election once McCarthy officially exits. INSKEEP: OK. So there's a lot of uncertainty here, but what we do know is that McCarthy was a big figure in his party for a moment. What does his departure mean for Republicans? YEAGER: Well, in Congress, it makes the House Republicans' majority even smaller. McCarthy has also been a fundraising giant for the party. He says he plans to continue supporting Republican candidates across the country, but the GOP will no doubt feel their purse strings tighten come this next election season. Now, Democrats may be tantalized by the possibility of flipping a seat held by a former Republican leader and House speaker, but their chances are slim. Even with McCarthy gone, this district is still one of the reddest in California. Trump carried by some 10 points here in 2020. INSKEEP: Joshua Yeager of KVPR, thanks so much. YEAGER: Thank you.

But what do people think in his district around Bakersfield, Calif., which McCarthy represented for more than a decade? Joshua Yeager covers that area for our member station KVPR, and he's on the line. Good morning. JOSHUA YEAGER, BYLINE: Good morning. INSKEEP: What are you hearing around the district? YEAGER: Well, a colleague and I ran around talking to constituents here. McCarthy may be a political lightning rod nationally, but here he's really well liked. Some voters were disappointed to see his own party throw him out. Len Reinhart (ph) is a Republican, and he questioned the party's direction. LEN REINHART: I just don't like their future. Just, like, they're too bickering in there, and they're just not as strong as they used to be, I think. YEAGER: In recent months, though, some Trump supporters I spoke to in Bakersfield had begun to sour on McCarthy. He was caught between the factions of a deeply fractured party. INSKEEP: OK. But who wants to replace him now? YEAGER: A lot of people. As soon as he was removed as speaker this fall, candidates began lining up to challenge him. McCarthy's loss of support within his party has unleashed a political feeding frenzy here. Candidates on both sides of the aisle lined up to run for this hotly contested seat after he was removed as speaker. There are about half a dozen - some Democrat, some Republican. David Giglio is one of them. He's a self-described \"America First\" Republican, and I called him up. DAVID GIGLIO: Kevin represents everything that's wrong with politics. He's made a lot of promises, and he really hasn't delivered much for the Central Valley and for the nation. YEAGER: All of these candidates were planning to run for the seat in 2024.

Chip Roy, R-Texas, speaks during the House Freedom Caucus news conference to oppose the debt limit deal outside of the Capitol on May 30. Bill Clark/CQ-Roll Call, Inc via Getty Images hide caption\n\nRep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, speaks during the House Freedom Caucus news conference to oppose the debt limit deal outside of the Capitol on May 30.\n\nAnger over House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's deal with President Biden to raise the debt ceiling is bubbling over, with some conservative members threatening to oust McCarthy as speaker.\n\n\"This deal fails - fails completely - and that's why these members and others will be absolutely opposed to the deal and we will do everything in our power to stop it,\" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry of Pennsylvania said during a press conference with caucus members Tuesday afternoon.\n\nTexas Rep. Chip Roy, a member of the Freedom Caucus, was even more blunt: \"The Republican conference right now has been torn asunder,\" he said. \"Not one Republican should vote for this deal - not one.\"\n\nRoy argued there was a \"breach\" in the structure set up by House Republicans after the January vote to elect McCarthy as speaker . He vowed to fight the new compromise bill and, without mentioning the speaker by name, added: \"No matter what happens, there is going to be a reckoning.\"\n\nUnder a rule McCarthy agreed to in January as a concession to his conservative critics, any one House member can offer a resolution to remove the House speaker.\n\nThe deal McCarthy and Biden reached in principal over the weekend would avoid a historic government debt default by raising the nation's debt ceiling for nearly two years.\n\nThe compromise bill, clocking in at 99 pages long , holds nondefense spending for fiscal year 2024 at roughly current levels and will raise it by 1% in 2025. It also sets spending caps for the federal budget, raises the age of food stamp recipients subject to work requirements and claws back funding for the Internal Revenue Service, among other things. But some conservatives in the House criticized the scale of the cuts, arguing they were not fully in line with an earlier partisan bill to raise the debt ceiling that House Republicans passed in April.\n\nOne after another, members of the Freedom Caucus at the press conference called on fellow Republicans to oppose the bill.\n\nRep. Dan Bishop, R-N.C., called the vote on the deal a \"career-defining vote for every Republican.\"\n\nLater, when asked by reporters if a motion to oust McCarthy over the bill is on the table, Bishop was the sole member to raise his hand.\n\nMcCarthy, for his part, is projecting confidence.\n\nAsked by reporters whether he thinks his speakership is secure, McCarthy responded: \"Yep.\"\n\nAs to opposition from members of his own conference, McCarthy defended the deal, saying \"it's the most conservative deal we ever had.\"\n\nHe added: \"Sometimes people just don't want to vote for a debt ceiling.\"\n\nRep. Patrick McHenry, one of the key negotiators of the deal, told reporters he does not believe McCarthy's job is in jeopardy.\n\n\"With a narrow majority in the House, we got the most conservative outcome we possibly could,\" the North Carolina Republican said. \"I wanted more - I absolutely wanted more - but what we have here is better than what was about to come.\"\n\nThe fact that conservative GOP - and progressive Democratic - lawmakers aren't happy with the final compromise deal isn't entirely surprising. Top congressional leaders as well as Biden said that no one would walk away completely satisfied. Rep. Greg Casar, member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, told All Things Considered co-host Ailsa Chang Tuesday that \"many\" in the caucus are leaning against the bill over some of the spending cuts. \"We have to hold the line against people getting screwed, getting kicked off of vital food programs, getting kicked off of their child core assistance, losing health care or losing housing,\" Casar said. The group argues that savings could have been found instead by closing tax loopholes for wealthy taxpayers.\n\nRepublican Rep. Dusty Johnson of South Dakota, who chairs the conservative Main Street Caucus, maintains the compromise legislation can still pass the House.\n\n\"We're going to get to 218, and I have every confidence of that,\" he told NPR's Here & Now .\n\n\"The vast majority of the Republican conference in the House is going to vote for this bill. And and how could they not? It is in many ways an historic accomplishment,\" he said, noting the reduction in spending and changes to welfare reform policy.\n\nAsked on Monday whether he was aware of any threat to McCarthy as speaker, Johnson said he hadn't heard of one.\n\nThe bill overcame a potential roadblock on Tuesday night when the House Rules Committee voted 7-6 to advance it to the House floor for debate and a vote on final passage, which is planned for Wednesday.\n\nThe panel includes nine Republicans and four Democrats and typically paves the way for bills drafted by the speaker to the House floor.\n\nConservative Freedom Caucus members had hoped to block the bill from advancing out of the Rules Committee. But Rep. Thomas Massie, a conservative who the group hoped would join their effort, chose to advance it to the House floor. Earlier in the day, Massie said members of the Rules panel owe the rest of Congress \"an honest shake\" and opportunity to voice their opinion with a vote on the House floor.\n\nFreedom Caucus members Reps. Ralph Norman and Chip Roy joined Democrats on the committee to vote against the rule.\n\nDuring the Rules Committee hearing earlier in the day, Rep. Brendan Boyle, D-Penn., said that while he has yet to meet anyone who loves the deal, \"perhaps that is a sign it is fair compromise between a narrowly Republican House, and a narrowly Democratic Senate, and of course, a Democratic White House.\"\n\nIf the bill passes the House, it then moves to the Senate, where Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has said there may be a weekend vote to get the legislation passed before June 5, the date at which the Treasury Department has said the U.S. may run out of money to pay its bills.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., got into an altercation with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday. Alex Brandon/AP hide caption\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., got into an altercation with former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday.\n\nIn a sign of how deeply divided the House Republican conference remains after weeks of infighting, former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and one of the Republicans who voted to oust him had an altercation in the Capitol Tuesday.\n\nMcCarthy shoved past Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., as he was speaking with NPR's Claudia Grisales in a hallway. Burchett stumbled forward and yelled after McCarthy, \"Why'd you elbow me in the back, Kevin?! Hey Kevin, you got any guts?!\"\n\nBurchett then called McCarthy a \"jerk\" and chased him down the hallway. When he caught up to him, he said, \"What kind of chicken move is that? You're pathetic, man. You are so pathetic.\"\n\nBurchett said it was the first time he'd spoken to McCarthy since he voted to oust him last month.\n\n\"That was it,\" he said. \"He should have kept his word. I think that just showed what he's about and it's unfortunate.\"\n\nMcCarthy denied elbowing Burchett, telling CNN that it was a \"tight hallway.\"\n\nThe dust-up comes hours before the House is slated to vote on a stopgap measure to keep the government open - the same thing that triggered the push to oust McCarthy in the first place. That unprecedented ouster brought legislative work to a halt and left the conference in disarray for three weeks while they tried to coalesce around a new speaker candidate.\n\nPolitical disagreements in Congress are nothing new but the exchange between McCarthy, who was once one of the top leaders in the party, and a ranking member escalates a long slide of bitterness and anger in the House.\n\nAnd unlike previous disagreements, many Republicans say recent conflicts have grown increasingly personal.\n\nSen. Markwayne Mullin, a former member of the House, made lewd accusations last month about Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., after Gaetz triggered the push to oust McCarthy. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene attacked Rep. Darrell Issa Tuesday morning through the use of emojis . And recent conference meetings have been heated, sometimes devolving into expletive-laden shouting .\n\nIn one recent example of the animosity, after Rep. Steve Womack, R-Ark., joked about a failed vote to expel New York Rep. George Santos, Santos went after Womack's son, who has struggled with drug addiction.\n\n\"Those are, you know, childish acts really, when you resort to going on social media and crossing red lines for a lot of members involving their families,\" Womack said.\n\nWomack said this isn't the olden days when members of Congress could have heated fights during the day, followed by joint dinners that night.\n\n\"You know, I long for those days. That's the way it was designed, and that's the way it ought to function,\" he said. \"But sadly, today there are too many personalities involved, and that's regretful. It gets in the way of us getting our work done.\"\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

At issue, of course, is the regular operation of the federal government. Federal agencies were to shut down at midnight after Congress failed to approve regular funding bills. The holdup was among Republicans in the House between a group of hard-liners and Speaker Kevin McCarthy. But this morning, the speaker said he would move a bill with help from Democrats. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) KEVIN MCCARTHY: We will put a clean funding stopgap on the floor to keep government open for 45 days for the House and Senate to get their work done. SIMON: NPR senior Washington editor and correspondent Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: Big reversal for the speaker. What's in his plan? Can it work to avoid a shutdown for at least 45 days? ELVING: There's a chance it could. It could get the votes it needs in the House today by adding some Democrats to the portion of the Republican majority that is still loyal to McCarthy. That's what we've been waiting for. And because this is an unorthodox move, it's not been through the normal process and rules. McCarthy will need the support of two-thirds of all the members voting, so not just some bipartisan support, but robust support in both parties. And we know a lot of conservatives are still saying no. And we don't really have a count on the Democrats. They may want to sign on because they want to avoid a shutdown and because McCarthy's plan does use current spending levels, no big new cuts. And it also has a sweetener in the disaster money that the White House asked for. But there are going to be other Democrats saying no because there's no new money for Ukraine. So huge reversal for the speaker after all this battle in his own party. Now he's reaching across the aisle. We'll see how many votes he gets. SIMON: Why had the speaker been unwilling to work with - how do I put this up for you? How do - why was it that the speaker was willing to work with Democrats in June to raise the debt ceiling but not before today when it came to funding the federal government? ELVING: The difference in June was that the debt ceiling was more widely understood to be a crisis, a serious threat to the well-being of the U.S. economy with implications around the world. Kevin McCarthy and other Republicans were more motivated to reach a deal before that debt deadline because they accepted it as real and consequential. So that time, McCarthy struck a deal with President Biden, and he allowed a bipartisan vote on it. And that deal actually wound up with more Democratic votes than Republican. Of course, that only angered and embittered McCarthy's critics on the right, including some of the rebels who had opposed his elevation to speakership way back in January. So they vowed revenge, and they took their chance this month when the House needed to be passing the bills that would fund the federal functions beyond the end of the fiscal year, which is tonight at midnight. So this time around, McCarthy's been reluctant to reach out for those Democratic votes because his critics say if he does, they will force a vote to remove him as the leader of the Republican Party. And the Senate's got an endorsed bipartisan compromise that would keep the government open a while and provide time for more negotiation. And that could be brought to the floor and possibly pass with Democratic support. But again, that would trigger the vote to remove him. SIMON: Yeah. House Republicans did find time this week to open hearings on impeaching President Biden. Did it seem to convince the undecided? ELVING: Well, the first impeachment inquiry hearing did happen this week, did not make a lot of news because it did not contain much that was new. The House members who were driving this process seemed to be playing a movie in their heads called \"The Biden Crime Family.\" But it's not a movie most of the country has ever seen. We're told it's based on a true story, but we have yet to see the movie as they describe it. And this week's event included a well-known law professor, Jonathan Turley, who has testified in hearings before, often pleasing the Republicans who called on him to testify. But this time, he said he had yet to see evidence to justify impeachment. And that seemed the opposite of what they wanted to hear. SIMON: Senator Dianne Feinstein died this week at the age of 90 after serving more than 30 years in the Senate, first became a national figure following the assassination of Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone in San Francisco. She became mayor then and enlisted a lot of sympathy and respect, didn't she? ELVING: All but overcome with emotion herself, she toughed it out, went before the cameras with the news and then took the reins of a city that was in shock and in mourning. That was 45 years ago, a lifetime ago. And in the interim, she led a breakthrough for women in the Senate and became the longest-serving woman in Senate history. She has earned her rest.

SIMON: NPR senior Washington editor and correspondent Ron Elving joins us. Ron, thanks for being with us. RON ELVING, BYLINE: Good to be with you, Scott. SIMON: Big reversal for the speaker. What's in his plan? Can it work to avoid a shutdown for at least 45 days? ELVING: There's a chance it could. It could get the votes it needs in the House today by adding some Democrats to the portion of the Republican majority that is still loyal to McCarthy. That's what we've been waiting for. And because this is an unorthodox move, it's not been through the normal process and rules. McCarthy will need the support of two-thirds of all the members voting, so not just some bipartisan support, but robust support in both parties. And we know a lot of conservatives are still saying no. And we don't really have a count on the Democrats. They may want to sign on because they want to avoid a shutdown and because McCarthy's plan does use current spending levels, no big new cuts. And it also has a sweetener in the disaster money that the White House asked for. But there are going to be other Democrats saying no because there's no new money for Ukraine. So huge reversal for the speaker after all this battle in his own party. Now he's reaching across the aisle. We'll see how many votes he gets. SIMON: Why had the speaker been unwilling to work with - how do I put this up for you? How do - why was it that the speaker was willing to work with Democrats in June to raise the debt ceiling but not before today when it came to funding the federal government? ELVING: The difference in June was that the debt ceiling was more widely understood to be a crisis, a serious threat to the well-being of the U.S. economy with implications around the world. Kevin McCarthy and other Republicans were more motivated to reach a deal before that debt deadline because they accepted it as real and consequential. So that time, McCarthy struck a deal with President Biden, and he allowed a bipartisan vote on it. And that deal actually wound up with more Democratic votes than Republican. Of course, that only angered and embittered McCarthy's critics on the right, including some of the rebels who had opposed his elevation to speakership way back in January. So they vowed revenge, and they took their chance this month when the House needed to be passing the bills that would fund the federal functions beyond the end of the fiscal year, which is tonight at midnight. So this time around, McCarthy's been reluctant to reach out for those Democratic votes because his critics say if he does, they will force a vote to remove him as the leader of the Republican Party. And the Senate's got an endorsed bipartisan compromise that would keep the government open a while and provide time for more negotiation. And that could be brought to the floor and possibly pass with Democratic support. But again, that would trigger the vote to remove him. SIMON: Yeah. House Republicans did find time this week to open hearings on impeaching President Biden. Did it seem to convince the undecided? ELVING: Well, the first impeachment inquiry hearing did happen this week, did not make a lot of news because it did not contain much that was new. The House members who were driving this process seemed to be playing a movie in their heads called \"The Biden Crime Family.\" But it's not a movie most of the country has ever seen. We're told it's based on a true story, but we have yet to see the movie as they describe it. And this week's event included a well-known law professor, Jonathan Turley, who has testified in hearings before, often pleasing the Republicans who called on him to testify. But this time, he said he had yet to see evidence to justify impeachment. And that seemed the opposite of what they wanted to hear. SIMON: Senator Dianne Feinstein died this week at the age of 90 after serving more than 30 years in the Senate, first became a national figure following the assassination of Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone in San Francisco. She became mayor then and enlisted a lot of sympathy and respect, didn't she? ELVING: All but overcome with emotion herself, she toughed it out, went before the cameras with the news and then took the reins of a city that was in shock and in mourning. That was 45 years ago, a lifetime ago. And in the interim, she led a breakthrough for women in the Senate and became the longest-serving woman in Senate history. She has earned her rest.

And we know a lot of conservatives are still saying no. And we don't really have a count on the Democrats. They may want to sign on because they want to avoid a shutdown and because McCarthy's plan does use current spending levels, no big new cuts. And it also has a sweetener in the disaster money that the White House asked for. But there are going to be other Democrats saying no because there's no new money for Ukraine. So huge reversal for the speaker after all this battle in his own party. Now he's reaching across the aisle. We'll see how many votes he gets. SIMON: Why had the speaker been unwilling to work with - how do I put this up for you? How do - why was it that the speaker was willing to work with Democrats in June to raise the debt ceiling but not before today when it came to funding the federal government? ELVING: The difference in June was that the debt ceiling was more widely understood to be a crisis, a serious threat to the well-being of the U.S. economy with implications around the world. Kevin McCarthy and other Republicans were more motivated to reach a deal before that debt deadline because they accepted it as real and consequential. So that time, McCarthy struck a deal with President Biden, and he allowed a bipartisan vote on it. And that deal actually wound up with more Democratic votes than Republican. Of course, that only angered and embittered McCarthy's critics on the right, including some of the rebels who had opposed his elevation to speakership way back in January. So they vowed revenge, and they took their chance this month when the House needed to be passing the bills that would fund the federal functions beyond the end of the fiscal year, which is tonight at midnight. So this time around, McCarthy's been reluctant to reach out for those Democratic votes because his critics say if he does, they will force a vote to remove him as the leader of the Republican Party. And the Senate's got an endorsed bipartisan compromise that would keep the government open a while and provide time for more negotiation. And that could be brought to the floor and possibly pass with Democratic support. But again, that would trigger the vote to remove him. SIMON: Yeah. House Republicans did find time this week to open hearings on impeaching President Biden. Did it seem to convince the undecided? ELVING: Well, the first impeachment inquiry hearing did happen this week, did not make a lot of news because it did not contain much that was new. The House members who were driving this process seemed to be playing a movie in their heads called \"The Biden Crime Family.\" But it's not a movie most of the country has ever seen. We're told it's based on a true story, but we have yet to see the movie as they describe it. And this week's event included a well-known law professor, Jonathan Turley, who has testified in hearings before, often pleasing the Republicans who called on him to testify. But this time, he said he had yet to see evidence to justify impeachment. And that seemed the opposite of what they wanted to hear. SIMON: Senator Dianne Feinstein died this week at the age of 90 after serving more than 30 years in the Senate, first became a national figure following the assassination of Harvey Milk and Mayor George Moscone in San Francisco. She became mayor then and enlisted a lot of sympathy and respect, didn't she? ELVING: All but overcome with emotion herself, she toughed it out, went before the cameras with the news and then took the reins of a city that was in shock and in mourning. That was 45 years ago, a lifetime ago. And in the interim, she led a breakthrough for women in the Senate and became the longest-serving woman in Senate history. She has earned her rest.

      "text": "The race to replace McCarthy in California\n\nBy\n\nJoshua Yeager\n\nKevin McCarthy isn't in Congress anymore, but that doesn't mean his influence isn't still being felt back home in Bakersfield where the race to replace him has become chaotic.\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST: Sunday was Kevin McCarthy's last day on the job. Today the eight-term Republican from California woke up a regular civilian. After a tumultuous year, McCarthy reached the highest position in Congress as speaker of the House before being ousted just months later after efforts by members of his own party. Now someone has to fill his shoes, and the race is on to replace the one-time Republican leader in his Bakersfield district. As KVPR's Joshua Yeager reports, the contest is shaping up to be just as chaotic as McCarthy's brief speakership. JOSHUA YEAGER, BYLINE: Republicans in Bakersfield didn't expect to be in this position, but here they are. GREG PERRONE: I'm horribly disappointed. YEAGER: Greg Perrone is president of the Greater Bakersfield Republican Assembly. After watching Bakersfield boy Kevin McCarthy rise to speaker of the House, the group is weighing their options for a totally new representation. PERRONE: And then if you look at the fiasco of who's going to run to replace him, it just created a bigger mess instead of doing the honorable thing, which is, I'm not going to seek reelection. YEAGER: McCarthy's departure has unleashed a political feeding frenzy here in the district. Ten candidates will duke it out for McCarthy's seat. One of them, Assemblyman Vince Fong, was a McCarthy staffer and has his endorsement. But McCarthy's tenuous succession plan has created problems for his heir apparent. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: The secretary of state has announced Vince Fong will not be allowed to run for the 20th Congressional District. YEAGER: That's because the two-term assemblyman's name is already on the ballot for reelection to the state House. A Sacramento judge, though, ruled in the candidate's favor, striking down a century-old law that prevents candidates from running for two offices on the same ballot. Secretary of State Shirley Weber says she'll appeal the ruling. All the attention has put a bull's eye on Fong for other candidates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVID GIGLIO: Vince should not be in this race. YEAGER: David Giglio hoped to unseat McCarthy even before his resignation. That's why he's here, making his case to the Bakersfield Republican Assembly. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) GIGLIO: This is a chance for the Central Valley to change course. Kevin McCarthy has dictated California Republican politics now for decades. YEAGER: Fong will have a distinct advantage with McCarthy's weight and war chest behind him. McCarthy leaves Congress with some 10 million in the bank. But before anyone can choose who they want to take the seat in 2025, the district will hold a separate special election to fill the rest of McCarthy's term, an election that hasn't even been scheduled yet.

McCarthy leaves Congress with some 10 million in the bank. But before anyone can choose who they want to take the seat in 2025, the district will hold a separate special election to fill the rest of McCarthy's term, an election that hasn't even been scheduled yet.

After watching Bakersfield boy Kevin McCarthy rise to speaker of the House, the group is weighing their options for a totally new representation. PERRONE: And then if you look at the fiasco of who's going to run to replace him, it just created a bigger mess instead of doing the honorable thing, which is, I'm not going to seek reelection. YEAGER: McCarthy's departure has unleashed a political feeding frenzy here in the district. Ten candidates will duke it out for McCarthy's seat. One of them, Assemblyman Vince Fong, was a McCarthy staffer and has his endorsement. But McCarthy's tenuous succession plan has created problems for his heir apparent. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) UNIDENTIFIED REPORTER: The secretary of state has announced Vince Fong will not be allowed to run for the 20th Congressional District. YEAGER: That's because the two-term assemblyman's name is already on the ballot for reelection to the state House. A Sacramento judge, though, ruled in the candidate's favor, striking down a century-old law that prevents candidates from running for two offices on the same ballot. Secretary of State Shirley Weber says she'll appeal the ruling. All the attention has put a bull's eye on Fong for other candidates. (SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING) DAVID GIGLIO: Vince should not be in this race. YEAGER: David Giglio hoped to unseat McCarthy even before his resignation.

Some congressional observers say this is a mess that's been in the making for years. So how did the GOP get here, and how does the Republican conference and the House find a path forward? Norman Ornstein has been writing and thinking about Congress and American politics for decades. He's a senior fellow emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute, and he joins me now. Good morning, Norman. Welcome to the program. NORMAN ORNSTEIN: Thanks, Leila. Great to be with you. FADEL: So I'd like to refer to something you and Thomas Mann wrote in The Washington Post 10 years ago. In this piece, you said at the time you had no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the dysfunction lies with the Republican Party. So 10 years ago, did you predict what we're seeing now? ORNSTEIN: You know, I pretty much predicted what we saw this week, but I wasn't quite as pessimistic in terms of where the country was going to be heading. But what we could see - and, you know, I've been around Congress now for more than five decades, worked closely with both parties, know a whole lot of the members. But what Tom Mann and I saw - and both of us were in this situation - was a dynamic that was changing one political party into something that was dysfunctional. And what we saw back then as well, you know, the - Eric Cantor, who was then a part of the leadership team, Kevin McCarthy and Paul Ryan, back in 2010, wrote a book called \"Young Guns:\" - taken from the movie of the same name - \"A New Generation Of Conservative Leadership.\" They didn't even mention their own leader, John Boehner. And they fanned out around the country to bring the Tea Party to Washington, basically told them that they were going to affect dramatic changes, cut spending and have big tax cuts and destroy the system as we had known it. And those radicals they brought in really believed it, but they didn't accomplish those goals. And ultimately they turned against their own leaders. Eric Cantor was the first to go. He lost in a primary to a Tea Party radical. John Boehner, who had been the speaker, basically got forced out with some help from the others. Then Paul Ryan left. And now we saw Kevin McCarthy basically eaten alive because they had helped turn a party into something that was more radical, more distrustful of their own leaders and, frankly, has become a kind of cult. FADEL: So if... ORNSTEIN: And that's what we saw. FADEL: So if one party, as you describe, is some kind of cult, is extreme, as you say, what is the path forward in a House of Representatives that has both and needs both to get pretty much anything done? ORNSTEIN: It's not a very good path for governing. And, you know, what ended up killing McCarthy - and of course, we saw the roots of this directly and immediately back when it took him 15 votes to become speaker and he had to make concession after concession to his more fringe group. But, you know, that was to get 45 days before we have yet another showdown over shutting down the government. And part of that effort to even get that vote done meant cutting out funding for Ukraine. We're not looking at a good path ahead. We don't yet know who the replacement will be. We have a temporary replacement right now, Patrick McHenry of North Carolina. But if you look at the two candidates who are out there now - Jim Jordan, who is one of the most radical members and favored by the insurgents who toppled Kevin McCarthy, and then you've got Steve Scalise, who once defined himself as David Duke without the baggage - we're not looking at a better picture in terms of bringing things together and governing. We're not in a good place as a country right now. FADEL: Norman Ornstein is a senior fellow emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute. Thank you, Norman, for your time and your insights.

In this piece, you said at the time you had no choice but to acknowledge that the core of the dysfunction lies with the Republican Party. So 10 years ago, did you predict what we're seeing now? ORNSTEIN: You know, I pretty much predicted what we saw this week, but I wasn't quite as pessimistic in terms of where the country was going to be heading. But what we could see - and, you know, I've been around Congress now for more than five decades, worked closely with both parties, know a whole lot of the members. But what Tom Mann and I saw - and both of us were in this situation - was a dynamic that was changing one political party into something that was dysfunctional. And what we saw back then as well, you know, the - Eric Cantor, who was then a part of the leadership team, Kevin McCarthy and Paul Ryan, back in 2010, wrote a book called \"Young Guns:\" - taken from the movie of the same name - \"A New Generation Of Conservative Leadership.\" They didn't even mention their own leader, John Boehner. And they fanned out around the country to bring the Tea Party to Washington, basically told them that they were going to affect dramatic changes, cut spending and have big tax cuts and destroy the system as we had known it. And those radicals they brought in really believed it, but they didn't accomplish those goals. And ultimately they turned against their own leaders. Eric Cantor was the first to go. He lost in a primary to a Tea Party radical. John Boehner, who had been the speaker, basically got forced out with some help from the others. Then Paul Ryan left. And now we saw Kevin McCarthy basically eaten alive because they had helped turn a party into something that was more radical, more distrustful of their own leaders and, frankly, has become a kind of cult. FADEL: So if... ORNSTEIN: And that's what we saw. FADEL: So if one party, as you describe, is some kind of cult, is extreme, as you say, what is the path forward in a House of Representatives that has both and needs both to get pretty much anything done? ORNSTEIN: It's not a very good path for governing. And, you know, what ended up killing McCarthy - and of course, we saw the roots of this directly and immediately back when it took him 15 votes to become speaker and he had to make concession after concession to his more fringe group. But, you know, that was to get 45 days before we have yet another showdown over shutting down the government. And part of that effort to even get that vote done meant cutting out funding for Ukraine. We're not looking at a good path ahead. We don't yet know who the replacement will be. We have a temporary replacement right now, Patrick McHenry of North Carolina. But if you look at the two candidates who are out there now - Jim Jordan, who is one of the most radical members and favored by the insurgents who toppled Kevin McCarthy, and then you've got Steve Scalise, who once defined himself as David Duke without the baggage - we're not looking at a better picture in terms of bringing things together and governing. We're not in a good place as a country right now. FADEL: Norman Ornstein is a senior fellow emeritus at the American Enterprise Institute. Thank you, Norman, for your time and your insights.

Joshua Yeager/KVPR hide caption\n\nThe Rodriguez family celebrates a birthday at Wool Growers, a 67-year-old Basque restaurant in House Speaker Kevin McCarthy's Bakersfield district.\n\nIn Wool Growers, a historic Basque restaurant and Bakersfield institution, owner Jenny Maitia-Poncetta - and many locals - watched the debt ceiling showdown unfold from a tiny TV hanging above the bar.\n\nMcCarthy's willingness to reach across the aisle and usher in a deal is a strength of the embattled speaker, she said.\n\n\"I'm a Republican, and I'm proud of being a Republican, but I know we need to work together to make it work,\" she said of the bill that ultimately saw more Democratic votes than Republican.\n\nAnd besides, she says, the deal saw non-defense spending shrink for the first time in years. Deeper cuts would be ideal, but that's still a win for conservatives.\n\n\"Anything is better than nothing,\" the restaurateur adds.\n\nDiner Randy McDaniel agrees between sips of hearty vegetable soup.\n\n\"I'm very conservative, but I think people who are too far right are going to kill us if they don't get in the middle a little bit,\" he said.\n\nIn particular, McDaniel says he's happy to see the expansion of work requirements tied to food stamp eligibility.\n\n\"I'm good with helping people who really need it, but I think there's too many people out there that are not doing their part to try and improve,\" he said.\n\nIvy Cargile is a political science professor at California State University, Bakersfield. She's been watching the discussions closely and says McCarthy fared better than expected, given his contentious path to the speakership .\n\n\"The debt ceiling bill passed and this is a win for him,\" she said. \"This is a solid win for him.\"\n\nShe says a deal to raise the debt limit and spare the country an unprecedented financial crisis was hardly a foregone conclusion.\n\n\"I was concerned,\" she said. \"In Kern County, poverty levels are high. People do live paycheck-to-paycheck. And some of those paychecks come from the federal government.\"\n\nCargile says she's eagerly waiting to see how McCarthy will handle the federal government's funding fight - through the formal budget-making process - at the end of the year.\n\nIn an unprecedented concession to claiming the speaker's gavel, any single House Republican can trigger a motion to fire McCarthy. It remains unclear whether any in his conference will trigger what some lawmakers have called the \"nuclear\" option.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped hardline conservatives from expressing their displeasure with McCarthy and party leadership. Earlier this week, some in the Freedom Caucus upended routine House procedures ahead of a vote to forbid future bans on gas stoves, a Republican priority.\n\nThe tumult spread to other factions of the Republican Party on Wednesday, McCarthy told reporters Wednesday evening, adding that he wasn't concerned about threats to his gavel.\n\nIf House Republicans were to oust the speaker - a big \"if\" at this point - it's unclear who could take up the gavel. Any replacement would have a tough task finding consensus within the divided party, Cargile says.\n\nA search for a new party leader could also distract from what is already shaping up to be a contentious 2024 presidential election, she adds.\n\nSponsor Message\n\nBecome an NPR sponsor"

      "text": "The Biden Interview: The President Talks About the Supreme Court, Threats to Democracy and Trump's Vow to Exact Retribution\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nPresident Joe Biden said Friday that he was not fully confident that the current U.S. Supreme Court, which he described as extreme, could be relied on to uphold the rule of law.\n\nWhen asked the question directly, Biden paused for a few seconds. Then he sighed and said, \"I worry.\"\n\n\"Because,\" he said, \"I know that if the other team, the MAGA Republicans, win, they don't want to uphold the rule of law.\"\n\nBut he said, \"I do think at the end of the day, this court, which has been one of the most extreme courts, I still think in the basic fundamentals of rule of law, that they would sustain the rule of law.\"\n\nStill, Biden said the court itself should recognize it needs ethics rules after stories by ProPublica revealed that billionaires had given undisclosed gifts to Supreme Court justices and that Justice Clarence Thomas has made appearances at events for donors to the Koch political network. The code of conduct that applies to other federal judges doesn't apply to the Supreme Court. \"The idea that the Constitution would in any way prohibit or not encourage the court to have basic rules of ethics that are just on their face reasonable,\" Biden said, \"is just not the case.\"\n\nThe discussion was part of a rare formal interview on a topic the president has laid out as a priority: How America's democracy is under siege. Seated in the Roosevelt Room of the White House on Friday afternoon, Biden seemed relaxed and confident, batting back a question about why he thinks he's the only Democrat who can protect democracy next year, especially given voter concerns with his age: \"I'm not the only Democrat that can protect it. I just happen to be the Democrat who I think is best positioned to see to it that the guy I was worried about taking on democracy is not president.\"\n\nBiden cast the threat to democracy posed by Donald Trump's 2024 candidacy as a resistance movement animated by fear of change. \"I think Trump has concluded that he has to win,\" Biden said, noting the rising vitriol in the embattled former president's rhetoric. \"And they'll pull out all the stops.\"\n\nBiden linked the attempt by House Republicans to bring Washington to \"a screeching halt\" through a government shutdown to Trump's effort to regain the presidency. He warned against the desire of \"MAGA Republicans\" - which he called a minority of the GOP, much less the nation as a whole - to weaken institutions such as the federal civil service to shift power over the U.S. government toward the president alone. Trump has promised his supporters to \"be your retribution\" in a second term.\n\nThe drama over a government shutdown resulted from the \"terrible bargain\" Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy made with extremist colleagues to secure his job, Biden said. \"He's willing to do things that he, I think, he knows are inconsistent with constitutional processes.\" He added: \"There is a group of MAGA Republicans who genuinely want to have a fundamental change in the way that the system works. And that's what worries me the most.\"\n\nBiden faulted his Democratic Party for failing at some points to respond effectively to one of the wellsprings of the anti-democratic threat: the anxieties of Americans, most conspicuously blue-collar white men, unsettled by economic, cultural and demographic change.\n\nWhat's needed isn't so much economic benefits as \"treating them with respect,\" said Biden, who has emphasized his middle-class Scranton, Pennsylvania, upbringing throughout his political career. \"The fact is, we're going to be very shortly a minority-white-European country. Sometimes my colleagues don't speak enough to make it clear that that is not going to change how we operate.\"\n\nBiden expressed confidence that the majority of the Republican Party and the nation itself would ultimately safeguard the American experiment. But he exhorted them to \"speak up\" in opposition to the increasingly menacing rhetoric Trump has deployed in response to his legal peril.\n\n\"[Do] not legitimize it,\" he said. He added, in what seemed a reference to the vitriol aimed at jurors and potential jurors in trials for the Jan. 6 insurrection and Trump-related cases, \"I never thought I'd see a time when someone was worried about being on a jury because there may be physical violence against them if they voted the wrong way.\"\n\nHe encouraged Americans concerned about democracy to be \"engaging\" more with family, friends and acquaintances who have embraced extremism. Even more urgent, he added, is voting in next year's presidential election. \"Get in a two-way conversation,\" he said. \"I really do believe that the vast majority of the American people are decent, honorable, straightforward. ... We have to, though, understand what the danger is if they don't participate.\"\n\nRead More\n\nProPublica also asked Biden whether his former Senate colleague Joe Lieberman is upholding democracy by working with an organization called No Labels to pursue a potential third-party candidacy. \"Well, he has a democratic right to do it. There's no reason not to do that. Now, it's going to help the other guy. And he knows [that]. ... That's a political decision he's making that I obviously think is a mistake. But he has a right to do that.\"\n\nBiden was asked whether Fox News and other outlets that spread falsehoods about the 2020 election drive the threat that he's concerned about or simply reflect sentiment that already exists. Both, Biden said: \"Look, there are no editors any more. That's one of the big problems.\" Without providing detail, he suggested that reporters on outlets such as Fox are just doing what they're told.\n\nIn response to a question about whether the decision by Elon Musk, the billionaire owner of X (formerly Twitter), to lower guardrails against misinformation contributes to the problem, Biden said, \"Yeah, it does.\" Biden noted that the invention of the printing press had effects that are still felt today. He suggested something similar was happening with the internet. \"Where do people get their news?\" he continued. \"They go on the internet. They go online ... and you have no notion whether it's true or not.\"\n\nFiled under -\n\nDuring Donald Trump's second presidency, ProPublica will focus on the areas most in need of scrutiny.

In fact, the donor bases for Ryan and McCarthy are actually more similar to some Democrats than to their colleagues in the main conservative grouping, the Freedom Caucus.\n\nThe fundraising disparity stokes the divisive atmosphere in Congress, reinforcing policy differences and sometimes affecting the outcome of legislation in surprising ways.\n\nFor example, when a Republican-backed plan to ease a campaign finance rule evaporated in Congress, it was the most conservative GOP lawmakers in the House who joined with liberal Democrats to get it killed.\n\nThe provision, which died in December , was initiated by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and was included in a must-pass spending bill. It would have eliminated caps on the money a national party committee can spend in coordination with a candidate.\n\nThe caps were originally meant to reduce the amount of outside cash flowing directly to advocacy for a particular candidate. Those in favor of lifting the restrictions say they are outmoded in the increasingly wild world of campaign finance and effectively give less-accountable outside groups like super PACs more influence than traditional parties.\n\nMany Democrats argued that eliminating the caps would have opened the spigot to even more big money in politics. For conservatives, the reason to oppose the McConnell plan was different: It might have helped Republican leaders quash internal dissenters.\n\nWith a bigger campaign war chest raised from donors who support mainstream Republicans, the party would find it easier to select and back its favored House candidates. \"The McConnell rider provides preferential treatment to the Washington establishment,\" the Conservative Action Project, a group led by former Attorney General Edwin Meese, wrote in appealing to like-minded lawmakers to fight the measure.\n\nThe differences in donor bases affect other policy debates, said Dave Brat of Virginia, a Freedom Caucus member who defeated then-Majority Leader Eric Cantor in the 2014 primary and went on to take his seat. For instance, he said, conservatives lost their fight to defund the U.S. Export-Import Bank last year in part because the companies that benefit from the bank won over Republicans and Democrats who received campaign contributions from those firms.\n\nThe disparity is \"a huge deal,\" Brat said.\n\nProPublica's analysis used a calculation called cosine similarity to compare each House members' donors to others; two members with an identical set of donors would receive a score of 1, while two with no PAC donors in common would get a score of 0.\n\nThe degree of similarity between Ryan's 2014 PAC donors and those of Freedom Caucus members Justin Amash of Michigan and Ted Yoho of Florida was close to nil: 0.03 and 0.16. Tim Huelskamp, a Kansas Republican who lost his seat on the House Agriculture Committee in 2012 for his votes against leadership, had few PAC donors in common with Ryan (a score of 0.15) or any other House colleague in 2014: his highest score was 0.3, with fellow Kansan Mike Pompeo.\n\nPAC donors to House Majority Leader McCarthy, of California, were more like Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer's (0.53 score) than they were those of Ohio Republican Jim Jordan, who heads the Freedom Caucus (0.31).\n\nThe gap between the leadership and insurgents has widened since 2008. That year, McCarthy's PAC donors were more similar to those of Michele Bachmann, the former Minnesota congresswoman who founded the House's Tea Party caucus, than they were to PACs that gave to then-Majority Leader Cantor or then-Speaker John Boehner. By the end of 2014, the gulf between McCarthy and the conservatives was much wider: all House GOP leaders, and even 11House Democrats, had PAC donors more similar to McCarthy's than any member of the Freedom Caucus.\n\nCosine similarity scores for PAC donations made to members of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 2014 election cycle. A score of one would mean an identical set of donors, and a score of zero would mean no overlap between donors.\n\nSource: ProPublica analysis of Federal Election Commission data. Credit: Sisi Wei and Derek Willis.\n\nThe donors that typically back House leaders are large corporate PACs with broad interests before Congress. They include the Automotive Free Trade International PAC , which represents American dealers of foreign car manufacturers. The PAC gives hundreds of thousands of dollars to Republican candidates, of which just $11,500 went to three dozen Freedom Caucus members during the 2014 cycle. On the other hand, none of the leaders received contributions from the Citizens United Political Victory Fund , which is one of the top overall donors to Freedom Caucus members.\n\nThe two factions do have some PAC donors in common, such as the Koch Industries PAC, which gave $201,500 to 36 members of the House Freedom Caucus identified by the Pew Research Center during the last election. The KochPAC gave more than $1.4 million to Republican House candidates, including its leaders.\n\nBut even in cases where the same PAC backs both camps, the amounts are often lopsided, with less money going to Freedom Caucus members, many of whom are relatively junior lawmakers. The Home Depot PAC , for example, gave the maximum $10,000 to scores of lawmakers' campaigns in 2014 ; only one of them, Barry Loudermilk of Georgia, where Home Depot has its headquarters, is a Freedom Caucus member. Other members of the Freedom Caucus received donations from the PAC, but not for the maximum amount.\n\nStephen Holmes, a spokesman for Home Depot, said many factors go into the company's PAC giving, but caucus membership wasn't one of them.\n\nThe failure of McConnell's plan to lift the caps on party spending shows how the source of lawmakers' contributions influences their votes. Republicans generally have voted in favor of looser rules on raising and spending campaign money, especially since the passage of the 2002 McCain-Feingold law that banned national parties from collecting unlimited contributions. Rick Hasen, a University of California-Irvine law professor who studies campaign finance and elections, said it's notable that the Freedom Caucus pushed to preserve the party restrictions.\n\n\"Sometimes,\" Hasen said, \"self-interest can trump ideology.\"\n\nDerek Willis\n\nDerek Willis was a news applications developer at ProPublica, focusing on politics and elections.\n\nGet our investigations delivered to your inbox with the Big Story newsletter.\n\nCreative Commons License (CC BY-NC-ND 3.0)\n\nThank you for your interest in republishing this story.

      "text": "After a Decade of Tracking Politicians' Deleted Tweets, Politwoops Is No More\n\nInvestigative Journalism in the Public Interest\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nPoliticians haven't stopped deleting some of their most cringeworthy tweets, but Politwoops , our project that has tracked and archived more than half a million deleted tweets from candidates and elected officials since 2012, is no longer able to track them.\n\nSince Elon Musk took over Twitter, the platform has disabled the function we used to track deletions - and the new method that Twitter says should identify them appears to be broken. We have been unable to find anyone who can help us, and with Twitter surprising developers by announcing a move to a paid model for gathering tweet data , it's no longer clear that Twitter is a stable platform on which to maintain this work. It seems fitting to give Politwoops a sendoff, a farewell to not exactly a friend but an odd part of our national political discourse for a decade.\n\nOriginally built by the Sunlight Foundation, Politwoops always had a tenuous existence. Born in 2012, it received its first eulogy just three years later after Twitter pulled the plug, only to come back just in time for the 2016 presidential election. (Now-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy welcomed it back, then deleted that tweet .) When Sunlight closed up shop, ProPublica took over the app , which is when I started to maintain it.\n\nPolitwoops was built on the idea that what elected officials and candidates said on Twitter mattered, at least a little. Like most users of Twitter, politicians usually tweet pretty mundane stuff: celebrations of victories mixed with jeers for opponents, some local flavor and attempts to jump into trending conversations. Most of the deletions are for mistakes any Twitter user could make: typos, forgotten or incorrect images, bad URLs. The occasional seems-like-a-toddler-grabbed-the-phone posts . Truly forgettable stuff.\n\nBut for those politicians who really embraced Twitter as a place where they could be themselves, the deletions sometimes spoke volumes. Some deleted posts are hard to forget, like one from then-President Donald Trump in the early evening of Jan. 6, 2021, not long after a mob invaded the U.S. Capitol and assaulted police officers in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying Joe Biden's victory in the 2020 presidential election:\n\nTrump had perhaps the most-watched Twitter account during my time running Politwoops. While he was in office, Trump's tweets got a ton of attention, but they seldom were a departure from other things he said in public. I would often get emails from reporters asking whether he had, in fact, deleted some alleged tweet they had seen, and mostly he had not; other accounts would post images of fake tweets that never appeared on his timeline. Politwoops became an integral resource for checking whether viral ( and often poorly photoshopped ) tweets were fake.\n\nAll the while, other politicians were posting - and deleting - interesting, newsworthy and bizarre things on the platform. Running Politwoops for the past six years has, strangely enough, made many elected officials seem more human to me. They, and not Trump, are what I'll remember most about the site.\n\nSometimes deleted messages appear to be offhand remarks that politicians have instantly thought better of: When political scientist Larry Sabato wrote, \"You have to admit, Biden is on fire,\" referring to then-Vice President Joe Biden's debate performance against Republican Paul Ryan in October 2012, Texas Republican Sen. John Cornyn retweeted it. And then deleted it 11 seconds later .\n\nOther examples of this genre include Kentucky Republican Rep. Thomas Massie's deletion of this somewhat cryptic tweet about men and war a minute after posting it, while New York Democratic congressional candidate Nate McMurray did the same for this hot take about The Buffalo News in October 2020.\n\nIn other cases, it was harder to tell why a tweet was deleted. Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, famous for his use of abbreviations and sparsely worded posts , is a known booster of the University of Northern Iowa, his alma mater. In November 2021 he posted that UNI was trying to recruit a local volleyball player . Fourteen hours later, he deleted the tweet . That athlete did, in fact, sign with UNI a year later .\n\nAs Twitter grew in popularity among politicians, its use became more professional, with staffers posting news and pictures. That led to some interesting conversations as staffers who had access to multiple accounts, including their own personal ones, sometimes clicked the wrong button. I've gotten more than one email or phone call asking if a tweet posted by mistake to the wrong account and then deleted could be removed entirely from Politiwoops. (Answer: We don't do that.)\n\nIn December 2020, I got an email from someone who worked on the campaign of then-Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney, D-N.Y. The congressman had posted and deleted a tweet that showed up on Politwoops, and would we consider removing it? It's very rare that we would do that - that's the whole point of the site - but when I brought up the deleted tweet I saw why he was asking: Maloney had mistakenly sent a public tweet that should have been a direct message, because it included his personal cell phone number. After some conversation, we decided to redact the number.\n\nAfter the 2016 election, when Twitter became an important part of fundraising for political campaigns, I started to notice a very strange pattern: some accounts, especially long-shot candidates running against high-profile incumbents, dramatically increased the number of their deletions. A good example of this was Kim Mangone, a California Democrat then running against McCarthy for a House seat. Mangone's deletions consist mostly of her own retweets , which seems like a weird thing to do until you discover that Twitter prevents users from reposting identical tweets or retweets over and over in a short time span. The only way around that restriction is to delete the earlier post and then repost it.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting political deleter is Sen. Brian Schatz, a Hawaii Democrat active on the platform. Like many of his colleagues, Schatz deleted typos and some retweets of others' posts. But he often posted an informal message - almost always without a link or mentioning other accounts - that gave you a glimpse into his actual thinking. Here's an example where Schatz could have tagged some of the pundits he was criticizing, but didn't . And another one in that vein . Or this one with early COVID advice on mask-wearing . Sometimes he'd even acknowledge the deletions , or provide an explanation for doing it . Most politicians do not do this.\n\nOther senators are famous for their folksier tweets - Grassley excels at this - and there are some lawmakers who can be equally blunt on the platform. But I'd like to believe that I learned something about how Schatz thinks that would be hard for me to know otherwise, given that we've never met.\n\nRead More\n\nThat's one of the things I'll miss most about running Politwoops: getting a glimpse behind the carefully crafted images that politicians present to the public.

      "text": "The Government Gave Free PPP Money to Public Companies Despite Warning Them Not to Apply\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nAs Congress launched a historic bailout to keep businesses afloat at the outset of the pandemic, government officials stressed that the loans were for mom-and-pop operations that didn't have another easily available lifeline.\n\n\"This was a program designed for small businesses,\" then-Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said , as companies like Shake Shack and Potbelly made headlines for grabbing millions from the newly created Paycheck Protection Program. \"It was not a program that was designed for public companies that had liquidity.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy was even clearer. \"We will go after those big companies that cheat the system,\" he told Fox News that spring.\n\nBut the tough talk hasn't translated into action. Instead, a ProPublica review has found, the government gave out generous loans to companies that may not have needed them. And it has often forgiven the loans, despite having said that publicly traded companies would be unlikely to merit such generous treatment.\n\nTake Lazydays Holdings, a publicly traded collection of RV dealerships that got a nearly $9 million loan. The company had $31 million in cash on hand at the end of 2019, and then prospered as Americans turned to RVs for socially distanced vacations. Lazydays' stock price has shot up more than 500 % during the pandemic. (Lazydays did not respond to requests for comment.) The government has forgiven nearly all of it, allowing Lazydays to keep the money.\n\nThe ProPublica analysis of Securities and Exchange Commission filings found at least 120 publicly traded companies that received loans of more than $500,000, grew their revenues last year and have been allowed to keep the money.\n\nIn addition, at least 30 companies announced plans to go public after receiving their loans, bringing in truckloads of investor cash that they often used to pay off other debts - but not the ones they owed to the federal government, all of which were forgiven.\n\nOverall, ProPublica found at least $250 million that went to publicly traded companies with growing revenues and that has already been forgiven by the government. That's just a sliver of the $800 billion PPP program. But it's also almost certainly a significant undercount of the amount of taxpayer dollars that went to well-heeled companies. The count, for instance, doesn't include any of the b illions of dollars that went to firms backed by giant private equity funds. Their finances are not publicly disclosed.\n\nThe government had no rules requiring companies to pay back loans if it turned out they didn't need the money.\n\nInstead, the government had one modest requirement particularly relevant to publicly traded companies: It made all applicants for loans attest that pandemic-related uncertainty made the loan \"necessary.\" And it warned in a follow-up advisory that having access to cash elsewhere - as public companies usually do via investors - would make it difficult to take that pledge in good faith.\n\nBut the government has rarely followed up. The Small Business Administration, which oversees the PPP, discarded a questionnaire it had begun sending companies to quiz them on their financial situations.\n\nIn response to questions from ProPublica, the SBA said that it is examining all forgiveness applications to make sure they comply with the rules. \"We are continuously aware of our role in the stewardship of federal funds to ensure the integrity of our programs, and we have rigorous processes in place to ensure appropriate oversight of loans of all sizes,\" spokesperson Christalyn Solomon said.\n\nBut the SBA declined to provide evidence of how it is evaluating whether public applicants were honest when they said their loans were \"necessary.\" Experts say that's because lawmakers offered no specifics on what they meant by \"necessary\" from the outset, leaving the program's administrators with no objective basis on which to demand repayment.\n\n\"Congress needed to say to the SBA, 'This is what constitutes need,'\" said Liz Hempowicz, director of public policy at the nonprofit Project on Government Oversight. \"If you have access to excess capital in any form, that absolutely should've been baked into the program from the beginning.\"\n\nBy many metrics, the federal government's response to the pandemic succeeded in alleviating the worst effects of the most abrupt pause in economic activity America has ever experienced. Unlike most safety net programs, it did so by erring on the side of generosity. The government's supplemental unemployment insurance and stimulus checks were enough to actually lower poverty last year.\n\nThe same philosophy applied to relief for businesses. The government kept the PPP application simple to encourage companies to participate, and banks were paid to move the loans along without asking many questions. While the program was built on the chassis of the SBA's standard loan program, it dispensed with many of its rules, such as a requirement that applicants demonstrate they couldn't obtain reasonably priced credit elsewhere.\n\nIn the first round of the bailout, which was quickly depleted, companies did not have to prove that they had actually been impacted by COVID-19.\n\nInstead, the application required them to certify that \"current economic uncertainty makes this loan request necessary to support the ongoing operations of the applicant.\" Facing confusion from corporate lawyers who said the language was vague, the SBA released further guidance in late April 2020.\n\nThe clarification specifically warned public companies that they probably wouldn't meet the threshold. \"Borrowers must make this certification in good faith, taking into account their current business activity and their ability to access other sources of liquidity,\" the agency wrote . \"It is unlikely that a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets will be able to make the required certification in good faith.\"\n\nThat admonition had some effect. According to a study forthcoming in the Review of Corporate Finance Studies, half of all public companies qualified for the loans, but only 42% of those eligible chose to take them. That compared to 87% of all eligible private companies. (The PPP generally excluded companies with more than 500 employees.) On average, the 812 public firms that took loans had less cash and more debt than those that didn't borrow. The public companies collectively borrowed $2.2 billion, but 13.5% of them repaid their loans, mostly soon after the SBA's April guidance.\n\nBut because Congress didn't impose any actual requirements to return the money, many companies didn't. Some even shrugged off congressional pressure to do so.\n\nIn May 2020, a House oversight subcommittee sent letters asking five large public companies to return their $10 million loans. One of them did . The other four refused, and they eventually all received forgiveness (with one asking for slightly less than the whole amount).\n\nThey included a contractor for the U.S. Postal Service called EVO Transportation and Energy Services, which hasn't filed financial reports for all of 2020 after discovering problems with its 2019 disclosures.\n\nThe company didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe SBA began processing forgiveness applications after the first round of PPP loans was exhausted in August 2020. It decided that all borrowers of less than $2 million would automatically be \"deemed\" truthful in their pledges that their loans were necessary.\n\nFor those who borrowed more, it issued a nine-page \" loan necessity questionnaire \" that asked about the recipient's ownership structure, cash on hand pre-pandemic, revenues during the time when the loan was supposed to be used and access to other capital.\n\nThat didn't go over well.\n\nLast December, a construction industry trade group sued , saying the SBA questionnaire violated the original guidance that implied forgiveness would be determined by what companies knew at the time they applied, without regard to what happened later. In July, the agency stopped using the questionnaire, saying that the form was burdensome for borrowers and a drain on auditing resources.\n\nWithout companies' answers, the SBA has developed a machine-learning algorithm that flags loans for signs of potential fraud, such as payroll numbers that don't add up. As of last month, agency data showed, investigators had reviewed 65,000 loans, 8,000 of which, totaling $2.7 billion, were referred for further analysis. Of those, only 300 loans were for more than $2 million.\n\nThe agency declined to say how many forgiveness applications have been rejected after going through this process, or how, without using the discontinued questionnaire, it has evaluated whether the loans were necessary.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission also issued inquiries to some companies about their representations to investors, but a spokesperson declined to say whether any enforcement actions had been taken as a result.\n\nA former finance manager at one company that received millions in PPP money and hasn't paid it back said that he'd hoped the government would more closely examine his employer's finances.\n\n\"I remember that questionnaire coming out, and we were thinking, 'This might not get forgiven,' because our cash position was a lot better at the end of the year,\" the employee said. Since the questionnaire has been thrown out, he figures, companies that didn't need the cash will end up keeping it. \"The only reason to give it back is public sentiment. At that point, it's free money.\"\n\nWaste is inevitable in any economic rescue mission. But some of it is avoidable. Experts say Congress could have created a threshold of financial health at which PPP loans would have to be repaid - without denying the lifeline many firms needed.\n\n\"We're talking about a ridiculously low interest rate,\" Hempowicz said. \"There is a benefit either way, especially for bigger companies, to have received these loans, even if they aren't then converted into grants.\"\n\nAll PPP loans were forgivable if the cash was mostly spent on payroll. If a company was still seeing steady business, it could use that freed-up income for other priorities, like paying off debt and buying other companies.\n\nThat's the happy outcome for many companies that performed well in 2020, often profiting from the very pandemic that they said put them in the position of needing a taxpayer bailout.\n\nA chain of powersports dealers called RideNow collectively received $19 million, despite nearly tripling its net income from 2019 to 2020 as interest in motorbikes and all-terrain vehicles skyrocketed. In March 2021, the publicly traded online motorcycle sales platform RumbleOn announced it would acquire RideNow to create what it called the \"only omnichannel customer experience in powersports and the largest publicly traded powersports dealership platform.\" RideNow's loans were fully forgiven in June, and RumbleOn's forgiveness application for its original $5.1 million loan is pending.\n\nOther examples abound. Acme United Corporation saw its sales increase 15% in 2020 because of strong demand for first-aid supplies. Its $3.5 million loan was fully forgiven . So was the $2.7 million borrowed by Conifer Holdings, an insurance company that attributed revenue growth to lower claims by businesses that were temporarily  shuttered but maintained their policies - which explicitly did not cover business interruption due to infectious diseases. And the ammunition manufacturer Ammo Inc. kept $1 million after seeing its revenues triple to $62.5 million in 2020, fueled by increased consumer demand for bullets. None of those companies returned requests for comment.\n\nPublic companies aren't the only borrowers that took more than they likely needed. Securities and Exchange Commission filings are also a window into privately held companies that have raised money in the public markets or later listed themselves on an exchange.\n\nThe venture-capital-backed person-to-person lending marketplace Prosper files earnings statements because it sells its loans to investors. The company had $64 million in unrestricted cash on hand at the end of 2019, but it still suspended its 401(k) match and cut salaries above $100,000 across the board in early 2020 - a collective reduction in compensation almost equal to the $8.4 million PPP loan it received. The pay cut also applied to the C-suite, but they had already received up to 10% base salary bumps in March 2020, so it hurt less.\n\nIn November, the company instituted a retroactive two-year bonus plan for executives - potentially totaling $3 million for five people.\n\nProsper did not respond to a request for comment, and its forgiveness request is still pending.\n\nSome companies did pay the money back. At least 27 companies decided to do so while in the process of going public, since the sale of stock often generates large amounts of cash.\n\nLuminar Technologies, an autonomous driving technology startup, gave back its $7.8 million before its Nasdaq debut.\n\n\"We decided to return the PPP loan as soon as we realized we didn't need it anymore,\" said Anthony Cooke, Luminar's vice president for policy and regulation. \"We decided to apply for a PPP loan because it gave us the flexibility to withstand uncertain times while protecting our employees. We were able to protect employees, grow our business and take it public in 2020, and we repaid our PPP loan as soon as it was feasible.\"\n\nOther companies kept the taxpayer money, even while paying off other debts.\n\nThat's what another company in the autonomous driving business did. A Ford-backed designer of sensors called Velodyne Lidar got $10 million in government money, which a spokesperson said was \"used to support our employees during a time of uncertainty.\"\n\nThe company went public in September of last year, giving it $222 million in cash. The government forgave Velodyne's loan this June.\n\nBattery-powered bus maker Proterra got $10 million. Its revenues increased last year , and it went public this year. The company decided to keep the money, which spokesperson Shane Levy said \"supported our ability to maintain a full workforce as we've navigated the uncertainty caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.\" A Volkswagen- and UPS-backed self-driving truck company called TuSimple kept its $4.1 million after going public in a deal that generated about $1 billion; a spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nSeveral companies hadn't yet had any income at all - they had been funded by investors through their entire existence, suggesting that they probably had access to other credit.\n\nA pre-revenue electric vehicle maker called Faraday Future got $9.2 million. This past July, it launched a public offering that generated $1 billion; its loan forgiveness request is still pending. A spokesperson told ProPublica that the investor proceeds will be \"budgeted to produce vehicles,\" not to pay back taxpayers. Space launch services company Astra took $4.9 million in government money. As it applied for forgiveness in June, it told investors that COVID-19 \"has not materially affected our future growth outlook\" and that it had seen \"some signs of positive effects for its long-term business prospects and partnerships as a result of the pandemic.\" Astra's Nasdaq debut in July generated $463 million, and its PPP loan was forgiven last month. A spokesperson didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nAnother category of large PPP recipients consisted of clinical and early commercial-stage medical device and pharmaceutical companies, which are heavily investor-backed and which sometimes profited from COVID-related activity. A biotech company called PolarityTE, which makes regenerative tissue products, cut staff by 47% in 2020 and raised revenues by 79% by serving as a COVID-19 testing lab. It received $3.6 million, which was forgiven; the company didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nAnything having to do with residential real estate also did well.\n\nFast-growing homebuilder Dream Finders Homes saw 52% earnings growth in 2020, which it attributed in part to pandemic-induced migration to suburban developments. It went public in January 2021, generating $134 million, and was granted full forgiveness on its $7.2 million loan. The company didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe home improvement services platform Porch told investors that spiking home sales in late 2020 helped it rebound from a spring business dip. It applied for forgiveness for its $8.1 million PPP loan in December, the same month it debuted on Nasdaq. With $122 million of the proceeds from its IPO, it bought four other companies; it hasn't paid back the PPP loan, which was forgiven in June . A spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nFinally, the type of companies that arranged the capital for all these public offerings and funding rounds - investment advisory firms - also dipped into the PPP.\n\nCohen & Company, a financial services firm with $2.8 billion under management, got $2.2 million. The firm saw dramatically higher income last year. Nearly all of its loan was forgiven. Another asset manager and investment banking firm, JMP Group, had $3.8 million forgiven despite having $50 million in cash at the end of 2019 and 15% revenue growth in 2020. Neither firm responded to a request for comment.\n\nSome investment advisory firms may have used inflated claims. One study found that at least 6% of the $590 million granted to those firms was more than they could have justified given their payroll, which has to be reported to the SEC.\n\nWriting laws is often a balancing act. One approach draws bright lines that lay out exactly what's required, which companies often figure out a way to game. The other leaves rules more vague, relying on the regulated party to abide by the program's intent. That eases the process for beneficiaries who really need help, but runs the risk the others will also benefit.\n\nThe PPP leaned toward the latter approach. It told companies that they probably shouldn't apply if they had other resources at their disposal, but gave them a window to do so if they wanted. In order to make that work, there would need to be a credible threat of enforcement, or at least public shaming if they took advantage of funds meant for the truly disadvantaged.\n\nErik Gordon, a professor at the University of Michigan's Ross School of Business, said the SBA should have held public companies to a higher standard of need and then audited them to ensure they'd been truthful.\n\n\"If I ran the SBA, I would say, 'You certified that this loan request was necessary - walk us through that. You had this much cash, or you had this much loan facility open or you had no trouble raising this money,'\" Gordon said.\n\nRead More\n\nOf course, if you don't want public companies to apply, you could just bar them from applying. That's what Congress did when it created a second round of the PPP in December 2020. That time around, companies were also required to demonstrate that their revenues had declined substantially in at least one quarter in order to qualify.\n\nSam Rosen, a finance professor at Temple University who co-authored the study on public firm participation in the PPP, said it isn't that complicated. \"If we were in a similar situation in the future, do we want public firms to have access to this?\" he said. \"I think it's just about being clear up front.\"\n\nDid Your Company Get Bailout Money?

      "text": "Welfare Is No Substitute for a Child Tax Credit\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches , a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week.\n\nThis story was co-published with The Washington Post.\n\nThose in Congress who are blocking President Biden's proposed child tax credit - a monthly federal stipend for families with children of up to $300 per child - have been making a curious claim of late. They've been saying that there is already a highly effective cash assistance program for low-income parents and kids: Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF.\n\nIf the child tax credit were to be provided to these families going forward, \"all the requirements that apply to those receiving TANF ... would be gone,\" said Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, in October.\n\nDoing so would \"shatter a decades-old consensus\" that TANF has successfully transitioned people from welfare to work, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., added in December.\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, and key Democratic swing vote Sen. Joe Manchin, W.Va., among others on the Hill, have recently echoed these sentiments.\n\nHere's the problem: They are simply wrong about the success of TANF. It is a program distinguished by failure.\n\nLast year marked the 25th anniversary of the Clinton-era welfare reform law that created TANF, which inspired me and my colleagues at ProPublica to investigate the current state of cash assistance in this country. Our reporting found that the requirements of TANF, which McConnell, Manchin and the others praised, are more often just plain cruel.\n\nIn New Mexico and many other states, for instance, low-income single mothers applying for TANF are forced, in a relic of colonial \"bastardy\" laws, to first identify the father of their child (and his eye color, license plate number and parents' addresses), and also to recall under penalty of perjury the exact date when they got pregnant, before they can get a small amount of cash assistance for things like rent, child care and diapers. Many are also made to submit their children to genetic testing.\n\nWhen a state has all of this information, it can then go after the dads for child support - much of which the government pockets. (ProPublica found that in 2020, nationally, more than $1.7 billion in child support from fathers meant to go to their kids was instead diverted into government coffers, as part of TANF's design.)\n\nSome states go even further out of their way to avoid spending TANF dollars to help struggling moms, dads and kids. In Arizona , only 6% of families below the poverty line are able to obtain assistance from the program, partly because the state uses more than $150 million a year of its TANF funding to instead pay for child welfare investigations of many of the very same poor parents, as well as the foster care costs of removing their children from them. (More than 60% of Black children in Maricopa County - metro Phoenix - will see their parents investigated by the time they turn 18, according to a recent academic study .)\n\nAnd across the nation, $5.2 billion in TANF funding that is supposed to be helping provide direct assistance to low-income families is instead sitting entirely unused in states' bank accounts, with the amount actually increasing during the pandemic even as need soared.\n\nThe sheer difficulty of accessing these dollars often leaves applicants casting about for other options. In Utah , for example, so few families seeking TANF are approved or eligible for the aid that many parents I've spoken to in my reporting say they feel they have to seek help from the LDS Church instead. There, they are sometimes pressured to get baptized, work for the church or read aloud from the Book of Mormon in order to receive assistance.\n\nBut if spending less on helping those in need is actually the point of welfare law, then opponents of the child tax credit in Congress are right to say that TANF works well enough already.\n\nIn fact, spending less on parents and children was built into the original structure of TANF. The program's funding was frozen in 1996 - and has not been increased since to account for inflation or population shifts. That means less and less is available per poor family with every passing year, especially in the rapidly diversifying desert Southwest where I live.\n\nTake Nevada , which since the '90s has changed demographically more than any other state, due both to immigration and to an influx of tech companies and other young newcomers. Between 1997 and 2015, as the state's increasing population caused its cost of living to skyrocket, the number of kids living in poverty there more than doubled, from 67,852 to 143,407. The result: Nevada now gets the smallest population-adjusted amount of TANF funding in the nation, at only $63 a year per child. By comparison, neighboring California receives $409.\n\nRead More\n\nThis is the program that America's families will be left with if Congress does not pass the child tax credit this year.\n\nRuby Duncan, who led marches of poor working mothers down the Las Vegas Strip and into its casinos at the height of the city's Rat Pack glory days, a half-century ago, and who remains a leading advocate for families in the Southwest, put it best.

      "text": "A Year of Empty Threats and a \"Smokescreen\" Policy: How the State Department Let Israel Get Away With Horrors in Gaza\n\nProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they're published.\n\nThese highlights were written by the reporters and editors who worked on this story.\n\nIn early November, a small group of senior U.S. human rights diplomats met with a top official in President Joe Biden's State Department to make one final, emphatic plea: We must keep our word.\n\nWeeks before, Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the administration delivered their most explicit ultimatum yet to Israel, demanding the Israel Defense Forces allow hundreds more trucksloads of food and medicine into Gaza every day - or else. American law and Biden's own policies prohibit arms sales to countries that restrict humanitarian aid. Israel had 30 days to comply.\n\nIn the month that followed, the IDF was accused of roundly defying the U.S., its most important ally. The Israeli military tightened its grip, continued to restrict desperately needed aid trucks and displaced 100,000 Palestinians from North Gaza, humanitarian groups found , exacerbating what was already a dire crisis \"to its worst point since the war began.\"\n\nSeveral attendees at the November meeting - officials who help lead the State Department's efforts to promote racial equity, religious freedom and other high-minded principles of democracy - said the United States' international credibility had been severely damaged by Biden's unstinting support of Israel. If there was ever a time to hold Israel accountable, one ambassador at the meeting told Tom Sullivan, the State Department's counselor and a senior policy adviser to Blinken, it was now.\n\nBut the decision had already been made. Sullivan said the deadline would likely pass without action and Biden would continue sending shipments of bombs uninterrupted, according to two people who were in the meeting.\n\nThose in the room deflated. \"Don't our law, policy and morals demand it?\" an attendee told me later, reflecting on the decision to once again capitulate. \"What is the rationale of this approach? There is no explanation they can articulate.\"\n\nSoon after, when the 30-day deadline was up, Blinken made it official and said that Israelis had begun implementing most of the steps he had laid out in his letter - all thanks to the pressure the U.S. had applied.\n\nThat choice was immediately called into question. On Nov. 14, a U.N. committee said that Israel's methods in Gaza, including its use of starvation as a weapon, was \"consistent with genocide.\" Amnesty International went further and concluded a genocide was underway . The International Criminal Court also issued arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister for the war crime of deliberately starving civilians, among other allegations. (The U.S. and Israeli governments have rejected the genocide determination as well as the warrants.)\n\nThe October red line was the last one Biden laid down, but it wasn't the first. His administration issued multiple threats, warnings and admonishments to Israel about its conduct after Oct. 7, 2023, when the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel, killed some 1,200 people and took more than 250 hostages.\n\nGovernment officials worry Biden's record of empty threats have given the Israelis a sense of impunity.\n\nTrump, who has made a raft of pro-Israel nominations, made it clear he wanted the war in Gaza to end before he took office and threatened that \"all hell will break out\" if Hamas did not release its hostages by then.\n\nOn Wednesday, after months of negotiations, Israel and Hamas reached a ceasefire deal. While it will become clear over the next days and months exactly what the contours of the agreement are, why it happened now and who deserves the most credit, it's plausible that Trump's imminent ascension to the White House was its own form of a red line. Early reports suggest the deal looks similar to what has been on the table for months, raising the possibility that if the Biden administration had followed through on its tough words, a deal could have been reached earlier, saving lives.\n\n\"Netanyahu's conclusion was that Biden doesn't have enough oomph to make him pay a price, so he was willing to ignore him,\" said Ghaith al-Omari, a senior fellow at The Washington Institute who's focused on U.S.-Israel relations and a former official with the Palestinian Authority who helped advise on prior peace talks. \"Part of it is that Netanyahu learned there is no cost to saying 'no' to the current president.\"\n\nSo-called red lines have long been a prominent foreign policy tool for the world's most powerful nations. They are communicated publicly in pronouncements by senior officials and privately by emissaries. They amount to rules of the road for friends and adversaries - you can go this far but no further.\n\nThe failure to enforce those lines in recent years has had consequences, current and former U.S. officials said. One frequently cited example arose in 2012 when President Barack Obama told the Syrian government that using chemical weapons against its own people would change his calculus about directly intervening. When Syria's then-President Bashar al-Assad launched rockets with chemical gas and killed hundreds of civilians anyway, Obama backpedaled and ultimately chose not to invade, a move critics say allowed the civil war to spiral further while extremist groups took advantage by recruiting locals.\n\nAuthorities in and outside government said the acquiescence to Israel as it prosecuted a brutal war will likely be regarded as one of the most consequential foreign policy decisions of the Biden presidency. They say it undermines America's ability to influence events in the Middle East while \"destroying the entire edifice of international law that was put into place after WWII,\" as Omer Bartov, a renowned Israeli-American scholar of genocide, put it. Jeffrey Feltman, the former assistant secretary of the State Department's Middle East bureau, told me he fears much of the Muslim world now sees the U.S. as \"ineffective at best or complicit at worst in the large-scale civilian destruction and death.\"\n\nBiden's warnings over the past year have also been explicit. Last spring, the president vowed to stop supplying offensive bombs to Israel if it launched a major invasion into the southern city of Rafah. He also told Netanyahu the U.S. was going to rethink support for the war unless he took new steps to protect civilians and aid workers after the IDF blew up a World Central Kitchen caravan. And Blinken signaled that he would blacklist a notorious IDF unit for the death of a Palestinian-American in the West Bank if the soldiers involved were not brought to justice.\n\nTime and again, Israel crossed the Biden administration's red lines without changing course in a meaningful way, according to interviews with government officials and outside experts. Each time, the U.S. yielded and continued to send Israel's military deadly weapons of war, approving more than $17.9 billion in military assistance since late 2023, by some estimates. The State Department recently told Congress about another $8 billion proposed deal to sell Israel munitions and artillery shells.\n\n\"It's hard to avoid the conclusion that the red lines have all just been a smokescreen,\" said Stephen Walt, a professor of international affairs at Harvard Kennedy School and a preeminent authority on U.S. policy in the region. \"The Biden administration decided to be all in and merely pretended that it was trying to do something about it.\"\n\nIn a recent interview with The New York Times , Blinken disagreed and said Netanyahu has listened to him by softening Israel's most aggressive tactics, including in Rafah. He also argued there was a cost to even questioning the IDF openly. \"Whenever there has been public daylight between the United States and Israel and the perception that pressure was growing on Israel,\" Blinken said, \"Hamas has pulled back from agreeing to a ceasefire and the release of hostages.\"\n\nHe acknowledged that not enough humanitarian assistance has been reaching civilians and said the Israelis initially resisted the idea of allowing any food and medicine into Gaza - which would be a war crime - but Netanyahu relented in response to U.S. pressure behind the scenes. Blinken backtracked later in the interview and suggested that the blocking of aid was not Israeli policy. \"There's a very different question about what was the intent,\" he told the Times.\n\nFor this story, ProPublica spoke with scores of current and former officials throughout the year and read through government memos, cables and emails, many of which have not been reported previously. The records and interviews shed light on why Biden and his top advisers refused to adjust his policy even as new evidence of Israeli abuses emerged.\n\nThroughout the contentious year inside the State Department, senior leaders repeatedly disregarded their own experts. They cracked down on leaks by threatening criminal investigations and classifying material that was critical of Israel. Some of the agency's top Middle East diplomats complained in private that they were sidelined by Biden's National Security Council. The council also distributed a list of banned phrases, including any version of \"State of Palestine\" that didn't have the word \"future\" first.  Two human rights officials said they were prevented from pursuing evidence of abuses in Gaza and the West Bank.\n\nThe State Department did not make Blinken available for an interview, but the agency's top spokesperson, Matthew Miller, said in a statement that Blinken welcomes internal dissent and has incorporated it into his policymaking. \"The Department continues to encourage individuals to make their opinions known through appropriate channels,\" he added. Miller denied that the agency has classified material for any reason other than national security.\n\nOver the past year, reports have documented physical and sexual abuse in Israeli prisons, using Palestinians as human shields and razing residential buildings and hospitals . At one point early in the conflict, UNICEF said more than 10 children required amputations every day on average. Israeli soldiers have videotaped themselves burning food supplies and ransacking homes. One IDF group reportedly said , \"Our job is to flatten Gaza.\"\n\nIsrael's defenders, including those on the National Security Council , acknowledge the devastating human toll but contend that American arms have helped Israel advance western interests in the region and protect itself from other enemies. Indeed, Netanyahu has significantly diminished Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, killing many of the groups' leaders. Then Iran's \"axis of resistance\" received its most consequential blow late last year when rebel groups ousted Assad from Syria.\n\nU.S. Ambassador to Israel Jack Lew told the Times of Israel he worried that a generation of young Americans will harbor anti-Israel sentiments into the future. He said he wished that Israel had done a better job at communicating how carefully it undertook combat decisions and calling attention to its humanitarian successes to counter a narrative in the American press that he considers biased.\n\n\"The media that is presenting a pro-Hamas perspective is out instantaneously telling a story,\" Lew said. \"It tells a story that is, over time, shown not to be completely accurate. 'Thirty-five children were killed.' Well, it wasn't 35 children. It was many fewer.\"\n\n\"The children who were killed,\" he added, \"turned out to have been the children of Hamas fighters.\"\n\nThe repercussions for the United States and the region will play out for years. Protests have erupted outside the American embassies in Muslim-majority countries like Indonesia, the world's third-largest democracy, while polls show Arab Americans grew increasingly hostile to their own government stateside. Russia, before its black eye in Syria, and China have both sought to capitalize by entering business and defense deals with Arab nations. By the summer, State Department analysts in the Middle East sent cables to Washington expressing concerns that the IDF's conduct would only inflame tensions in the West Bank and galvanize young Palestinians to take up arms against Israel. Intelligence officials warn that terrorist groups are recruiting on the anti-American sentiment throughout the region, which they say is at its highest levels in years.\n\nThe Israeli government did not answer detailed questions, but a spokesperson for the embassy in Washington, D.C., broadly defended Israel's relationship with the U.S., \"two allies who have been working together to push back against extremist, destabilizing actors.\" Israel is a country of laws, the spokesperson added, and its actions over the past 15 months \"benefit the interests of the free world and the United States, creating an opportunity for a better future for the Middle East amid the tragedy of the war started by Hamas.\"\n\nNext week, Trump will inherit a demoralized State Department, part of the federal bureaucracy from which he has pledged to cull disloyal employees. Grappling with the near-daily images of carnage in Gaza, many across the U.S. government have become disenchanted with the lofty ideas they thought they represented.\n\n\"This is the human rights atrocity of our time,\" one senior diplomat told me. \"I work for the department that's responsible for this policy. I signed up for this. ... I don't deserve sympathy for it.\"\n\nThe southern city of Rafah was supposed to be a safe haven for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who the IDF had forced from their homes in the north at the start of the war. When Biden learned that Netanyahu intended to invade the city this spring, he warned that the U.S. will stop sending offensive arms if the Israelis went through with it.\n\n\"It is a red line,\" Biden had said, marking the first high-profile warning from the U.S.\n\nNetanyahu invaded in May anyway. Israeli tanks rolled into the city and the IDF dropped bombs on Hamas targets, including a refugee camp , killing dozens of civilians. Biden responded by pausing a shipment of 2,000-pound bombs but otherwise resumed military support.\n\nIn late May, the International Court of Justice ordered Israel to stop its assault on the city, citing the Geneva Conventions. Behind the scenes, State Department lawyers scrambled to come up with a legal basis on which Israel could continue smaller attacks in Rafah. \"There is room to argue that more scaled back/targeted operations, combined with better humanitarian efforts, would not meet that threshold,\" the lawyers said in a May 24 email. While it's not unreasonable for government lawyers to defend a close ally, critics say the cable illustrates the extreme deference the U.S. affords Israel.\n\n\"The State Department has a whole raft of highly paid, very good lawyers to explain, 'Actually this is not illegal,' when in fact it is,\" said Ari Tolany, an arms trade authority and director at the Center for International Policy, a Washington-based think tank. \"Rules for thee and not for me.\"\n\nThe administration says that it restrained Israel's attack in Rafah. In a recent interview, Lew told the Times of Israel the operation ultimately resulted in relatively few civilian casualties. \"It was done in a way that limited or really eliminated the friction between the United States and Israel,\" he added, \"but also led to a much better outcome.\"\n\nSeveral experts told me international law is effectively discretionary for some countries. \"American policy ignores it when it's inconvenient and adheres to it when it is convenient,\" said Aaron Miller, a career State Department diplomat who worked for decades under both Democratic and Republican presidents as an adviser on Arab-Israeli negotiations. \"The U.S. does not leverage or bring sustainable, credible, serious pressure to bear on any of its allies and partners,\" he added, \"not just Israel.\"\n\nRead More\n\nMiller and others note that the barbarity of Hamas attacks on Oct. 7, 2023, galvanized domestic support for Israel and made it significantly easier for Biden to avoid holding the Israelis accountable as they retaliated.\n\nThere are other likely reasons for Biden's unwillingness to impose any realistic limitations on Israel's use of American weaponry since Oct. 7. For one, his career-long affinity for Israel - its security, people and the idea of a friendly democracy in the Middle East - is shared by many of the most powerful people in the country. (\"If this Capitol crumbles to the ground, the one thing that would remain is our commitment to our aid - I don't even call it aid, our cooperation - with Israel,\" Nancy Pelosi said in 2018, weeks before resuming her role as House speaker.) That rationale aligned with the Democrats' political goals during an election when they were wary of taking risks and upsetting large portions of the electorate, including the immensely powerful Israel lobby.\n\nImmediately after the ICJ's order about the Rafah invasion, officials in the State Department's Middle East and communications divisions drafted a list of proposed public statements to acknowledge the importance of the court and express concern over civilians in the city. But Matthew Miller, the State Department spokesperson, nixed almost all of them. He told the officials in a May 24 email that those on the White House's National Security Council \"aren't going to clear\" any recognition of the ruling or criticism of Israel.\n\nThat was an early sign that the State Department was taking a back seat in shaping war policy. In its place, the NSC - largely led by Jake Sullivan, Brett McGurk and Amos Hochstein - assumed a larger role. While the NSC has grown significantly in size and influence over the decades, State Department officials repeatedly told me they felt marginalized this past year.\n\n\"The NSC has final say over our messaging,\" one diplomat said. \"All any of us can do is what they'll allow us to do.\"\n\nThe NSC did not make its senior leaders available for an interview or respond to questions from ProPublica. Sullivan, Biden's national security adviser and brother to the State Department's counselor, said recently it was difficult, for much of the past year, \"to get the Israeli government to align with a lot of what President Biden publicly has been saying\" about Gaza.\n\nRead More\n\nSullivan said too many civilians have died there and the U.S. was frequently required to publicly and privately pressure Israel to improve the flow of humanitarian aid. \"We believe Israel has a responsibility - as a democracy, as a country committed to the basic principle of the value of innocent life, and as a member of the international community that has obligations under international humanitarian law - that it do the utmost to protect and minimize harm to civilians.\"\n\nDuring another internal State Department meeting in March, top regional diplomats voiced their frustrations about messaging and appearances. Hady Amr, one of the government's highest-ranking authorities on Palestinian affairs, said he was reluctant to address large groups about the administration's Israel policy and he took issue with much of it, according to notes of the conversation. He warned colleagues that the sentiment in Muslim communities was turning. From a public diplomacy perspective, Amr told them, the war has been \"catastrophically bad for the U.S.\" (Amr did not respond to requests for comment.)\n\nAnother attendee at the meeting said they had been effectively sidelined by the NSC. A third said it was a huge amount of effort to even get permission to use the word \"condemn\" when talking about Israeli settlers demolishing Palestinians' homes in the West Bank.\n\nSuch sanitizing language became common. Alex Smith, a former contractor with the U.S. Agency for International Development, said that at one point the State Department distributed NSC's list of phrases that he and others weren't allowed to use on internal presentations. Instead of \"Palestinian residents of Jerusalem,\" for example, they were meant to say \"non-Israeli residents of Jerusalem.\" Another official told Smith in an email, \"I would recommend not discussing [international humanitarian law] at all without extensive clearances.\"\n\nA USAID spokesperson said in an email that the agency couldn't discuss personnel matters, but the list of terms was given to the agency by the State Department as early as 2022, before the war in Gaza. The list, the spokesperson added, includes the \"suggested terms that are in line with U.S. diplomatic protocol.\"\n\nDeference to Israel is not new. For decades, the U.S. has repeatedly looked the other way when Israel is accused of human rights abuses.\n\nOne of the most conspicuous paper tigers in American foreign policy is the Leahy Law, experts say. Passed more than 25 years ago, the law's authors intended to force foreign governments to hold their own accountable for violations like torture or extrajudicial killings - or their military assistance would be restricted. The law allowed precision targeting of individual units that faced credible allegations, so that the U.S. didn't need to cut off entire countries from U.S.-funded weapons and training. It's essentially a blacklist.\n\nRead More\n\nAlmost immediately, Israel got special treatment, records show. In March 1998, IDF soldiers fired on journalists covering demonstrations in the West Bank city of Hebron. Congress asked the State Department, then led by Madeleine Albright, to take action under the new law. \"An Israeli official informed the U.S. Embassy that the soldiers were disciplined after the incident, but was unable to provide further information,\" State Department officials responded in a letter - more than two years later - to Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., the law's namesake. \"It is the Department's conclusion that there are insufficient grounds on which to conclude that the units involved committed gross violations of human rights.\"\n\nWhile the country took action across the globe in South America, the Pacific Rim and elsewhere, the U.S. government has never disqualified an Israeli military unit under the law - despite voluminous evidence presented to the State Department.\n\nIn 2020, the agency even set up a special council, called the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum, to assess accusations against the country's military and police units. The forum is composed of State Department officials with expertise in human rights, arms transfers and the Middle East who review public allegations of human rights abuses before making referrals to the Secretary of State. While it had ambitious goals to finally hold Israeli units accountable, the forum became widely known as just another layer of bureaucracy that slowed down the process and protected Israel.\n\nCurrent and former diplomats told me that U.S. leaders are fundamentally unwilling to follow through on the law and cut off units from American-funded weapons. Instead, they have created multiple processes that give the appearance of accountability while simultaneously undermining any potential results, the experts said.\n\n\"It's like walking toward the horizon,\" said Charles Blaha, a former director at the State Department who served on the Israel Leahy Vetting Forum. \"You can always walk toward it but you will never ever get there.\"\n\n\"I really believed in the Israeli military justice system and I really believed that the State Department was acting in good faith,\" he added. \"But both of those things were wrong.\"\n\nA review of the vetting forum's emails and meeting minutes from 2021 through 2022 shows even the most high-profile and seemingly egregious cases fall into a bureaucratic black hole.\n\nAfter the IDF was accused of killing Palestinian American journalist Shireen Abu Akleh in May 2022, videos circulated on the internet of Israeli police units beating pallbearers at her funeral. \"It is indeed very difficult to watch,\" a deputy assistant secretary wrote in an email to a member of the forum. Another member told colleagues, \"I think this would be what is actionable for the funeral procession itself as we wait for more info on circumstances of death and whether this would trigger Leahy ineligibility.\"\n\nNeither Akleh's killing, nor the funeral beatings, led to Leahy determinations against Israel.\n\nFor years, lawmakers pushed the U.S. government to take action on Akleh's case. Tim Rieser, a senior foreign policy aide who helped draft the Leahy Law, recently held a meeting with State Department officials to discuss the case again. The officials in the meeting again punted. \"We're talking about an American journalist who was killed by an Israeli soldier and nothing happened,\" he said. \"They are walking out the door on Jan. 20th and they haven't implemented the law.\"\n\nIn another case considered by the forum, a 15-year-old boy from the West Bank said he was tortured and raped in the Israeli detention facility Al-Mascobiyya, or Russian Compound. For years, the State Department had been told about widespread abuses in that facility and others like it.\n\nMilitary Court Watch, a local nonprofit organization of attorneys, collected testimony from more than 1,100 minors who had been detained between 2013 and 2023. Most said they were strip searched and many said they were beaten. Some teens tried to kill themselves in solitary confinement. IDF soldiers recalled children so scared that they peed themselves during arrests.\n\nAt the Russian Compound, a 14-year-old said his interrogator shocked and beat him in the legs with sticks to elicit information about a car fire. A 15-year-old said he was handcuffed with another boy. \"An Israeli policeman then walked into the room and beat the hell out of me and the other boy,\" he said. A 12-year-old girl said she was put into a small cell with cockroaches.\n\nMilitary Court Watch routinely shared its information with the State Department, according to Gerard Horton, one of the group's co-founders. But nothing ever came of it. \"They receive all our reports and we name the facilities,\" he told me. \"It goes up the food chain and it gets political. Everyone knows what's going on and obviously no action is taken.\"\n\nEven the State Department's own public human rights reports acknowledge widespread allegations of abuse in Israeli prisons. Citing nonprofits, prisoner testimony and media reports, the agency wrote last year that \"detainees held by Israel were subjected to physical and sexual violence, threats, intimidation, severely restricted access to food and water.\"\n\nIn the summer of 2021, the State Department reached out to the Israeli government and asked about the 15-year-old who said he was raped at the Russian Compound. The next day, the Israeli government raided the nonprofit that had originally documented the allegation, Defense for Children International - Palestine, and then designated the group a terrorist organization.\n\nAs a result, U.S. human rights officials said they were prohibited from speaking to DCIP. \"A large part of the frustration was that we were unable to access Palestinian civil society because most NGOs\" - nongovernmental organizations - \"were considered terrorist organizations,\" said Mike Casey, a former U.S. diplomat in Jerusalem who resigned last year. \"All these groups were essentially the premier human rights organizations, and we were not able to meet with them.\"\n\nMiller, the State Department spokesperson, said in his statement that the agency has not \"blanketly prohibited\" officials from speaking with groups that document allegations of human rights abuses and they continue to work with organizations in Israel and the West Bank.\n\nAfter the raid on DCIP, a member of the forum emailed his superior at the State Department and said the U.S. should push to get an explanation for the raid from the Israelis and \"re-raise our original request for info on the underlying allegation.\"\n\nBut almost two years went by and there were no arrests, while those on the forum struggled to get basic information about the case. Then, in the early months of the Israel war on Hamas, another State Department official reached out to DCIP and tried to reengage, according to a recording of the conversation.\n\n\"As you can imagine, it's been a bit touchy here,\" the official said on the call, explaining the months without correspondence. \"The Israeli government's not going to dictate to me who I can talk to, but my superiors can.\"\n\nThe IDF eventually told the State Department it did not find evidence of a sexual assault but reprimanded the guard for kicking a chair during the teenager's interrogation. To date, the U.S. has not cut off the Russian Compound on Leahy grounds.\n\nIn late April, there was surprising news: Blinken was reportedly set to take action against Netzah Yehuda, a notorious ultraorthodox IDF battalion, under the Leahy law.\n\nThe Leahy forum had recommended several cases to him. But for months, he sat on the recommendations . One of them was the case of Omar Assad.\n\nOn a cold night in January 2022, Netzah Yehuda soldiers pulled over Assad, an elderly Palestinian American who was on his way home from playing cards in the West Bank. They bound, blindfolded and gagged him and led him into a construction site, according to local investigators. He was found dead shortly after.\n\nAfter the killing, DAWN, an advocacy group founded by the slain Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi, compiled a dossier of evidence on the case, including testimony from family and witnesses, as well as a medical examiner's report. The report found Assad had traumatic injuries to the head and other injuries that caused a stress-induced heart attack. The group delivered the dossier to the State Department's Leahy forum.\n\nThe dossier also included information about other incidents. For years, Netzah Yehuda has been accused of violent crimes in the West Bank, including killing unarmed Palestinians. They have also been convicted of torturing and abusing detainees in custody.\n\nBy late 2023, after the Oct. 7 attacks, the experts on the forum decided that Assad's case met all the conditions of the Leahy law: a human rights violation had occurred and the soldiers responsible had not been adequately punished. The forum recommended that the battalion should no longer receive any American-funded weapons or training until the perpetrators are brought to justice.\n\nRead More\n\nProPublica published an article in the spring of 2024 about Blinken sitting on the recommendations . But when he signaled his intention to take action shortly after, the Israelis responded with fury . \"Sanctions must not be imposed on the Israel Defense Forces!\" Netanyahu posted on X. \"The intention to impose a sanction on a unit in the IDF is the height of absurdity and a moral low.\"\n\nThe pressure campaign, which also reportedly came from Speaker Mike Johnson , R-La. and Lew, the ambassador, appears to have worked. For months, Blinken punted on an official decision. Then, in August, the State Department announced that Netzah Yehuda would not be cut off from military aid after all because the U.S. had received new information that the IDF had effectively \"remediated\" the case. Two soldiers involved were removed from active duty and made ineligible to serve in the reserve, but there is no indication that anyone was charged with a crime.\n\nMiller, the spokesperson, said the IDF also took steps to avoid similar incidents in the future, like enhanced screening and a two-week educational seminar for Netzah Yehuda recruits.\n\n\"In seven and a half years as director of the State Department office that implements the Leahy law worldwide,\" Blaha wrote shortly after the announcement, \"I have never seen a single case in which mere administrative measures constituted sufficient remediation.\"\n\nIn its statement to ProPublica, the Israeli government did not address individual cases, but said, \"All of the incidents in question were thoroughly examined by the American administration, which concluded that Israel took remedial measures when necessary.\"\n\nLast summer, CNN documented how commanders in the battalion have been promoted to senior positions in the IDF, where they train ground troops and run operations in Gaza. A weapons expert told me the guns that Netzah Yehuda soldiers have been photographed holding were likely made in the U.S.\n\nLater in the year, Younis Tirawi, a Palestinian journalist who runs a popular account on X, posted videos showing IDF soldiers who recorded themselves rummaging through children's clothing inside a home and demolishing a mosque's minaret.

      "text": "Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy to Resign From Congress\n\nR ep. Kevin McCarthy, the former House Speaker who was ousted from the position by members of his own party, announced on Wednesday that he will resign from Congress at the end of the year.\n\n\"I have decided to depart the House at the end of this year to serve America in new ways,\" McCarthy wrote in an op-ed in the Wall Street Journal . \"I know my work is only getting started.\"\n\nHis announcement will leave the House GOP with an even slimmer majority-they already hold only an eight seat majority in the chamber-until a special election can be held to fill his vacated seat. Many in Washington expected McCarthy to leave Congress following a historic vote in October when a group of conservative hardliners successfully kicked him out of his leadership position for the first time in U.S. history, leaving the California Republican in an uncomfortable position within his conference. The move signaled a major shift in the dynamics of the House GOP and highlighted deep divisions within the party.\n\n\"I will continue to recruit our country's best and brightest to run for elected office,\" McCarthy wrote. \"The Republican Party is expanding every day, and I am committed to lending my experience to support the next generation of leaders.\"\n\nMcCarthy's departure marks a significant turn from his earlier statements, where he had asserted his intention to remain in Congress. The former Speaker, who first entered Congress in 2007, swiftly ascended the leadership ladder, overcoming an unsuccessful bid for the gavel in 2015. Known for his prolific fundraising, McCarthy's tumultuous journey culminated in his appointment as House minority leader and later as speaker after a contentious 15-round vote .\n\nThe catalyst for McCarthy's ouster was the assertion by eight conservative hardliners-led by Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz-that he had violated their agreement made during the initial speaker race. They accused McCarthy of breaching the terms by supporting a clean stop-gap spending bill, prompting a motion to vacate. Democrats backed the motion, adding to the pressure on the embattled Republican leader.\n\nTensions between McCarthy and his critics have been palpable since the motion to vacate, with some members expressing dissatisfaction over his handling of the speaker's race to replace him. The sympathy McCarthy initially garnered following his leadership ouster began to wane, further exacerbating the divisions within the GOP. He was succeeded as House Speaker by Rep. Mike Johnson of Louisiana.\n\nMcCarthy has repeatedly targeted the eight Republicans who voted against him, leading to speculation that he may intervene in primaries and elections to unseat them. McCarthy's resignation comes against the backdrop of a growing exodus among Republican lawmakers. Over the past months, almost a dozen House GOP members have declared their intentions to retire from office at the conclusion of their terms, including his longtime ally Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina, whom McCarthy tapped to serve as speaker pro tempore after he lost his position.\n\nSome retiring members pointed to a distaste for the political climate in Washington as a factor influencing their decisions. The sentiment echoes a broader trend in recent years, where lawmakers have increasingly cited frustration with the polarized and gridlocked nature of Capitol Hill as a significant motivator for stepping away from public office. McHenry on Tuesday said he's \"confident\" in the House's future, despite the upheaval after McCarthy's removal.\n\nMcCarthy struck a similar tone in his announcement, declaring himself an \"optimist.\"\n\n\"No matter the odds, or personal cost, we did the right thing,\" he wrote. \"That may seem out of fashion in Washington these days, but delivering results for the American people is still celebrated across the country.\"\n\nWrite to Nik Popli at nik.popli@time.com"

      "text": "Why House Democrats Refused to Save McCarthy\n\nF or the first time in U.S. history, a motion to vacate the Speaker of the House has succeeded , with the chamber's Democrats shrugging as a small group of mostly far-right Republicans provided the crucial votes to oust Republican Speaker Kevin McCarthy.\n\nOn Tuesday, Democrats voted unanimously alongside Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida and seven other GOP members to remove McCarthy as Speaker. Despite talk over the weekend that some Democrats might cut a deal with McCarthy to save him, the Speaker ultimately refused to offer members of the opposition party any concessions, leaving Democrats united against him. In the narrowly divided House, only a handful of Republicans needed to join Democrats to create the majority needed to win the vote.\n\nEven though the effort to oust McCarthy was instigated by Republicans, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries urged House Democrats to join them in voting against the Speaker. In a statement released before the vote, Jeffries explained his reasoning, saying McCarthy had brought this on himself by using his short tenure as Speaker to cater to extremists in his party. He pointed to the chaotic 15 rounds of voting that the House endured back in January to pick McCarthy as Speaker, a process in which McCarthy made concessions to far-right Republicans, including allowing any one member to force a motion to vacate.\n\n\"It is now the responsibility of the GOP members to end the House Republican Civil War,\" Jeffries wrote. \"Given their unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism in an authentic and comprehensive manner, House Democratic leadership will vote yes on the pending Republican Motion to Vacate the Chair.\"\n\nFormer Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who was out of town and missed the vote, also laid the chaos at the feet of the GOP, and said Democrats had no reason to help McCarthy.\n\n\"The Speaker of the House is chosen by the Majority Party,\" Pelosi wrote on X, the site formerly known as Twitter. \"In this Congress, it is the responsibility of House Republicans to choose a nominee & elect the Speaker on the Floor. At this time there is no justification for a departure from this tradition. The House will be in order.\"\n\nOver the weekend, as talk of Gaetz's plan to push for a vote to oust McCarthy intensified, Washington was buzzing with talk of even just a handful of Democrats making a deal with  Republican leadership to shield the Speaker. Moderate Democrats remained under pressure through Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn the end, no rank-and-file Democrats felt moved to help McCarthy or his party get out of a mess of their own making.\n\n\"I think he's likely the most unprincipled person to ever be Speaker of the House,\" Rep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat, told reporters ahead of the vote. \"He's disdainful, he lies about us, he lies about the process of governance. It's not even a question of whether or not we should take any particular action.\"\n\nIn a final, doomed plea ahead of the vote, it was Rep. Patrick McHenry, a North Carolina Republican and a McCarthy ally, who suggested that Democrats might be making the right political move for them.\n\n\"With this record of success that we've seen Kevin McCarthy and a Republican majority produce in a Washington run by Democrats, we're going to throw that away, resulting in more liberal outcomes, not more conservative ones,\" McHenry told his colleagues. \"So I understand why the left is where you are today. You don't like an effective conservative majority, and I don't blame you. But on the right, rethink this.\"\n\nDemocrats are running some risk in that they are gambling that the next Speaker of the House won't turn out to be worse, in their assessments. But many Democrats in the chamber felt helping prop up McCarthy's speakership carried its own risks.\n\n\"This is the Republican's civil war and they haven't shown they can govern,\" California Rep. Ted Lieu, the vice chair of the House Democratic Caucus, told TIME immediately after the speakership vote. \"Hopefully the Republicans will be able to put forward someone that doesn't break his word and we'll see what happens. I am voting for Hakeem Jeffries.\"\n\nAsked what happens if the next Speaker isn't Jeffries and refuses to work with Democrats, Lieu said \"It's too early to speculate.\"\n\nFollowing the vote on the motion to vacate, McHenry was selected as Speaker Pro Tem of North Carolina off of a secret list put together by McCarthy. McHenry immediately called for a recess before the House began the process of selecting a new Speaker. When those votes do happen, McCarthy could continue to put his name forward. Possible successors include Majority Leader Steve Scalise, Majority Whip Tom Emmer, and Conference Chair Elise Stefanik, all of whom backed McCarthy and say that they are not interested in replacing him.\n\n\"Right now I think all of us are just trying to think through what the path ahead is,\" California Rep. Pete Aguilar, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, told TIME immediately after the vote. \"It's incredibly unfortunate that we're in this situation, but the reality is Kevin McCarthy ran to the extremes at every possible turn from the very beginning. That's why it took them 15 votes, he made a lot of promises.\"\n\nNik Popli contributed reporting.\n\nWrite to Mini Racker at mini.racker@time.com"

      "text": "In Dramatic Vote, McCarthy Becomes First House Speaker to be Ousted in U.S. History\n\nF or the first time in American history, a Speaker of the House has been stripped of the gavel.\n\nA small group of Republican hardliners led by Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida provided the pivotal votes on Tuesday needed to remove Speaker Kevin McCarthy from his leadership position, marking a dramatic but expected end to McCarthy's contentious 10-month tenure as leader of the House and setting the stage for an intense intraparty search for his replacement.\n\nThe move to oust McCarthy began after the California Republican relied on Democrats to avert a government shutdown. Gaetz, after days of warning and mounting tension, went on the House floor on Monday night to introduce a resolution that declared the speakership vacant, triggering an exceedingly rare process to compel a vote to determine whether McCarthy would retain his post as Speaker. All Democrats present and 8 Republicans supported the measure in a 216-210 vote that followed an hour of floor debate, during which hard-right Republicans railed against their own leader and verbally sparred with his defenders while Democrats listened silently.\n\n\"Chaos is Speaker McCarthy,\" Gaetz said. \"Chaos is somebody who we cannot trust with their word.\"\n\nBut others argue the chaos is what comes next. There's no clear consensus on which lawmaker might be elected to replace McCarthy, and so far no Republican has put themself forward to serve as Speaker. Republican Rep. Tom Cole, a key McCarthy ally, urged members to \"think long and hard before you plunge us into chaos\" by voting to vacate the speakership. \"He put his political neck on the line, knowing this day was coming, to do the right thing-the right thing for the country,\" Cole said, referring to McCarthy's efforts to end the government shutdown.\n\nGaetz's motion has thrust the House into uncharted territory. Only two other speakers in history have faced similar motions to vacate, neither of which succeeded: once in 1910 and more recently in 2015 when Rep. Mark Meadows attempted to oust Speaker John Boehner. (That motion was not introduced on the floor, but it ultimately led to Boehner's resignation from Congress.)\n\nThe decision to boot McCarthy came on the heels of his strategic maneuver to avert a government shutdown over the weekend, when he relied on Democratic votes to pass a clean stopgap spending bill after Gaetz's faction refused to back the House GOP measure. Conservatives said that McCarthy, who made a series of pledges to win the speakership after a marathon 15 rounds of voting in January, broke his word to conservatives by striking the short-term deal.\n\n\"It is becoming increasingly clear who the Speaker of the House already works for, and it's not the Republican conference,\" Gaetz declared on Monday as he argued for McCarthy's removal. He criticized McCarthy's reliance on Democratic support to pass the funding bill and accused him of deceiving his fellow Republicans during spending negotiations and making undisclosed agreements with Democrats, particularly regarding funding for Ukraine, a matter that many conservatives vehemently opposed.\n\nThe move by Gaetz represented a significant escalation in the ongoing power struggle between McCarthy and the hardliners in his party. Since McCarthy's election as Speaker in a chamber where his party holds a razor-thin five-seat majority, more than five Republicans have intermittently threatened to challenge his leadership, subjecting him to numerous votes of confidence, some of which were politically painful for McCarthy and moderate Republicans.\n\nThis bitter feud between Gaetz and McCarthy has roots dating back to McCarthy's initial ascent to the speakership. In January, Gaetz took to the House floor to accuse McCarthy of engaging in questionable financial dealings, a narrative that continued to simmer. As a concession to Gaetz and the 19 other Republicans who initially opposed his speakership, McCarthy altered House rules to enable any member to call for a snap vote on his ouster-which ultimately led to his failure to keep the position.\n\nStill, the ultimate success of Gaetz's bid to remove McCarthy wasn't assured, as it hinged on the support of some fellow Republicans and all Democrats. Even some Republicans who had expressed reservations about McCarthy's leadership weren't on board with Gaetz's plan. \"Mr. McCarthy is an accurate reflection of the current House Republican Conference,\" Rep. Dan Bishop, a rightwing North Carolina Republican who has sparred with McCarthy, said in a statement before voting no on the resolution to vacate the speakership.\n\nIn the days leading up to the vote, several moderate and conservative-leaning Democrats indicated that they would be hesitant to punish McCarthy for his efforts to work across the aisle and prevent a government shutdown. Others saw no reason to bail him out, given the series of concessions McCarthy had made to appease the right flank of his party, including opening an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden and reneging on spending agreements made with the President during the debt ceiling crisis.\n\nBut in the end, every Democrat present voted for the motion to vacate. In a statement released early Tuesday afternoon, House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries announced that Democrats would not lend their support to McCarthy: \"Under the Republican majority, the House has been restructured to empower right-wing extremists, kowtow to their harsh demands and impose a rigid partisan ideology,\" he said.\n\nSeveral Democrats echoed that sentiment ahead of the vote. \"Republican leadership is in such a dysfunctional state and we need them to be functional in order to take up things for the American people,\" Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, tells TIME.\n\nRep. Abigail Spanberger, a Virginia Democrat, said ahead the vote that McCarthy is \"likely the most unprincipled person to ever be speaker of the House\" before listing off reasons she would not back him. \"He's disdainful, he lies about us, he lies about the process of governance. It's not even a question of whether or not we should take any particular action,\" she told reporters.\n\nGaetz's move, while celebrated by his supporters, incited the ire of McCarthy's allies within the Republican Party, who viewed the push as a publicity stunt driven by personal animus. \"I cannot conceive of a more counterproductive and self-destructive course,\" Rep. Tom McClintock, a Republican from California, said on the House floor. McCarthy remained stoic throughout the vote Tuesday, occasionally smiling but making little eye contact with his detractors.\n\nWith McCarthy removed from his leadership position, House Republicans will now look to find a replacement that can appease both far-right members and moderates in the party. (Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina will serve as acting Speaker until a new one is elected.) Asked on Monday if he had any lawmakers in mind for the job, Gaetz suggested House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, a Louisiana Republican and McCarthy ally.\n\nWrite to Nik Popli at nik.popli@time.com"

      "text": "The Model Kevin McCarthy Should Follow After the Shutdown Fight-but Probably Won't\n\nH ouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy finally bowed to the obvious on Saturday and allowed his chamber to vote on a stop-gap spending bill that did not include spending cuts or policy changes-what's known as a clean continuing resolution (CR) in Capitol Hill lingo-in order to keep the government open . Doing so could cost McCarthy his speakership, as far-right rebels have spent weeks threatening that passing such a bill with Democratic votes could prompt them to offer a motion to remove McCarthy from the job.\n\nThe situation underscores both the difficulty of McCarthy's job with a fractious caucus and a razor-thin majority, but also how governing in a bipartisan way is considered tantamount to treason. This has left Congress on the brink of total paralysis.\n\nBut it wasn't always this way . In fact, the hyper partisanship that grips American politics today is a relatively recent development.\n\nIronically, the 1960s-one of the most divisive and tumultuous decades of the last century-was a golden era for compromise in Congress.\n\nDuring that decade, two remarkable Senate leaders-Majority Leader Mike Mansfield (D-Mont.) and Minority Leader Everett Dirksen (R-Ill.)-perfected the art of bipartisan governance and passed some of the most significant legislation in American history. The two men were driven by a deep commitment to civility, self-restraint, candor, and respect for the institution they jointly led-a commitment that could do much to repair our broken legislative branch today. An example of their work offers an illustration of how Congress should work-one that unfortunately exposes how broken the legislative branch is today.\n\nDirksen, a would-be actor and former congressman, who became one of the Senate's great orators and legislative dealmakers, joined the chamber in 1950, while Mansfield, a laconic former college history professor and one-time copper miner, moved from the House to the Senate in 1952. By 1961 their colleagues had tapped the two men to lead their respective Senate caucuses.\n\nBoth men were certainly partisans with Dirksen's fundamentally conservative nature preventing him from supporting much of President John F. Kennedy's domestic legislative agenda. Yet, each also viewed governance-and the compromise and conciliation often required-as a responsibility of leadership. Mansfield's modesty and fairness combined with Dirksen's persuasion and dealmaking to frequently allow the leaders to overcome the strongest ideological elements of their own parties, causing Mansfield to later reflect that \"you get a partner like Dirksen and form a dream relationship once in a century.\"\n\nIn 1963, they confronted an immense legislative challenge. The Senate was deeply divided over Kennedy's proposed nuclear test ban treaty with the Soviet Union. Most Senate Republicans opposed reaching any accommodation with the Soviets and many powerful Senate Democrats, including the influential Armed Services Committee Chairman Richard Russell of Georgia, agreed.\n\nWhen, after months of negotiations, Kennedy presented the treaty to the Senate it was far from certain it would survive, especially since ratification required two-thirds support. Fortunately for Kennedy, Dirksen and Mansfield seemed to embrace the sage advice of one-time Secretary of State Dean Acheson. \"The central question is not whether Congress should be stronger than the Presidency, or vice versa,\" Acheson said, but how both could be strengthened to do \"pressing work,\" both separately and together.\n\nWhile Dirksen warned that \"every word and every line and every phase of the treaty must be carefully examined for its present and future effect,\" that was far from a declaration of war. This was crucial, because as Mansfield admitted both publicly and privately to Kennedy and Dirksen, Republican votes would decide the fate of the treaty. The majority leader hoped that \"Senator Dirksen and I will be working shoulder-to-shoulder on this one when the chips are down.\"\n\nFar from attacking the minority party, Mansfield declared that he had \"every confidence\" in their fairness. He trusted that Republicans would set politics aside and focus on \"what will be good for their country.\" The statement was vintage Mansfield, downplaying partisanship and assuming the best intentions of the other party, particularly Dirksen. This stance helped engender trust and build durable working relationships.\n\nAs the debate began, Dirksen said he was detecting a \"pattern of fear\" about the ramifications of the treaty as he talked to his Republican colleagues. He suggested to Mansfield that they \"ought to get on our horses and go down to the White House\" to suggest to the president that he work to understand and address this fear.\n\nKennedy was initially reluctant to agree to the visit, not wanting to elevate Dirksen, given his opposition to the president's domestic agenda. But Mansfield, always focused on what it took to win in the Senate, pressed the White House, and the meeting was scheduled for the same day Senate floor debate began.\n\n\"Now this is a little presumptuous on my part,\" Dirksen warned Kennedy as he began reading aloud the draft of a letter he was hoping the president would agree to send to the Senate. The proposed letter offered \"unqualified and unequivocal assurances\" that the United States would pursue underground nuclear testing, maintain a posture of readiness to resume atmospheric testing, enhance detection capabilities to ensure the Russians were not cheating, and maintain a robust weapons development capability. He saw such promises as key to securing votes from his side of the aisle.\n\nKennedy readily agreed to send the letter, and the three men spent the rest of the almost hour-long meeting strategizing about where the votes stood with senators of both parties. After the meeting, Dirksen immediately announced he would support the treaty and resist efforts to amend it or attach reservations.\n\nThe letter crafted by Dirksen and sent by the president gave the minority leader crucial arguments to use to win over fellow Republicans. He proved able to secure support from 25 of them, representing an ideological cross section of the GOP, including midwestern conservatives and northeastern liberals. All Democrats supported the bill save for some conservative southerners and maverick Senator Frank Lausche of Ohio.\n\nWhen the final vote of 80-19 was announced, Mansfield stood, looked at the Republican leader, and said, \"I salute a great American.\"\n\nKennedy considered the treaty the supreme foreign policy accomplishment of his presidency, made possible only because a Republican leader set aside partisan considerations and helped round up the votes.\n\nRead More : The Freedom Caucus Has Taken the House Hostage. Their Demand? Kevin McCarthy's Spine\n\nRatification of the Test Ban Treaty was but one example of a highly fruitful legislative partnership that helped pass, among other landmark legislation, the 1964 Civil Rights Act and the 1965 Voting Rights Act. The key was the Democratic majority listening to Dirksen's advice and requests, and working to bring him into the fold. Crucially, the minority leader didn't see legislating as a chance to score political points. He had no interest in \"owning the libs,\" to use the language of today. Rather, on many issues-even those that provided political victories for Kennedy or his successor Lyndon B. Johnson-Dirksen could place national interest above partisan advantage.\n\nExposing how different politics are today , McCarthy faces the looming specter of a coup should he even grudgingly agree to a bipartisan deal to keep the government open-an absolute necessity. Yet, the speaker has also operated in almost the opposite fashion of Dirksen. He hasn't even tried to find common cause with the other party, despite confronting divided government. At every turn, he has looked to appease the right wing of his party and pass things with only Republican votes. When he was forced to cut a deal with President Biden to raise the debt ceiling, he quickly reneged on the terms when the fringe of his caucus rose up in protest.\n\nIt seems clear, however, that Dirksen's methods offer the speaker a way out of his seemingly impossible predicament. Democrats might even save him from a coup. The key is deploying Dirksen's way of thinking and prioritizing what is good for the country over what is good for McCarthy's party or his own political future. Unfortunately, in 2023 this seems little more than a naïve hope-even as it remains the best path to a government that functions in deeply divided times.\n\nMarc C.

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy's Shutdown Dilemma\n\nW ith just five days to go until the government shuts down without a spending deal, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is at a crossroads.\n\nHe can either shut down the government and possibly save his standing with the GOP hardliners threatening to oust him, or work with Democrats to pass a short-term spending bill and avert a government shutdown-potentially at the expense of his own speakership.\n\nCaught in the middle of the California Republican's political calculus are millions of Americans who would be impacted by even a short government shutdown, including hundreds of thousands of federal workers and scores of everyday citizens .\n\nThe threat to McCarthy's leadership comes from Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz and at least four other conservative hardliners who have said that they would attempt to overthrow McCarthy if he cooperates with Democrats to pass a stopgap measure to keep the government funded. These lawmakers are adamant in their opposition to any funding bill that doesn't meet their strict fiscal and policy demands.\n\nMcCarthy has been exploring various strategies, including a proposal to package four individual appropriations bills that would cut billions of dollars in spending. The approach would mark an attempt to appease conservatives while buying more time to pass the rest of their spending bills, though there is no guarantee that McCarthy can gather enough support from his fellow Republicans to pass this funding package or a continuing resolution (CR), a short-term bill.\n\nAsked on Tuesday if he's willing to work with House or Senate Democrats to keep the government open, McCarthy signaled that he would rather bypass talks with congressional Democrats and instead strike a spending deal directly with President Joe Biden, months after the pair agreed to funding levels during this year's debt ceiling fight. \"I think it'd be very important to have a meeting with the President,\" McCarthy said. Any potential deal would have to include the House GOP's border security package, he added. \"I believe we have a majority here, and we can work together to solve this. It might take us a little longer, but this is important,\" McCarthy said.\n\nThe House Speaker's political tightrope act is compounded by former President Donald Trump's backing of the conservative hardliners. Last week, Gaetz made his stance clear, stating, \"I'm giving a eulogy to the CR right now. I'm not voting for a continuing resolution, and a sufficient number of Republicans will never vote for a continuing resolution.\"\n\nBut even if McCarthy decides to go around the far-right members of his own party and work with Democrats, it's not clear how his colleagues across the aisle will react. If McCarthy attempts to work with Democrats to avoid a shutdown, Republicans could trigger a \"motion to vacate,\" forcing a vote on whether to oust McCarthy as Speaker. Democrats would then face a difficult decision: support McCarthy in order to keep the government funded and risk angering their own party's base, or seize the opportunity to potentially remove him from office.\n\nModerate Democrats have so far refrained from making concrete promises. Some Democrats may even demand concessions in exchange for their support of McCarthy. Rep. Henry Cuellar, a Texas Democrat who sits on the Appropriations committee, tells TIME that he would be willing to help McCarthy \"for the good of the institution\" by tabling a motion to vacate, a proposal that he says several Democrats would support to keep the government open. \"I feel bad for him because he is the Speaker and is supposed to be governing,\" Cuellar says. \"It's unfortunate but he's got to make a decision. It's like a Band-Aid: do you pull it slowly or do you just pull it off and vacate?\"\n\n\"Either we do it now or he's going to live and work the next year and a half under this threat,\" he added. \"And he can't operate under a constant threat by his far-right people.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell are currently in talks over a short-term bill to keep the government open past Sept. 30, though any Senate plan may get bogged down in the Republican-led House if it includes the $24 billion to help Ukraine that the White House requested-a move several conservatives oppose .\n\nMcCarthy also has the White House to appease. White House officials have insisted that McCarthy uphold his end of the debt ceiling deal he made with Biden this summer, which kept government funding at nearly flat levels for the next fiscal year. But conservatives had pushed for much lower funding levels, with some viewing the agreement as a starting point for negotiations. \"I need to be very clear, it's up to the Speaker to twist in the wind. I mean, seriously ... a deal is a deal,\" White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters aboard Air Force One on Tuesday. \"The President made a deal with the Speaker and a bipartisan deal that was voted by two-thirds of House Republicans back in June.\"\n\nMichael Linden, a former Office of Management and Budget official who was closely involved in the negotiations that led to the Biden-McCarthy debt ceiling deal, says it is \"extremely unusual\" for the government to shut down not long after congressional leaders reached a bipartisan agreement on overall spending levels. \"My impression absolutely was that they were negotiating in good faith and that they intended to stick to the terms and the contours of the deal,\" Linden says of past budget talks between McCarthy and Biden. \"Now I hope that Speaker McCarthy makes good on his word. Allowing the government to shut down would not only be going back on the deal, but it would be extremely damaging for him. Under what circumstances would anybody in any future need for negotiation trust that he is able to make good on his word if he can't deliver this?\"\n\nOn Tuesday, McCarthy projected confidence that he's flipped enough of the five Republican holdouts, but doubts remain. Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican who backed McCarthy's speakership bid, said on CNN on Sept. 24 that he won't support a short-term bill and that he would \"look strongly at\" overthrowing McCarthy if he passes one relying on Democratic votes. Other conservatives, including Reps. Eli Crane of Arizona and Dan Bishop of North Carolina, have expressed similar views, underscoring McCarthy's challenge.\n\n\"It really does suggest how extreme and out of the mainstream this faction of House Republicans is, and it puts Kevin McCarthy in a very difficult position,\" Linden says.\n\nMcCarthy has so far struggled to assemble enough votes to pass individual spending bills, in part because conservatives want a slew of amendments in the legislation on hot-button policy issues ranging from abortion and LGBTQ troops to racial identity and border wall construction. The far-right demands, despite having support from some prominent Republicans, risk turning off Democrats who GOP leaders will almost certainly need to pass any spending bills.\n\nHouse Republicans on Tuesday are expected to bring up a procedural vote to move forward on four regular appropriations bills this week, a significant test for McCarthy after he failed to pass a similar procedural vote for a defense bill last week in a major embarrassment for the House GOP leaders. Rep. Chip Roy, a hard-right Texas Republican who worked on the short-term funding bill, told Fox News last week that his party's holdouts are \"gonna eat a s-t sandwich\" that they \"probably deserve to eat\" if they continue to block a plan to keep the government open. Politically, a split within ultra-conservative circles could be McCarthy's best hope of survival, allowing him to make the case to moderate Republicans and Democrats that ousting him wouldn't solve any problems, because the far-right holdouts are too powerful for any Speaker to contend with.\n\n\"There may have never been a shutdown where the blame for causing it has been so crystal clear,\" Linden says. \"This is a problem that has been caused entirely within the Republican [conference] in the House.\"\n\nWrite to Nik Popli at nik.popli@time.com"

      "text": "McCarthy Was Ousted as House Speaker. What Happens Next?\n\nW ith Kevin McCarthy officially out as Speaker of the House , the Republican Party now needs to choose a new leader, plunging Congress into a state of uncertainty and chaos with government funding set to expire in just over a month.\n\nMcCarthy took himself out of the running on Tuesday evening, and by Wednesday afternoon, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana had announced they'd enter the contest.\n\n\"They don't get to say they're conservative because they're angry and chaotic,\" McCarthy said during a press conference Tuesday night of the eight Republicans who voted to oust him. \"They are not conservatives and they do not have the right to have the title.\"\n\nIn the meantime, Republican Rep. Patrick McHenry of North Carolina has been tapped to serve as acting speaker, a temporary position, as designated by McCarthy's succession list submitted in January. He presided over the chamber briefly before calling a recess to allow Republicans and Democrats to meet privately.\n\nFlanked by his new security detail, McHenry told TIME before walking into a meeting with Republicans: \"It's a lot... But I'm doing fine.\"\n\nWith no clear path forward, many Republicans left the Capitol shortly after the vote on the motion to vacate and prepared to return to their districts for the next week. Republican lawmakers said after the meeting that the House will recess until Oct. 10, and then hold a speaker candidate forum that day before voting for a permanent speaker on Oct. 11. The decision to delay the vote by eight days irked some Republicans, including Florida Rep. Cory Mills, who said in a statement, \"What we should NOT be doing is going home or adjourning as we still have work to do.\"\n\nWith the duration of McHenry's role as acting speaker uncertain, the House is essentially in a holding pattern. The appropriations bills that Congress needs to pass before Nov. 17 to avoid a government shutdown will likely face more delays, as will the federal aid to Ukraine that President Joe Biden has requested.\n\nHouse lawmakers now find themselves in uncharted territory, with McCarthy becoming the first Speaker in U.S. history to be stripped of the gavel. \"It's incredibly unfortunate that we're in this situation,\" Rep. Pete Aguilar, chair of the House Democratic Caucus, told TIME immediately after the vote, vowing to support Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries to be the next Speaker despite not having enough votes in the Republican-led House.\n\nBut the removal of McCarthy also underscores the deep divisions within the Republican Party and raises questions about its future leadership. The House could move swiftly to elect a new Speaker, or the process could be delayed while Republicans regroup and seek a consensus candidate. In January, it took 15 rounds of voting across four days for McCarthy to gather enough support for the gavel, and a similar process could play out again if Republican hardliners push for concessions.\n\n\"If this motion carries, the House will be paralyzed,\" Rep. Tom McClintock, a California Republican, said in remarks on the House floor. \"We can expect week after week of fruitless ballots while no other business can be conducted.\"\n\nAlready, several Republicans have emerged as potential successors to McCarthy, including Reps. Scalise, Jordan, Tom Emmer of Minnesota and Kevin Hern of Oklahoma. Even former President Donald Trump's name has been floated by Texas Rep. Troy Nehls (the Speaker technically does not need to be a member of the House).\n\nScalise is currently battling blood cancer and undergoing treatment, but he told TIME on Tuesday night that he's \"feeling fine.\" Emmer, the majority whip and a close McCarthy ally, has indicated that he would back Scalise. Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz , who led the vote to topple McCarthy, has also floated Scalise's name as a potential replacement. Jordan, a Freedom Caucus co-founder who was against the idea of kicking McCarthy out of the speakership, received an endorsement from Kentucky GOP Rep. Thomas Massie on Tuesday evening.\n\nMcCarthy told reporters he might endorse someone to succeed him, but did not share who he thinks it should be. He also said that he \"hasn't thought about\" resigning from Congress despite the attacks from several members of his party.\n\nThere could be further drama in the coming days as a separate movement gathers steam: some Republicans have suggested expelling Gaetz, an idea that Newt Gingrich, the former Republican House speaker in the 1990s, supports. \"It was personal,\" McCarthy said of Gaetz's move.\n\nWhile McCarthy claimed he maintains \"optimism\" about the future, he said he had a piece of advice for the next Speaker: \"Change the rules.\"\n\nWrite to Nik Popli at nik.popli@time.com"

      "text": "What's Really Behind Kevin McCarthy's Announcement of an Impeachment Inquiry\n\nThis article is part of The D.C. Brief, TIME's politics newsletter. Sign up here to get stories like this sent to your inbox.\n\nLacking the votes to move forward with an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, House Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday made the unilateral and unusual decision to plow forward with committee-level probes into alleged influence peddling, corruption, and stonewalling.\n\nPut simply, McCarthy has triggered a process to remove Biden from power without even having sufficient votes in his own backyard to get started. Instead, he's just going to wing it and hope no one questions the legitimacy of a process that, when last launched against one of his own without an on-the-record vote, he decried as a political stunt.\n\nMcCarthy's latest cave to his far-right flank reveals three truths: his speakership is in far more peril than folks outside the Beltway understand; a minority of his caucus are continuing to dictate the terms of his agenda; and a looming spending standoff is now even more likely to result in a shutdown that could trip up the global economy more seriously than widely appreciated.\n\nBack in January, McCarthy took 15 tries to snag the speakership and he landed at the price of allowing any single member of his caucus the power to call for booting him at any given time. As such, he is constantly at the mercy of his loud and excitable fringe, and they're not exactly enthralled with the House right now. That leaves the heavy lift of funding the government up in the air with just 11 working days to go until the feds have to face a shutdown because they're out of cash.\n\nIn announcing this next step, McCarthy curiously framed the launch as necessary because he had heard allegations-not evidence-of malfeasance during Biden's days as Vice President under Barack Obama. In a nuanced way, McCarthy's pivot means lawmakers no longer have to pretend their work to ferret out alleged corruption in the Biden universe is linked to hypothetical legislation but rather expressly for the political goal of kicking the President to the curb-an effort that has never before been successful but nonetheless remains a protected option in the American system of perpetual accountability.\n\nBoth Bill Clinton and Donald Trump took full votes of the House to launch inquiries against them. This time, despite the rancor from the far right, it's not clear that there is even sufficient support among the 222 Republican House members to get off the starting line. Vulnerable Republicans and hardcore reactionaries alike reacted sourly to the announcement, meaning McCarthy's gamble may have already proven a loser even before he gets back to home base. And in the Senate, not even the most partisan conservative held any hope that this was anything more than performative acting meant to appease the party base that was promised impeachment but never guaranteed how it would end.\n\nAt its heart, the allegations against Biden are that, as Vice President, he leveraged his clout to help his son's business interests. Hill Republicans concede they don't have a smoking gun but do insist that they have enough to merit further investigation, which McCarthy's marching orders give them some cover. In continuing to ask the questions, Hill Republicans are hoping they can dig out something that retroactively justifies a whole lot of time and money spent looking for the proof that, in a criminal setting, would have been required by now to sustain such a sideshow.\n\n\"House Republicans have uncovered serious and credible allegations into President Biden's conduct,\" McCarthy said. \"Taken together, these allegations paint a picture of a culture of corruption.\"\n\nImpeachment, by its nature in the present, is a political affair. Both of Trump's impeachments were colored in the House by blinding partisanship. This inching toward an impeachment of Biden is no different. Whereas then-Speaker Nancy Pelosi famously held out as long as she could against the first impeachment of Trump, McCarthy seems eager to chuck the restraint in exchange for his flank's support.\n\nStill, that allyship may not be there. McCarthy's conservative vanguard didn't trust him at the start, had doubts about his debt-ceiling deal , and sees the looming shutdown as never far from center stage. Even still, the olive branch hasn't proven sufficient, and the Freedom Caucus is still agitating for faster and more definitive action-even without any shred of credulity that they have the votes to pass much of anything.\n\nMcCarthy's hold on the Speaker's gavel is as weak as it's ever been, but his team will tell you he's been here before and knows the shaky grip. Despite a razor-thin majority, a cranky and fractured coalition, and a dodgy relationship with his party's indicted leader off at Bedminster, N.J., McCarthy somehow has remained atop the GOP pecking order in the House. Predictions of his fall have proven, to this point, premature. His durability is one that defies history and gravity alike, but is worthy of respect. McCarthy has lasted to this point as a survivor, often despite his best efforts to fumble. Still, luck is a finite resource, and McCarthy keeps testing his. The choice to greenlight impeachment probes-and doing so without a vote-is yet another pressure test of his good fortune.\n\nMake sense of what matters in Washington. Sign up for the D.C.

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy Is Blaming Biden's Climate Policy for the Attacks in Israel\n\nI n the current line of thinking among many American conservatives, Palestinian militants' horrific attack on Israeli civilians over the weekend can be at least slightly blamed on President Joe Biden's policies. In this telling, a substantial measure of that fault has to do with the administration's attempts to address climate change , though how exactly that connection works is a bit fuzzy.\n\nThat, at least, was one takeaway from ex-House Speaker Kevin McCarthy 's (R-Calif.) comments to reporters on Monday in the bloody aftermath of the Hamas attacks on Israel. The remarks contained many of the national security jabs one might expect-the President being, in McCarthy's description, soft on Iran, weak on border security, and generally terrible at projecting U.S. strength abroad.\n\nWe'll leave the dissection of some of those criticisms to our colleagues in Washington D.C. We will also leave aside the question of any role decades of unstinting and bipartisan U.S. support for Israel may have played in perpetuating the conflict, as the Israeli Defense Forces lays siege to a Palestinian enclave of 2.2 million that Israel's prime minister has vowed to reduce to \"rubble.\" Instead, we'll focus on one of McCarthy's critical points: that Biden's green policies have come at the expense of America's national security interests and those of its allies, and-as the former speaker appeared to imply-indirectly created the conditions for the Hamas attacks.\n\n\"President Biden has said previously that he believes the number one threat America is facing is climate change. That is not true,\" McCarthy said, going on to list terrorism, border security, energy production and Iranian, Russian, and Chinese power as greater threats. \"Rather [than] focus on his Green New Deal, he should focus on protecting the American people,\" he said.\n\nBasically, McCarthy's argument seemed to be that America and its allies are safer when the U.S. produces more oil. By \"attacking\" American oil production, Biden has empowered hostile petro-states like Iran and Russia.\n\nYou can imagine U.S. environmental progressives saying to themselves, \"would that it were!\" Biden's stance on new drilling has been, in essence, a balancing act between pacifying green advocates furious over his decision in March to permit a massive new oilfield in Alaska, and the political reality that high prices at the gas pump tend to be a one-way ticket to a one-term presidency. McCarthy omitted the fact that U.S. oil production is on track to set new records this year and next, despite an urgent mandate from the world's scientists to cut fossil fuel emissions. Rather than squeezing oil production, Biden's climate strategy has hinged on creating financial incentives for green energy and manufacturing. Perhaps the biggest bitter pill Democrats had to swallow when passing last summer's Inflation Reduction Act was to allow even more oil drilling in exchange for desperately-needed green subsidies.\n\nBeyond that, there's good national security justification for cutting carbon emissions (Not to mention the imperative to help avert untold human misery around the world and potential civilization-level catastrophe). Unchecked global warming will swamp the U.S. with climate refugees, batter coastlines with mega-storms, and threaten food supplies, infrastructure, and even military bases overseas, and altogether make the world a more violent, unstable place. It's also just obviously a good move, geopolitically speaking, for the U.S. to invest in building up its capacity to manufacture batteries and wind and solar energy, rather than allowing China to corner the global market. With the costs of those technologies falling, doubling down on fossil fuels would be akin to investing in horses back when the world was transitioning to petroleum.\n\nNone of that, though, will likely dissuade conservatives from attempting to use climate action as a cudgel to batter Democrats in the lead up to next year's election. The strategy, it seems, is to paint a connection between emissions cuts and any current crisis, as if any attention the government spares for our biosphere must necessarily come at the expense of something else. But, as National Security Council Coordinator for Strategic Communications John Kirby told FOX News on Monday, with the vast resources of the federal government, not to mention a $816.7 billion defense budget, we're perfectly capable of doing more than one thing at once. \"We are a big enough, and powerful enough, and effective enough nation to be able to look after all these disparate national security threats,\" Kirby said. \"And one of them absolutely is climate change.\"\n\nWrite to Alejandro de la Garza at alejandro.delagarza@time.com"

      "text": "Lawmakers Almost Came to Physical Blows at the Capitol. Twice\n\nT he hallowed halls of the U.S. Capitol on Tuesday witnessed not one but two near-physical altercations involving lawmakers, showcasing the escalating animosity within the political landscape.\n\nThe first incident unfolded when Rep. Tim Burchett, a Tennessee Republican, accused former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy of deliberately elbowing him in the back. Burchett, one of the eight GOP members who voted to remove McCarthy from his leadership post in October, was speaking to reporters after a closed-door Republican conference meeting when the incident occurred. According to Burchett, McCarthy's blow was intentional and fueled by personal resentment.\n\n\"I was one of eight that voted him out,\" Burchett declared, labeling McCarthy a \"bully\" and emphasizing the personal nature of the attack. \"He's mean and he knows it,\" Burchett added, suggesting McCarthy's actions were inappropriate and describing the encounter as \"a little heated.\"\n\nBut McCarthy denied any deliberate physical contact, telling CNN that the hallway was tight and attributing the incident to the confined space. In an earlier interview on the network, McCarthy said he was surprised by Burchett's vote to oust him, considering the Tennessee Republican had previously supported his bid for the speakership.\n\nThe tension on Tuesday didn't stop at the House. In a separate incident at a Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions hearing, Sen. Markwayne Mullin, an Oklahoma Republican, and Teamsters President Sean O'Brien nearly came to blows. The confrontation stemmed from a series of provocative tweets exchanged between the two, culminating in a direct challenge to settle their differences physically.\n\n\"You know where to find me. Anyplace, Anytime cowboy,\" O'Brien tweeted at Mullin, leading to a heated exchange during the Senate hearing. Mullin and O'Brien exchanged taunts and challenges, with Mullin ultimately getting up from his seat, ready to confront O'Brien physically. Mullin is a former undefeated Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) fighter, and was inducted into the Oklahoma Wrestling Hall of Fame.\n\nSen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, intervened at the last minute, admonishing Mullin to sit down and preventing the situation from escalating further. \"You're a United States senator, sit down,\" Sanders ordered Mullin as he stood up to approach O'Brien. This was not the first clash between Mullin and O'Brien, as their longstanding animosity had previously spilled into public view on social media.\n\nThe two incidents on Capitol Hill underscored the deepening divisions and personal animosities within the political arena just days ahead of a potential government shutdown, raising concerns about the state of civility and decorum among elected officials. A recent poll from Pew found that positive views of many governmental and political institutions are at historic lows, with just 16% of the public saying they trust the federal government always or most of the time.\n\nWrite to Nik Popli at nik.popli@time.com"

Mr McCarthy denies it.\n\nAt a private meeting of Republican politicians on Tuesday evening after losing his job, Mr McCarthy told colleagues he did not plan to run for Speaker again.\n\nHe later took aim at his political nemesis, Mr Gaetz, accusing him of attention-seeking.\n\n\"You know it was personal,\" Mr McCarthy told a news conference, \"it had nothing to do with spending.\"\n\nHe said fundraising emails sent by Mr Gaetz amid the infighting were \"not becoming of a member of Congress\".\n\nThe hardliners who ousted him \"are not conservatives\", Mr McCarthy added.\n\nHe only became Speaker in January after a gruelling 15 rounds of voting in the chamber as Mr Gaetz and other right-wingers refused to support him.\n\nTo win over those hardliners Mr McCarthy agreed to make it possible for a single member to put forward a motion to oust him, which is exactly what Mr Gaetz ultimately did.\n\nMr McCarthy was supported by 210 Republicans but eight voted against him in Tuesday's vote, joining all Democrat members.\n\nThey were Mr Gaetz, Eli Crane, Andy Biggs, Ken Buck, Tim Burchett, Bob Good, Matt Rosendale and Nancy Mace.\n\nOne vote against Mr McCarthy that surprised many came from Ms Mace - a moderate Republican from South Carolina.\n\nShe said afterwards: \"I am looking for a Speaker who will tell the truth to the American people, who will be honest and trustworthy with Congress, with both parties.\"\n\nDemocratic House Leader Hakeem Jeffries had said in a letter to colleagues that he would not provide the votes needed to rescue Mr McCarthy.\n\nCongresswoman Pramila Jayapal, a left-wing Democrat from the north-western US state of Washington, said before the vote: \"Let them wallow in their pigsty of incompetence.\"\n\nDespite Mr McCarthy's recent efforts to help the government avoid a federal shutdown, Democrats said they viewed Mr McCarthy as untrustworthy.\n\nIn May, he backed out of a spending deal with President Joe Biden following pressure from the Republicans.\n\nSome had considered saving Mr McCarthy in return for concessions but the now former Speaker later ruled this out.\n\nDemocrats also felt betrayed by Mr McCarthy's U-turn in the days after the storming of the Capitol, when he first condemned Donald Trump's role and then backed him.\n\nThe packed chamber - which Republicans control by a 221-212 majority - was mostly silent as members awaited the result of the roll call vote.\n\n\"The office of Speaker of the House is hereby declared vacant,\" said Arkansas Republican Steve Womack with a bang of his gavel, to audible gasps.\n\nEarlier in the day the former president, Donald Trump, said on social media that the party should be \"fighting the Radical Left Democrats\" instead of each other.\n\nNorth Carolina Republican Patrick McHenry, who supported Mr McCarthy, is now the interim Speaker. He put the House in recess for a week.\n\nIt is unclear if he will have the full powers of the office, or merely administrative powers and the ability to supervise a new election.\n\nThe rules do not state how long a person could fill in as an interim, though a vote on a new Speaker is planned for 11 October.\n\nLouisiana Republican Steve Scalise and Minnesota Republican Tom Emmer have been mentioned as potential replacements for Mr McCarthy. Neither has expressed any interest in the role.\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement that President Biden is hoping the House would quickly elect a new Speaker, and noted that the \"challenges facing our nation will not wait\".\n\nThe last two Republican Speakers - Paul Ryan and John Boehner - left Congress after repeated tangles with their more conservative colleagues.\n\nThe so-called motion to vacate had only previously been used twice in the past century to remove a Speaker - in 2015 and 2010 - though never successfully.\n\n(With additional reporting from Kayla Epstein and Max Matza)\n\nSign up for our morning newsletter and get BBC News in your inbox.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "After Kevin McCarthy's ousting, who might replace him as US House Speaker?\n\nThe US House of Representatives is looking for its next Speaker after Republican Kevin McCarthy was ousted in a right-wing revolt from within his own party.\n\nTwo leading contenders have emerged but, with Republicans in tumult, it is not clear who will take up the gavel, or when.\n\nRepublicans control the lower chamber of Congress with a very narrow majority.\n\nSo when eight rebels joined the Democrats last week, McCarthy's fate was sealed in a 216-210 vote. It was the first time a House Speaker, one of the top jobs in US politics, has been removed in this way.\n\nThe rebellion was led by Florida congressman Matt Gaetz after Mr McCarthy relied on Democratic votes to get a short-term spending deal passed and narrowly averted a government shutdown.\n\nMr Gaetz accused him of making a \"secret side deal\" that weekend with President Biden on Ukraine aid.\n\nBut really this was the final act in a bitter saga that has been simmering all year between the Speaker and a right-wing faction in his party.\n\nThose lawmakers tried to block his election to the post in January, saying he could not be trusted to enact conservative priorities.\n\nIn their view, he proved that by striking a deal with Democrats in June to raise the debt ceiling without deep spending cuts.\n\nNow they are the ones being accused of treachery - some Republicans are openly talking about expelling Mr Gaetz.\n\nNo Democrat voted to save Mr McCarthy, with the party saying he had broken promises to them, as well.\n\nOn a temporary basis, Patrick McHenry of North Carolina - a close ally of Mr McCarthy - was appointed as the interim Speaker.\n\nHe does not have the power to run the chamber but \"may exercise such authorities of the office of speaker as may be necessary and appropriate pending the election of a Speaker\", according to House rules.\n\nThat would appear to rule out bringing legislation to the floor.\n\nIn the coming days, Republicans will debate among themselves who should become the full-time Speaker.\n\nThere will be a candidate forum on Tuesday, followed by a possible vote on Wednesday or Thursday.\n\nIn January, it took Mr McCarthy 15 votes over four days to finally be elected.\n\nGiven the bad blood over his removal, and the unresolved disputes between moderate Republicans and the party's right-wingers, whoever takes over will face a steep challenge of uniting warring factions.\n\nTwo top names have emerged: Steve Scalise and Jim Jordan.\n\nMr Scalise, from Louisiana, is Mr McCarthy's former deputy.\n\nMr Jordan of Ohio is a conservative rebel turned party insider.\n\nA third man, Kevin Hern, has stepped aside after initially indicating interest.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump has stoked speculation that he would take up the job on a short-term basis if Republicans needed more time to decide - though the party's own leadership regulations technically bar him from doing so.\n\nMr McCarthy had initially ruled out running again, but has since said he will do \"whatever the conference wants\".\n\nThe Speaker runs the chamber and is second in line for the presidency. For nearly a week there has been a vacuum at the top of US government that could persist if Republicans do not decide soon.\n\nThere are also important issues the House needs to address in the coming weeks - agreeing an annual budget to avoid a shutdown, deciding on aid to Ukraine and how to proceed with the impeachment inquiry of Joe Biden. With Israel now at war after a shock attack by Hamas, the House could also need to approve an aid package for the major US ally.\n\nA deeper, more long-lasting consequence is a reputational one.\n\nPolling suggests that confidence in government has been falling among Americans for some time.\n\nThis chaos may harden that feeling further and add to a sense that the US political system just isn't working.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

It boiled over at the weekend when he struck a deal with Democrats to fund government agencies.\n\nWhat happens next is uncertain. Patrick McHenry is the interim Speaker, and the House will need to figure out who gets the permanent gig.\n\nFor the moment, McCarthy says he has no plans to seek the Speaker's gavel again and refused to confirm at an evening news conference that he will even remain a congressman.\n\nFor a recap of what happened today, you can read this article .\n\nAnd if you want to delve into the feud that started this situation, you can watch this video .\n\nOur writers today have been Kayla Epstein, Mike Wendling, Gabriela Pomeroy, Lisa Lambert, Ali Abbas Ahmadi, Emily Atkinson, Marita Moloney and Max Matza.\n\nThis page was edited by Marianna Brady, Matt Murphy and myself.\n\nThanks for joining us.\n\nThe House Radio-TV Gallery, which handles media relations for the lower chamber of the US Congress, has just told reporters that lawmakers have been advised no further votes are expected for the rest of the week.\n\nKayla Epstein US reporter\n\nMcCarthy just held a press conference hours after he was ousted as Speaker.\n\nHe attempted some gallows humor, quipping: âI made history, didnât I?â\n\nThe California Republican confirmed publicly that he would not run for Speaker again and reaffirmed his commitment to US support for Ukraine, which some far-right members of his caucus have begun to question.\n\nMcCarthy also had harsh words for the Republicans who ousted him.\n\nâIâm not quite sure those individuals are looking to be productive,â he said.\n\nHe also added: âI want to be a Republican and conservative that governs.â\n\nFinally, he reflected on the impact that his turbulent run as Speaker had on his family.\n\n\"My poor mom,\" he said. \"I think this job is always harder on your loved ones.\"\n\nAnd in departing words to the media, he semi-joked: \"You probably won't cover me as much. I probably won't miss you, but see you soon!\"\n\nAsked repeatedly about rumours of tense exchanges with other lawmakers in the past few days, McCarthy jokes: \"Wait till my book.\"\n\nThe quip triggered laughter among journalists in the room.\n\nHe also hinted that much has been left unsaid about his tenure as leader.\n\n\"I bite my lip. I let people say things that are not true, but it's not right,\" he says.\n\nHe jokes that his Italian mother is upset because she reads what the reporters write.\n\nSpeaking to reporters, McCarthy continues criticising his Florida colleague, Matt Gaetz, and the seven other rebellious Republicans.\n\nFundraising emails Gaetz sent amid the infighting were \"not becoming of a member of Congress\", he says.\n\nBut he quickly adds: \"I'm not going to blame anyone. There's no blame there.\"\n\nMcCarthy goes on to say the group that ousted him \"are not conservatives\".\n\nAsked if he will remain a lawmaker after the day's embarrassment, he responds: \"I will look at that.\"\n\n\"I'm a Republican. I win by Republicans, I lose by them,\" says McCarthy.\n\nâYou know it was personal, it had nothing to do with spending,â says McCarthy in a press conference at the Capitol, in a swipe at Gaetz.\n\nIt was about âgetting attentionâ.\n\nSam Cabral Reporting from Capitol Hill\n\nThe BBC asked Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, if he was concerned about potential disruptions following McCarthy's ousting.\n\nâYeah. It\ntook a week in January when we did it, and I mean itâs enormously disruptive of\nour proceedings,\" Raskin replied.\n\nâThe chaos\non the Republican side led to everybodyâs schedule being overthrown for the next\ntwo weeks,\" he continued, explaining that members were supposed to have returned to their districts to meet constituents.\n\n\"All of that\ngot thrown out the window so we could watch some of the worst political rhetoric I've seen in Congress since I've got here, on the floor of the House,\" he said.\n\nPunchbowl News reports , external that McCarthy won't attempt a comeback bid for Speaker. CNN just confirmed this reporting.\n\nHe is expected to make the announcement in a closed-door meeting with the Republican rank-and-file that's going on right now.\n\nOur reporter, Sam Cabral, saw pizza being wheeled into the conference a short while ago, usually a sign of a long night ahead on Capitol Hill!\n\nHouse Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the chamber's top Democrat.\n\nHakeem Jeffries, leader of the Democratic minority in the House, has issued a statement appearing to invite Republican co-operation.\n\n\"It is our hope that traditional Republicans will walk away from Maga  extremism and join us in partnership for the good of the country,â he said, referring to Donald Trump's \"Make America Great Again\" agenda.\n\nHouse Republicans are holding a closed-door meeting at 18:30 ET (right now), CBS News reports. It's unclear what they'll announce publicly afterward.\n\nThe House is currently in recess and there will be no more floor votes or action tonight.\n\nHouse Democrats are not caucusing tonight. They meet tomorrow at 09:00 ET (14:00 BST).\n\nKayla Epstein US reporter\n\nWhite House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre has issued a statement on McCarthy's ouster.\n\n\"President Biden has\ndemonstrated that he is always eager to work with both parties in\nCongress in good faith on behalf of the American people. Because the\nurgent challenges facing our nation will not wait, he hopes the House will\nquickly elect a Speaker,\" she said.\n\n\"Once the House has met their\nresponsibility to elect a Speaker, he looks forward to working together with\nthem and with the Senate to address the American peoplesâ priorities.\"\n\nRep Tim Burchett of Tennessee spoke to reporters after Kevin McCarthy was ousted as Speaker, and he offered some insight into why he voted to get rid of his fellow Republican.\n\nBurchett mentioned an interview he did with CNN last night where he mentioned he would be praying about his decision.\n\nThen this morning, McCarthy called him with what Burchett described as an \"air of desperation\".\n\n\"And then the first thing out of his mouth was very condescending\" about his religious beliefs, Burchett said.\n\nBurchett said that tone \"answered my question\" of which way to vote.\n\nSam Cabral Reporting from Capitol Hill\n\nNot one single Democrat voted to\nsave McCarthy, as some had speculated they might. Their unified opposition\nspelled the former Speaker's doom as eight Republicans defected.\n\nJamie Raskin, the top Democrat on\nthe powerful Oversight committee, told reporters \"it was one of the\nclearest choices we faced\".\n\n\"This was completely organic\nand grassroots,\" he said. \"I did not hear a single member... voice\nany inclination to have us vote for Kevin McCarthy for Speaker.\"\n\nThey remained unified under their\nown party leader, Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nJeffries likely won't be Speaker\nwhile the Republican party remains in the majority in the House, but would\ntheoretically ascend to the speakership if Democrats retake the chamber in the\nnext election.\n\nSam Cabral Reporting from Capitol Hill\n\nSouth Carolina's Nancy Mace surprised some political watchers today when she voted to oust McCarthy.\n\nSpeaking with reporters, the Republican explained she was frustrated her work on federal rape kit legislation could not proceed amid the legislative chaos of this session.\n\nMace said she\nwas angry âas a fiscal conservative, I'm angry as a woman. I am deeply\nfrustrated\".\n\nâThat is the\nconsequence of that behaviour,\" she said. \"And I want the American people to trust the\nSpeaker. When the Speaker makes a promise to either side of the aisle, they\nought to keep it.\"\n\n\"The House\nwas going to be in chaos if this did not happen,\" Mace continued. \"I am looking for a Speaker who\nwill tell the truth to the American people who will be honest and trustworthy\nwith Congress, with both parties.\"\n\nAnthony Zurcher BBC North America correspondent\n\nAt the beginning of the year, Kevin McCarthy made modern congressional\nhistory by taking four days and 15 ballots to be elected speaker of the\nhouse.\n\nNine months later, he made history again by being the first house\nspeaker removed by a House vote.\n\nThe last time such a vote was even held was in back in 1910, and that\nwas a manoeuvre by a powerful House Speaker to demonstrate his strength to his\npolitical opponents.\n\nTodayâs vote has demonstrated McCarthyâs political weakness â and the\ndivisions among House Republicans that have made it difficult for the party to\ngovern effectively.\n\nHouse Speakers used\nto be able to run their chamber with an iron fist, with a range of ways to reward\nloyalty and punish dissent.\n\nIn this House, at least, that is no longer the\ncase. The rebels rule the roost.\n\nThis video can not be played\n\nGaetz: Republicans experiencing 'stages of grief'\n\n\"The stages of grief I think are in progress with some of my colleagues,\" Matt Gaetz told reporters shortly after winning his bid to oust McCarthy.\n\n\"I think there was a stage of denial... and now we appear to be headed toward bargaining.\"\n\nHe endorsed the House GOP's second in command, Steve Scalise, for Speaker.\n\nScalise, however, recently announced he is undergoing treatment for a rare blood cancer and had publicly backed McCarthy.\n\nSam Cabral Reporting from Capitol Hill\n\nTwo Democratic lawmakers got into the elevator as I was leaving the vote.\n\nâLet the civil war begin,â said one.\n\nThe other laughed heartily.\n\nMeanwhile, Matt Gaetz, the leader of this coup against McCarthy, was swarmed by reporters as he left the Capitol.\n\nKayla Epstein US reporter\n\nRep Patrick McHenry becomes Speaker pro tempe with McCarthy's removal\n\n\"The office of speaker of the United States House of Representatives is hereby declared to be vacant,\" Rep Steve Womack, an Arkansas Republican, declared with the bang of his gavel.\n\nThis moment is unprecedented in modern US history. The House is now in uncharted waters, but some procedure guides what happens next.\n\nPatrick McHenry of North Carolina, who supported Mr McCarthy, is now the Speaker pro tempore, basically the interim Speaker. He just called the House into recess.\n\nIt is unclear if the temporary Speaker will have the full powers of the office, or merely have administrative powers and the ability to oversee a new election.\n\nThe rules do not state how long a person could fill in as an interim Speaker or when a new election would be held.\n\nThe House will likely be thrown into chaos until another Speaker is chosen. Given the hostile divisions within the Republican caucus, that process could prove as messy as McCarthy's own battle.\n\nThis video can not be played\n\nWatch: The moment McCarthy is removed as House speaker\n\nSo, it's been decided. Speaker Kevin McCarthy has been told to go.\n\nHere's a look at how the vote unfolded:\n\nThere will be plenty of reaction to come, so stick with us as we bring you the all the latest.\n\nCopyright Â© 2025 BBC.

Mr McCarthy later told reporters the physical contact was accidental.\n\n\"If I would hit somebody, they would know I hit them,\" the Californian congressman told reporters.\n\nBut in his ethics complaint, Mr Gaetz said Mr Burchett described the assault as a \"sucker punch\" and a \"clean shot to the kidney\".\n\nThe ultra-conservative argued in a letter that the incident deserved \"immediate and swift investigation by the Ethics Committee\".\n\n\"This Congress has seen a substantial increase in breaches of decorum unlike anything we have seen since the pre-Civil War era,\" he wrote in the complaint.\n\n\"The rot starts at the top,\" he added.\n\nWhen informed of Mr Gaetz's complaint, Mr McCarthy replied \"oh, good,\" before adding that \"Ethics is a good place for Gaetz to be\".\n\nMr Gaetz is himself the subject of an ongoing ethics investigation into allegations of sexual misconduct.\n\nThe Republican Party has been consumed by chaos for nearly two months, after eight right-wing Republicans - including Mr Burchett - voted to oust Mr McCarthy from his post.\n\nAccording to Mr Burchett, Tuesday's run-in was the first time he had spoken to Mr McCarthy since voting against him last month.\n\nRecounting the incident to reporters, Mr Burchett said he ran after the former Speaker.\n\n\"As he [Representative McCarthy] always did, he just denies it or blames somebody else,\" Mr Burchett said.\n\nHe said he would not be pressing charges.\n\n\"It's over as far as I'm concerned,\" he said. \"I pray for him and hope he finds some happiness in his life.\"\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy announces retirement from Congress\n\nFormer US House Speaker Kevin McCarthy has said he will be retiring from Congress at the end of December.\n\nMr McCarthy, 58, made the announcement on Wednesday in an opinion piece in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nIn it, he said he has \"decided to depart the House at the end of this year to serve America in new ways\".\n\nMr McCarthy, a Republican, was ousted from his role as Speaker in October in a revolt by some members of his party.\n\nHis election as Speaker in January was equally tumultuous, with 15 rounds of votes necessary before he secured enough support for the role.\n\nIn his opinion piece, Mr McCarthy wrote that despite leaving Congress, he will continue to help recruit the \"best and brightest\" to run for elected office.\n\n\"The Republican Party is expanding every day, and I am committed to lending my experience to support the next generation of leaders,\" he wrote.\n\nThe California lawmaker's decision to retire brings an end to his 16-year career in the House, in which he quickly rose through the ranks of Republican leadership, serving as Majority Whip, Majority Leader and then Speaker.\n\nHis last year in office was rocked by fractures within his own party, where some members disagreed with him striking a deal with Senate Democrats to fund government agencies and avoid a shutdown.\n\nMr McCarthy was ousted from the Speaker role through a rarely-used procedural tool known as a motion to vacate, filed by Florida Republican Matt Gaetz.\n\nMr Gaetz accused Mr McCarthy of cutting a \"secret side deal\" with Democrats to continue funding Ukraine's defence against Russia, which some Republicans say the US cannot afford.\n\nMr McCarthy denied this accusation. Still, he was ousted in a narrow vote of 216 to 210.\n\nHe wrote in the Wall Street Journal that he remains an \"optimist\".\n\n\"How could I not be? I'm the son of a firefighter. For 17 years I've served in the same congressional seat - the same office in which I was once denied an internship. Only in America,\" he said.\n\nMr McCarthy represented a district that covers much of California's Central Valley.\n\nHis departure means California Governor Gavin Newsom will soon have to call a special election to fill the seat.\n\nWho ends up replacing Mr McCarthy will have implications for the narrow Republican majority in the House.\n\nMr McCarthy's announcement comes after another House Republican, Patrick T McHenry, said that he will retire at the end of his term.\n\nAfter last week's ouster of New York Republican George Santos, the party now holds 221 seats in the lower chamber of Congress. It needs 218 seats or more to retain control of the House.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Why do Kevin McCarthy's Republicans want to impeach Joe Biden now?\n\nSpeaker of the House Kevin McCarthy has announced a formal impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden.\n\nAfter weeks of hints and veiled suggestions, the California Republican took the plunge in a brief statement to the press that there were \"serious and credible allegations into President Biden's conduct\" that \"taken together\" necessitated further investigation.\n\nImpeachment by the House of Representatives is the first step in a formal process to remove a president - or other senior executive or judicial official - from office. It requires a simple majority vote in the chamber to trigger a trial in the US Senate, where a two-thirds majority is necessary for conviction and removal.\n\nPresident Donald Trump was impeached twice when Democrats controlled the House - over Ukraine in 2019 and the January 6 Capitol riot in 2021 - but was acquitted by the Senate on both occasions.\n\nIn his announcement to reporters at the US Capitol, Mr McCarthy ticked through a series of accusations against the president and the president's son, Hunter Biden.\n\nHe accused the president of lying about knowledge of his son's business dealings and said that \"Biden family members\" had received millions of dollars in payments from shell companies and that transactions had been flagged as questionable by the US Treasury Department. He noted that an FBI informant had passed along an allegation that Mr Biden had taken a bribe in exchange for official actions as vice-president, and that he had used his government office to coordinate with his son's business partners.\n\nMr McCarthy also alleged that the Biden administration had given the president's family and associates special treatment during its investigations into possible criminal violations.\n\nRepublicans have not found concrete evidence of misconduct by the president, however.\n\nThe speaker's action came approximately two months after a House committee heard testimony from two Internal Revenue Service officials who claimed Mr Biden's Justice Department prevented a more thorough investigation of the president's involvement in Hunter Biden's personal finances.\n\nIn late July, Republican Senator Chuck Grassley released a Federal Bureau of Investigation document detailing how a trusted intelligence source had passed along allegations that the Biden family had received two $5 million payments from a Ukrainian energy company after then Vice-President Biden pressured Ukraine to remove a senior government official in charge of investigating corruption.\n\nNeither the IRS investigators nor the FBI document provided conclusive evidence of illegal or improper conduct by the president, but Republicans in the House asserted that the information was enough to trigger a formal impeachment inquiry.\n\nMr McCarthy said that impeachment proceedings would give House Republicans \"the full power to gather all the facts and answers for the American public\".  Courts have traditionally given congressional committees more sweeping authority to issue and enforce subpoenas for documents and testimony when those orders are issued as part of an impeachment inquiry.\n\nIn July, Mr McCarthy drew parallels with the administration of Richard Nixon, who was the target of a congressional inquiry in 1974 but resigned before he was formally impeached.\n\n\"We're watching this administration use government much like Richard Nixon by denying us to get the information that we need,\" he said.\n\nIn the past, the House speaker had been reluctant to endorse calls from some Republicans in his chamber to initiate impeachment proceedings, saying that it was too soon to follow that course of action. He was under increasing pressure from right-wing members of his party to move more quickly, however. And with only a narrow Republican majority in the House of Representatives and tough votes on government spending looming in the coming weeks, Mr McCarthy changed course.\n\nBut even that many not be enough to satisfy the speaker's conservative critics. Shortly after Mr McCarthy's impeachment announcement, Congressman Matt Gaetz of Florida took to the floor of the House of Representatives to express his disappointment.\n\n\"This is a baby step following weeks of pressure from House conservatives to do more,\" he said. \"We must move faster.\"\n\nThe ultimate success of an impeachment resolution in the House is very much in doubt. Republicans hold a narrow majority in the chamber and some centrists in the party, contemplating challenging re-election races in November 2024, have expressed unease with moving forward with a process that will only enflame political divisions in America.\n\nThe Biden team was quick to push back against Mr McCarthy's impeachment announcement.\n\n\"House Republicans have been investigating the President for nine months, and they've turned up no evidence of wrongdoing,\" White House spokesperson Ian Sams wrote in a social media post.\n\nOnly three US presidents have been impeached - Andrew Johnson in 1868, Bill Clinton in 1998 and Donald Trump twice. None was convicted by the Senate.\n\nDemocrats currently have a 51-49 majority in the Senate, virtually ensuring that any Biden impeachment referral from the House will meet a similar fate.\n\nThe former US president says his successor has \"done so much damage and so much destruction\" in his first days in office.\n\nThe ex-president uses the speech to criticise the Trump administration's cuts to the welfare agency.\n\nThe US president apportioned blame to Ukraine's leader hours after the deadliest strike on civilians this year.\n\nThe US president also confirmed he was revoking the security clearance of Joe Biden and \"any other member\" of the Biden family.\n\nPresident Trump claims \"many\" of Biden's pardons are void because they were signed automatically and not by hand.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

It was a fight he picked - and one he won.\n\nFor the past couple of days, it looked like the sharp-tongued Mr Gaetz - from the other Hollywood, in Florida - had enough votes to get his coup under way.\n\nBut at times on Tuesday, it came across as the right-wing rebel versus the rest of his party.\n\nAn hour or so before the first vote to ever successfully remove a sitting Speaker, as other members observed recess, Mr Gaetz sat alone in the House chamber, with the occasional Democrat stopping for a chat.\n\nWhen voting began and members of Congress streamed in, the contrast on either side striking.\n\nDemocrats gathered in animated conversation and laughter, as relaxed as if they were at a cocktail party.\n\nAt their caucus meeting earlier on Tuesday, they had agreed to oppose Mr McCarthy in unison and present their own leader, Hakeem Jeffries, as the best choice for Speaker.\n\nLeaving that meeting room, member after member told us they considered the Republican Speaker from California to be unprincipled, untrustworthy and undeserving of being rescued.\n\nWith their efforts to cajole Democratic votes in support of Mr McCarthy achieving zero success, the Republicans appeared largely dejected.\n\nMany sat quietly as they waited for the vote to begin.\n\nMeanwhile, Mr Gaetz sat at the back of the room with fellow defectors like Eli Crane and Tim Burchett, as well as others who had not yet agreed to back him.\n\nWhen Mr McCarthy walked on to the floor, he made every effort to appear nonplussed by it all. He huddled with allies, pulling playfully at one's tie, and then sat back in his seat with his legs crossed.\n\nVotes in the House can be rather lengthy and boring. Debates ahead of these roll calls are typically humdrum and occur before a barely full chamber.\n\nThat was not the case on Tuesday. The House was nearly full, with less than 10 absences in total, while the galleries above were packed with visitors.\n\nThe debate, too, was lively.\n\nMr Gaetz did most of the talking, backed up by only two others.\n\nWhen he said he did not want to be lectured by colleagues whom he accused of being beholden to special interests, one Republican retorted from the back: \"You're no martyr.\"\n\nAt various points, others groaned and laughed at Mr Gaetz's comments.\n\nAs each member's vote was recorded by a verbal roll call, Mr McCarthy seemed to know his fate was sealed.\n\nWhen the eighth Republican vote against him came in, he was staring straight ahead with little expression on his face.\n\nMr Gaetz pointedly walked over to where House Democrats exit the chamber and left among them.\n\nTwo Democrats hopped into the lift with me as the Capitol building emptied.\n\n\"Let the civil war begin,\" said one.\n\nThe other laughed.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

On Tuesday, the US House of Representatives voted 216-210 to oust Mr McCarthy , with all Democrats voting against him along with eight Republicans who turned their backs on their leader.\n\nThe vote kicks off another potentially chaotic process to appoint the next Speaker.\n\nThe Speaker of the House is an immensely powerful role that allows for near-total control over the chamber's functions.\n\nHere's what you need to know about one of the most important jobs in American politics.\n\nThe US Constitution established the role of Speaker of the House, which oversees the lower chamber of Congress. The Speaker is both traditionally and historically a sitting member of the majority party, though this is not a constitutional requirement.\n\nTherefore, in addition to leading the House of Representatives, they are also leader of the majority party in the chamber.\n\nAt a practical level, the Speaker sets the House's legislative agenda, controls committee assignments, sets the vote and work calendar, and is responsible for keeping their party members unified behind major initiatives.\n\nWielded effectively, the position of Speaker of the House is one of the most powerful in Washington. Depending on the partisan makeup of Congress, they can make or break a US president's agenda, stymie opposition, and spearhead their party's biggest legislative initiatives.\n\nA shrewd and effective Speaker will be able to marshal their members behind their party's agenda, and control rebellious lawmakers by doling out incentives or punishments.\n\nFormer House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat who stepped down from the position when Republicans took control of the House on 3 January 2023, was regarded as one of the most effective modern Speakers of the House.\n\nThough the Democratic caucus she oversaw contained multiple factions, including progressives, moderates, and more conservative-leaning Democrats, she was able to use the tools available to the Speaker to keep a united front when it came to most major votes.\n\nThe House of Representatives functions on a two-year cycle, known as a \"session.\" The new Congress began on 3 January 2023 and Republicans will be in the majority.\n\nThe very first thing a new session of the House of Representatives must do is vote for a Speaker of the House. Without that person in place, the chamber cannot move on to any other function, including swearing-in members. The chamber must continue to hold votes until a Speaker is elected.\n\nThe vote for Speaker requires a candidate to receive the support of a majority of the House - 218 votes. The existing leader of the majority party is usually presumed to be the person to assume the speakership.\n\nFor the party in the minority, the head of their caucus is known simply as the \"minority leader\".\n\nThey do not have control over the House's functions like the Speaker does, but instead wield power within their caucus to keep lawmakers unified in opposition to the majority or advance bipartisan efforts.\n\nIn the 118th Congress, the Democrats are in the minority. Representative Hakeem Jeffries of New York was selected as the Democratic minority leader.\n\nThe drag performer had part of her leg amputated on Thursday after a \"severe infection\", her family says.\n\nJens-Frederick Nielsen says the island must \"stand together\" with Denmark during a highly symbolic visit to Copenhagen.\n\nOne hundred days into Trump's second term, Democrats are still reckoning with an election loss and debating the fate of the party\n\nFive Trump supporters say his first 100 days have met their expectations - with a few surprises and some warning signs.\n\nA federal judge said there was \"strong suspicion\" the Louisiana-born girl had been sent to Honduras with her mother and sister.\n\nCopyright 2025 BBC.

      "text": "Rep. Matt Gaetz triggers vote to oust Kevin McCarthy from speaker's office\n\nWASHINGTON - Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., the Donald Trump ally and conservative bomb-thrower who has been a nagging thorn in leadership's side, filed a resolution Monday to force a vote to overthrow his political nemesis, Kevin McCarthy, as speaker of the House.\n\nThe House must now vote on whether to keep McCarthy on as speaker. It has until Wednesday.\n\nSpeaking to reporters on the steps of the Capitol, a beaming Gaetz predicted he has the votes to oust McCarthy - as long as Democrats don't move to save the speaker .\n\n\"I have enough Republicans where, at this point next week, one of two things will happen: Kevin McCarthy won't be the speaker of the house, or he'll be the speaker of the House working at the pleasure of the Democrats. And I'm at peace with either result, because the American people deserve to know who governs them,\" Gaetz said.\n\nDuring the past two weeks, Gaetz had issued a specific warning to McCarthy, saying he would try to oust him as speaker if he brought a short-term government funding bill to the floor that passed with help from Democrats.\n\nTrue to his word, Gaetz made the motion to vacate Monday, just two days after McCarthy put a so-called clean continuing resolution, or CR, on the floor to avert a government shutdown, passing it with 209 Democratic votes and 125 Republican votes.\n\nThe House floor is normally loud and boisterous. But it was absolutely quiet as Gaetz stood up, buttoned his jacket, approached the well of the House and addressed the chamber Monday evening to announce the motion.\n\nAsked by Rep. Jake Ellzey, R-Texas, who was presiding at the time, what his resolution was about, Gaetz replied: \"Declaring the office of speaker of the House of Representatives to be vacant.\"\n\nWhen he finished after about a minute, there was no reaction from the gathered Democrats or the Republicans as he walked away up the aisle.\n\nMore from NBC News:\n\nIf all 212 Democrats voted to remove McCarthy, Gaetz would need just four other Republicans to oust him. A handful of conservatives, including Bob Good, R-Va., Eli Crane, R-Ariz., and Andy Biggs, R-Ariz., said they would join Gaetz's effort.\n\nOther conservatives, like Rep. Wesley Hunt, R-Texas, said they were keeping an \"open mind,\" while Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., said that he was torn by the decision and that most of his constituents \"are saying vacate.\"\n\n\"Well, it's between two things for me. It's between voting against my friend, Kevin McCarthy, and voting my conscience,\" Burchett said. \"And that's kind of where I'm at.\"\n\nAfter he dropped the resolution, Gaetz said he hasn't cut a deal with Democrats to get rid of McCarthy, even though he has spoken to many of them privately.\n\n\"I have made no deal with Democrats, because I believe that Democrats should vote against Kevin McCarthy for free. It's Kevin McCarthy who's out there offering deals to Democrats,\" Gaetz told reporters. \"I'm not offering anything, and I won't offer anything. ... When we stand here a week from now, I won't own Kevin McCarthy anymore; he won't belong to me. So if the Democrats want to adopt him, they can adopt him.\"\n\nDefiant, McCarthy and his allies have lashed out at Gaetz, accusing him of seeking the limelight and holding a personal vendetta against McCarthy. They vowed to beat back Gaetz's efforts, and McCarthy has denied having any deal with Democrats to support him.\n\n\"So be it; bring it on,\" McCarthy said Sunday on CBS News' \"Face the Nation.\" \"I'll survive.\"\n\nJust minutes after Gaetz filed the motion, McCarthy repeated those remarks on X: \"Bring it on.\"\n\nAsked to react to Gaetz's move, a GOP House member pulled out his phone and showed NBC News a fundraising pitch by Gaetz.\n\nSaid a McCarthy ally, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Jason Smith, R-Mo. \"The only way that the motion to vacate can be successful is if 200-plus Democrats join with him, because 200-plus Republicans are adamantly opposed to his motion to vacate.\"\n\nProgressive Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., and Gaetz \"are on the same page,\" he said.\n\nGaetz's action comes after months of public tangling with McCarthy, who he says failed to live up to promises he made to conservatives during the speaker's fight in January to significantly cut spending. In fact, it was Gaetz who led a band of 20 conservative rebels to oppose McCarthy for the speaker job, leading to 15 grueling rounds of voting before McCarthy finally triumphed .\n\nBy filing a so-called motion to vacate, Gaetz has triggered a future floor vote over removing McCarthy as speaker, though it's unclear exactly when that vote might happen. McCarthy allies almost certainly will try to delay or thwart a vote by \"tabling\" the motion and referring it to a committee, but that might not work.\n\nGaetz's resolution \"declaring the Office of Speaker vacant\" is privileged, meaning it takes precedence over other House business. Under House rules, privileged matters must be considered within two legislative days.\n\nWhile he conceded he might not remove McCarthy on the first try, Gaetz vowed to keep filing resolutions, perhaps daily, to oust him. Every vote will weaken McCarthy, he predicted.\n\n\"This first vote will be my floor, not my ceiling,\" Gaetz said. \"And I think that as we have more votes later, numbers will likely grow.\"\n\nConservative Rep. Thomas Massie, R-Ky., said moments after Gaetz filed the motion that he thought it was a \"bad idea,\" though he said Gaetz \"probably does\" have at least five votes to remove McCarthy.\n\n\"I don't support the motion to vacate,\" he said, noting that he's a rare Republican who filed the motion to overthrow Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, in 2015. Massie said Gaetz has fewer grievances against McCarthy.\n\n\"We're going to find out by the end of the week if this is sustainable,\" he said.\n\nGaetz's motion puts House Democrats in a political pickle given the GOP's razor-thin 221-212 majority. Democrats will have to decide whether to vote with McCarthy foes to topple him or side with McCarthy allies to bail him out.\n\nBut there has been little goodwill between Democrats and McCarthy, who criticized and then defended Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, attack on the Capitol, reneged on a debt and budget deal with President Joe Biden and recently launched an impeachment inquiry into Biden.\n\nAfter Gaetz filed the motion, Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Va., said he's a \"hard no\" on rescuing McCarthy and encouraged colleagues to follow suit.\n\n\"Democrats should think long and hard about this. There is absolutely no upside to preserving Kevin McCarthy in the speakership. It's an unstable speakership,\" Connolly said. \"Upon examination, I do not understand what any Democrat would find of redeeming value to allow him to persist in the speakership. We should not enable, aid or abet his continuation in office.\"\n\nRep. Norma Torres, D-Calif., was more direct: \"It's not my problem to save his a--.\"\n\nRep. Garret Graves, R-La., a McCarthy ally, dismissed Gaetz's \"theatrics\" as a distraction from the process of funding the government, predicting Democrats will reject Gaetz's plan.\n\n\"I think that there are a number of people that care about the institution and see through - very much see through what this is,\" Graves said. \"And so I fully expect that you would have Republicans and Democrats simply do what's right.\"\n\n- Rebecca Kaplan and Kyle Stewart contributed.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "House Speaker McCarthy defends leadership, says Gaetz has 'personal' issues\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy on Tuesday lashed out at Rep. Matt Gaetz , saying that the fellow Republican lawmaker who is seeking to oust him has \"personal things in his life that he has challenges with.\"\n\nMcCarthy's jab on CNBC's \" Squawk Box \" came less than two hours before he told the Republican caucus that he would bring Gaetz's motion to vacate his speakership to the House floor Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIn February, the Department of Justice ended a two-year criminal sex trafficking investigation of Gaetz without filing charges against the Florida congressman.\n\nMcCarthy on Tuesday accused Gaetz of targeting him because of a House ethics investigation into Gaetz's conduct that was also the subject of the criminal probe.\n\n\"He's blaming me for an ethics complaint against him that happened in the last Congress,\" McCarthy said. \"I have nothing to do with it.\"\n\n\"He wants me to try to wipe that away,\" McCarthy said.\n\n\"I'm not going to do that. That's illegal,\" the California lawmaker said.\n\n\"And you know what? If some way I lose my job because I uphold the law [and the] continuity of government, so be it.\"\n\nAsked for comment, a spokesman for Gaetz referred CNBC to remarks the congressman made about McCarthy on Monday.\n\n\"For some people, policy failures are recast as personal because their own failures are personally embarrassing to them,\" Gaetz had said.\n\nGaetz on Monday night filed a resolution that seeks to remove McCarthy as speaker.\n\nGaetz's move came two days after McCarthy, with Democratic support, passed a stopgap funding bill in the House that avoided a government shutdown.\n\nMcCarthy won the gavel in January after 14 failed votes and overcoming opposition from a conservative bloc led by Gaetz.\n\nTo win on the 15th ballot, McCarthy granted concessions to Gaetz's clique, which included allowing any individual lawmaker to file a motion to vacate.\n\n\"Matt Gaetz had planned to do this from the very beginning,\" McCarthy said Tuesday on \"Squawk Box.\"\n\n\"He has personal things in his life that he has challenges with. That's fine,\" McCarthy said. But \"this is just confusing in the process\" of keeping the government funded beyond the next few weeks, he said.\n\nThe House Ethics Committee, which is led by Republicans, in July reopened an investigation into allegations against Gaetz, including sexual misconduct and drug use, CNN reported that month.\n\nMcCarthy's effort to keep his speaker position comes as congressional leaders work to craft a bill to fund the government before it expires.\n\nThe short-term funding bill that President Joe Biden signed Saturday night after it passed Congress with overwhelming bipartisan support will keep the government open for just 45 days.\n\nGaetz warned McCarthy in recent weeks that he would move to oust him if the speaker worked with Democrats to pass a stopgap funding bill.\n\nBecause Republicans hold just a narrow majority in the House, McCarthy can only afford to lose a handful of GOP votes if no Democrats in the House back him over a challenger promoted by Gaetz and his fellow hard-liners.\n\nDemocrats are weighing their options.\n\nGot a confidential news tip?

      "text": "What's Next After McCarthy's Upcoming Departure From Congress\n\nFollowing the Dec. 6 announcement by former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) that he'll leave Congress early at the end of the year, questions have arisen about what's next for the lawmaker and his vacated seat.\n\nThe California lawmaker had been expected to make an announcement soon about his political future as the filing deadline for the next election is fast approaching. However, the decision by Mr. McCarthy was especially weighty, given the already extremely thin Republican majority in the House.\n\nMr. McCarthy, 58, has represented California's 20th Congressional District since January 2007, following his departure from the California Assembly, where he served as minority leader. More than a decade and a half later, he was elected as speaker of the House in January.\n\nMr. McCarthy's district isn't likely to turn Democrat, as it has been solidly Republican for some time. However, California Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, is now required to call a special election within two weeks of the McCarthy seat becoming vacant.\n\nAs for who will fill the position, there's speculation that one of a few prominent local Republicans could take Mr. McCarthy's place. The Los Angeles Times reported that former California Rep. Devin Nunes, who's currently serving as the CEO of former President Donald Trump's namesake media and technology group, could have the support to secure the position.\n\nThe publication also reported that former California state Legislature minority leader, state Sen. Shannon Grove, could take the position. An army veteran, Ms. Grove was a six-year member of the State Assembly before taking the state Senate post in 2018 and is also a supporter of President Trump. The state lawmaker has also been a champion of the California oil industry and has opposed mandatory vaccinations for schoolchildren.\n\nMr. McCarthy's is the most recent in a string of House retirement announcements causing turmoil in recent months. The party also recently experienced the rare expulsion of indicted Rep. George Santos (R-N.Y.).\n\nThe California Republican Party responded to The Epoch Times's request for comment on the future of the congressional seat with a statement from California Republican Party Chairwoman Jessica Millan Patterson.\n\n\"Our nation, our state, and California's 20th Congressional District are better off today because of Speaker Emeritus Kevin McCarthy's years of service,\" she said.\n\n\"As Speaker of the House, he envisioned and implemented a commonsense, conservative agenda to move our nation forward. From recruitment to fundraising, no one has done more to help Republicans get elected across this country, and his ceaseless efforts enabled us to pick up two separate GOP House majorities, including five-seat pickups here in California.\n\n\"I am so proud to call him a friend and mentor and am in awe of all that he has accomplished for our state and nation. I wish him all the best as he enters this next chapter.\""

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy Is Not the Problem\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Nikki Haley got to the heart of the government shutdown fireworks in her appearance on Fox News Sunday.\n\n\"Let's be clear what the Freedom Caucus is really trying to do; they are trying to cut spending.\"\n\nThat's of course correct. One would be hard-pressed to find any Republican, Freedom Caucus member or not, who does not understand the gravity of the state of our federal budget and spending.\n\nUnfortunately, now we have a small group of Republicans doing what liberals do-looking for whom to blame. You would think that House Speaker Kevin McCarthy is personally responsible for $33 trillion in national debt and a $2.2 trillion deficit.\n\nMcCarthy is sent to do budget battles with his hands tied behind his back. The marching order regarding spending cuts is and has been that only on the table is discretionary spending.\n\nDiscretionary spending accounts for 27 percent of the federal budget.\n\nDiscretionary spending is funds that Congress has authority to appropriate annually. About half of it is the Defense budget. Given that our Defense spending is currently at a dangerously low level as a percent of GDP, it is, for practical purposes, also off the table.\n\nSo, what is left to target for spending cuts is miniscule in the grand scheme of things. The allegation that McCarthy betrayed his party and colleagues by not seriously going to budget war and shutting down the government is a grand distortion.\n\nIf we want to turn to reality, the real issue is what no one wants to talk about-the approximately 70 percent of the federal budget that is non-discretionary, which happens automatically.\n\nThe major non-discretionary items are interest on the federal debt and entitlement programs-the two largest being Social Security and Medicare.\n\nInterest is a symptom rather than a cause. Interest rates, and hence interest expenditures, have been going up because of all the spending and the inflation that has resulted from this.\n\nSo, we wind up staring into the eyes of the elephants in the room.\n\nSocial Security and Medicare.\n\nEven our champion of Make America Great Again, former President Donald Trump, has insisted that reform of Social Security and Medicare is off the table.\n\nFederal spending is now around 25 percent of GDP. CBO projects it reaching 30 percent in 30 years. The average from 1962 to 2022 was 20.5 percent.\n\nMost of the growth in that spending comes from interest, Social Security, and Medicare.\n\nWe are a far different country today compared to when these programs were enacted-Social Security in 1936, Medicare in 1965.\n\nThe costs of Social Security, a retirement system, and Medicare, a health care payment system for the elderly, are driven by the percentage of elderly in the population. Lower birth rates, hence fewer children, and longer life spans means a higher percent of elderly and increasingly costly programs.\n\nThe median age in the United States in 1930 was 26.5. In 1960, it was 29.6. In 2021, it was 38.8.\n\nPer a Cato Institute report, \"unfunded obligations for Medicare and Social Security are equivalent to $650,000 for every U.S. household.\"\n\nMust our citizens take a beating with benefit cuts and retirement age increases? No.\n\nWe need to transform from tax-based government systems to market-based systems of ownership. Markets and ownership are what built our country. Our problems began when we start turning to government.\n\nBut major change takes courage and leadership. And in this we seem to be sorely lacking.\n\nI invite those Republican members of Congress, so bent on dumping on Speaker McCarthy, who has done his job keeping the nation functioning and moving forward, to step out and speak to the nation regarding how they propose to reform Social Security and Medicare.\n\nAnd I invite our Republican presidential candidates, including the one currently leading in the polls, to do the same."

Marjorie Taylor Greene (R-Ga.), whose motion to vacate his speakership is pending in the House.\n\nAt the time, the congresswoman declined to make the measure privileged, which would have forced a vote. Instead, she said that the motion was a \"pink slip\" and a warning to the House speaker, but she has not ruled out forcing a vote later. Ms. Greene said passing the spending package was \"a betrayal of the American people\" and \"a betrayal of the Republican voters.\"\n\nMs. Greene's move was the same maneuver used by Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) against Mr. McCarthy in October, which ended Mr. McCarthy's speakership after less than one year. Eight Republicans joined Democrats for the vote. Despite her alignment with Mr. Gaetz on many issues, Ms. Greene did not vote to remove Mr. McCarthy.\n\nIn the interview, Mr. McCarthy indicated that Ms. Greene has policy issues and suggested that the pair should discuss them with each other to find common ground.\n\n\"I don't believe the Speaker has spoken to Marjorie. I think if you sit down and discuss, you will understand you have Congress that you don't control all. You have to find common ground in between, and that can be done. Those are two conservatives, they can do it,\" Mr. McCarthy said.\n\nGOP voters are \"furious that our so-called Christian conservative, Republican Speaker of the House did this to them,\" she said. \"People are fed up with Republicans that say one thing and turn around and literally join the flock and just continue the same old [expletive] everybody's tired of.\"\n\n\"And here, Mike Johnson, he's literally turned into Mitch McConnell's twin and worse. He's a Democrat ... There's not even any daylight between him and Nancy Pelosi at this point.\"\n\nIn an interview on MSNBC on April 7, Mr. Curbelo said he believed Republicans and Democrats did not want to go through more chaos, referring to the House struggling without a speaker for three weeks, as happened with Mr. McCarthy.\n\n\"So, I do think that even if Marjorie Taylor Greene does move forward with this, I don't think it's going to get very far. Mike Johnson has learned what every other Speaker has shown here, at least Republican Speakers. In order to make the House a stable place that can pass big pieces of legislation, bipartisan cooperation is needed,\" he said."

Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) as speaker said he was shoved by the member on Nov. 14.\n\n\"I got elbowed in the back ... it was a clean shot to the kidneys,\" Rep. Tim Burchett (R-Tenn.) told reporters on Capitol Hill in Washington.\n\nMr. Burchett was in the middle of an interview with a reporter when he was passed by Mr. McCarthy.\n\n\"I turned back, and there was Kevin,\" Mr. Burchett said.\n\nClaudia Grisales, the NPR reporter who was interviewing the Tennessee congressman, said she saw what happened.\n\n\"McCarthy shoved Burchett,\" she wrote on X.\n\nThe force caused Mr. Burchett to move towards Ms. Grisales.\n\n\"Why'd you elbow me in the back, Kevin?\" Mr. Burchett was quoted as saying. \"Hey Kevin, you got any guts?\"\n\nMr. McCarthy did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"I guess our shoulders hit,\" Mr. McCarthy later told reporters. \"I did not run and hit the guy, I did not kidney punch him.\"\n\n\"You didn't shove him?\" one reporter asked.\n\n\"No,\" Mr. McCarthy said.\n\nMr. McCarthy denied intentionally doing anything.\n\n\"If I hit somebody, they would know it. If I kidney punched someone, they would be on the ground,\" he said.\n\nWhen told that Mr. Burchett had said he was in pain, Mr. McCarthy smiled. \"Come on now,\" he said.\n\nFormer Rep. Adam Kinzinger (R-Ill.) said that Mr. McCarthy shoved him twice in the past.\n\n\"The first time I was so surprised that I thought it was a joke at first, until I remembered that it had been almost a year since we had spoken, and our relationship was, how shall I say, strained. A similar event happened a few months later, again, walking past me in an isle on the floor,\" Mr. Kinzinger wrote on his Substack.\n\nThe former speaker also denied those allegations.\n\n\"He's a bully,\" Mr. Burchett told reporters. \"He's the type of guy that when you're a kid would throw a rock over the fence and run home and hide behind his mama's skirt.\"\n\n\"That hallway was, there's plenty of room you can walk four side by side, he chose to do what he did,\" Mr. Burchett also said. \"It'll end right here, I'm sure it'll just be a little little asterisk on his storied career.\"\n\nMr. Burchett said he backed off because confronting his colleague over what took place was not accomplishing anything. He also said he would likely not file an ethics complaint because he believes Mr. McCarthy will leave Congress this year or next.\n\nThe blow \"is symptomatic of the problems that he's had in his short tenure as speaker,\" Mr. Burchett said.\n\nMr. Burchett told NPR that the situation with Mr. McCarthy was the first time they'd spoken since Mr. Burchett voted to remove the California congressman as speaker.\n\nMr. Gaetz described what happened as an assault and called for a quick investigation by the panel.\n\n\"While Rep. Burchett is within his rights to decline to press charges against Rep. McCarthy, your committee does have a duty to investigate breaches of the binding code of official conduct,\" he wrote to the leaders of the panel, Reps. Michael Guest (R-Miss.) and Susan Wild (D-Pa.).\n\nThe code states in part that members \"shall behave at all times in a manner that shall reflect creditably on the House.\n\n\"There is substantial evidence that Mr. McCarthy breached this duty,\" Mr. Gaetz wrote.\n\nMr. McCarthy said in October that he was remaining in office.\n\n\"No, I'm not resigning. I'm staying, so don't worry,\" he told reporters in Washington.\n\n\"We're going to keep the majority. I'm going to help the people I got here, and we're going to expand it,\" he also said at the time.\n\nBut he told CNN recently that he might, in fact, depart early.\n\n\"I don't know,\" he said, when asked if he was leaning toward staying in Congress or doing something else.\n\nMr. McCarthy represents California's 20th Congressional District, which covers part of central California. He has been in office since 2013.\n\nMr. McCarthy easily won reelection in 2022, earning 67 percent of the vote."

      "text": "Happy Friday. The endless California rain means everything outside our door is a mud sty. But I've been long prepared for this. My workdays (11:00 A.M. to 11:45 A.M.) were already spent in bed. TGIF.\n\n→ Kevin McCarthy needs more friends: The Republicans, now in control of the House, are trying to complete a fairly basic thing which is to choose their next speaker. It's not going well.\n\nLongtime California Congressman Kevin McCarthy is the obvious would-be winner but he can't quite scrounge together enough votes. Eleven times-eleven!-McCarthy has been put up for a vote. And ten times he has fallen a few votes short. Why? The right flank of the party hates him. He is now reportedly offering his dissenters deep concessions: More members of the Freedom Caucus joining the House Rules Committee and the ability for just one irate member of the lower chamber to call a whole new vote to oust the speaker at any time (currently requires half the GOP).\n\nMainstream media coverage of the situation is basically just the word LOL typed out over and over, so I've had trouble understanding what is actually happening. One good read is in the American Conservative : \"For anti-McCarthy Republicans, it's not about finding a better alternative. It's about proving they can and will hold a Republican leader accountable.\"\n\nMaybe. Perhaps the bigger problem facing the nationalist-populist wing of the GOP is, nearly six years after Donald Trump took office, it has little idea of how to articulate a vision for the America it wants to build. (Consider Rep. Dan Crenshaw's justifiable rant directed at the anti-McCarthy holdouts.)\n\nMichigan Libertarian and former Congressman Justin Amash wrote of McCarthy : \"He's unprincipled, dishonest, vindictive, and focused solely on gaining and maintaining power.\"\n\nTo get this kind of endless in-fighting you used to have to go to a socialist potluck.\n\n→ Amazon to lay off 18,000: There's a new word I'm learning. The word is stagflation. It is, per Fortune , \"when a stalling economy, high inflation, and rising unemployment all collide.\" In other words: the toxic brew of inflation caused by the Biden administration's endless, blind Covid stimulus mixed with American businesses not growing fast enough. The Sherwin-Williams color of the year might be Terra , but according to Bloomberg, \" Stagflation Will Rule 2023 .\"\n\nAnd so into the maw go 18,000 people's jobs at Amazon. The layoff is hitting the corporate teams (versus warehouse workers), and it represents about 5% of that workforce.\n\n→ Cardi B for Speaker? The hip hop star didn't use the word stagflation, but she captured the crux of it on a Twitter rant , calling for \"anybody that is responsible for these f****** prices to put that s*** the f*** down.\" The rapper noted that her lettuce used to be $2, and it is now $7. Despite her $62 million net worth, Cardi \"can only imagine what middle class people or people in the hood is m***** f***** thinking, so yes I'm going to say something.\" TGIF stands with Cardi B.\n\n→ Latest from the Twitter Files: The Twitter Files-internal documents, emails and chats involving the past Twitter regime-continue to show how the U.S. government sought to silence its critics. The latest, from Matt Taibbi , shows that Adam Schiff, a Democrat and the head of the House Intelligence Committee, specifically asked the social network to ban a journalist, Paul Sperry. Even Twitter employees, usually perfectly happy to censor the politically inconvenient, balked at this .\n\n→ Wait . . . now Democrats are busing migrants to New York? Gov. Jared Polis, the governor of Colorado, is busing migrants to New York City. And New York mayor Eric Adams is not happy about it, saying : \"This is just unfair for local governments to have to take on this national obligation.\"\n\nRecall not three months ago, when busing migrants to New York was considered outrageous , potentially human trafficking, worthy of huge splashy headlines and endless features about the suffering these trips were causing. When the buses come from Colorado, surely the response will be the same? Of course not.\n\nI just checked, and there is not a single story on The New York Times homepage right now. Polis describes his busing program to NYC versus the essentially identical Republican busing program to NYC as \" night and day .\" Because, Polis says: \"We are respecting the agency and the desires of migrants who are passing through Colorado. We want to help them reach their final destination, wherever that is.\"\n\n→ We're all going to be sent to New Jersey for re-education: Two bits of news from New Jersey public schools. First, masking is back for a lot of students. Once educators got ahold of the mask and the sweet quiet of social distancing, they apparently couldn't get enough. Now, with various respiratory viruses ripping through schools (in large part because of children's weakened immune systems from Covid isolation), various districts are bringing back masks .\n\nThe much bigger update this week is the New Jersey governor signed into law a state-wide requirement for all K-12 students every year to undergo \"media literacy\" training because \"democracy is under attack.\" I cannot believe the disinfo mafia has now gotten into state-wide requirements. Here's Gov. Phil Murphy:\n\n\"Our democracy remains under sustained attack through the proliferation of disinformation that is eroding the role of truth in our political and civic discourse. It is our responsibility to ensure our nation's future leaders are equipped with the tools necessary to identify fact from fiction.\"\n\nThe flashcards for these classes will be easy to make. One side: Substack. Other side: Bad.\n\n→ Another fantastically insane fake Native American: I'm beginning to think that any high profile Native American influencer should be assumed to be a white girl with a spray tan. The latest Pretendian, who is quite literally a white girl with a spray tan: Kay LeClaire. A major leader in the Indigenous movement, LeClaire has claimed Métis, Oneida, Anishinaabe, Haudenosaunee, Cuban and Jewish heritage. She was a co-owner of giige , a \"Queer and Native American-owned tattoo shop and artist collective in Madison, WI.\" She was a community leader-in-Residence at UW-Madison's School of Human Ecology and was part of the Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women Task Force. She has had copious speaking engagements, and she even led a name-change-mob, forcing the local music venue Winnebego to change its name for Indigenous sensitivity (it was named after its street). She sold crafts and clothes, all while pretending to be a Native American (that's a federal crime , by the way). Obviously she also claims to be Two-Spirit, a sort of nonbinary identification long-practiced in Native cultures.\n\nShe is in fact German, Swedish and French Canadian. An anonymous blogger identified the fraud.\n\nOn a related note, it's a good time to read this article about how the official \"Native American\" population in the U.S. between the years 2010 and 2020 . . . doubled. Pretty soon every high school senior will be Native American. Little Harrison and Haisley will be touring the Princeton campus like, \"why, yes, this is my ancestral feathered headdress, thanks for asking.\"\n\n→ Jordan Peterson under Canadian review: The Canadians are trying to take Jordan Peterson's psychology license. The College of Psychologists of Ontario which governs the profession up north, is demanding that he apologize for various comments like calling Elliot Page \"she,\" calling Prime Minister Trudeau a \"prick,\" and commenting on a plus-size Sports Illustrated model: \"Sorry. Not Beautiful.\"\n\nHere's what the College had to say: \"The comments at issue appear to undermine the public trust in the profession as a whole, and raise questions about your ability to carry out your responsibilities as a psychologist.\"\n\nNow, is Mr. Peterson the man I personally would choose to see for therapy? No. But most therapists in my neighborhood are demisexual faeries who think therapy is white supremacy and happiness is impossible to achieve until the revolution comes. I wouldn't see them either. There's a great Wall Street Journal defense of Peterson here .\n\nOf course this would never happen here in the U.S. . . .\n\n→ Of course this is happening in the U.S.: A new law in California paves the way for doctors to lose their license for \"dissemination of misinformation or disinformation related to the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus.\" That sort of behavior is now considered \"unprofessional conduct.\"\n\nLongtime TGIF readers know my stance, but for all the newcomers: Misinformation and disinformation are real phenomena. But most of the time these days the words are political terms applied to any information a ruling clique doesn't like. Often, it's used by progressive journalists who want to see various voices censored on social media.\n\nIn the case of Covid, many, many very real facts were considered mis-and-disinfo. Like: The vaccine does not prevent transmission of Covid. That was considered fake news, verboten. Had this law been in place you would have lost your medical license for saying it. In that case, people saw with their own bodies that, although vaccinated, they were very much coughing. But thanks to this new law that muffles doctors, who knows what we won't know going forward.\n\n→ Vaccine-skeptical, sit this one out: When Damar Hamlin, a football safety for the Buffalo Bills, got hit in the chest and collapsed on the field, who was ready to jump in and opine but the vax skeptics . On Tucker Carlson, there was speculation that Hamlin was suffering vaccine-induced myocarditis.\n\nObviously there are vaccine side effects that were under-reported and lied about, but that does not mean anyone with an injury or anyone who dies young was killed by Pfizer. Just like progressives see a twinge in their ankles as #longcovid, the conservative vax skeptic movement is a hammer looking for nails.\n\nIn very good news, Damar Hamlin is stable and seems to be making a recovery.\n\nNo posts"

He also sounds off on why Republicans in Congress live for drama, and how he understands the Silicon Valley titans, like Mark Zuckerberg, quickly pivoting to the right. Watch our conversation in full below, catch it on the Honestly feed wherever you get your podcasts, or scroll down for an edited transcript.\n\nThis episode of Honestly is sponsored by Uber and X.\n\nWhy the House Republicans are so hard to manage:\n\nBari Weiss : Your predecessor, John Boehner, was pushed out of the speakership in 2015. Then we had Paul Ryan. Then we had Kevin McCarthy. It's a lot of drama and a lot of chaos. You look at the other side of the aisle, and Nancy Pelosi was able to run things with an iron fist. What is it about Republicans that make them so ungovernable or hard to harness?\n\nMike Johnson : That's a really good question: How come the Democrats stick together and Republicans don't? And here's my answer, and I think it will make sense to you. Democrats really are consistent in their philosophy. They think very much and operate very much like a union. They're very collectivist in their worldview and their ideology. They move together as a pack. They're all sort of social animals. It's socialism, in some real respect. Whereas on the other side of the aisle, the Republicans are, by nature, more independent, rugged, individualist, and deeply rooted in our philosophy. And \"you can't tell me what to do!\" and all that stuff. And that's great. There's a great blessing to that. I'm one of those people as well-until you have a one-vote margin, and you need everybody to move together. And so that is the challenge every day.\n\nBW : You've sort of obliquely referred to some of the show ponies in your party. And it's no secret that certain people-I'm thinking of Chip Roy, Marjorie Taylor Greene, Lauren Boebert, Thomas Massie-they are the challenging wing of the party. How do you manage that group? And frankly, and if there's a way to characterize that group, what do they want?\n\nNo posts"

      "searched_phrase": "Kevin McCarthy",
      "website": "https://www.thefp.com",
      "text": "This piece was first published on Tablet .\n\nThe hundreds of Hamas fighters who carried out a murderous rampage inside Israel over the weekend returned to the Gaza Strip with an invaluable new strategic asset. On Sunday, Gilad Erdan, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, told journalists that the Islamist group had captured \" dozens \" of hostages with American citizenship. If this number is even remotely accurate, the assault would be the largest mass abduction of Americans since the Tehran embassy crisis of 1979.\n\nHamas has likely divided those hostages across unmapped underground sites throughout Gaza, foreclosing the possibility of a single, swift rescue operation. The hostage issue threatens to inject a future source of divergence into Israeli and American objectives during the crisis.\n\nIn a speech at the White House Tuesday, Joe Biden said that he had \"no higher priority than the safety of Americans being held hostage around the world.\" Outgoing House speaker Kevin McCarthy listed \"rescue all American hostages\" as the U.S.'s top priority in the unfolding war. White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters that, as of Tuesday, the exact number of American hostages remains unknown.\n\nIsrael must now weigh the survival of American hostages against neutralizing active threats against other groups of civilians, and also against the country's stated war aim of disarming Hamas, which would likely require a massive ground operation in which most, if not all, of the hostages would be killed. Hamas, meanwhile, can parade American corpses through downtown Gaza and claim that they are victims of the Israeli assault.\n\n\"Hamas will use the hostages in two ways: as human shields and as a source of leverage over Washington,\" explained Michael Doran , director of the Center for Peace and Security in the Middle East at the Hudson Institute and a former senior director on the National Security Council. \"As human shields, they will prevent Israel from destroying critical infrastructure. As a source of leverage, Hamas will convince Washington to compel Israel to make concessions-on the terms of a cease-fire, the release of prisoners, relaxing economic restrictions on Gaza, delivering payments from abroad, etc. Hamas will parade American hostages before the cameras to beg Washington to bring a halt to Israeli military operations so that the hostages can gain their freedom.\"\n\nThe ways in which American hostages complicate the conflict hardly ends there. The tiny Gulf emirate of Qatar served as the laundering mechanism for $6 billion in unfrozen Iranian oil money that the U.S. used to purchase the freedom of five American citizens or green-card holders that the Islamic Republic had imprisoned, a transaction announced only last month . Doha also happens to be where much of Hamas's exiled high command lives. Qatar, Washington's chosen middleman for hostage diplomacy with Iran-which is Hamas's leading state sponsor -can claim it runs an existing and effective channel for negotiating the hostages' freedom. Any apparent progress on this diplomatic track could provide the Americans with an incentive to restrain any Israeli operation in Gaza.\n\nJason Poblete , one of the U.S.'s leading lawyers working on behalf of American hostages, said it is likely that officials from the U.S.'s Special Operations Command are already in Israel, weighing their options and waiting for further instructions. Poblete explained that when Americans are held hostage, an entire policy infrastructure springs into action-one that includes the State Department special envoy for hostage affairs, the FBI, the military, family engagement coordinators, and the intelligence community. \"There's a whole mechanism behind the scenes that was already working\" when Erdan made his vague statement about hostage numbers Sunday morning, Poblete said.\n\nIt is the impression of policymakers in Washington that Israeli security planners believe Hamas can be convinced to release children and the elderly from captivity without major preconditions, meaning there is some degree of existing Israeli buy-in for any hostage negotiations that might already be taking place. The presence of a U.S. aircraft carrier positioned offshore may suggest that the U.S. is actively weighing some sort of operation to rescue its citizens, or at least wishes to project a willingness to do so.\n\nHowever, entangling the United States in a war in Gaza would go against Israel's entire concept of its own security. \"Israel has this doctrine of defending itself by itself,\" said Jonathan Schanzer , senior vice president for research at the D.C.-based Foundation for Defense of Democracies . \"It doesn't want American boots on the ground.\"\n\nIt is unclear whether Hamas made a specific effort to kidnap American citizens. But it is fortuitous, from the Islamists' perspective, that the price of an American hostage has never been higher. The captives freed through the deal that the Biden administration struck last month fetched about $1.2 billion a head-a sum that doesn't include an additional $10 billion that made its way to Iran through Iraq that same week. \"That by itself is opening a new door to hostage-taking,\" explained Nizar Zakka , who Iran held between 2015 and 2019 and who now heads the organization Hostage Aid Worldwide . \"It's become a hostage business model.\"\n\nThe Iranian hostage business model has an established official counterpart within the American policy apparatus. In response to a string of ISIS abductions and executions of American citizens, the Obama and Trump administrations formulated a set of codified responsibilities, working groups, fusion cells, and protocols within the U.S. government for securing the release of kidnapped Americans. \"We have a guy now who has the [informal] title of 'hostage ambassador,' \" Poblete pointed out.\n\nBut like anything else in the executive branch of the U.S. government, the behavior of the American hostage-policy complex is an expression of the basic outlook and objectives of a given presidential administration. \"Our hostage policy will be successful or not based on how we anchor our overall policy,\" Poblete said. If the policy is anchored in a series of direct quid pro quos with a terrorist group or its state sponsor, enabled through the mediation of a government with close ties to whichever extremists are holding the Americans, the machinery of U.S. policy will spring into action within that paradigm, with the possible result of billions of dollars making their way to the Hamas hostage-takers in Gaza, along with the promise, presumably, that they will still be alive to make use of the money.\n\nInterestingly, two of Poblete's clients were released from Iran without a reported ransom being paid. \"Trump used all instruments of state power to secure the release of hostages,\" Poblete explained. These instruments might have included a credible threat of force against Iran or its proxies, financial and psychological warfare, and other tools that are outside the scope of negotiations, or even of pure diplomacy.\n\nThe war against Hamas contains the possibility of a deck-clearing regional conflagration through which Israel can correct decades' worth of strategic errors that have led to the establishment of large Iranian-backed terror armies on two of its borders. Perhaps the unfolding hostage crisis will force a similar rethink of America's approach to hostage issues, especially when Iran is involved. \"We can use this crisis to have an end to the hostage-business model. This is an industry that has to stop,\" Zakka said.\n\nHostage-taking limits a country's range of actions against its enemy. It is also a shortcut for baiting very powerful governments into a parody of civilized diplomacy in which they bargain with and petition people who kidnap and murder their citizens. The hostages become stand-ins for whatever evils their societies are accused of. In return, they lose all connection to the rest of the world.\n\nWhat the Hamas hostages, Israeli and American, are enduring now, with the prospect of a live-broadcast execution hanging over their heads, is excruciating, even if they have not yet been physically harmed. \"The hostage-takers put you in a certain mindset that you are nobody-nobody cares about you, you are nothing,\" Zakka explained. \"This is what is very important for the hostages to stay alive: to know that people are working, and they're not sleeping, to get you out.\"\n\nA country can't easily wage a full-scale war if scores of its own people and the citizens of its closest ally are being held captive. But in the sickening logic of a rapidly escalating conflict, Israel might not have any other choice. \"If Israel fights this war the way that it probably should, it will probably need to assume that the hostages are already dead,\" said Schanzer.\n\nArmin Rosen is a staff writer for Tablet magazine. Follow him on X, formerly Twitter, @ArminRosen .\n\nTo support more of our coverage of the war on Israel, become a Free Press subscriber today:\n\nThe brutal truth is that most of the hostages will be killed during Israel's current campaign to wipe out Gaza. I feel terrible for these hostages. On the other hand, I think it's hypocritical and naive to think that any country, Israel especially, is going to in any way curb its drive to retaliate viciously and kill thousands of Palestinians for the case of these hostages. Sadly, mostt of the hostages that are now being held (some of whom, I suspect , are already dead) will likely be killed in the coming days weeks. We cant possibly think that an all out war between Israel and Hamas and other Palestinian groups is not going to result in the death of Israelis too. Israelis are used to one Israeli death equaling around 10 or more Palestinian deaths. I am not saying this to criticize Israel (I am Jewish and support Israel). This is not fair and it is not realistic.\n\nThe last sentence in your excellent article, Mr. Rosen, should've been Israel's first thought.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "We expected Hamas to try to kill Jews. We didn't expect Americans to celebrate when they did.\n\nI have never been a knee-jerk voter but have seen how just seven congressional republicans were able to oust Kevin McCarthy from the Speakership.  Then I recall how 15 Congressional Democrats voted against a law to deny US entry to any Hamas member.  Then I see that virtually every individual railing against Israel votes Democratic and I feel compelled to vote Republican or abstain.\n\nExcellent, and much needed, perspective on what happened, and what continues to happen in Israel. That the American professoriate, of which I once belonged, has given in to this sort of ideological nonsense that leads to actual deaths, rapes, and torture is inexplicable. I am very grateful for The Free Press and the great work you all are doing.\n\nAmerica allowed its universities to be infiltrated and later controlled by Marxist activists.\n\nEducation was replaced with indoctrination and students converted to progressive acolytes with a mission to promote moral, intellectual and social revolt.\n\nThis is the result and a testimony to tolerance gone a bridge too far.\n\nWords cannot express how grateful I am for The Free Press, and how disgusted I am by the abominable behavior of American citizens (and others) \"protesting\" on behalf of terrorists and murderers.  What is wrong with people??   I am a Catholic who loves your podcast \"Honestly\" as well as the Commentary Magazine podcast, which I began listening to several years ago at my son's recommendation.   After the horrific attacks of Oct 7, 2023, I became a subscriber because I felt I ~HAD~ to do something to register my love and support for Israel.  All I can say is that these protesters cannot possibly understand what they are doing.  They have been fed a steady diet of oppression bullshit and the U.S. should be demanding the release of the American hostages every single day.  We are not the same country we were when I was young.  And I miss that country.\n\nI really can't add anything constructive but as an Asian American I was shocked and ashamed at how many Asian American (mostly young women indoctrinated by the public schools and universities) ripping down hostage posters and chanting pro Hamas and anti Jewish slogans.  A poison is spreading in this country.  These people weren't taught this at home.  It came from the institutions.    Don't want to play politics on this grave issue but the institutions are captured and controlled by one particular party.  Think about that.\n\nThank goodness for The Free Press and its excellent journalists, home based or invited. My subscribing to The Free Press was such a good decision.\n\nWords cannot express the vile reaction that wells up inside when I see the ignorance of those who would aid in the destruction of Israel. I am not Jewish. I'm American. The wolf is at the door. There will be an attack on our soil. We will be attacked by those who believe there can be no Jewish state, no Christian state, no state that does not follow sharia law. The support that has flowed from our universities, our media, our politicians, and our social media activists, will be complicit in the bloodshed of Americans. There will be no accountability. Do not expect it. Only ready yourselves. October 7th can happen here. Do not be blind to eventuality.\n\nFirst the Saturday people, then the Sunday people.\n\nLike you, I didn't expect to see Americans celebrate Hamas's atrocities against Jews. Especially not those Americans -- privileged, educated (or getting-educated) heirs to the tradition of campus activism. It was not just appalling but staggering, because it was something unheard-of in progressive politics: positively rejoicing in atrocities against any ethnic group, in the name of any cause.\n\nThis grotesque mutation became possible when a force from the Old World insinuated itself into New World politics. The radical protests of the past were generally driven by people steeped in intellectual conceits, but the ones we're seeing now are driven by people steeped in visceral hatred. American students who've joined in these protests thinking of it as their progressive coming-of-age need to understand that following the lead of Students for Justice in Palestine is not at all like following the lead of Students for a Democratic Society.\n\nhttps://thefamilyproperty.blogspot.com/2023/11/savagery.html\n\nSo incredibly well written, and so much what many of us feel right now. Thank you Bari Weiss. Never give up, never surrender!!!\n\nHussein's story has literally left me speechless... and full of hope that we will be rid of the scourge of Hezbollah with the IDF and God's help... in sh'Allah...\n\nThank you for covering this war from it's outset in the most compassionate way... and for bringing so many wonderful voices to our ears... shana tova umetuka yoter...\n\nThank you, Bari. I have appreciated TFP's truth-seeking coverage of Israel, antisemitism, and anti-West sentiment throughout the past year. The comments section often gets after you for not supporting Trump and threaten to unsubscribe because of it. I think what you and TFP offer is valuable no matter who you personally choose to vote for. I don't think you owe it to your readers to reveal how you mark your ballot. I also don't think it fits with TFP's mission to have all its readers support the same candidate. There are other outlets for people who want to stay safely in a bubble of confirmation bias and groupthink. I see TFP as trying to offer something of value to truth seekers and believers in liberal values across the center left and right.\n\nHas anyone on hear actually taken the time to LISTEN to Harris's statements about Israel?\n\nJust tonight - Israeli people and American people are allies.   Friends.   She is not for cutting off arms shipments to Israel.\n\nI know you want to think that she is in the pocket of the Lefties - if she was Biden wouldn't have picked her.\n\nYou honestly think Trump is better for Israel or even likes Jews?  He doesn't care about Israel any more than he cares what Melania thinks about abortion- just elect me....\n\nNetanyahu and Sinwar are perfectly implacable enemies.    The more Palestinians the Israelis kill the more Sinwar's position hardens and cred as a living martyr grows.   The longer the Israeli hostages are held the more justified the repeated attacks.  Bombs now just to make the rubble dance.  Now dragging this into a showdown with Iran, certainly America and the free world's enemy, no doubt about it.\n\nWhere does it end?   I can't see it from here but believing that Donald Trump will make a terrible situation better is lunacy.\n\nOne of the few things done well by the Biden/Harris administration is the continued support of Israel.  If Harris wins -- will she continue this or will she walk back on this statement as a tool to get elected and follow the far left side of her party which calls for divestment, de-arming/de-funding Israel and generally supporting a 1-state solution?  Of note, the entire body of her political career (AG, senate, candidate) has been as left of center as you can be and still have relevance in US politics.  Thus It is reasonable to be concerned that she will follow the latter.  Also, while Trump is a nut, he certainly was far, far more stringent about Iran than either Obama or Biden/Harris -- the effects of this pressure are obvious; Iran is far more of an issue now.\n\nThe Vice President is a simpleton who is equal measures of incompetence and ineffectiveness. She has no executive experience of note and no accomplishments save the boxes she successfully checked in her climb up the Democrat Party career ladder. Her sense of international relations is devoid of any understanding of our own national interests and the attendant needs of our allies. In short, she communicates weakness in all things she addresses. For that reason, she is dangerous to our security and the security of our allies.\n\nYou wish, but not so. Just continue believing falsehoods. Negativity won't ever win.\n\nIf Trump had shown any semblance of foreign policy leadership that wasn't completely driven by nepotism and/or self-aggrandizement, I might agree.\n\nEven in her relative inexperience, she is a critical and pragmatic thinker who is not afraid to make a decision and explain why.\n\nAll he has to offer is 4 more years of chaos, ego, and self-dealing.\n\nThe only lunacy here is the moral equivalency of equating Sinwar and Netanyahu and thinking Harris will be Israel's savior.\n\nNetanyahu and Sinwar are two pre-historic predators locked in a fatal embrace.\n\nThe world sees it.\n\nAsk yourself why, in the wake of a true atrocity committed by Hamas, Israel has lost the upper moral hand which they surely should have retained given what happened.\n\nI absolutely believe Israel is an unbreakable ally of the US.  We should all be disgusted and sickened that Iran, with its money men in Qatar and Dubai, has managed the seemingly impossible feat of turning a ultra religious regime that would sooner execute its entire LBGT population into one that is somehow the victim here.  Drop any of these campus protestors into Iran for 5 minutes and see how long they last.\n\nI am in no way at all equivocating Israel or Israelis with the likes of Iran, Hezbollah, Hamas.\n\nI am saying that Netanyahu has played right into the propaganda war waged by those same actors, diminishing Israel's support here at home and worldwide.\n\nI still fail to see what Trump will do or not do that makes a positive difference here.\n\nHamas horrifying butchers. U.S. pro-Hamas vastly worse. Clearly fighting words but we have lost our way since Branderberg and the idiotic soldier funeral cases.\n\nIsn't there enough to go after in the news without going after Bari Weiss? How about trying to form a constructive recommendation or ask a question or state a genuine concern. So disappointing. Bari Weiss has started a movement and been courageous her expressing points of view that have not always been popular, what have you done lately for the cause?? Please share.\n\nWe don't learn. Islamist terrorists brought us 9/11. Now they brought Israel 10/7.\n\n\"We expected Hamas to try to kill Jews. We didn't expect Americans to celebrate when they did.\" We also expected the IDF to kill civilians in their typical ferocious, vengeful manner, as they are trained, ordered, and exalted to do. We didn't expect Gaza to become the single most dangerous place in the world to be a child. We didn't expect tens of thousands of children and babies to be murdered, ripped apart, mutilated, burned alive, left without limbs, parents, food, medicine, water or hope. What Hamas did on Oct 7th is a brutal crime. What has happened since is clearly, demonstrably, grotesquely, an ongoing genocide. It's not even debatable any longer. The innocents are paying the price for the wicked. To deny it is willful ignorance. It's cruelty of the first order. It is an unforgivable sin.\n\nBari Weiss and the other contributors write a series of thoughtful, sophisticated analyses (look at Ferguson's recent piece, for instance) and all you can offer is a tired expression of moral equivalence. Suffice it to say, that when a terrorist organization spends billions of dollars on military hardware rather than infrastructure to support its peoples' social and economic development, and then attacks a sovereign state across undisputed national borders, deploying the most heinous tactics of rape, disfigurement, and indiscriminate killing of children, women (civilians), all while hiding amongst and beneath their own citizens, the response is going to necessarily result in some very bad outcomes for those who started it.\n\nThe innocents are paying the price for the wicked HAMAS, who cares nothing for its own people, only for its soulless, evil goal to eliminate the Jewish people.  To deny or ignore THAT is willful ignorance."

      "text": "Last year was certainly eventful. The year 2023 brought spy balloons, Donald Trump's indictments, the coronation of a king, the fall of a crypto prince, and no shortage of chaos in Washington, from the ouster of Kevin McCarthy to the farcical George Santos scandal. Oh, and then there's the small matter of two major wars, one in Gaza and one in Ukraine. Plus ongoing tension between the U.S. and China. On a cheerier note, 2023 was also the year of Barbenheimer, the year it felt like AI really arrived, and the year the nineties were finally cool again.\n\nBut, as crazy as last year was, will the next twelve months prove that it was actually just the calm before the storm?\n\nFor us at least, 2024 begins with a distinct feeling of dread.\n\nJust look around the world. The Middle East grows more unstable, the war in Ukraine is not going Kyiv's way, and Xi Jinping's rhetoric gets more bellicose by the day. Here at home, there's the election from hell, in which American voters will likely face the rematch nobody wants: Donald Trump and Joe Biden.\n\nTo find out if things will really be as terrible as we fear, we are starting the year with a special 2024 predictions episode of Honestly . Here's how it will work: we're going to call up some friends of the pod-people we trust in their fields-to get a better sense of what's coming down the pike.\n\nThe great Tyler Cowen looks into the economic crystal ball. Leandra Medine clues us in on fashion trends in 2024. Our very own Suzy Weiss talks through the cultural year ahead. Linguist John McWhorter looks at language. Doctor and longevity expert Peter Attia tells us how to start the year right. Eagle-eyed political observers Nate Silver and Frank Luntz try to forecast the election. And historian Niall Ferguson tells us whether we're right to have nightmares about World War III.\n\nSome guests cheered us up, whereas others freaked us out. All of them were a pleasure to talk to. We hope you enjoy these conversations with some of our favorite people.\n\nPeter Attia's health advice for the start of a new year:\n\nYou would be hard-pressed to find a long list of people whose lives wouldn't be materially better if they found more ways to exercise. So rule number one would be: Could a person commit to being more active?\n\nA second thing that might seem a little bit out of my wheelhouse, but does tie in to health, especially as we go into this year, where everybody is going to be sucked into the vortex of world news and world affairs and politics, is being more disciplined about taking a vacation from media, social media, and electronics, and substituting all that with time outdoors. For me personally, and for my patients, no one is immune to the negative psychological forces of that awful vortex.\n\nA third thing is to think twice before you have the drink. Ask yourself the question: If I'm going to allow myself to have only three or four of these a week, is this one really worth it?\n\nSuzy Weiss on the cultural trends of 2024:\n\nOkay, everyone's been saying \"the nineties are back\" for so long, so it's easy to say, \"oh, the eighties are next.\" You know: pencil eyebrows and shoulder pads. But I think we should actually be looking to the 1920s, a period of huge political and social upheaval and yet a huge time of economic prosperity. So my big predictions: hedonism, consumerism, dance music, and at the very least, short haircuts for women.\n\nLeandra Medine on a risqué fashion trend for 2024:\n\nThis is a really high-stakes, risky trend to go with. But we are seeing more and more people opt out of wearing pants. It's like the hemline index has come so high that we have actually forgone the skirt or the shorts altogether. We are just wearing underwear and pantyhose. It's like this vaguely incomplete look that somehow makes the most uncool yet cool shoes look better, and complements oversize winter coats in the most unconventional ways, and makes it easier to pick a sweater because you don't have to wonder about how it tucks into what you're wearing on the bottom.\n\nJohn McWhorter on \"rizz\" (defined as \"style, charm, or attractiveness; the ability to attract a romantic or sexual partner\") being the Oxford Dictionary 2023 word of the year:\n\nYou know, I thought it was just right because I only picked it up summer of '22 from my daughter's ten-year-old friends. They started using it. And I thought it was just some random syllable. I only learned that it was from charisma about four months ago when I asked. And how current it is is clear from the fact that about a month ago, I used it in quotation marks in front of one of my classes at Columbia. I said, \"I'm going to give you a word that I'm not supposed to use: rizz.\" That got the biggest laugh because it was so inappropriate that I'm using it. And so I thought, that one must be really hot. And so, yeah, rizz, because if you had said that to me in 2021, it would have sounded like something Hungarian.\n\nTyler Cowen on the economic outlook for 2024:\n\nThis is not slated to be a terrible year. We have, in fact, actually licked inflation without a recession, which was a shock to many economists. The global order is possibly stabilizing somewhat compared to the last twelve months. The U.S. economy is highly innovative in artificial intelligence and the biomedical area, and there's a fair amount to be happy about. But predictions are tough. Keep in mind that one out of every six years, the U.S. economy, you know, might be in recession. There's always a chance of that. But so far, so good.\n\nFrank Luntz on whether Biden will step aside before the election:\n\nThere has to be a chance because in the end, if he loses to Donald Trump, that will be his legacy for the rest of time. That he gave the presidency back to this individual. And I don't believe, after passing all this significant legislation-you can argue whether it's good or bad, but it is significant-I don't believe that he will want to be known as that individual. The only person who could talk him out of it is his wife. And she has to decide what her legacy will be as well: an active, participatory, engaged first lady, one of our best in modern times, or the person who said to her husband, \"You stay around; you fight this because you think you're the only one who could beat Donald Trump.\"\n\nNobody is looking Joe Biden straight in the eye and saying to him, \"You're going to lose this thing.\" It doesn't happen in the White House. It doesn't happen in politics. She's the only one who could do this. And clearly she's not doing it.\n\nNate Silver, when asked, \"Gun to your head, who is going to win: Trump or Biden?\"\n\nShoot me.\n\nNiall Ferguson on the importance of contemplating defeat in Cold War II:\n\nI think that there's a decent chance we'll lose Cold War II. And that's what people find really hard to visualize. The reason people don't worry is that they kind of think, \"We're always going to win. It's going to be fine. Don't worry.\" And I'm like, no, you have to contemplate the possibility of losing. The United States did not inevitably win Cold War I. It looked like it was losing for most of the 1970s. By 1979, it really looked like it was in trouble. And I think we just don't get across to people what losing might be like and why it might be bad.\n\nUkrainians understand what losing is like because they saw Bucha. They saw the bodies in the streets of Bucha. Israelis know what losing is like because they know that October 7 was a dress rehearsal for the Holocaust II. But we don't really know what losing would mean. And young Americans absolutely have no concept. In fact, young Americans are so complacent about freedom that they're basically against it now, which is a bizarre turn of events.\n\nWe need a bit more of what we would actually be like if we lost. Let's just imagine that there is a Taiwan crisis and they send two aircraft carrier groups, and the Chinese just sink both the carriers, and the U.S. finds it has to sue for peace, and Taiwan is taken over, and Xi Jinping does the ticker-tape parade through Taipei. What then? What does that mean? I think a lot of people haven't really got anywhere close to thinking that through.\n\nThey don't realize that ceasing to be number one, losing the Pax Americana, has massive costs. These are the things people don't spend enough time thinking about because they just complacently assume that somehow all of this stuff is going on over there in Ukraine and Israel and Taiwan, and somehow we'll be fine. But the reality is we will definitely not be fine any more than we would have been fine if the Soviets had won the first Cold War.\n\nFor more vital conversation, become a Free Press subscriber today:\n\nNow I can start inserting \"rizz\" into my conversations with my students. I kill more good slang that way.\n\nI'm not sure I agree with Tyler Cowan that we've beaten inflation.  I see the standard govt measures like CPI nearing 3%, but don't feel any relief yet.  I understand that lower inflation doesn't mean prices come down from where they have moved, just think soem of the measures are overly optimistic.   And I also see pressures that might keep inflation from dropping in the real world (shipping avoiding Suez/Red Sea for example).  Fuel prices continue to bounce up and down, but $3/gallon gas seems to be on the low end of the norm now.  And grocery prices continue to surprise me, as many items have nearly doubled in price compared to just a few years ago, and are going to stay there.  Dismissing these prices and the psychological effect of them seems too convenient when discussing inflation and why we should really feel good about the economy.\n\nNo posts"

      "text": "They said Trump was a threat to democracy. Now they are propping up my MAGA challenger.\n\nImagine what extreme measures a desperate Democratic establishment couldd take to ensure only the most frenzied Maga candidates and public figures rise to the forefront of politics prior to elections.  Since the Jan 6th hearings failed to sway anyone. They must think outside the box, utilizing the full weight of media.  Biden sending the FBI into Mar a lago for a raid is just a preview of what we are in for.  Could anything energize the right wing fringe more than such overreach at Trump and fellow Maga candidates? Dems know they only do stand a chance when national attention is on how crazy Republicans react. They want more crazy, at all costs.\n\nI'm no politician, but this seems pretty basic. It's far harder to defeat an incumbent in an election. If Meijer loses his primary, Dems don't have to defeat an incumbent. This piece comes across as whining from a toady who has done everything he could to ingratiate himself to Democrats, then feels betrayed (and, hilariously, surprised) when Democrats work to unseat him.\n\nGood riddance. See ya, Pete. I don't think you will be missed.\n\nAnd what is the epilogue?  He lost.  So Meijer says \"But Gibbs and I couldn't be more different.\" Impressive.  That sounds pretty strong.  So strong that maybe Meijer would then support democracy and maybe (1) Run as a third party candidate (he has a $50M trust fund), or (2) support the Democrat.\n\nAnswer: NO!  Neither.  He instead endorses the nutjob he ran against -- Gibbs.\n\nSo, was Meijer just bullshitting the whole time?  Did he fool Bari into carrying this piece?  Sure, we should all agree that Democrats should not have been endorsing the nut jobs.  That said, where is Bari and everyone else's stance on this?  Mainstream Republicans should **ALSO** not be endorsing the nut jobs.  When did we decide to give the Republican Party a pass on being crazy?\n\nWill there be a followup piece on how, actually, Meijer turned out to be devoid of principles?\n\nIt's hilarious that a Republican who was praised by Democrats for impeaching the leader of his own party thinks they did that because what he did was righteous, not because he acted like a Democrat. And now he's shocked that these beacons of morality are funding his opponent, who will be easier for them to run against. I mean how naive can you be? You're playing politics at the federal level and you are this out to lunch?? You are publicly expressing shock at the injustice of it all and are also completely tone-deaf at the impeachment vote you are so proud of having cast. Let me tell you: You don't have to be hardcore MAGA to believe that that impeachment vote was foolish and counter-productive. Here's hoping you lose your primary.\n\nYes, that's true. But it does seem to indicate that teachers can't express themselves even to say whom they are married to.  \"Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age appropriate or developmentally appropriate for students in accordance with state standards.\"\n\nhttps://www.miamiherald.com/latest-news/article259859150.ece/BINARY/HB%201557%20education%20bill.pdf#storylink=readmore_inline\n\nBTW, in case anyone on this Substack missed it, John Gibbs ended Peter Meijer's self-absorbed dalliance as the MI-Us 3rd Congressional District representative. Unconstitutional impeachments, silly red flag 2A laws, support for trans men competing with women, and numerous budget-busting, pork-laden laws are behind us now that Meijer was ousted...unless, of course, the newly redrawn 3rd (D+3) results in a victory this fall for Hillary Scholten (an AOC doppelganger with schoolmarm glasses...mean but accurate, imo).\n\nWow Peter - nice warm embrace you had for your threat-to-democracy MAGA challenger when you went and introduced him at a Republican \"unity event\" a day after losing.  Propping up the very same guy you whined and complained that the Democrats refused to distinguish you from in any meaningful way.\n\nSo what - you get revenge by proving them right?  Face it Peter - you're assimilating.  There's no more reason for anyone to credit you for your past honorable deeds when clearly they're a thing of the past.  You'll use the feeling of betrayal by Democrats to justify hugging your own party even tighter.  It's only a matter of time before you're Trump-splaining on Fox News in a bid to remain relevant.\n\nYes, it will be a damn shame if this lunatic gets elected when it could have been you.  But apparently not as much of a shame as I would have liked to believe.\n\n\"and has tweeted that Democrats are the party of \"Islam, gender-bending, anti-police, 'u racist!'\"\n\nWhere's the lie though? We are fed up with their madness. Do you really think people are going to continue supporting a party where they constantly hear messages about how awful they are?\n\nWell Peter, your last minute gambit didn't work, did it. Good riddance.\n\nSo, maybe this makes me a \"fringe issue\" voter, Peter,  but I do not see the point of having a Republican/conservative in office who will not fight for the reality that men cannot *be* women, that Title IX should not be rewritten/interpreted to replace \"sex\" with the make pretend \"gender identity\", and who has no concern for Gender Ideology being promoted in K-12 schools and girls as young as 12-16 having their breasts chopped off in \"gender affirmation\".  You lost me when you said that Gibbs was an \"extremist\" for observing that the Democrats are the party of \"Gender Bending\".  Yeahhhh....  Is your head buried in the sand?   I was really offended by that.  Is it far right to say that there are two sexes and that if a tiny few men have a disorder of the mind we do not need to re-order all of society - especially when it is not those guys but the fetishists who wish to alter society and  \"trans\" children in order to give themselves cover?   You could have walked a line without going there.  Better to have a Democrat in place if Gibbs loses later and know where we stand.   - LM\n\nHOWS THAT L TASTE PETER????????????? HOW DOES IT TASTE???????????????????????\n\nAll I hear from the Democrats and their liberal media shills 24/7 is a broken record: our democracy is under attack from Ultra MAGAS, election deniers and white Supremacists. According to the F.B.I. and Attorney General Garland these people pose the biggest existential threat to our country. It's unbelievable that the Democratic Party Establishment is now funding millions of $$$ in campaign ads SUPPORTING these Ultra MAGAS and election deniers in their primary elections. This only goes to show that the January 6th Committee hearings are  a total sham and that Pelosi and Schiff made Liz Cheney look like a fool.\n\nThere is no real difference between either party that matters.  Your whining about Dems supporting your opponent is rich.  All you Trump haters disregard how you would react if the entire corrupt bureaucratic machine aligned to prevent the exposure of their incompetence and crimes.  Trump may be an asshole with delusions of dictatorship but he was no match for the unrelenting criminal behavior that is the triumvirate of our corrupt Intel, politicians and media useful idiots.\n\nMr. Meijer, I can understand your concern - to an extent.  I was happy to see politicians like you willing to stand against the cowardice in your party and vote to impeach Trump.  And yes, attempts by an opposing party to boost extreme candidates - while normally a time honored tradition by both parties - seem perhaps out of place in this time when our democracy teeters on a knife's edge.\n\nBut let's not forget which party is responsible for this state of affairs - and why.  The one thing that you and those who support this criticism conveniently fail to mention is that these supposed ads \"boosting\" and \"promoting\" far right candidates are actually attack ads.  They paint each candidate in what would normally be considered a negative light by highlighting their support for Trump and his seditious behavior.  The catch here is that this negative light is actually appealing to modern day voters in the Republican Party - *your* party.\n\nGranted, the Democrats know this, and are using it to their advantage.  Is that wrong and shameful?  It's hard to say.  I'd love to say yes, but then again, all they're doing is telling voters the truth about these candidates.  If your party's constituency were sane, these ads would be boosting *you*.  Not to mention, Ruben Gallego is right, isn't he?  You would make Kevin McCarthy speaker just the same as a full-on election-denying MAGA-brain.  That's a real practical concern - the same kind of practical concern that has caused you to pull your head back into your shell over the previous year and downplay your role in helping to impeach Trump.\n\nYou can complain about the Democrats all you want.  But don't try to tell us that their behavior is \"more nauseating\" than the behavior of your own party.  The party actually responsible for creating this perverse state of affairs, where telling the truth about a candidate is to be decried as irresponsible, as opposed to hoping they don't notice that their incumbent Representative actually acted honorably when it mattered.  Where a decent man has to rely on the help of his political opponents to protect him from his own voters.\n\nYou know where the problem actually lies, and yet you continue to climb into the same bed with those who perpetuate it.  Why?  It's hard not to see this an an instance of misplaced anger and frustration.  That fact that you find the Democrats behavior to be more disturbing clearly indicates that you have far higher standards for them than for your own party.  And there's a reason for that.\n\nComing from the Russia hoax party it's rich you complain about how republicans created this perverse situation\n\nFirstly, I belong to no political party.\n\nSecondly, coming from the \"Russia hoax hoax\" crowd, that's a sadly yet predictably misinformed response.\n\nYou belong to no party but blame republicans, great!    As for the Russia hoax , it did far more to discredit our institutions then any mean tweet from trump.\n\nMean tweet?  Are you freaking serious?!?  You still think this is about Trump being crass and impolite?!?\n\nThe man tried to OVERTHROW OUR DEMOCRACY.  For goodness sake, man!  What are you paying attention to?\n\nFor your information, there was no \"Russia Hoax\".  There was a bunch of Trump supporters and anti-anti-Trumpers seizing on the stupid Steele Dossier and Carter Page to discredit an absolutely legitimate investigation.\n\nThe Russia hoax, Ukraine hoax, the intervention on behalf of the Biden family by our the FBI.  The wiretapping of the Trump campaign, the illegal leaks.  The suppression of speech and the press, the political violence of left wing groups.  The attack on the White House, the attempt to block the judiciary committee with Kavanaugh.   The list can go on, there are things to criticize Trump over but they pale in comparison to the authoritarian tactics which of the party which you don't belong to.\n\nYou belong to no party. Bullshit.\n\nIt's kind of crazy watching democrats do trumps work for him in wiping out the remanent of nevertrumpers."

Once you know to look for it, you really find it everywhere, especially in politics. Think: Hillary Clinton's 2016 email scandal. Then, last summer, we learned that Donald Trump improperly stored and would not return classified presidential records that he took with him to his estate at Mar-a-Lago.

      "text": "TGIF. Let's get right to the news.\n\n→ White House fights to keep the federal mask mandate : After a Trump-appointed judge struck down the federal mask mandate, there were shrieks of celebration. Videos of flight attendants singing down aisles and merrymaking, collecting masks in trash bags, went viral. Normal people smiled and cheered along with them-it's hard to think of a group that has seen fewer human faces in the past few years than flight attendants. But The Washington Post's Robin Givhan called these cheers \" whoops of selfish delight .\"\n\nIt remains very important to America's pundits that people wear masks in the vicinity of planes-not while eating or drinking during the flight-but during other times.\n\nNew York Times columnist Paul Krugman predicted widespread violence against the masked : \"soon we'll be seeing many incidents in which those who choose to protect themselves with KN95s etc face harassment, even violence. Because this was never about freedom.\" And former senior Obama advisor Valerie Jarrett seemed to think masks had been made illegal: \"Wearing my mask no matter what non-scientists tell me I can do.\"\n\nAnd lo, the Justice Department on Wednesday night announced it filed an appeal to reinstate the mask mandate on planes and other public transportation. Cover yourselves right back up, flight attendants.\n\n→ Obama comes out to get mad about disinformation: Yesterday at Stanford, President Obama gave a sweeping speech about disinformation , my favorite thing to complain about people complaining about. He called for more government regulation of platforms (they should be \"be required to have a higher standard of care when it comes to advertising on their site\") and criticized big tech's business model (\"inflammatory content attracts engagement\").\n\n\"These companies need to have some other north star other than just making money and increasing market share,\" the former president said.\n\nWe have an idea of what that North Star can be: how about the constitution? There's a First Amendment in there that seems like a pretty great articulation of what the values of a social media company ought to be.\n\n→ CNN+ shuts down : A reported $300 million was spent on CNN+ and it lasted less than a month . (And we thought Quibi 's demise was epic.) It turns out Americans just aren't interested in paying for content from Don Lemon and Rex Chapman. Brian Stelter, who also had a show on the short-lived service, quoted the new CNN CEO who called it \" an incredibly successful launch .\" We're not cable TV experts, but we know that we have more daily visitors than CNN+ did. RIP.\n\nMeanwhile on Apple TV+, \"The Problem with Jon Stewart\"-a mush of lefty rants from a couple years ago warmed up and served again-is a ratings disaster dropping by the fifth episode to just 40,000 viewers . And on Spotify, The Obamas' deal with the company has fallen apart and they will seek a new podcast home.\n\n→ Netflix stumbles: Netflix stock dropped 35% after the company divulged that it lost 200,000 subscribers in the first quarter. It projected losses of 2 million subscribers between April and June. The ever-opinionated Elon Musk's take on it: \"the woke mind virus made Netflix unwatchable.\" Maybe. A lot of the content they churn out is really boring and Morally Correct. But also there's just a lot more competition out there. Netflix used to be the only game in town.\n\n→ Speaking of Musk: On Thursday morning he filed new documents in his quest to buy Twitter. He's put together a $46.5 billion funding package with some impressive backers. But to make it work, he still needs to get past the poison pill the board put in, which would dilute shares if anyone acquires more than 15% of the company. Musk is, in theory, trying to make an end-run around the board by going straight to Twitter's shareholders with his offer. They, in turn, could pressure the board to drop the poison pill. But, at this point, this financing deal appears to be more of a forcing mechanism to make Twitter's board-which has yet to respond to his original offer to purchase the company- take him seriously .\n\n→ Everyone say \"Putin Price Hike\" : That's apparently going to be the official line from Washington. Biden could say something about inflation resulting from hard choices made during a terrible time, a recession staved off during a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic, but the president is instead opting to go for a classic Democrat standby: Russia did it. \"I'm doing everything I can to bring down prices and address the Putin Price Hike,\" Biden said this week . CNN White House correspondent John Harwood came out with a strong defense: \"Biden confronts a host of problems he can't do much to solve.\" Harwood lists: Inflation, Covid, and immigration.\n\n→ An Easter bunny save and a shadow handshake: When President Biden started talking to an Easter party bystander about Afghanistan, someone on his staff wearing a bunny costume physically intervened. The bunny waved its arms, directing the confused-looking president away . The video went viral. It's unnerving to watch the president of the United States look a little confused at times (did he handshake thin air after a speech?).\n\n→Why we need a fully present commander in chief: Some 100,000 people are trapped in the destroyed Ukrainian city of Mariupol as Russia closes in on the city. Russian forces have shown themselves ready and willing to brutalize and kill civilians, which Putin then celebrates .\n\n→ Jared Kushner's kushy Saudi deal: Trump's son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner, received a $2 billion investment from the Saudis just months after Trump left office. Senator Elizabeth Warren last week called for a Department of Justice investigation into it, since it sure looks like a quid-pro-quo. As with all potentially back-dealing political offspring: the answer is yes to an investigation, please do.\n\n→ And in other Trumpy news: Last Friday, the 45th president endorsed Ohio senate candidate J.D. Vance, who in 2016 identified himself as a Never Trumper and called Trump \" an idiot .\" That's all ancient history now: \"I think Trump was a great president,\" he said at a town hall this week . \"When the facts change, you gotta change your mind.\"\n\nAnd it turns out that Republican House Leader Kevin McCarthy-stalwart Trump booster-told Liz Cheney he'd call the president and ask him to resign. McCarthy denies it. But, and I hate to admit it, Rachel Maddow has the tape:\n\n→ More polls show Americans moving right : University of Virginia's Center for Politics changed their ratings on 11 house races across the country- all in the direction of Republicans. Meanwhile Cook Political changed eight ratings on house races also toward the right . In-the-bag Democratic races changed to likely wins. And likely wins changed to toss-ups.\n\n→Young black Americans turn against Biden : In 2014, there were 6,095 black Americans murdered. In 2020, that number rose to 9,941. That's almost 4,000 more deaths. So perhaps it shouldn't come as a surprise that a new poll from Pew asking people to identify the number one problem in communities in which they live finds that, yet again, black Americans choose the issue of crime/violence as their No. 1 concern, far above Covid, racism, and even housing.\n\nAnd while a broad swath of young Americans have turned against Biden, with 18-34 year olds showing a 20 point drop in job approval since Jan 2021 , according to a Civiqs poll, and the drop is even higher among young black Americans. Biden has seen a 30 point drop among that group. (The sharp Derek Thompson pointed that out.)\n\n→ Google Docs is our sensitivity reader now : A new update rolling out to Google docs-which we couldn't live without-is prompting people to use more inclusive language in their writing. The software wants kinder, gentler words used for derided minorities like landlords . May Google Docs suggest proprietor instead ? The word mother is of course verboten. When a reporter for the tech news site Motherboard wrote the word Motherboard , Google docs underlined it and alerted the reporter: \"Inclusive warning. Some of these words may not be inclusive to all readers. Consider using different words.\" The site, which I will now call Parentboard lest my Google yell at me, called the update \"very broken.\"\n\n→ Who is banning all these books : There's an odd game going on right now where both the left and right really want to say the other side is doing book banning, which these days just means removing titles from school reading lists. And, well, it's both sides. One Florida county is pulling 58 books from the school library. The list was posted by Attorney General candidate Daniel Uhlfelder and books on it range from reasonable-to-remove (\"50 Shades of Gray\" was in the school library ???) to totally unreasonable (\"The Bluest Eye\" by Toni Morrison). Meanwhile, a new survey from the School Library Journal shows the top books teachers wanted to remove from summer reading lists, and here's that list: \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" all of Shakespeare, and \"The Great Gatsby.\"\n\n→ My favorite influencer : Hasan Piker, the handsome socialist media star, went to Coachella wearing an $1,100 Gucci shirt . The man who got really rich raging against the rich is seeing his audience turn on him (first for his mansion and his Porsche, then for the private jet and the Gucci). But Piker seems to be having a great time making fun of the \" haters .\" We continue to salute this brilliant champagne socialist who makes a reported $210,000 a month on Twitch. We are all fools for not having done this first.\n\nNo posts"

Kevin McCarthy of California told members of the media, \"I'm not resigning. I'm staying, so don't worry.\"\n\n\"We're going to keep the majority,\" McCarthy proclaimed , \"I'm going to help the people I got here, and we're going to expand it.\" McCarthy's remarks were in response to a CNN report claiming McCarthy was going to resign. Two months later, CNN has been proven right: McCarthy is headed for the door.\n\nIn a Wall Street Journal editorial , McCarthy announced he has \"decided to depart the House at the end of this year to serve America in new ways. I know my work is only getting started.\"\n\nMcCarthy's farewell address reads like a CV. \"I helped lead Republicans to a House majority-twice,\" McCarthy claimed. \"We got more Republican women, veterans and minorities elected to Congress at one time than ever before. I remained cheerfully persistent when elected speaker because I knew what we could accomplish.\" And, McCarthy added, \"even with slim margins in the House, we passed legislation to secure the border, achieve energy independence, reduce crime, hold government accountable and establish a Parents' Bill of Rights. We did exactly what we said we would do.\"\n\nOne might ponder why the majority in the House was so slim to begin with. Maybe it had something to do with McCarthy's money men spending exorbitant amounts of cash in GOP primaries to damage America First candidates who suggested a change in Republican congressional leadership  was necessary. One also wonders who McCarthy was trying to impress with this CV-its placement in the chosen newspaper of the establishment and financial center-right should provide some insight.\n\nSurprisingly, McCarthy left the strongest point on his resume out of his editorial: He's a talented fundraiser. But for those who read the Wall Street Journal and might consider hiring McCarthy as a lobbyist for their cause, they already know that. They've been signing checks for McCarthy for years.\n\nBradley Devlin is the former political editor for The American Conservative .

      "text": "State of the Union: Former Speaker Kevin McCarthy is backing a primary challenge against his arch-rival Rep. Matt Gaetz, which is just the kind of move that ultimately cost the Californian his speakership.\n\nKevin McCarthy wants his revenge.\n\nWhat is left of the former House speaker's political operation seems to be supporting a primary challenge against Florida's Rep. Matt Gaetz, the House GOP member who led the effort to oust McCarthy from the speaker's office last October. McCarthy's chosen fighter is Aaron Dimmock, the director of executive development for the Aylstock, Witkin, Kreis and Overholtz Center for Leadership at the University of West Florida and former Navy aviator. Dimmock filed just before the deadline to appear on the primary ballot in August and listed the treasurer of McCarthy's American Patriots PAC, Maria Wojciechowski, as his campaign committee's treasurer. He currently has a residence in Pensacola, Florida, but registered to run using a Missouri drivers license and listed Jefferson City, Missouri as his location on his LinkedIn page as late as April 30. Dimmock changed his LinkedIn location to Pensacola after Gaetz tweeted about Dimmock's previously listed location.\n\nWhile Dimmock served as the director at Chapman & Co., a company that provides workplace training sessions and seminars, the Daily Caller reported that he made a series of pro-DEI and pro-BLM posts in the aftermath of the George Floyd riots.\n\nLinkedIn posts on Dimmock's page included messages like \"I want diversity and inclusion to be a priority,\" \"#inclusivelanguage,\" and \"#diversityandinclusion.\" One repost on Dimmock's page is a series of commitments to the \"black community\" by Chapman & Co.\n\n\"Meet Aaron W. Dimmock - the BLM supporting DEI instructor running against me in the Republican Primary,\" Gaetz tweeted. \"I knew former Representative McCarthy would be getting a puppet of his to run. I didn't know it would be a Woke Toby Flenderson!\"\n\nIn response to this new challenger, Gaetz's campaign team has purchased a number of internet domains, such as AaronDimmockForCongress.com , AaronDimmock.com , and DimmockForCongress.com . \"Meet DEI Dimmock,\" AaronDimmockForCongress.com reads.\n\nDimmock will run; Gaetz will beat him. This story, however, is mostly about Kevin McCarthy. Increasing the debt limit, passing a continuing resolution, and deal making with Democrats behind the GOP conference's back all played their part in McCarthy's ouster, but above all, it was this kind of political maneuvering that did McCarthy in.\n\nIn the 2022 midterm elections, McCarthy and his political operation deeply intervened in the GOP primary process. The Congressional Leadership Fund (CLF) and other McCarthy-aligned groups spent millions attacking conservative candidates like Anna Paulina Luna, Joe Kent, and Anthony Sabatini. If these GOP candidates made it through their primaries damaged by McCarthy-world attacks from the left, McCarthy would parachute in for the general and fundraise. In Kent's case, McCarthy's help was too little, too late. The GOP barely took back the House of Representatives.\n\nIt was the kind of moves McCarthy made in 2022, and is making now with Dimmock, that ultimately forced McCarthy to cut a deal with House conservatives for the speakership, which stipulated that leadership would stay out of open primary challenges and, more importantly, lowered the threshold for the motion to vacate.\n\nHistory is repeating itself in the 2024 election cycle in a number of ways: Biden v. Trump, the GOP has weak Congressional leadership heading into November, and McCarthy is up to his old tricks. How might this bode for Republicans hoping to defend their slim majority?\n\nCorrection: Based on erroneous reports, this story previously claimed Aaron Dimmock lived outside of Florida's 1st Congressional District.

      "text": "The 118th Congress should take a page from the 68th.\n\nThe opening of the 118th Congress was marked by voting drama usually associated with the outcome of presidential primaries and elections. The election of House speakership is normally a quiet affair, but Republican Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy needed fifteen rounds to win the post.\n\nThe unusual number of ballots introduced Americans to Frederick Gillett , who needed nine rounds over four days to secure the speakership in 1923. Gillett may not have been a prominent historical figure like Speaker Joe Cannon or so familiar as Nancy Pelosi, but his term was not insignificant.\n\nThe 118th Congress may have begun under less-than-auspicious circumstances, but America First conservatives would be fortunate if it equaled the legislative achievements of Gillett's 68th Congress .\n\nBetween 1860 and 1920, over 28 million immigrants entered America; midway through this period, the source of immigrants shifted from Northern and Western Europe to Southern and Eastern Europe. Unfortunately, these later arrivals endured more prejudice and discrimination than the former because of their unfamiliar languages, customs, and religious beliefs.\n\nThe matter reached a crossroads with America's entry into World War I. Amid President Woodrow Wilson's crackdown on dissent, business paranoia over growing socialist sentiment, and the Bolshevik Revolution in Russia, Congress passed -over Wilson's veto-the Immigration Act of 1917, the first legislation to comprehensively restrict immigration.\n\nAfter the war, Congress passed an emergency bill that introduced two new features: a numerical limit of 350,000 on the overall number of immigrations and a quota system to allocate spaces based on national origins. The quotas restricted annual immigration from a country to 3 percent of the existing foreign-born population as of the 1910 census. Wilson opposed this bill as well and used a pocket veto to prevent its passage.\n\nIn 1920, the American people repudiated Wilson and delivered a landslide to a decidedly conservative Republican presidential ticket of Warren Harding and Calvin Coolidge; voters similarly gave the Republicans massive majorities in both the House and Senate.\n\nHaving promised a return to \"normalcy,\" President Harding promptly signed the Emergency Immigration Act into law.\n\nA temporary measure set to expire in 1924, Rep. Albert Johnson of Illinois, the bill's sponsor, sought to make the provisions permanent in the 68th Congress.\n\nGiven the effectiveness of the Emergency Act in reducing immigration, Johnson's next bill simply tightened the restrictions. The law lowered the numerical limit to 165,000 and the quota to 2 percent as of the 1890 census. More pointedly, the original quota had been based on the number of people born outside of the United States. The new quota was based on the entire number of people born inside the country, which, in practice, dramatically restricted the entry of Southern and Eastern Europeans.\n\nIn the space of eight weeks, the 68th Congress passed the bill with overwhelming majorities in both houses. It was signed into law on May 26, 1924, by President Coolidge, who had ascended to the presidency after Harding's death in August 1923.\n\nEstablished by constitutional amendment in 1913 , the income tax was a foundational component of the progressive reform agenda. Conceived to mitigate rising income inequality, the original tax rates were modest, the highest being 7 percent.\n\nUpon entry into World War I, the Wilson administration raised the required revenue by levying taxes at much higher rates-from a 15 percent top marginal rate in 1916 to 77 percent in 1918, before declining to 73 percent through 1921.\n\nSuch high rates during a national emergency were justified, but maintaining them three years after the war ended was simply confiscatory. When the economy fell into a sharp recession in 1920, Wilson's refusal to lower taxes was another factor in the Republicans' subsequent victory.\n\nHarding's plan to revive the economy entailed reducing government expenditures and lowering income tax rates.\n\nHarding achieved an early success in the form of the Revenue Act of 1921 , which lowered the top rate from 73 to 58 percent. Unemployment began to decline, and prices began to stabilize, albeit too late to prevent Republican losses in the 1922 midterm elections. The subsequently narrower majorities had the consequence of enhancing the leverage held by the party's remaining progressive insurgents, namely Senator Robert La Follette of Wisconsin.\n\nIn November 1923, the Coolidge administration transmitted a tax reduction proposal to the House. The draft legislation rapidly advanced in both chambers but this auspicious start was soon thwarted by an alliance of Republican progressives and Democrats that favored steeper progressive rates. Instead of the desired 25 percent, the bill only reduced the top rate from 58 to 46 percent. Coolidge reluctantly signed the bill on June 2, 1924.\n\nThe 68th Congress faced two principal challenges, one long-term and one immediate-establishing a durable regime for future immigration and right-sizing the government's relationship to the economy after World War I-and it succeeded.\n\nIn the space of ten days, Coolidge signed into law two bills passed by the 68th Congress to address these challenges.\n\nIn its day, the Immigration and Nationality Act was deemed a triumph; Johnson characterized it a \"second Declaration of Independence.\"\n\nWhile it is reviled today as the legal embodiment of American nativism, it is little appreciated how the act precluded the passage of legislation completely foreclosing immigration and preserved family reunification and unlimited immigration from the Western Hemisphere.\n\nUnlike literacy tests and country-specific restrictions, the numeric restrictions were more transparent and inherently objective; their endurance through 1965 attested to their efficacy.\n\nIn contrast, the Revenue Act was considered a setback; Coolidge contended it did not \"represent a sound permanent tax policy.\"\n\nRectifying the law's shortcomings became the centerpiece of the Republican Party's campaign in the upcoming 1924 presidential election . Coolidge easily defeated La Follette for the Republican nomination, and the party enthusiastically united behind him and a platform pledging to reduce taxes.\n\nFor its part, the Democratic Party had not yet fully reconciled itself to the conservative wave that had overwhelmed it in 1920. Only four years removed from the Wilson administration, Democrats still favored a more progressive tax structure and its platform denounced tax cuts as a giveaway to the wealthy.\n\nNevertheless, this opposition was a rare instance of agreement as the party convention was deadlocked between its two leading candidates; after 103 ballots, the party settled on a compromise candidate, John W. Davis, who had been Wilson's solicitor general but was now a prominent Wall Street lawyer.\n\nAfter his defeat, La Follette abandoned the Republican Party; repelled by the relatively conservative Democratic platform, he entered the presidential race as the Progressive Party nominee. True to form, La Follette vowed to expand government intervention in the economy and institute a more progressive tax system.\n\nCoolidge won the election in a historic landslide. Fortified by the mandate, the next Congress promptly passed a bill reducing the top rate from 46 to 25 percent, which Coolidge signed into law on February 26, 1926.\n\nThe economic benefits soon became manifest; between 1922 and 1929, the annual rate of growth averaged 4.7 percent while joblessness declined from 6.7 percent to 3.2 percent.\n\nThe new Republican House faces comparable challenges. Amid the Second Great Inflation, America awaits a plan to right-size a bloated post-pandemic government. Imperiled by the catastrophe on the southern border, America needs a comprehensive new immigration regime.\n\nThe 118th Congress will be thwarted by the Democratic Senate and the Biden White House, but there is no reason it cannot similarly lay the foundation for a robust Republican platform in 2024.\n\nKevin McCarthy may not be Frederick Gillett, but conservatives would be lucky if the 118th Congress echoed the 68th.\n\nR.

      "text": "The speaker should hold fast and take the negative example of Kevin McCarthy to heart.\n\nLet's review. Kevin McCarthy, the California Republican, was ousted from the speakership after over 10 months of poor to middling efforts to advance conservative interests against Democratic opposition in Congress and the White House. The final straw came in October, when he relied on Democratic votes to pass a continuing resolution, prompting a motion to vacate from Florida's Rep. Matt Gaetz.\n\nFollowing McCarthy's departure, The American Conservative 's own Bradley Devlin asked Republican House members what they wanted in their new leader.\n\n\"We need a leader with the basic qualities of leadership,\" Virginia's Bob Good commented. \"Someone who is trusted by the conference, and someone who is a fighter, and understands negotiations and leverage and that will fight for more than just trying to become Speaker.\"\n\n\"The next thing I'm looking for is leadership and vision,\" Montana's Matt Rosendale said. \"A vision of where we want to go, and the ability, the leadership ability and skills to organize the group and help pursue it. You have to be able to incite enthusiasm in your vision.\"\n\n\"Conservative members must have trust that the next Speaker of the House will fight hard on key issues like securing the border, energy independence, and cutting government spending,\" said Byron Donalds of Florida. \"The next Speaker will need that trust and belief to win their votes.\"\n\nFollowing some inconclusive hurly-burly, the next speaker was Mike Johnson of Louisiana. This week will test his mettle against the standards set by his colleagues.\n\nDespite filibuster opposition, Mitch McConnell and Chuck Schumer passed through a mammoth bill 70-29 laying aside $95 billion for defense in Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan. (No money was allotted to securing the southern border of the U.S., following the failure of Senate Republicans to secure a satisfactory deal.) A narrow plurality of the country and a strong plurality of the Republican voters whom Johnson and his colleagues nominally represent have become skeptical of spending more money on the Ukraine war. That alone should be a check on a huge no-strings funding package. Yet as Sen. J.D. Vance of Ohio wrote in our pages Monday, the bill under consideration is more dire than mere blank-check funding.\n\nIt gets worse. Back in 2019, Democrats articulated a novel theory of impeachment, based on Trump's refusal to spend money from the USAI-Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative. Five years after impeaching Trump for refusing to spend money on Ukraine, they have drafted a new law that again requires Trump to spend money on Ukraine. If he negotiates an end to the war, as he has promised to do, they will undoubtedly argue that he has broken the law. We are nearly a year away from an election that could give Trump the presidency, and Ukraine-obsessive Republicans have already given the Democrats a predicate to impeach him.\n\nStopping not just dubious cash outlays for foreign governments but this bill in particular is a priority.\n\nSo far, Johnson seems disinclined to move the legislation. \"The Republican-led House will not be jammed or forced into passing a foreign aid bill that was opposed by most Senate Republicans,\" he said Wednesday.\n\nYet doubts remain. An embarrassing failure to count votes resulted in the February 6 failure to impeach Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas, prompting questions about his ability to whip the caucus and advance its priorities. Per POLITICO, Johnson is \"polishing his reputation for dithering in the face of tough decisions,\" presiding over Do Lung Bridge-like madness with almost pure ad hoc decision-making. A Democrat-authored discharge petition is floating around; only a few defections from the GOP will allow Hakeem Jeffries to ram the bill through without any guidance or input from the speaker at all. McCarthy is encouraging Johnson from the sidelines to make the former speaker's errors again.\n\nA handful of congressmen are reportedly working on a counter to the Senate's bill, which they say will be more amenable to House conservatives. Will Johnson be able to avoid defections while the particulars are ironed out, probably at length? Will he be able to get the caucus to pass the revision?\n\nThis is a matter of both competence and personality-it returns to the question of mettle, the standards Johnson's fellow congressmen set after his predecessor's departure. Does Johnson \"incite enthusiasm\"? Is he a leader of men? Is he a ditherer, or worse? Is he just Kevin McCarthy without the Hibernian charm?\n\nAs our own Curt Mills recently pointed out , McCarthy would have happily moved this deeply unsatisfactory bill through with Democrat support, ignoring the larger part of his own constituents; this is a vindication of his removal. Johnson should hold fast and allow the sometimes unruly business of the elected legislature to work itself out instead of hustling through a clean, orderly hobble on the party's future work.\n\nJude Russo is the managing editor of The American Conservative and a contributing editor of The New York Sun .

      "text": "Is an advocate of foreign policy restraint being railroaded?\n\nAmid the hurly-burly of presidential dropouts , attempted presidential assassinations , and novel presidential conventions , the gears of Washington grind on.\n\nA sideline moment of the winding last week in Wisconsin was a direct confrontation between Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-FL) and his pet aversion, the former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy .\n\n\"What night are you speaking?\" Gaetz quizzed McCarthy. \"Are you speaking tonight?\"\n\n\"If you took that stage, you would get booed off of it,\" he added. \"You would get booed off the stage.\" In a game-after interview with CNN , McCarthy shot back: \"[Gaetz] looks very unhinged.\"\n\nThe representative from Florida's First District, of course, led the successful charge last autumn to defenestrate the then-speaker. Gaetz alleged a panoply of heresies-spending issues, foreign policy, etc-where McCarthy was said to be deficient in comparison to alternatives.\n\nGaetz eventually backed now-Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA).\n\nMcCarthy, as of late, has said the story is simpler. The Californian wouldn't stop a House Ethics Committee investigation into years-old allegations against Gaetz (allegations for which he was never charged ). But from the outside looking in, McCarthy's side of the story would seem no clean tale of moral probity.\n\nFar from being above the fray, McCarthy in private life has initiated a \"revenge tour\" of sorts, attempting to primary his former foes in Congress.\n\nPerhaps most prominently, Charleston-area Congresswoman Nancy Mace-a former McCarthy acolyte turned ally of Gaetz et al.-survived a primary challenge in June. \"I want to send him back to the rock he's living under right now. He's not part of America.... I hope I drive Kevin McCarthy crazy,\" Mace told the Times.\n\nNow the primary effort of the hardliners and the ethics investigation against Gaetz have apparently merged.\n\nCongressman David Joyce (R-OH) is a member of the House Ethics Committee, which is probing Gaetz. The American Conservative found financial disclosures that reveal Rep. Joyce's campaign and his leadership PAC donated a combined $7,000 to Gaetz's primary challenger, Aaron Dimmock.\n\nFor his part, Gaetz told TAC: \"It is no surprise to see Mr. Joyce, a stock-trading member of the ethics committee, funding my opponent. The ethics committee was hand picked by McCarthy and they will do his bidding in elections and in their witch hunt coming after me.\"\n\nThere is evidence here of a $2,000 transaction from Friends of Dave Joyce (his campaign committee) and then $5,000 from Defending American Values Everywhere PAC (DAVE PAC)-his leadership committee.\n\nWhat comes next is unclear.\n\nDepending on what the committee finds (a source close to the matter indicates the likely timeline is \"at this rate\" after the election), Gaetz could face expulsion from the House. But the stink of potential conflict-of-interest could corrode the legitimacy of any report.\n\nAnd the political realpolitik is murky.\n\nGaetz is a stalwart ally of Trump, and if the president is re-elected, it would seem unlikely that the first order of the day would be to punish allies based on a potentially tainted report.\n\nIf Trump loses, and the Democrats take the House, the precedent of removing a member of Congress who has never been charged with a crime would also weigh heavily. Recent examples such as Rep. George Santos of New York and Rep. James Traficant of Ohio involved situations in which both figures had at least been charged with crimes.\n\nMost serious: There is the question of why Gaetz has been such a focus.\n\nSince at least 2019 , Gaetz has set himself apart in advocating for a hardline position of foreign policy restraint , making him a standout in a Trumpian fray that has countenanced hawkish and even neoconservative elements.\n\n\"The 'fog of war' is no fog to me, or any of the 700,000 people I serve,\" Gaetz said five springs ago, when he was beginning to make his mark on this front.\n\n\"It is not hazy,\" said Gaetz, whose North Florida district has among the highest concentrations of active-duty military in America. \"We see the impact of war every day among the people we love who shape our lives.\"\n\nAdd in the background of Joyce.\n\nOhio has rising stars on the restraint right such as the vice presidential nominee J.D. Vance and entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy and Rep. Warren Davidson . And the Buckeye state would seem very much at the center of the new Republican politics, as I wrote for the TAC cover piece in the March/April 2024 issue.\n\nBut in other ways, Ohio is a vestige of the old guard .\n\nJoyce has contemporaries such as Rep. Mike Turner, the House intel chair, who represents a more establishment perspective. Turner was a sparring partner with former Fox host Tucker Carlson . Turner's district features an epic military base, \"with over 30,000 employees and an annual contribution of $16.68 billion to our regional economy,\" per Turner's own reporting.\n\nJoyce was a prime advocate of the contentious foreign military aid packages to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan that passed out in the Spring.\n\n\"Today was not only a vote to support our allies when they need it the most, but also a vote to protect America's national security. China, Russia and Iran are anti-American regimes that have no intent of stopping their aggressions with our allies. They also pose a strong and dangerous threat to Americans here at home,\" Joyce said. \"This package provides the critical funding necessary for Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan to defend their freedom. Something every American should stand for.\"\n\nFor what it's worth, Gaetz voted against all three of those packages.\n\nCurt Mills is the Executive Director of The American Conservative , where he previously served as senior reporter and contributing editor.

      "text": "State of the Union: A staffer for a prominent Freedom Caucus member tells The American Conservative that Majority Whip Tom Emmer could be the next Speaker of the House.\n\nThe House is currently voting on whether or not Kevin McCarthy will remain Speaker of the House after Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida filed a motion to vacate the chair in response to the Speaker's dealmaking with Democrats to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nIf Democrats refuse to bail McCarthy out, which seems likely since House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries said \"Democrats will not save McCarthy\" in a letter to the Democratic caucus earlier today, Gaetz only needs a handful of Republicans to join him in his effort to vacate the chair. As it stands now, Gaetz could have seven or more votes to oust McCarthy, given Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado hinted at voting against McCarthy by tweeting that \"Kevin McCarthy has repeatedly broken his word both to the American people and to members of Congress.\"\n\nA staffer for a key Freedom Caucus member told The American Conservative that, if McCarthy is removed, \"the only person who could get the votes to become speaker would be Majority Whip Tom Emmer. However, it would take several days if not weeks to get a winning vote. Odds are McCarthy keeps running for speaker again and the battle drags on longer than in January. Emmer seems like a step up, however we don't know what kind of leader he'd be. It's a very difficult situation.\" Apart from McCarthy and Emmer, the staffer was unsure of who could get to 218 votes. Other individuals TAC spoke to were confident that McCarthy would be removed today, but were unsure of how long the process to replace him might take and who would end up holding the Speaker's gavel. Some suggested it could once again be Kevin McCarthy, since a more conservative candidate would struggle to win over the centrists in the GOP caucus.\n\nEmmer is seemingly more hawkish on Ukraine than McCarthy has been in his attempts to balance the fractious GOP caucus. When TAC asked the staffer about this possible shift on Ukraine, the staffer said, \"Ukraine has become a very big issue in the party. Republicans are heavily moving towards not funding them anymore. But it's important to note that it's because of increasing pressure from the American people. The people are tired of it. Republicans in favor of Ukraine funding are looked at very unfavorably by their constituents.\"\n\nEmmer's potential advantage over McCarthy, the staffer told TAC, is that \"Emmer would likely do what the majority of his party wants as opposed to McCarthy, who is okay with working across the aisle and getting more Democrat votes than Republican votes.\"\n\nBradley Devlin is the former political editor for The American Conservative .

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy Helps Hillary Clinton Dismiss Any Benghazi Committee Findings\n\nFirst Eric Cantor, then John Boehner, now Kevin McCarthy. All gone from GOP leadership.\n\nThe Tea Party trifecta in the House has been achieved in remarkable fashion. All three ultimately succumbed to the palpable (and justifiable) frustration of the conservative base over party leadership's consistent betrayal of the base.\n\nAlthough there are many factors that contributed to McCarthy's downfall, one in particular has already proven politically devastating and shows no signs of going away any time soon.\n\nAlex Wong/Getty Images\n\nDuring an appearance on Fox News , McCarthy implied the House Select Committee on Benghazi was created to help take down Hillary Clinton's candidacy:\n\nThis was a serious gaffe. Devastating even. No Republican official could afford to make, especially not a candidate for speaker of the house. McCarthy just handed Clinton and the Democrats a gift. His comments breathed new life into a Clinton campaign reeling from months of bad press and tanking poll numbers over her dubious explanations of using a private email address as secretary of state. As expected, within days of McCarthy's comments, the Clinton campaign put up an ad using footage from McCarthy's FoxNews appearance and a voice over claiming, \"the committee investigating Benghazi and Clinton's emails was created to destroy her candidacy.\"\n\nOf course, Congressional Democrats didn't waste any time either seizing the opportunity to use McCarthy's statements in an attempt to dismantle the entire bipartisan Benghazi Select Committee.\n\nRep. Louise Slaughter (D-N.Y.), who introduced a resolution that ultimately failed in the House, said the comments \"called into question the integrity of the proceedings\" of the committee and demonstrated that \"the Select Committee established by Republican leaders in the House of Representatives was created to influence public opinion of a presidential candidate.\"\n\nThat's just great. All of this just weeks before Clinton's highly anticipated October 22 testimony before Rep. Trey Gowdy led committee. And just like that, over a year's worth of investigative work into the Benghazi attacks that led to the death of four Americans, undermined.\n\nMcCarthy tried to clear up his remarks , but the damage had been done. The credibility of anything the Benghazi committee uncovers about that 2012 terrorist attack will be called into question and dismissed as nothing but a political witch hunt. The Democrats tried that narrative before but the growing scandal surrounding the Clinton emails had doused those flames. Until now.\n\nFolks inside the beltway were livid at McCarthy, especially committee chairman, Trey Gowdy. They fully understood the consequences of his mistake. Some believe it served as the final death knell in McCarthy's speakership candidacy. As reported by the Washington Post , Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Cali.) stood up during the GOP conference meeting prior to McCarthy's withdrawal and lamented the magnitude of his gaffe in this exchange:\n\nAs Rohrabacher recalled, McCarthy then stood up to speak.\n\n\"I've learned from this mistake. I hope you all will forgive me,\" McCarthy said, according to Rohrabacher. \"I will make sure it doesn't happen again.\"\n\nRohrabacher said he rose again.\n\n\"Kevin, you need to not be in this race,\" he said.\n\nRep. Rohrabacher understood and articulated the reverberating effect this would have. It's continuing to play out as new reports of an apparent disgruntled former Benghazi Committee employee named Bradley Podliska alleges he was fired because he objected to the partisan turn the investigation took to focus on taking down Hillary Clinton. Perhaps he was emboldened to go this route by the opening provided by McCarthy's initial implication.\n\n[sharequote align=\"center\"]There are no coincidences in politics.[/sharequote]\n\nThere are no coincidences in politics.\n\nThere are many reasons to be suspicious of Podliska's wild accusations. The committee issued a strong statement disputing them all, explaining why Podliska's allegations do not pass the smell test.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped the mainstream media from running with the story or democratic operatives from taking the \"see, we told you it was a political witch hunt\" story line to the hilt.\n\nAlthough McCarthy has been denied the honor of every yielding the speaker's gavel, the real losers are the families of Tyrone Woods, Glen Doherty, Sean Smith and Ambassador Christopher Stevens, who have yet to get an honest answer as to what led up to the deaths of their loved ones. And the American people have yet to get an honest answer as to why the administration, including Hillary Clinton, went out of its way to blame an obscure YouTube video for the Sept. 11, 2012 attack, despite intelligence evidence to the contrary.\n\nWe were hoping the October 22 testimony before the committee by Hillary Clinton would help get shed some light on those questions and many others still unanswered. Unfortunately now, the democrats have plenty of political ammunition to distract from anything substantive that may come from the lengthy hard work of the committee.  Thank you very much, Kevin McCarthy.\n\n-\n\nTheBlaze contributor channel supports an open discourse on a range of views.

She claimed McCarthy is at odds with other Republicans, but did not say who or what contentions allegedly exist.\n\n\"Well, I don't know because you haven't quoted anybody,\" he snapped. \"You just say something. You say - you frame some brand of something.\"\n\nBREAKING NEWS: Speaker McCarthy Calls For Congress To Initiate Impeachment Inquiry Into Biden youtu.be\n\nMcCarthy proceeded to defend the potential of an impeachment inquiry. It's about uncovering the truth, he explained.\n\n\"Congress has a responsibility for the investigation wing. All I'm saying is, and I'm sure you'd probably ask the same question: where's the truth? You've got to get to the bottom of the truth. And the only way Congress can do that is go to impeachment inquiry that gives Republicans and Democrats the ability to get all the information,\" he said.\n\nIronically enough, Democrats used the same argument in 2019 to justify opening an impeachment inquiry into then-President Donald Trump. As the proverb goes: what's good for the goose is good for the gander.\n\nBut on Tuesday, McCarthy stopped short of announcing an official impeachment inquiry. Still, he warned that any efforts by the White House to obstruct congressional investigations will leave him with no option but to begin impeachment proceedings.\n\nFor years, Biden has maintained that he was not involved in Hunter Biden's overseas business dealings and that he never even discussed business with his son. But Devon Archer, longtime business associate of Hunter's, is expected to testify to Congress that Biden did discuss business with Hunter at least two dozen times.\n\nWhen news of that forthcoming testimony broke, the White House, pressed once again on Biden's denials, finally changed its story .\n\n\"The president was never in business with his son,\" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said on Monday.\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "website": "https://www.theblaze.com",
      "text": "Horowitz: Why is Kevin McCarthy not speaking out against impending omnibus that destroys his leverage?\n\nRecord excess deaths and illness, record inflation, record supply shortages, record crime, record illegal immigration, a bureaucracy that surveils, spies on, and persecutes political opponents, and a collapsing culture that teaches grooming and racism in school. Never has an incumbent party been this vulnerable headed into a midterm election, and never has an emerging opposition party been granted so much political capital to change course following that election. Yet unless Kevin McCarthy, the presumptive speaker in waiting, uses his robust clout within the party to oppose the impending omnibus bill, the entire leverage and political capital of the midterms will become worthless.\n\nMoney (budget bills) talks, congressional hearings walk. House Republicans are salivating to hold hearings on some (but not all) of the aforementioned criminal acts of the Biden administration, but no relief will come to the American people absent the use of the budget process as leverage to force changes in funding and policy on the most contentious issues of our time. Republicans know all too well that any stand-alone messaging bill (much less a mere hearing) will die in the Senate and will not become law. Placing those priorities, however, in budget bills and standing behind them is the only way to force a national debate and brinksmanship over the issues that matter. But that leverage is now hanging by a thread.\n\nIn late September, 22 Republicans , including Mitch McConnell, voted for a continuing resolution to fund the government and all its immoral and illegal tyranny until December 16. Rather than filibustering the bill until our grievances are redressed or extending the deadline into next year so that a GOP-controlled House could rewrite the budget, they kicked it until right before Christmas break with the intention of passing an omnibus bill. Unless there is a massive campaign from inside and outside the GOP ranks, Republican senators will cut the legs out from under the new majority by funding Biden's autocratic government without reforms all the way until fiscal year 2024.\n\nOne obvious player in this has been jarringly silent. Kevin McCarthy will likely become the most important Republican in America as the presumed speaker of the House next year. He will fully control the body of government closest to the people and the one that is fully controlled by the majority party. Of all people, he should have been lying down on the tracks in opposition to allowing Democrats to write the budget for the rest of the fiscal year, thereby undercutting his entire leverage to fight any of Biden's extremely unpopular policies in the budget as soon as he commands the gavel in January. Yet he was stone silent and remains so to this very day. It was only the Freedom Caucus that demanded the budget be extended into early next year with an expiration deadline that would empower the new House majority.\n\nWhich begs the obvious question: What is McCarthy's motivation in becoming speaker, and what exactly does he plan to do? If he fails to publicly call on McConnell to pass a simple CR in December rather than a full-year omnibus, that would be a sign that he views the budget leverage as a liability to be avoided rather than an opportunity - the only legislative opportunity - to bring our two years of grievances to the brink.\n\nIf McCarthy were true to his campaign rhetoric, he would demand that McConnell pass a CR until February. Here is how it would play out. As soon as he becomes speaker, he would work on a budget bill for the remainder of FY 2023 for a month. That bill would contain some or all the following provisions:\n\nEvery day, Republicans would give speeches and do media drawing attention to the devastating consequences of each of the aforementioned policies and why they need to be blocked and defunded. Then they would pass their version of the budget and dare the Senate and White House to decline to sign it in favor of promoting the terrible policies the American people just voted against.\n\nTry to imagine the leverage McCarthy would command during those months. Let's say Republicans win 52 seats in the Senate, 240 seats in the House, 30 governorships, and a record number of legislative chambers. They will never amass more political capital than at that critical juncture to finally fight for our prerogatives. Yet by remaining silent and allowing McConnell to kick that leverage until late next year, the election mandate will have dissipated. Moreover, with so many people dying from the COVID policies, lives destroyed from the energy and food crises, political opponents literally being rounded up by the FBI, and hundreds of thousands of criminal aliens pouring into the country every single month, we cannot afford to wait any longer .\n\nYet waiting is exactly what McCarthy wants. He wants to be able to wash his hands of any ability to actually effect change by having McConnell cleanly toss the fight before it begins. That way he can focus on non-must-pass stand-alone legislation that he knows will never go anywhere, along with hearings that will never bring policy changes. Then he will point to all of that amazing work and say, \"Look, this is why we need to win the next election and get the presidency, at which point all will be good.\"\n\nDaniel Horowitz\n\nBlaze Podcast Host"

      "text": "GOP's Vince Fong trounces opponent in special election for House seat vacated by former Speaker Kevin McCarthy\n\n'I am filled with humility and gratitude tonight.'\n\nEarlier this week, two Republicans faced off in a special election for the U.S. House seat vacated by former Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.), and the winner left his opponent in the dust.\n\nOn Tuesday night, California Assemblyman Vince Fong (R-Bakersfield) was declared the winner of the special election for the 20th Congressional District seat formerly occupied by McCarthy. Fong soundly defeated Tulare County Sheriff Mike Boudreaux - a fellow Republican - by a 60.3% to 39.7% margin, the New York Post reported.\n\nThe 20th Congressional District has been called the most conservative in California since registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats there 47% to 27%.\n\nFong, 44, spent a decade working as McCarthy's district director before getting elected to the state Assembly, and McCarthy endorsed him in the race. Fong also received the endorsement of former President Donald Trump, who called Fong a \"true Republican.\"\n\n\"I am filled with humility and gratitude tonight,\" Fong said in a statement.\n\n\"With the campaign over, the real work now begins,\" his statement continued. \"In Congress, I will remain focused on solving the tough issues facing our community - securing the border, supporting small business, bringing investment in water storage and infrastructure, unleashing our energy industry, and keeping the United States safe amidst the grave security threats facing our nation.\"\n\nFong said he will continue working on state business before transitioning to Washington, so it is unclear when he will officially be sworn in. Once he is, he will serve in Congress - fortifying Republicans' razor-thin majority - until at least January.\n\nSheriff Boudreaux, 57, who enjoyed endorsements from Trump's acting director of national intelligence, Richard Grenell, and GOP state Sen. Shannon Grove, is slated to compete against Fong for the congressional seat once again in November. However, now that the special election race is over, he seems focused on the job of fighting crime .\n\n\"California faces a crime crisis unlike any other in its history. That's why I will be stepping up the fight for a safer Valley and safer California,\" he said. \"I look forward to providing updates on this effort in the coming weeks.\"\n\nIt's hardly surprising that two Republicans ended up contending for the seat once occupied by McCarthy. The 20th Congressional District has been called the most conservative in California since registered Republicans outnumber registered Democrats there 47% to 27%.\n\nRep. McCarthy, 59, was first elected to the seat in 2007. He was then elected speaker in January 2023. However, just 10 months later, he became the first speaker in U.S. history to be ousted from the role after fellow House Republicans became frustrated with his leadership. He then resigned from the House altogether in December.\n\nLike Blaze News? Bypass the censors, sign up for our newsletters, and get stories like this direct to your inbox.

Scalise has been getting treated for cancer. \"I would probably vote for at least a hundred Republicans in our caucus,\" Gaetz said, suggesting that he'd also be open to supporting people who aren't members of Congress.\n\nGOP Rep. Andy Biggs of Arizona has also expressed a desire to see McCarthy ousted from the speakership. \"Last November, I ran for House Speaker because I feared that Kevin McCarthy would not rein in federal spending and take on Democrats. As seen by his latest CR, these fears are now reality. He cannot remain Speaker,\" Biggs tweeted .\n\nBut many Republicans will likely line up behind McCarthy.\n\n\"@SpeakerMcCarthy and the @HouseGOP have consistently delivered strong results for the American people. I support Speaker Kevin McCarthy as we continue to work to save America from the Far Left Democrats led by Joe Biden,\" House Republican Conference Chair Elise Stefanik (R-N.Y.) has declared .\n\n\"My fellow Republican Representatives: Look at the replies. Don't walk the plank with Elise,\" Gaetz responded . \"You can fight alongside me and tens of millions of patriotic Americans who know DC is broken and we can do better than this. No more for Ukraine. No CR's. Cut Spending,\" he wrote, along with the hashtag \"#VacateMcCarthy.\"\n\nLike Blaze News?

Kevin McCarthy from the House speakership slot.\n\nThe move on Tuesday marked the first time in U.S. history that the legislative chamber has removed a speaker, according to reports .\n\nEight GOP lawmakers and 208 Democrats voted to remove McCarthy, while 210 Republicans voted against removing McCarthy. Zero Democrats voted against ousting McCarthy from the speakership.\n\n\"The fight is not over. Now we must elect a Speaker,\" GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, who instigated the move to oust McCarthy, declared on X.\n\nOriginal story below:\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives has voted in favor of ousting GOP Rep. Kevin McCarthy of California from the House speaker role which he has held since earlier this year.\n\nRepublican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida had moved to boot McCarthy from the speakership after McCarthy worked with Democrats to secure votes for a budget resolution that averted a government shutdown.\n\nThe vast majority of House Republicans voted against removing McCarthy from the House speaker post on Tuesday. Reps. Andy Biggs (Ariz.), Ken Buck (Colo.), Tim Burchett (Tenn.), Eli Crane (Ariz.), Matt Gaetz (Fla.), Bob Good (Va.), Nancy Mace (S.C.) and Matt Rosendale (Mont.) voted with Democrats to remove McCarthy.\n\nWith the vote to kick McCarthy out of the speaker's slot, the House will now need to select a new speaker.\n\nMcCarthy became speaker in January after 15 rounds of balloting, so such such a scenario could play out again, with multiple rounds of voting taking place before a speaker is finally selected. Republicans control the House majority, but not by a significant margin.\n\n\"I support Motion to Vacate,\" GOP Rep. Andy Biggs of of Arizona noted in a post on X. \"Speaker McCarthy has failed to demonstrate himself as an effective leader who will change the status quo. He has gone against many of the promises he made in January and can no longer be trusted at the helm.\"\n\nLike Blaze News?

      "text": "After Impeachment, House Bestows Big Trade Victory on Trump\n\nShare This article\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) - One day after its historic impeachment votes, the Democratic-led House gave President Donald Trump an overwhelming bipartisan victory Thursday on a renegotiated trade agreement with Canada and Mexico.\n\nBy a 385-41 vote, the House approved a bill that puts in place terms of the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement.\n\nThe legislation passed after House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., and her colleagues won key concessions from an administration anxious to pass the trade deal before next year's election season makes that task more difficult.\n\nThe deal is projected to have only a modest impact on the economy. But it gives lawmakers from both parties the chance to support an agreement sought by farmers, ranchers and business owners anxious to move past the months of trade tensions that have complicated spending and hiring decisions.\n\nThe GOP-controlled Senate probably will take up the legislation when members return to Washington after the holidays and after dealing with impeachment.\n\nTrump made tearing up the North American Free Trade Agreement a hallmark of his presidential run in 2016 as he tried to win over working-class voters in states such as Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania.\n\n\"Critics said it couldn't be done, but he made it happen. Another promise made, another promise kept,\" said House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif.\n\nSome said the agreement did not do enough to prevent U.S. jobs from relocating to Mexico, but it won praise from Democrats who have routinely voted against prior trade agreements.\n\n\"Twenty-six years ago, I opposed NAFTA with every bone in my body,\" said Rep. John Lewis, D-Ga. \"I never thought the day would come when we would have the opportunity to right some of the wrongs in that agreement.\"\n\nPelosi said the agreement was \"light years\" ahead of what the administration negotiated with Canada and Mexico. \"We knew we could do better,\" Pelosi said.\n\nThe original NAFTA phased out nearly all tariffs on goods produced and traded within North America. It was extraordinary because it linked two wealthy, developed countries with a poor, developing country. Since then, trade with Canada and Mexico has increased more rapidly than trade with most other countries.\n\nDemocrats for years have charged that NAFTA led to massive losses of high-paying manufacturing jobs in the U.S. as companies moved production to low-wage Mexico. Trump distinguished himself from free-trade Republicans in the presidential primary with his NAFTA-bashing rhetoric, and his administration got Canada and Mexico to negotiate a rewrite.\n\nThe International Trade Commission projected in April that the agreement would boost the economy by $68 billion and add 176,000 jobs six years after taking effect.\n\nSome of the biggest impacts would be felt in the U.S. automotive industry. The agreement aims to see more cars produced where workers earn an average of at least $16 an hour.\n\nThe commission found that the new agreement would create 30,000 jobs in American auto parts plants. On the down side, the commission found the pact would increase the cost of pickup trucks and cars. That would hurt demand and reduce the number of jobs in factories that assemble cars by about 1,500.\n\nBusiness and farm groups had been hitting the airwaves and the halls of Congress to get lawmakers to support the pact, putting pressure on Democrats to work with the administration even as labor unions remained wary that the new deal represented much of an improvement from NAFTA.\n\nTrump, at times, seemed resigned to the assessment that the two sides would never reach a compromise. \"She's incapable of moving it,\" Trump said a few weeks ago about Pelosi.\n\nBehind the scenes, Trump's lead negotiator, U.S. Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, was working with House Democrats on changes to address their concerns. The agreement includes a process that could lead to inspections of factories and facilities in Mexico that are not living up to labor obligations.\n\nIt also secures more than $600 million for environmental problems in the NAFTA region. It scrapped giving pharmaceutical companies 10 years' protection from cheaper competition in a category of ultra-expensive drugs called biologics, which are used to fight such illnesses as cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and diabetes.\n\nIn the end, the AFL-CIO endorsed the pact, as did the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and other major business groups.\n\nSome Republicans grumbled that Democrats took too long to get the agreement across the finish line, but many were quite happy with the result.\n\nRep. Mike Kelly, R-Pa., said the pact reminded him of when he would write a letter to Santa, and it would be answered with most of the presents he wanted on Christmas morning.\n\n\"This is certainly one of those times when the letter to Santa Claus actually got answered,\" Kelly said.\n\nCopyright 2019 The Associated Press.

      "text": "More Than 150 Republicans in Congress Vow to Challenge Electoral Votes This Week\n\nShare This article\n\nWith Congress scheduled to certify the presidential election results in just a few days, at least 140 House Republicans and at least a dozen senators have vowed to challenge those results.\n\nSenators led by Ted Cruz are threatening to reject the electors from disputed states as not 'regularly given' and 'lawfully certified' according to the Constitution unless there's an \"emergency 10-day audit.\"\n\nCruz told Fox's Sunday Morning Futures program, \"We ought to have a fair inquiry, a fair audit into these results, and we ought to resolve these claims, not just dismiss them out of hand.\"\n\nSen. Ron Johnson told NBC's Meet The Press, \"The fact of the matter is we have an unsustainable state of affairs in this country where we have tens of millions of people who do not view this election result as legitimate.\"\n\nVice President Mike Pence's chief of staff issued a statement saying Pence \"shares the concerns of millions of Americans about voter fraud and irregularities in the last election\" and \"welcomes the efforts of members of the House and Senate to...raise objections and bring forward evidence before the Congress and the American people on January 6th.\"\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin Mccarthy also is reportedly supporting the move, but several high profile Republicans object.\n\nRepublican Sen. Lindsey Graham tweeted , \"Proposing a commission at this late date - which has zero chance of becoming reality...appears to be more of a political dodge than an effective remedy.\"\n\nRep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the third-ranking House Republican, warned it \"set an exceptionally dangerous precedent.\"\n\nSenators Mitt Romney, Pat Toomey, and Lisa Murkowski say they intend to certify the election results.\n\nMeanwhile, a leaked phone call between President Trump, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, and others is making headlines.\n\nOn the recording, Trump asks the Georgia official for an honest statewide election result, repeatedly claiming he won the state by hundreds of thousands of votes but only needs to prove a little under 12,000 to claim victory.\n\nThe president can be heard saying, \"So, look, all I want to do is this: I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have because we won the state and flipping the state is a great testament to our country because, you know, this is, just, it's a testament that they can admit to a mistake or whatever you want to call it. If it was a mistake, I don't know.\"\n\nRaffensperger disputed the president's list of claims amounting to massive voter fraud, saying the president's \"data is wrong.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the 117th Congress was sworn-in over the weekend, and Nancy Pelosi was narrowly re-elected as Speaker of the House after Democrats suffered unexpected losses in the 2020 Congressional elections.\n\nThe opening prayer by Democrat Rep. Emanuel Cleaver was marked by a bit of politically correct absurdity when he closed by saying \"Amen and Awoman\".\n\nFor now, control of the US Senate is still up in the air with two run-off races in Georgia to be decided tomorrow. If Democrats win both, the new Senate will split 50-50.\n\nShare This article\n\nSince joining CBN News, Dale has reported extensively from Western Europe, as well as China, Russia, and Central and South America.

The border is a thorny issue and she can't win inside her party and she'll be targeted for these comments for a long time from Republicans. Issues like immigration are not the ones that anyone would sign up for given the obvious political risk.\"\n\nRepublicans also called Harris out about her trip and her way of trying to deflect blame.\n\n\"This unconventional approach is nothing more than a cynical political decision to ensure the blame doesn't fall on her shoulders by distancing herself from Biden's border crisis,\" House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) said in a statement.\n\n***Please sign up for CBN Newsletters and download the CBN News app to ensure you keep receiving the latest news from a distinctly Christian perspective.***\n\nAs CBN News reported , Harris is still taking heat for where she's not going - the US-Mexico border.\n\nHarris met with Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador Tuesday after a visit to Guatemala on Monday. Her goal was to tackle the border surge and the many political problems that go with it.\n\nBut at home, Republicans like Sen. John Cornyn (R-TX) said she went to the wrong place.\n\n\"The only problem is she's not visiting the border,\" he said. \"She's not even in her home state of California which has a border with Mexico.\"\n\nDuring an exclusive interview for NBC Nightly News, anchor Lester Holt pressed her on the issue asking, \"Do you have any plans to visit the border?\"\n\n\"At some point, you know, we are going to the border,\" said Harris. \"So this whole thing about the border. We've been to the border.\"\n\n\"You haven't been to the border,\" Holt replied.\n\n\"And I haven't been to Europe,\" Harris responded. \"I don't understand the point you're making.\"\n\nCringe. Kamala Harris doesn't get it. Holt: \"Do you have any plans to visit the border?\" Harris: \"We've been to the border. We've been the border.\" Holt: \"YOU haven't been to the border.\" Harris: \".....and I haven't been to Europe. I don't understand the point you're making.\" pic.twitter.com/fFXMf8X0b6\n\nSen. Ted Cruz (R-TX) tweeted the awkward video of the interview, writing: \"Kamala Harris: 'I don't understand the point that you're making.' Fact check: True.\"\n\nU.S. Rep. Steve Scalise (R-LA) also tweeted: \"WATCH → Kamala Harris jokes that she hasn't been to Europe either when even NBC News confronted her about why she still hasn't visited the border. This is a crisis we're talking about-not a vacation.\"\n\nDr. Andrew Selee, the president of the Migration Policy Institute, told CBN News that the lack of a border visit by the Vice President may make sense from a policy lens, noting that she's focused on the diplomatic side of migration rather than the border which is managed directly by the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nStill, Selee says Harris may need to get more involved.\n\n\"It is not possible to completely separate one from the other and I suspect that the Vice President will eventually have to engage more closely with border policy,\" he said.\n\nMeanwhile, it also appears that some folks in Central America still think President Trump won the election. Fox News reports during the vice president's visit to Guatemala Monday, she was greeted by protesters holding up signs saying Trump won the 2020 presidential election.\n\n\"Mind Your Own Business,\" another sign read.\n\nShare This article\n\nYou are signing up to receive general newsletters from CBN.

'I've got to make a decision. I have my papers and I'm looking at it.'\n\nThe top Republican left his options open, saying he doesn't need a 'title' to continue representing the American public and help the country 'move forward.'\n\nHe also had some advice for his successor Speaker Mike Johnson on how to deal with the GOP conference: 'Bring in a psychiatrist for many of these members.'\n\nIn McCarthy's wide-ranging sit-down, he discussed multiple topics including his relationship with Donald Trump and his thoughts on Matt Gaetz - who led the unprecedented bid to vote him out as speaker in September.\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy told DailyMail.com he still hasn't decided if he will seek re-election in 2024 after he was ousted by his colleagues two months ago\n\nHe has faced multiple questions about his political future after eight conservative colleagues joined the Democrats to take the gavel away in farcical scenes in the House.\n\n'One thing about me is I never give up,' he told DailyMail.com.\n\n'The great thing about the American public is you don't have to have a title to be able to do it. Everybody should be engaged and be able to help this country move further and I'm going to look at the best place to do that.'\n\nMcCarthy declined to say whether he would stay on the rest of his term if he does not run for re-election.\n\n'You're putting hypotheticals out there,' he replied to a question from DailyMail.com. 'I first have to decide what I'm going to do before I make a decision [on that].'\n\nBut McCarthy has not moved to join any committees since leaving the speaker's office.\n\nDays after his ouster two months ago, the former speaker had a different tune.\n\n'I'm not resigning, I've got a lot more work to do,' he told reporters at the Capitol on October 6.\n\n'Yes,' he would run for re-election, he said at the time.\n\nHe does not think Johnson will face the same fate, despite the precarious position a single-member motion to vacate puts him in.\n\n'It will probably go better for him,' McCarthy told DailyMail.com. 'They can't do it again. You watched the chaos of what happened. I don't think the Republican Party will put up with it.'\n\nHe predicted House Republicans could keep their majority - despite the chaos. 'The answer is easily yes, we can grow the majority.\n\n'Next cycle is even better for the House Republicans than the last two cycles,' the former speaker said, citing redistricting in North Carolina and a slew of Democratic retirements.\n\nBut questions remain about whether Johnson will be able to keep up with the prolific fundraising of his predecessor. McCarthy raised $78 million for the 2024 cycle during his time as speaker.\n\n'It's a disadvantage because I had been for a while so I've raised a lot of money,' McCarthy said of Johnson's fundraising. 'It'll come. Mike Johnson is going to put the work in but we left him in a better place than I had before.'\n\nDuring the interview the former speaker allowed himself a wistful moment, reflecting on the frenzied end to his nine months with the gavel.\n\nIn his first exclusive print interview since he lost his leadership role, McCarthy said he is still figuring out 'what's the best way to serve,' with just over a week until the December 8 deadline to register as a candidate in California 's 20th Congressional District\n\nThe top Republican left his options open, saying he doesn't need a 'title' to continue representing the American public and help the country 'move forward'\n\n'Everywhere I go, people walk up and say to me, 'what happened to you is not right',' he said. 'You know, you can't look backwards. You've gotta look forward.\n\n'I'm very proud of what we were able to accomplish in such a short amount of time.'\n\nMatt Gaetz said he started the effort to force McCarthy's ouster because he put a continuing resolution, CR, a bill that kept the government open by kicking the funding deadline down the road by six weeks on the House floor.\n\nThe so-called 'clean' CR did not include spending cuts - leaving spending at the 2023 levels that hardliners insisted on cutting.\n\nMcCarthy's word of advice to Mike Johnson: 'Bring in a psychiatrist' to deal with Republicans\n\nMcCarthy put the CR on the House floor hours before the original funding deadline, when it became clear there was no alternative to avoid a shutdown.\n\nHe said he 'didn't know' at the time whether the CR would cost him his job, but said that didn't factor into his decision-making. 'I wasn't concerned of whether I was going to get thrown out or not,' he said. 'I didn't know if I would.'\n\nMcCarthy said it only became clear to him he would be the first speaker to be ousted from the job in the moments before the historic vote.\n\n'I called my leadership team, I said, 'We're not going to win this one.' And I told them, 'I'm not going to run (for Speaker) again.''\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

It was Biden's problem, not ours. Now it becomes ours,' Trump said.\n\nPresident-elect Trump slammed McCarthy reaching a deal with President Biden to suspend the debt ceiling in 2023 as 'one of the dumbest political decisions made in years'\n\nRepublicans in the House will hold only a two-seat majority and a three seat majority in the Senate in the 119th Congress, meaning they will likely need the help of Democrats to pass some key pieces of legislation.\n\nMcCarthy and Biden reached a deal to avert the U.S. government defaulting on the debt in May 2023 with just days to spare.\n\nIn the end, 165 Democrats joined 149 Republicans to approve the bill so the U.S. could avoid the economic disaster.\n\nThe bipartisan legislation suspended the debt ceiling until 2025 while also capping federal spending and clawing back some COVID relief funds.\n\nBut the move drew harsh criticism from some GOP lawmakers who did not think Republicans demanded enough in the compromise legislation and threatened McCarthy's gavel.\n\nMcCarthy speaking at a press conference with other Republicans after passing the debt ceiling bill in May 2023. McCarthy was ousted by hard-right Republicans as speaker that October after reaching an agreement with Democrats to avoid a government shutdown\n\nThe suspension of the debt limit ends on January 1, so Congress will need to move quickly to reach a deal.\n\nTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen wrote a letter to Congressional leaders just days after Christmas warning that the U.S. was nearing default.\n\n'Treasury currently expects to reach the new limit between January 14 and January 23, at which time it will be necessary for Treasury to start taking extraordinary measures,' she wrote.\n\nSuch extraordinary measures are temporary steps the Treasury can take to move around funds to help avoid the U.S. hitting the limit and defaulting, but those efforts are temporary and limited.\n\n'The Democrats must be forced to take a vote on this treacherous issue NOW, during the Biden Administration, and not in June,' Trump wrote in his post.\n\nThe U.S. has never hit the debt limit since it was enacted, but Congress has had to scramble to reach agreements to avoid it on numerous occasions in recent years as the U.S. debt has ballooned.\n\nTrump with McCarthy in February 2020. During the Trump administration the debt ceiling was suspended three times as roughly $8 trillion was added to the national debt during his first term in office\n\nDuring Trump's first term in office, the debt limit was suspended three times including in 2017, 2018 and 2019. McCarthy was House majority leader the first two times it was raised under him.\n\nThe third time it was suspended during Trump's first term in September 2019, the then-president signed legislation kicking the deadline down the road two years into 2021.\n\nUnder Biden the debt limit was raised once in 2021 and then suspended again in 2023, setting the stage for the latest showdown just as a new administration is set to begin.\n\nEarlier this month, as lawmakers were rushing to pass a spending deal to avoid a separate government shutdown days before Christmas, Trump left members of Congress and Speaker Mike Johnson scrambling in the 11th hour when he suddenly publicly demanded the deal include a provision to address the looming debt limit.\n\nDemocrats were enraged when Republicans scuttled a bipartisan deal and opted to vote on a GOP only bill that also addressed the debt limit, but it failed miserably in the House when some Republican lawmakers joined Democrats to reject it.\n\nIn the end, Johnson put forward a slimmed down deal that addressed government spending but left out the debt limit provision. It passed just in time to avoid the government shutdown heading into the holidays.\n\nBut lawmakers will now have to address the debt limit moving forward, and Johnson's move could come back to haunt him in his own caucus as some question whether he should remain speaker even as Trump has endorsed Johnson to remain in the position.\n\nThe House is set to vote for a speaker for the new 119th Congress on Friday.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nBy posting your comment you agree to our house rules .\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual.\n\nDo you want to automatically post your MailOnline comments to your Facebook Timeline?\n\nYour comment will be posted to MailOnline as usual\n\nWe will automatically post your comment and a link to the news story to your Facebook timeline at the same time it is posted on MailOnline.

Patrick McHenry , chair of the Financial Services Committee, has been named as the interim Speaker, but now the GOP will launch a marathon bid to pick a successor while in turmoil.\n\nThe House is now in recess while Republicans decide on their next move to elect a leader.\n\nMcCarthy is swarmed by reporters after a vote to oust him from the speaker's chair\n\nFlorida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz leaves the House floor after his motion to vacate ousted the speaker\n\nThe humiliating end for McCarthy, 58, sent shockwaves across Capitol Hill and secured his title as the shortest-serving Speaker since 1875 , following a rollercoaster tenure of nine months.\n\nIt came after a rebellion led by his nemesis, Florida congressman Matt Gaetz , and a small group of hardline Republicans who viewed McCarthy as a weak conservative.\n\nMcCarthy was seen shaking hands and hugging his supporters on the House floor after the stinging loss. His name could be put up for speaker again in subsequent battles.\n\nRepublican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina stunned her colleagues by voting to boot McCarthy from leadership.\n\nThe free-wheeling congresswoman said her vote was about 'trust.'\n\n'It's not ideological. It's about having a leader in our nation who will tell the truth, who you can trust,' she told DailyMail.com. 'I am looking for a speaker who will tell the truth.'\n\nBut in January she tweeted that Gaetz is a 'fraud' for his McCarthy opposition.\n\nKevin McCarthy has been sensationally ousted as Speaker of the House in a historic vote sparked by a tumultuous civil war in the Republican party\n\nThe GOP leader's tenure came crashing down, nine months after he was elected after an unprecedented 15 rounds of votes.\n\nRepublicans were left reeling as they tried to stave off a potential government shutdown next month.\n\nMcCarthy's supporters called him a 'happy warrior' with 'true American grit'.\n\nBut, speaking on the House floor, Gaetz said: 'Chaos is speaker McCarthy. Chaos is somebody who we cannot trust with their word.\n\n'One thing that the White House, House Democrats, and many of us on the conservative side of the Republican caucus would argue is that the thing we have in common - Kevin McCarthy said something to all of us at one point or another that he didn't really mean and never intended to live up to.\n\n'I don't think voting against Kevin McCarthy is chaos. I think $33 trillion in debt is chaos. I think that facing a $2.2 trillion annual deficit is chaos.'\n\nHe added: 'Let's get on with it, lets vacate the chair, let's get a better Speaker.'\n\nMcCarthy's supporters booed and jeered at Gaetz as he tore into the Speaker ahead of the vote that officially removed him.\n\nRepublicans control the chamber by a narrow 221-212 majority, meaning it took only a handful of defections to remove McCarthy.\n\nIt came after a rebellion led by his nemesis, Florida congressman Matt Gaetz , and a small group of hardline Republicans who viewed McCarthy as a weak conservative\n\nSteve Scalise was one of the Republicans who came out in support of McCarthy\n\nMcCarthy's supporters called him a 'happy warrior' with 'true American grit'\n\nGaetz and his allies criticized McCarthy for relying on Democratic votes to pass temporary funding that headed off a partial government shutdown last week.\n\nThey also said he had not pushed hard enough to cut spending, and was too willing to send money to Ukraine.\n\nThe anti-McCarthy Republicans have not coalesced around one alternative they'd like to put up for speaker. Gaetz has noted that the speaker does not even have to be a member of the House.\n\nThe Florida Republican said he 'absolutely does not' want the top job - and floated a number of names - including members of McCarthy's own leadership team like Steve Scalise and Tom Emmer. He even suggested he 'might call up' for New York GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told reporters there are 'plenty of people' who good do the job better than McCarthy. Gaetz said Monday night he'd like to see Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who is battling blood cancer, in the role, but seemed open to other options.\n\nBurchett also said he wanted a speaker who didn't want the job so badly.\n\nHe said last week he had a conversation with McCarthy, 'the last thing he said was 'I really wanna be speaker.' And I think that sums up the whole thing ... it's not about one person.'\n\nBut McCarthy's allies could continue to put him up for speaker again.\n\n'I think Kevin McCarthy should take a hint after 15 ballots to become speaker after eight months of a failed speakership and after removal in this historic manner,' Gaetz said on that prospect.\n\nFormer President Trump seemed to disapprove of the drama playing out in Congress' lower chamber.\n\n'Why is it that Republicans are always fighting among themselves, why aren't they fighting the Radical Left Democrats who are destroying our Country?'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

      "text": "Is Kevin McCarthy TOAST? Up to SEVEN Republicans plan to vote with Matt Gaetz alongside Democrats to kick him out as Speaker in historic vote\n\nBy EMILY GOODIN, SENIOR U.S. POLITICAL REPORTER\n\nPublished: 12:13 EDT, 3 October 2023 | Updated: 13:28 EDT, 3 October 2023\n\n469\n\nView comments\n\nHouse Democrats were clear on Tuesday they are not voting in any way, shape or form to save Kevin McCarthy 's job as speaker as his future looks grim.\n\n'We're not voting in any way that would help save Speaker McCarthy,' Rep. Pramila Jayapal said outside the House Democrats' meeting in the basement of the Capitol . 'Nobody trusts Kevin McCarthy, and why should they?'\n\nMcCarthy's future looked bleak as he said he will call a vote on Tuesday afternoon on a motion to oust him from the speakership. He made clear he will not cut a deal with Democrats to stay in power, setting up an unpredictable showdown after Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz's motion on Monday night to remove him from power.\n\nGaetz presented a 'motion to vacate,' a legislative maneuver that would result in the ousting of the speaker if a majority of the House approves it. The vote could happen around 1:30pm or 2pm ET on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nIf four Republicans defect and no Democrat helps McCarthy, he will lose. And up to seven GOP lawmakers have indicated they will go with Gaetz and vote against the speaker.\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Harkeem Jeffries made it official shortly before the vote began, saying Democrats wouldn't vote to keep McCarthy in the speakership: 'Given their unwillingness to break from MAGA extremism in an authentic and comprehensive manner, House Democratic leadership will vote yes on the pending Republican Motion to Vacate the Chair.'\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy will face a vote on his future on Tuesday afternoon\n\nThe rules of the House allow for any single lawmaker - Democrat or Republican - to make a 'motion to vacate the chair,' essentially an attempt to oust the speaker from that leadership post through a privileged resolution.\n\nGaetz filed it on Monday evening and the House has two legislative days to vote on it.\n\nNext steps:  McCarthy allies will likely seek to block it by offering a 'motion to table'- or set aside - the resolution.\n\nThat is where Democrats can help save McCarthy, if they support the move to table the matter.\n\nDemocrats don't have to vote yes to help McCarthy. They could simply vote present, or not show up at all, and that would lower the threshold McCarthy needs to block the motion.\n\nIf McCarthy's allies fail to table the motion, the House would then move to a vote on removing McCarthy.\n\nAgain, Democrats could save him by voting in his support or just by voting present or being absent.\n\nIf Gaetz's motion succeeds, the speakership would be vacated and the House would then need to hold a new election.\n\nA speaker candidate would need to win a majority of votes from those lawmakers present and voting. In January it took McCarthy 15 rounds of votes to secure the speakership.\n\nMcCarthy, coming out of a meeting with House Republicans on Tuesday morning, said he was confident he would stay as speaker.\n\n'We'll move through this,' he said. 'If I counted how many times someone wanted to knock me out, I would have been gone a long time ago.'\n\nBut McCarthy holds a narrow majority in the House. And Democrats could prove his saving grace - if they wanted to.\n\nFor Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his caucus it is a tough choice: save McCarthy and stay with the speaker they know or vote for his ouster and see who winds up with the votes from Republicans to be in the speaker's chair.\n\nJeffries and McCarthy spoke on Monday night but neither offered details of the conversation.\n\nMcCarthy is prepared to face his fate head on. When he calls the 'motion to vacate' to the floor, his allies will seek to block it by offering a 'motion to table' - or set aside - the resolution.\n\nThat is where Democrats can help save McCarthy, if they support the move to table the matter.\n\nDemocrats don't have to vote yes to help McCarthy. They could simply vote present, or not show up at all, and that would lower the threshold McCarthy needs to block the motion.\n\nThey are indicating they will not do this.\n\nIf the motion to table fails, McCarthy doesn't have to immediately bring up Gaetz's motion to oust him.\n\nHe has 48 hours before he'd be obligated to call a vote on the matter, which could give him time to try and wrangle more lawmakers to his side.\n\nBut he likely won't find any support among Democrats, who blasted him as untrustworthy.\n\n'This issue is about Republican dysfunction,' Rep. Mark Takano said. 'We don't have an obligation to elect a Republican Speaker. But we don't have a particular obligation to also save this speaker. So there's not a commitment or a feeling that we need to do anything to save the speaker.'\n\n'We're not here to keep Kevin McCarthy in power. This is their problem. If they have the votes to keep him, then so be it,' Representative Jim McGovern said.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger said of McCarthy: 'He has made his bed.'\n\nAll of the Democrats said they were united behind their leader, Hakeem Jeffries.\n\nAnd Jeffries gave no indication of his plan as he left Tuesday morning's meeting.\n\n'House Democrats are going to continue to push people over politics and to fight to make life better for everyday Americans,' he said, adding Republicans should 'break from the extremists, end the chaos, end the dysfunction, end the extremism.'\n\nHouse Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries is showing no sign he will save Kevin McCarthy\n\nRepublican Rep. Matt Gaetz moved to remove Kevin McCarthy from speaker's office\n\nInside a closed-door meeting with Democrats on Tuesday morning, Jeffries pointed out it was their party that gave McCarthy the votes this weekend to pass a continuing resolution to prevent a government shutdown.\n\nThen he showed a video clip of McCarthy going on CBS' Face the Nation to talk about how Republicans saved the country from a shutdown mess.\n\nDemocrats said it was episodes like that which led to them not trusting McCarthy, along with McCarthy's actions on January 6th, his trip to Mar-a-Lago to make amends with Donald Trump, his attempt to discredit the January 6th committee, and his reneging on debt limit deal.\n\n'For many of us, there is a consensus that this is not somebody that can be trusted. And it is not our job to save him as a speaker,' Rep. Ilhan Omar said.\n\nJayapal said the distrust goes back to the January 6th insurrection when McCarthy went from railing against Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election results to embracing the former president.\n\n'For a lot of us, we were here. It is still deeply emotional for us,' she said. 'Kevin McCarthy stood on the House floor and said one thing and then talked to Donald Trump and immediately did something else.'\n\nOmar noted McCarthy has reneged on spending deals and also allowed the start of an impeachment inquiry of President Joe Biden.\n\n'He cannot be trusted really plays a huge role in the fact that we all know that there is no real deal to be made here,' she said.\n\nEven moderate Democrats said they wouldn't help McCarthy.\n\nRep. Jared Golden,  a moderate Democrat who sometimes votes with Republicans, said he would vote to oust McCarthy.\n\n'The GOP has control of the House and it is their responsibility to pick their leaders. That decision has nothing to do with me or with any Democrat,' Golden said in a statement. 'Absent any significantly meaningful benefit for Maine's Second District, I see no reason to vote for him.'\n\nDemocrats met for over two hours on Tuesday morning in the basement of the Capitol. Leadership offered all the members one minute to speak and 33 people took up the offer, going to the microphone to discuss the matter.\n\nThe meeting went on so long that aides brought in Cava for lunch. Cheers and applause could be heard at several times throughout the morning.\n\nGaetz's move is the first time a 'motion to vacate' has been used against a speaker.\n\nThe Florida Republican charges McCarthy with breaking his word to conservatives on spending deals and how he would run the House.\n\nBut McCarthy and his allies say it's a personal vendetta, pointing to the Ethics committee looking into several allegations against Gaetz, including illicit drug use, sexual misconduct and misusing campaign funds.\n\n'Matt Gaetz had planned to do this from the very beginning,' McCarthy told CNBC's 'Squawk Box.' 'He has personal things in his life that he has challenges with. That's fine.'\n\nMcCarthy has said repeatedly he doesn't get involved in ethics complaints.\n\n'He's been blaming me for some for an ethics complaint against him that happened in the last Congress ,' McCarthy noted.\n\n'I have nothing to do with he wants me to try to wipe that away. I'm not going to do that. That's illegal. And you know what, if some way I lose my job because I uphold the law because I uphold the continuity of government. So be it.'\n\nAnd some charge Gaetz with trying to garner attention ahead of a plan to run for Florida governor.\n\nGaetz was easily able to make his move to oust McCarthy because of a deal made back in January when McCarthy was trying to secure enough Republican votes to be speaker. To garner enough support from the conservative wing of the party, McCarthy agreed to their demand to give them the ability to call a quick vote to 'vacate the chair' and remove him from office.\n\nGaetz, in remarks on the House floor in Monday, charged McCarthy with a 'secret deal' with Democrats to fund Ukraine. Many conservative Republicans want to end U.S. aid to the war-torn country.\n\nMcCarthy denied the charge, saying there's no secret plan.\n\nGaetz, meanwhile, noted of McCarthy: 'If he's able to stay in power, it will be him working for the Democrats, continuing to do their bidding. So this is a revealing exercise, and I think it will show the country who's really in charge.'\n\n'I have enough Republicans where at this point next week, one of two things will happen: Kevin McCarthy won ́t be the speaker of the House or he ́ll be the speaker of the House working at the pleasure of the Democrats,' Gaetz said.\n\nMcCarthy responded to matter on social media, writing on X: 'Bring it on.'\n\nGaetz soon retorted in a post, 'Just did.'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

He and McHenry are close allies. It was McCarthy who ensured his friend was named to the top leadership spot in the House by naming him as speaker pro temp should anything happen to McCarthy.\n\nKevin McCarthy was behind Nancy Pelosi's office eviction\n\nAnd McCarthy's motive: retaliation. He and his GOP friends are furious Democrats didn't help save him from being ousted as speaker in Tuesday's historic vote.\n\nRepublican Rep. Garret Graves argued that McCarthy is getting Pelosi's office space in the Capitol because he is the former speaker, replacing her as the most recent to hold that title.\n\n'Look the deal is that the office that Pelosi is in right now is the office of the preceding speaker. Speaker Pelosi and other Democrats determined that they wanted a new ... speaker, and it's Kevin McCarthy. So, he's getting the office,' he said.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Annie Kuster of New Hampshire called the evictions of top Democrats 'petty.'\n\n'I did hear about that pettiness and frankly, my understanding is that started with Kevin McCarthy on the way out the door. I certainly hope the mood improves,' she told CNN .\n\nSpeaker Pro Temp Patrick McHenry gave the eviction orders shortly after he took over as speake r.  The majority party has all the power on Capitol Hill, controling office space and meeting rooms.\n\nThe House voted on Tuesday - 216-210 - to remove McCarthy as speaker. All Democrats voted with eight Republican conservatives to oust him.\n\nMcCarthy was the shortest-serving speaker since 1875, and the only one in US history to be voted out of leadership by fellow members.\n\nPelosi blasted her eviction as a 'sharp departure from tradition.'\n\nTraditionally former speakers are given office space in the Capitol. Former Republican speaker John Boehner has such office space.\n\nPelosi will retain her congressional office in the Canon House Office Building.  But office space in the House side of the Capitol is at a premium and it's a sign of power to have assigned space there.\n\nAnd Pelosi's office was in a prime position off the House floor.\n\n'Office space doesn't matter to me, but it seems to be important to them,' she said in a statement. 'Now that the new Republican Leadership has settled this important matter, let's hope they get to work on what's truly important for the American people.'\n\nNancy Pelosi missed the vote on Kevin McCarthy because she is in San Francisco for Dianne Feinstein's funeral\n\nStaff members tend to the office being vacated by Pelosi\n\nPelosi was the first female speaker of the House, and she served in that role for a total of eight years, from 2007 to 2011 and again from 2019 until 2023.  In November, her Democratic colleagues voted to grant her the ceremonial title of 'Speaker Emerita.'\n\nPelosi is in San Francisco for the funeral of the late Senator Dianne Feinstein. Her staff received an email Tuesday evening informing them to 'vacate the space' by Wednesday - at which point the locks would be changed.\n\nDemocratic leadership staff helped pack up her personal items so McCarthy could move his things in.\n\nHoyer also got a vacate order.\n\nMcCarthy blamed Pelosi for his ouster, saying she had pledged to support him if a motion was made to remove him.\n\nHis nemesis, conservative Rep. Matt Gaetz, made the formal motion to 'vacate the chair,' which starts the process to have a speaker removed from power.\n\n'I think today was a political decision by the Democrats. And I think I think the things they have done in the past hurt the institution,' McCarthy said Tuesday night shortly after the vote to remove him.\n\nHe said he spoke to Nancy Pelosi during his marathon speaker campaign in January and told her about conservatives' demand he change the House rules so a single lawmaker could propose the motion to 'vacate the chair.'\n\nMcCarthy said Pelosi told him to give in to conservatives and told him she would always back him up, implying he thought he had support from Democrats to fight back against the legislative move.\n\nBut Democrats were clear on Tuesday they saw the speakership as the Republicans' problem.\n\n'This issue is about Republican dysfunction,' Rep. Mark Takano said. 'We don't have an obligation to elect a Republican Speaker. But we don't have a particular obligation to also save this speaker. So there's not a commitment or a feeling that we need to do anything to save the speaker.'\n\n'We're not here to keep Kevin McCarthy in power. This is their problem. If they have the votes to keep him, then so be it,' Representative Jim McGovern said.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Abigail Spanberger said of McCarthy: 'He has made his bed.'\n\nStaff members attempt to block a view of the hideaway office being vacated by Pelosi\n\nSpeaker of the House Pro Tempore Representative Patrick McHenry gave the official eviction order but did it at Kevin McCarthy's request\n\nA photo from the Capitol showed items from Pelosi's office being packed up on Tuesday night, while the Democrat was in California to attend Feinstein's funeral\n\nMcCarthy said Tuesday evening he would not run again for speaker, putting the gavel up for grabs.\n\nNext steps are highly uncertain with no obvious successor to lead the House Republican majority.\n\nAs speaker pro tempore, McHenry will preside over the vote and selection of the House's next speaker, with the ability to recess the chamber, adjourn it and recognize speaker nominations.\n\nMcHenry said his goal was hold to a speaker election this coming Wednesday.\n\nMcCarthy as speaker was required to submit a confidential list to the clerk of people 'in the order in which each shall act as Speaker pro tempore in the case of a vacancy,' according to House rules.\n\nMcHenry was the top name on that list.\n\nAction is halted in the House until next week, when Republicans will try to elect their new speaker.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

And if Biden stays as the nominee for the Democrats , I believe Donald Trump will win.\n\n'I believe the Republicans will gain more seats in the House and the Republicans will win the Senate .'\n\nMcCarthy said the former President could count on his support.\n\n'That's an endorsement?' Costa asked.\n\n'I will support the president. I will support President Trump,' McCarthy responded.\n\nOn the possibility of serving in a Trump cabinet, the former speaker said he would do so 'in the right position' and if he was 'the best person for the job.'\n\n'Look, I worked with President Trump on a lot of policies. We worked together to win the majority,' he said, characterizing their relationship as one 'where we're very honest with one another.'\n\nMcCarthy first took office in the House in 2007 and quickly climbed the ranks.  He won speakership during the 15th round of votes in January after facing continuous opposition from some hardline Republicans.\n\nThe California Rep. was ousted from his role as speaker in a historic turn of events that saw eight Republicans vote in favor of the motion to vacate\n\nThe unprecedented ouster marked the first time that the chamber voted out a speaker. McCarthy announced that he will be leaving Congress altogether at the end of the month\n\nHowever, his opponents' frustration grew amid debt ceiling negotiations with President Joe Biden.\n\nMembers of the House Freedom Caucus blasted McCarthy for agreeing to a plan that didn't go far enough to curb spending as they saw it. Some labelled the compromise a 'betrayal.'\n\nThe final straw was McCarthy's handling of the appropriations process as a government shutdown loomed.\n\nWith government funding levels set to expire at the end of September and zero spending bills passed in the lower chamber, McCarthy decided to introduce a stopgap measure to extend government funding through mid-November.\n\nUltraconservative members of the Republican caucus insisted they weren't afraid of a shutdown if necessary. The measure only passed in the lower chamber due to Democratic support.\n\nDays later, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz introduced a motion that would remove McCarthy from his position as speaker. The motion to table the bill, or set it aside, failed, leading to a vote on the motion to vacate.\n\nIt passed with a final tally of 216-210. After serving for 269 days, McCarthy's tenure came to an end on October 3.\n\nThe California Republican said it only became clear to him he would be ousted moments before the historic vote.\n\n'I called my leadership team, I said, \"We're not going to win this one,\"' he told Dailymail.com in an exclusive interview last month. 'And I told them, \"I'm not going to run again.\"'\n\nMcCarthy faced opposition from hardline Republicans throughout his tenure as speaker, but the final straw came when he introduced a motion to prevent a government shutdown in September\n\nDays later, Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz introduced a motion to vacate that passed with a final tally of 216-210\n\nAfter he was relieved of his duties as speaker, McCarthy slammed the eight House Republicans who voted against him, accusing them of siding with Democrats and 'disrupting government.'\n\nThe Republicans who voted in favor of removing McCarthy were Andy Biggs of Arizona , Ken Buck of Colorado , Tim Burchett of Tennessee , Eli Crane of Arizona, Matt Gaetz of Florida , Bob Good of Virginia, Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Matt Rosendale of Montana .\n\nIt was the first time in history that the chamber had voted out a speaker - and it came as a victory for Gaetz, who filed the motion against McCarthy after months of threats and jabs.\n\nOn December 6, following McCarthy's announcement that he was leaving Congress altogether, Gaetz quipped in a tweet: 'McLeavin'.'\n\nThe House Republican majority will shrink to two following the expulsion of New York Rep. George Santos. The special election for that seat is February 13.\n\nMcCarthy told Dailymail.com he didn't need a 'title' to continue representing the American public and help the country 'move forward.'\n\n'One thing about me is I never give up,' McCarthy said.\n\n'Everywhere I go, people walk up and say to me, \"what happened to you is not right,\"' he said. 'You know, you can't look backwards. You've gotta look forward.'\n\nHe added: 'I'm very proud of what we were able to accomplish in such a short amount of time.'\n\nIn an exclusive interview last month, McCarthy told Dailymail.com he didn't need a 'title' to continue representing the American public\n\nMcCarthy's successor, Louisiana Rep. Mike Johnson, was elected unanimously after thirteen failed candidates and four floor votes\n\nLouisiana Rep. Mike Johnson was unanimously selected as McCarthy's successor after 22 days, thirteen failed candidates, four nominees and four floor votes.\n\nJohnson is a father-of-four who entered Congress in 2017 and is serving his fourth term.\n\nThe Louisiana Republican is a staunch Trump supporter, having earned the former president's backing in his reelections since 2016 and attended multiple rallies.\n\nHe opposed the certification of the 2020 presidential election results and took the lead in filing a brief in a lawsuit that sought to overturn Biden's victory. The congressman was also a member of Trump's impeachment defense team.\n\nIn his interview with Dailymail.com, McCarthy advised Johnson on the best way to lead the GOP conference, stating: 'Bring in a psychiatrist for many of these members.'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

Matt Gaetz has 'personal' issues after the Florida Republican moved to oust him, and added that he doesn't need the help of Democrats to stay in the speaker's office as the House prepares to vote on his fate Tuesday afternoon.\n\n'Matt Gaetz had planned to do this from the very beginning,' McCarthy told CNBC's 'Squawk Box.' 'He has personal things in his life that he has challenges with. That's fine.'\n\nMcCarthy and some of his allies have claimed Gaetz's animosity toward him is from the Florida Republican 's belief that the speaker played a role in an Ethics Committee investigation into allegations about sexual misconduct on Gaetz's part. McCarthy has said repeatedly he doesn't get involved in ethics complaints.\n\nGaetz on Monday evening presented a 'motion to vacate,' a legislative maneuver that would result in the ousting of the speaker if a majority of the House approves it. The vote could happen around 1:30pm ET on Tuesday afternoon.\n\nSpeaker Kevin McCarthy said Rep. Matt Gaetz has 'personal issues' and noted he expected to survive the challenge to his speakership\n\nBut McCarthy thinks he'll survive the challenge .\n\n'I'm an optimist. I put money on myself,' he said.\n\nHe indicated Gaetz's move is persona.\n\nThe rules of the House allow for any single lawmaker - Democrat or Republican - to make a 'motion to vacate the chair,' essentially an attempt to oust the speaker from that leadership post through a privileged resolution.\n\nGaetz filed it on Monday evening and the House has two legislative days to vote on it.\n\nNext steps:  McCarthy allies will likely seek to block it by offering a 'motion to table'- or set aside - the resolution.\n\nThat is where Democrats can help save McCarthy, if they support the a move to table the matter.\n\nDemocrats don't have to vote yes to help McCarthy. They could simply vote present, or not show up at all, and that would lower the threshold McCarthy needs to block the motion.\n\nIf McCarthy's allies fail to table the motion, the House would then move to a vote on removing McCarthy.\n\nAgain, Democrats could save him by voting in his support or just by voting present or being absent.\n\nIf Gaetz's motion succeeds, the speakership would be vacated and the House would then need to hold a new election.\n\nA speaker candidate would need to win a majority of votes from those lawmakers present and voting. In January it took McCarthy 15 rounds of votes to secure the speakership.\n\n'He's been blaming me for some for an ethics complaint against him that happened in the last Congress ,' McCarthy noted.\n\n'I have nothing to do with he wants me to try to wipe that away. I'm not going to do that. That's illegal. And you know what, if some way I lose my job because I uphold the law because I uphold the continuity of government. So be it.'\n\nThe crucial votes will likely come down to Democrats, meaning Democratic Leader Hakeem Jeffries and his caucus have to make a tough choice: save McCarthy and stay with the speaker they know or vote for his ouster and see who winds up with the votes from Republicans to be in the speaker's chair.\n\nJeffries and McCarthy spoke on Monday night.\n\nMcCarthy told CNBC the two men have a good relationship but added: 'I'm not asking for any special deal or anything else.'\n\n'Democrats have not asked for anything and I'm not going to provide anything,' he noted.\n\nHe did, however, note, the Nancy Pelosi, the longtime speaker of the House, doesn't support the option to use a motion to vacate.\n\nMcCarthy pointed out that Pelosi said 'that she would always vote it down, not based upon saving an individual but based upon what's good for government, what's good for the institution as a whole.'\n\n'And that's the question as to be are we now in a situation in our government that we just provided keeping government open, that we're going to play politics with how you become speaker? If that's the case, then I think we've got real problems.'\n\nJeffries said on Tuesday morning that 'this is a vote on conscious in many ways.' He said the party would come to a collective decision at their meeting that morning.\n\nIt's unclear how much support McCarthy would get from Democrats, who have trust issues with him and are frustrated with his longtime support of Donald Trump - even in the aftermath of the January 6th insurrection.\n\n'I am not a cheap date,' said Democratic Representative James McGovern.\n\n'I am one Democrat not in much of a mood to help him out,' said Democratic Representative Jamie Raskin. 'MAGA Republicans have to solve the problems that MAGA Republicans create.'\n\nAnd some Democrats see McCarthy in a mess of his own making by agreeing to conservative's demand that a single lawmaker can propose a motion to oust the speaker.\n\n'Do we side with a sociopath or an incompetent?' said Democratic Rep. Mark Pocan. 'I don ́t know?'\n\nBut other Democrats worry using such a motion could paralyze the House and set a dangerous precedent against future speakers.\n\nGaetz's move Monday is the first time a 'motion to vacate' has been used against a speaker.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz filed a motion to remove Kevin McCarthy as speaker\n\nDemocrats, led by Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (above), will likely be the ones to decide McCarthy's fate\n\nWith Republicans holding a narrow majority of four seats, Gaetz only needs four other Republicans to join him to trigger a new election for speaker.\n\nDemocrats, in addition to voting to save McCarthy by supporting a move to table the motion to vacate or they could simply vote present, which would raise the threshhold of GOP votes that Gaetz would need for victory.\n\nGaetz charges McCarthy with breaking his word to conservatives on spending deals and how he would run the House.\n\nMcCarthy's allies say it's a personal vendetta, pointing to the Ethics committee looking into several allegations against Gaetz, including illicit drug use, sexual misconduct and misusing campaign funds.\n\nAnd some charge Gaetz with trying to garner attention ahead of a plan to run for Florida governor.\n\nGaetz was easily able to make his move to oust McCarthy because of a deal made back in January when McCarthy was trying to secure enough Republican votes to be speaker. To garner enough support from the conservative wing of the party, McCarthy agreed to their demand to give them the ability to call a quick vote to 'vacate the chair' and remove him from office.\n\nGaetz, in remarks on the House floor in Monday, charged McCarthy with a 'secret deal' with Democrats to fund Ukraine. Many conservative Republicans want to end U.S. aid to the war-torn country.\n\nMcCarthy denied the charge, saying there's no secret plan.\n\nGaetz, meanwhile, noted of McCarthy: 'If he's able to stay in power, it will be him working for the Democrats, continuing to do their bidding. So this is a revealing exercise, and I think it will show the country who's really in charge.'\n\n'I have enough Republicans where at this point next week, one of two things will happen: Kevin McCarthy won ́t be the speaker of the House or he ́ll be the speaker of the House working at the pleasure of the Democrats,' Gaetz said.\n\nMcCarthy responded to matter on social media, writing on X: 'Bring it on.'\n\nGaetz soon retorted in a post, 'Just did.'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

      "text": "'I haven't heard Gaetz say one true thing': Defiant Kevin McCarthy rips into Florida Republican, claims eight colleagues who voted to oust him are not real conservatives and hints he could RESIGN from Congress in combative press conference\n\nBy EMILY GOODIN, SENIOR U.S. POLITICAL REPORTER and MORGAN PHILLIPS, POLITICS REPORTER FOR DAILYMAIL.COM\n\nPublished: 18:56 EDT, 3 October 2023 | Updated: 22:40 EDT, 3 October 2023\n\n1.4k\n\nView comments\n\nKevin McCarthy will not make another bid for Speaker of the House after he was ousted from the job in a historic vote on Tuesday sparked by a tumultuous civil war in the Republican Party.\n\nHe made the announcement on Tuesday evening, a few hours after eight GOP lawmakers joined Democrats to boot him from his leadership spot.\n\n'I will not run for speaker again,' McCarthy said in a nearly hour-long press conference that veered from combative to laugh filled.\n\n'I may have lost the vote today. But as I walk out of this chamber, I feel fortunate to have served the American people,' he said. 'I leave the speakership with a sense of pride and accomplishment. And yes optimism.'\n\nIn his remarks, he slammed Democrats, particularly their longtime leader Nancy Pelosi , and his nemieis, conservative Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz , who led the move to remove him from the speaker's office.\n\nMcCarthy's bombshell decision will open the floodgates for Republican candidates and could lead to weeks of turmoil among the party as Congress faces a November 17th deadline to prevent another government shutdown.\n\nHouse Republicans met behind closed doors on Tuesday night to discuss the fallout from the historic vote that resulted in McCarthy, R-Calif., becoming the first Speaker in the 234-year history of the United States Congress to have his gavel taken away by fellow lawmakers.\n\n'Unfortunately, four percent of our conference can join all the Democrats and dictate who can be the Republican Speaker in this House,' he said. 'I don't think that rule is good for the institution, but apparently I'm the only one.'\n\n'I wouldn't change a thing,' he noted.\n\nKevin McCarthy says he won't run for speaker again and 'I wouldn't change a thing'\n\nA motion to vacate the speaker's chair was adopted 216 to 210 on Monday afternoon.\n\nMcCarthy ally Rep. Patrick McHenry , chair of the Financial Services Committee, was named as the interim Speaker, but now the GOP will launch a marathon bid to pick a successor .\n\nThere is no clear frontrunner for the job.\n\nMcHenry told GOP lawmakers they will hold a candidate forum next Tuesday and an election for speaker next Wednesday.\n\nMcCarthy, who won the speakership in January after 15 rounds of votes, will not be on the ballot again. He wouldn't even confirm he'll stay in Congress.\n\n'I'll look at that,' he said.\n\nHe said he was removed because of politics and blamed Democrats even though the move to oust him was led by Gaetz.\n\n'I think today was a political decision by the Democrats. And I think I think the things they have done in the past hurt the institution,' McCarthy said.\n\nHe said he spoke to Nancy Pelosi during his marathon speaker campaign and told her about conservatives demand he change the House rules so a single lawmaker could propose the motion to 'vacate the chair,' which is the first move to oust the speaker.\n\nMcCarthy said Pelosi told him to give in to conservatives and told him she would always back him up. McCarthy did and Gaetz used the move to remove him from the speakership.\n\nHis rambling press conference, where he took question after question, at time seemed more like a therapy session. McCarthy, free from the burdens of leadership, let loose on his feelings about his rivals.\n\nMcCarthy described the eight Republicans who voted for his ouster as not real conservatives.\n\n'I don't think it says about the Republican Party. I think it says something about some people who are not a conservative,' he said of the vote.\n\nHe also tore into Gaetz.\n\n'It was personal,' he said of Gaetz's move to oust him. 'It had nothing to do about spending.'\n\nHe said it was all about 'getting attention.'\n\n'I mean, we're getting email fundraisers from him as he's doing this,' he noted.\n\nGaetz and McCarthy have been locked in an epic power struggle all year, since it took McCarthy 15 rounds of votes in January to secure the speakership.\n\n'Just because Gaetz said something don't believe it's true. I haven't heard him say one true thing yet,' McCarthy noted.\n\n'Wait for my book,' he added to laughter.\n\nGaetz charges McCarthy with breaking his word to conservatives on spending deals and how he would run the House, saying that is why he moved to oust him.\n\nMcCarthy's allies say it's a personal vendetta, pointing to the House Ethics committee looking into several allegations against Gaetz, including illicit drug use, sexual misconduct and misusing campaign funds.\n\nNo decisions on the next Republican leader will be made in the coming days.\n\nHouse members are done for the week and headed home. 'Members have been advised that no further votes are expected in the House this week,' came the notice from the Whip's office.\n\nSeveral names have been tossed out as potential speakers, including members of McCarthy's own leadership team like Steve Scalise and Tom Emmer.\n\nConservative Rep. Jim Jordan previously said he wasn't interested in the top job. But after his Republican colleagues banded his name about on Tuesday evening he appeared to reconsider.\n\n'That will be a decision for the conference,' Jordan said after the meeting when asked about running for speaker.\n\nMcCarthy said he would consider endorsing a successor but wanted to see who was running first.\n\nHis advice for the next speaker: 'Change the rules.'\n\nGaetz also suggested Reps. Mike Johnson, Kevin Hern and Jodey Arrington for the top job. He even suggested he 'might call up' former New York GOP Rep. Lee Zeldin.\n\nThe speaker doesn't have to be a member of the House. That led to Rep. Troy Nehls saying he'll be nominating Donald Trump for speaker.\n\nHowever, Trump wouldn't be able to be speaker and president so it seems unlikely he would want to lead the House given he's running for a second White House term.\n\nNo candidate has formally announced - yet.\n\nOther Republicans have ruled themselves out as a candidate. Rep. Elise Stefanik, the highest-ranking GOP woman, said she won't run.\n\nHouse Democrats will meet Wednesday morning to nominate their own candidate for speaker. They are expected to name Hakeem Jeffries, their leader who ran (and lost) for speaker in January.\n\nA pile of pizzas is delivered to House Republicans on Tuesday night\n\nMcCarthy is swarmed by reporters after a vote to oust him from the speaker's chair\n\nFlorida Republican Rep. Matt Gaetz leaves the House floor after his motion to vacate ousted the speaker\n\nThe humiliating end for McCarthy, 58, sent shockwaves across Capitol Hill and secured his title as the shortest-serving Speaker since 1875 , following a rollercoaster tenure of nine months.\n\nIt left Democrats quietly shaking their heads as they left the House chamber. Lawmakers packed the House floor for the vote and, instead of standing in groups to chat like is typical during a vote, each sat in their seat in silence, waiting for their name to be called so they could record their vote.\n\nMcCarthy sat quietly after the vote was done. When the gavel came down on his speakership, he stood to shake hands. His supporters surrounded him. One group of Republican lawmakers was seen in the corner of the floor praying. Republican Rep. Ann Wagner appeared to be crying.\n\nMcCarthy was seen shaking hands and hugging his supporters on the House floor after the stinging loss.\n\nThe vote had moments of surprises including when Republican Rep. Nancy Mace of South Carolina stunned her colleagues by voting to boot McCarthy from leadership.\n\nThe free-wheeling congresswoman said her vote was about 'trust.'\n\n'It's not ideological. It's about having a leader in our nation who will tell the truth, who you can trust,' she told DailyMail.com. 'I am looking for a speaker who will tell the truth.'\n\nBut in January she tweeted that Gaetz is a 'fraud' for his McCarthy opposition.\n\nKevin McCarthy has been sensationally ousted as Speaker of the House in a historic vote sparked by a tumultuous civil war in the Republican party\n\nRep. Patrick McHenry was named speaker pro temp and said Republicans would meet next week to pick their next speaker\n\nAfter the GOP leader's tenure came crashing down Republicans were left reeling as they tried to stave off a potential government shutdown next month.\n\nMcCarthy's supporters called him a 'happy warrior' with 'true American grit'.\n\nBut, speaking on the House floor, Gaetz said: 'Chaos is speaker McCarthy. Chaos is somebody who we cannot trust with their word.\n\n'One thing that the White House, House Democrats, and many of us on the conservative side of the Republican caucus would argue is that the thing we have in common - Kevin McCarthy said something to all of us at one point or another that he didn't really mean and never intended to live up to.\n\n'I don't think voting against Kevin McCarthy is chaos. I think $33 trillion in debt is chaos. I think that facing a $2.2 trillion annual deficit is chaos.'\n\nHe added: 'Let's get on with it, lets vacate the chair, let's get a better Speaker.'\n\nMcCarthy's supporters booed and jeered at Gaetz as he tore into the Speaker ahead of the vote that officially removed him.\n\nRepublicans control the chamber by a narrow 221-212 majority, meaning it took only a handful of defections to remove McCarthy.\n\nIt came after a rebellion led by his nemesis, Florida congressman Matt Gaetz , and a small group of hardline Republicans who viewed McCarthy as a weak conservative\n\nSteve Scalise was one of the Republicans who came out in support of McCarthy\n\nMcCarthy's supporters called him a 'happy warrior' with 'true American grit'\n\nGaetz and his allies criticized McCarthy for relying on Democratic votes to pass temporary funding that headed off a partial government shutdown last week.\n\nThey also said he had not pushed hard enough to cut spending, and was too willing to send money to Ukraine.\n\nThe anti-McCarthy Republicans have not coalesced around one alternative they'd like to put up for speaker.\n\nGaetz said he 'absolutely does not' want the top job.\n\nHe said Monday night he'd like to see Majority Leader Steve Scalise, who is battling blood cancer, in the role, but seemed open to other options.\n\nRep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., told reporters there are 'plenty of people' who would do the job better than McCarthy.\n\nBurchett also said he wanted a speaker who didn't want the job so badly.\n\nHe said last week he had a conversation with McCarthy and 'the last thing he said was \"I really wanna be speaker\". And I think that sums up the whole thing ... it's not about one person.'\n\nFormer President Trump seemed to disapprove of the drama playing out in the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nHe said: 'Why is it that Republicans are always fighting among themselves, why aren't they fighting the Radical Left Democrats who are destroying our Country?'\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

      "text": "Kevin McCarthy launches bombshell Biden IMPEACHMENT inquiry: Speaker accuses president of a 'culture of corruption' and 'abuse of power' over Hunter's shady foreign business deals\n\nBy EMILY GOODIN, SENIOR U.S. POLITICAL REPORTER\n\nPublished: 10:31 EDT, 12 September 2023 | Updated: 16:29 EDT, 12 September 2023\n\n2.8k\n\nView comments\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy officially announced he will begin an impeachment inquiry into Joe Biden in a shock statement accusing the president of an 'abuse of power and being involved in a 'culture of corruption' over son Hunter's foreign business deals.\n\n'House Republicans have uncovered serious and credible allegations into President Biden's conduct,' McCarthy said, speaking at the Capitol. 'Taken together these allegations paint a picture of a culture of corruption.'\n\n'These are allegations of abuse of power, obstruction and corruption. And they warrant further investigation by the House of Representatives . That's why today I am directing our House committee to open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden,' he noted.\n\n'This logical next step will give our committees, the full power to gather all the facts and answers for the American public. That's exactly what we want to know the answers.'\n\nRepublicans have charged Biden and his family made millions off shell companies Hunter Biden formed when his father was vice president. Hunter had business deals with an energy company in the Ukraine, received a discounted stake in a private-equity firm in China , and did consulting for a Romanian real-estate magnate.\n\nThe president has denied any involvement in his son's business dealings. But Republicans claim at least a dozen Biden family members could be involved in a scheme to benefit financially from Biden's public office.\n\nHouse investigators are expected to issue subpoenas for the bank records of the president and his family. The GOP also claim Biden sat in on at least 24 calls with Hunter's business partners and was referred to as 'the big guy' by Hunter's business associates. And they say Joe Biden used pseudonyms to discuss his activities related to Ukraine with his son Hunter during his time as vice president.\n\nSpeaker Kevin McCarthy, facing heavy pressure from the right wing of the Republican Party, will launch an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden\n\nAn inquiry is the first step in the impeachment process. It is when evidence is gathered for the articles, or charges, of impeachment against an official.\n\nIt is a massive step with many pitfalls, including infuriating Republican moderates and many GOP senators, who are skeptical of the issue and causing friction with the White House as budget negotiations are underway . Congress faces a September 30th deadline to fund the government or it will shutdown.\n\nMcCarthy, however, is under intense pressure from the conservative wing of his party to make such a move, including threats from some of his own GOP lawmakers to remove him from the speakership.\n\nThe White House has repeatedly denied Biden has conducted any wrongdoing. The president himself has said he was not involved with any of Hunter's business deals.\n\nSome of Hunter's former associates, however, have testified that Joe Biden spoke to Hunter's business associates but the president's defenders say it was quick conversation and merely cordial, not related to any dealmaking.\n\nJoe Biden also used various private email addresses from which he would sometimes send, receive and forward government correspondence according to emails found on Hunter Biden's now-infamous laptop.\n\n'Robin Ware,' 'Robert L. Peters' and 'JRB ware' were three pseudonyms used on emails that were about both official and family business.\n\nThe White House argues it's common for public figures to use false names.\n\nMcCarthy charged Biden was involved.\n\n'Eye witnesses have testified that the President joined on multiple phone calls, and had multiple interactions, dinners, resulted in cars and millions of dollars into his son's and his son's business partners,' he said.\n\nIt's estimated Hunter raked in $40 million through 20 shell companies and fake accounts created while Joe Biden was vice president, at the same time the elder Biden was joining Hunter's business calls and stopping by at lavish dinners.\n\nThe White House called McCarthy's move 'extreme politics.'\n\n'House Republicans have been investigating the President for 9 months, and they've turned up no evidence of wrongdoing. His own Republican members have said so. He vowed to hold a vote to open impeachment, now he flip flopped because he doesn't have support. This is extreme politics at its worst,' White House spokesperson for oversight and investigations Ian Sams said in a statement.\n\nPresident Joe Biden has denied any involvement with Hunter Biden's business dealings - above the two men on the Truman balcony with Hunter's son Beau on July 4th\n\nThe speaker justified his decision, claiming Biden's family got special treatment from the government.\n\n'It appears that the president's family has been offered special treatment by Biden's own administration - treatment that not otherwise would have received if they were not related to the President,' he noted.\n\nHe did not specify how the Bidens got special treatment but House Republicans have demanded records from the Justice, State, and Treasury Departments as part of their probe. Hunter is under investigation by a special counsel and faced an IRS investigation about his taxes.\n\nHunter Biden has denied any wrong doing.\n\nHouse Republicans have been investigating the president and his family since they took control of the lower chamber in January.\n\nRepublican Rep. James Comer, chairman of the Oversight Committee, claims there could be upwards of 12 Biden family members who benefitted from influence peddling by the president and Hunter.\n\nWhile most names have not yet been revealed, Comer previously said that suspicious activity reports (SARs) reviewed by Republicans on the panel have found that President Biden's brother Jim Biden and his son Beau's widow Hallie Biden benefited from foreign business deals.\n\nComer accused Hallie Biden of influence peddling by receiving a $35,000 payment linked to a Chinese firm.\n\nThe reports from earlier this year claimed that Hallie received a cut of the $3 million from China sent to an associate of Hunter Biden, whom she dated from 2016-2019 after her husband Beau died of brain cancer.\n\nThe White House, at the time, released a blistering statement accusing Republicans of orchestrating an 'attack' on Hallie.\n\nMembers of the Biden family could get dragged into the impeachment probe.\n\n'We know that bank records show that nearly $20 million in payments were directed to the Biden family members and associates through various shale companies,' McCarthy said on Tuesday.\n\nComer alleged that President Joe Biden's brother James 'Jim' Biden was among those who benefitted or were involved in foreign influence peddling\n\nRepublicans subpoenaed bank records and released documents purporting to show that Hallie Biden (right) received a cut of $3 million in cash from China\n\nWhen House Republicans meet on Thursday behind closed doors in the Capitol , the two committee chairmen leading the probes of the Biden family - Reps. Jim Jordan of the Judiciary Committee and Comer - will lay out their findings thus far.\n\nJordan, Comer and Republican Rep. Jason Smith of the Ways and Means Committee will lead the probe.\n\n'I do not make this decision lightly,' McCarthy said Tuesday.\n\n'I would encourage the President and his team to fully cooperate with this investigation,' he added. 'We are committed to getting the answers for the American public. Nothing more, nothing less. We will go wherever the evidence takes us.'\n\nThree separate Republican-led committees have investigated allegations that Hunter Biden leveraged his father's vice presidency to secure foreign business deals that made the family a mint.\n\nHunter is already facing legal issues. Federal prosecutors plan to indict Hunter on illegal gun charges that have a maximum sentence of 10 years in jail by the end of September.\n\nDavid Weiss, a U.S. attorney appointed by then-President Donald Trump, has been leading the Justice Department probe into the first son. He was given special counsel status last month amid concerns from Republicans that Weiss didn't have the authority to conduct a proper investigation.\n\nAn impeachment inquiry could mean Hunter is brought before Congress to answer questions.\n\nMcCarthy, in announcing the inquiry, is using his unilateral power as speaker to begin the impeachment process. Nancy Pelosi did the same when she was speaker to begin both of Donald Trump's impeachments.\n\nThe entire House could vote to begin impeachment proceedings but there were questions as whether McCarthy could wrangle the 218 votes from House Republicans to authorize it. Some moderate GOP lawmakers have been skeptical of the need for an impeachment inquiry.\n\nSo far, House Republicans have uncovered no evidence that Joe Biden has personally profited off his son Hunter's business arrangements.\n\nConservative Republican Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida (left) and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia (right) are among those threatening Speaker McCarthy\n\nMcCarthy said last month that an impeachment inquiry would only happen with a formal House vote.\n\n'To open an impeachment inquiry is a serious matter, and House Republicans would not take it lightly or use it for political purposes. The American people deserve to be heard on this matter through their elected representatives,' McCarthy told Breitbart News\n\n'That's why, if we move forward with an impeachment inquiry, it would occur through a vote on the floor of the People's House and not through a declaration by one person.'\n\nIn a full House vote, he'd only be able to lose five Republicans. Some had already cast doubt.\n\nModerate Republican Reps. Ken Buck of Colorado and Don Bacon of Nebraska have voiced skepticism of the impeachment inquiry.\n\nOther Republicans have questioned the timing. An impeachment inquiry could backfire politically, firing up Democratic and swing voters in Biden's favor as the next year's presidential election gets closer.\n\nFormer President Donald Trump successfully used his impeachments to rally his base and raise millions for his political fundraising committees.\n\nBut McCarthy is facing other threats.\n\nRepublican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a close Trump ally, has said she wouldn't vote to fund the government without an impeachment inquiry against Biden.\n\nRepublican Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida, another ally of the former president, has said if McCarthy stands in the way of the impeachment process, he'd move to remove him from the speakership.\n\nHe doubled down on that threat on Tuesday.\n\nSpeaking on the House floor shortly after McCarthy announced the impeachment inquiry into the president Gaetz warned: 'Focus on balanced budgets and term limits, subpoenas for Hunter Biden...and impeachment for Joe Biden...Do these things or face a motion to vacate the chair.'\n\nMcCarthy became speaker after a deal with the conservative wing of the Republican Party issued a list of demands - including the ability to call a quick vote to 'vacate the chair' and remove him from office.\n\nNow that threat hangs over McCarthy's every move like the sword of damocles.\n\nThe speaker is also dealing with a ticking clock when it comes to avoiding a government shutdown.\n\nIf Congress doesn't pass a bill to fund the government by the end of the month, there will be a partial shutdown. Given the Congressional schedule, there are just 11 working days to do that.\n\nThe White House has suggested passing a temporary resolution to keep the government open through the end of the year while negotiations continue.\n\nMcCarthy is trying to float a 30-day stopgap measure that would keep things running until  Nov. 1, but conservatives are balking at what's called a continuing resolution.\n\nThe White House has requested that resolution contain $16 billion in disaster relief funds and $24 billion for the Ukraine. Many Republicans want to cut off funding for the Ukraine.\n\nShare what you think\n\nThe comments below have not been moderated.\n\nThe views expressed in the contents above are those of our users and do not necessarily reflect the views of MailOnline.\n\nWe are no longer accepting comments on this article.\n\nPublished by Associated Newspapers Ltd\n\nPart of the Daily Mail, The Mail on Sunday & Metro Media Group"

Mutual Fund and ETF data provided by Refinitiv Lipper .\n\nKevin McCarthy is an American politician who presently serves California's 20th congressional district and previously served as the 55th speaker of the United States House of Representatives. His time as speaker of the House was cut short when the House voted him out and stripped him of the position on Oct. 3, 2023. He first served as a representative of California's 22nd Congressional district from 2007 until 2013 and also represented the state's 23rd district before serving the 20th district.\n\nPreviously, from 2014 until 2019, McCarthy served as House Majority Leader under former GOP Speakers of the House John Boehner and Paul Ryan. McCarthy is a longtime conservative politician with the Republican Party from California. While in college, he was the chair of the California Young Republicans and led the Young Republican National Federation. Moreover, prior to joining the U.S. Congress, McCarthy enjoyed a prominent career in California statewide politics. He served in the state assembly from 2002 to 2006 and was the minority leader for the Republicans from 2004 to 2006.\n\nAfter being elected to Congress, McCarthy soon climbed the ranks of leadership within the House GOP during his second term, first as the Republican Chief Deputy Whip from 2009 until 2011. After the 2010 midterm elections that saw the GOP take control of the House, McCarthy became the majority whip, serving from 2011 until 2014. However, when Eric Cantor was defeated by a Tea Party conservative challenger in 2014, McCarthy replaced him as Majority Whip. After Democrats retook the House in 2018, McCarthy was elected minority leader after former Speaker Ryan retired.\n\nFrom 2019 until January 2023, McCarthy served as House Minority Leader. McCarthy's ascent to the speakership was marred by opposition as members of his own party failed to elect him until the 15th ballot on Jan. 7, 2023.\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy discusses Democrats' 2026 midterm strategy on 'The Ingraham Angle.'\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy discusses the U.S. House passing a budget framework on 'Sunday Night in America.'\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy praises Elon Musk's work and condemns attacks against Tesla on 'The Ingraham Angle.'\n\nDebate over representatives voting in person or remotely is one that has been debated for recent years, especially after the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy weighs in after former White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre defended President Biden from recent criticism.\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy discusses Democrats' criticism of Elon Musk on 'The Ingraham Angle.'\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy helps launch public affairs firm Watchtower Strategy, according to a press release.\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy discusses President Donald Trump's first few days in office and his trips to North Carolina and California on 'Sunday Night in America.'\n\nFormer House Speaker Kevin McCarthy analyzes President Donald Trump closing diversity, equity, and inclusion offices and pardoning January 6 protesters on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'\n\nGOP lawmaker Kevin McCarthy clashed with NBC hosts during a contentious interview where he pointed to an alleged double standard against President Trump.\n\nThis material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten, or redistributed. ©2025 FOX News Network, LLC.

The final vote was 216 to 210 in favor of McCarthy's ouster.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., introduced a measure against McCarthy known as a motion to vacate on Monday night, accusing him of breaking promises he made to win the speaker's gavel in January.\n\nTensions flared during an hour of debate before the actual motion to vacate, after 11 Republicans voted with every Democrat to advance the measure. McCarthy's allies had taken up all of the microphones on the GOP side of the chamber, forcing Gaetz to make his case from the side where Democrats traditionally sit.\n\n\"Chaos is Speaker McCarthy. Chaos is somebody who we cannot trust with their word,\" Gaetz said as McCarthy looked down at his lap.\n\nLawmakers have voted to oust Speaker Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., from his leadership role, the first time in the history of the House of Representatives that the chamber voted to boot a member from the top job. (Anna Moneymaker / Getty Images)\n\nAt one point, an outraged McCarthy ally, Rep. Garret Graves, R-La., accused Gaetz and his cohorts of sending fundraising efforts on their motion to vacate. He fumed while pointing to his phone, \"Using official actions to make money, it's disgusting.\"\n\nChants of \"shame\" erupted on the House GOP side of the chamber.\n\nGaetz responded, \"When it comes to how those raise money, I take no lecture on asking patriotic Americans to weigh in and contribute to this fight from those who would grovel and bend knee for the lobbyists and special interests who own our leadership.\"\n\nA Republican lawmaker shouted at Gaetz, \"You're no martyr.\"\n\nDemocrats signaled early on Tuesday that they would not be inclined to help McCarthy. House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, D-N.Y., said before the vote that Democrats \"are ready to find bipartisan common ground. Our extreme colleagues have shown no willingness to do the same. They must find a way to end the House Republican civil war.\"\n\nIn January, it took 15 rounds of voting until McCarthy was elected.\n\nMcCarthy angered hardliners over the weekend when he passed a short-term spending bill known as a continuing resolution (CR) to keep the government open for 45 days in order to avert a government shutdown and give lawmakers more time to cobble together 12 individual spending bills.\n\nRep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., introduced the motion to vacate McCarthy. (AP Photo / J. Scott Applewhite)\n\nNinety House Republicans voted against the CR on Saturday, arguing that it was a \"clean\" extension of the previous Democrat-held Congress' policies. But the speaker's previous attempts to put a CR on the table that would cut spending for its short duration were upended by several of those same conservatives who were opposed to any such measure on principle.\n\nThe frustration at the small number of rebels was palpable among House Republicans on Tuesday morning.\n\n\"This is a distraction from what we should be focusing on, which is the appropriations process,\" said Main Street Caucus Vice Chair Stephanie Bice, R-Okla. \"This is all about Matt Gaetz. It's not about Kevin McCarthy. Matt Gaetz is using the American people as pawns in his narcissistic game of charades.\"\n\nElizabeth Elkind is a politics reporter for Fox News Digital leading coverage of the House of Representatives.

There was no reason to do it - NOTHING WAS GAINED, and we got nothing for it - A major reason why that Speakership was lost. It was Biden's problem, not ours. Now it becomes ours,\" Trump declared in the post.\n\nDEBT CEILING IS 'LAST TOOL' IN DEMOCRATS' TOOLBOX TO OBSTRUCT TRUMP AGENDA: KAROLINE LEAVITT\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and U.S. President Donald Trump attend a legislation signing rally with local farmers on Feb. 19, 2020, in Bakersfield, California. ( David McNew/Getty Images)\n\n\"I call it '1929' because the Democrats don't care what our Country may be forced into. In fact, they would prefer 'Depression' as long as it hurt the Republican Party. The Democrats must be forced to take a vote on this treacherous issue NOW, during the Biden Administration, and not in June. They should be blamed for this potential disaster, not the Republicans!\" he added.\n\nA deal passed by Congress and signed by President Joe Biden last year suspended the debt limit through Jan. 1, 2025, but Trump has been calling for the ceiling to be increased before he takes office.\n\n\"In June 2023, the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 was enacted, suspending the debt limit through January 1, 2025.  On January 2, 2025, the new debt limit will be established at the amount of outstanding debt subject to the statutory limit at the end of the previous day,\" Treasury Sec. Janet Yellen wrote in a recent letter to congressional leaders. \"Treasury currently expects to reach the new limit between January 14 and January 23, at which time it will be necessary for Treasury to start taking extraordinary measures. I respectfully urge Congress to act to protect the full faith and credit of the United States.\"\n\nPRESIDENT BIDEN SIGNS STOPGAP FUNDING BILL INTO LAW, NARROWLY AVERTING SHUTDOWN\n\nEarlier this month, Trump and Vice President-elect JD Vance pressed for the limit to be raised as part of a stopgap government spending proposal.\n\n\"The most foolish and inept thing ever done by Congressional Republicans was allowing our country to hit the debt ceiling in 2025. It was a mistake and is now something that must be addressed,\" the two men said in a statement. \"Increasing the debt ceiling is not great but we'd rather do it on Biden's watch. If Democrats won't cooperate on the debt ceiling now, what makes anyone think they would do it in June during our administration?\"\n\nBut the measure that eventually passed did not raise the ceiling.\n\nResponding to Trump's post about McCarthy, Rep.

Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., announced Wednesday that he will resign from his congressional seat after being ousted as House speaker.\n\nMcCarthy made the announcement in an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"No matter the odds, or personal cost, we did the right thing. That may seem out of fashion in Washington these days, but delivering results for the American people is still celebrated across the country. It is in this spirit that I have decided to depart the House at the end of this year to serve America in new ways. I know my work is only getting started,\" McCarthy wrote. \"I will continue to recruit our country's best and brightest to run for elected office. The Republican Party is expanding every day, and I am committed to lending my experience to support the next generation of leaders.\"\n\nMcCarthy surmised, \"It often seems that the more Washington does, the worse America gets. I started my career as a small-business owner, and I look forward to helping entrepreneurs and risk-takers reach their full potential. The challenges we face are more likely to be solved by innovation than legislation.\"\n\nKEVIN MCCARTHY, MATT GAETZ TRADE JABS AS FIERCE RIVALRY CONTINUES: HE 'BELONGS IN JAIL'\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., is not running for re-election, he says. (Tom Brenner for The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nHe detailed that \"the most reliable solution to what ails America is before our eyes: everyday men and women who are raising families, showing up for work, volunteering, and pursuing the American Dream with passion and purpose. I agree with President Reagan's observation that 'all great change in America starts at the dinner table.'\"\n\n\"Despite the best attempts by special interest groups and the news media to divide us, I have seen the goodness of the American people. They are what will ultimately uphold the enduring values of our great nation. We all have a role to play in that effort,\" McCarthy wrote. \"I never could have imagined the journey when I first threw my hat into the ring. I go knowing I left it all on the field - as always, with a smile on my face. And looking back, I wouldn't have had it any other way. Only in America.\"\n\nMcCarthy started the op-ed by writing, \"I'm an optimist. How could I not be?\" He went on to detail how he's the son of a firefighter and served in the same congressional seat for the last 17 years, ironically from the same office in which he was previously denied an internship.\n\nMcCarthy recalled how he helped Republicans to a House majority twice. \"We got more Republican women, veterans and minorities elected to Congress at one time than ever before,\" he wrote. \"I remained cheerfully persistent when elected speaker because I knew what we could accomplish.\"\n\nRep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., speaks to reporters hours after he was ousted as speaker of the House at the Capitol in Washington, D.C., on Oct. 3. (AP Photo/J.

We did exactly what we said we would do.\"\n\nMCCARTHY MAKES STUNNING ADMISSION ON BIDEN IMPEACHMENT INQUIRY: THE FACTS HAVE LED 'EVEN CLOSER'\n\n\"We kept our eyes on America's long-term global challenges by restoring the Intelligence Committee to its original charter and establishing a bipartisan Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party,\" McCarthy wrote. \"We reduced the deficit by more than $2 trillion, revamped work requirements for adults on the sidelines, cut red tape for critical domestic energy projects, and protected the full faith and credit of the U.S. We kept our government operating and our troops paid while wars broke out around the world.\"\n\nMcCarthy was the first House speaker to be voted out of the position in U.S. history.\n\nWith the departure of former Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., and McCarthy, the House GOP margin goes down to just two at the end of the year.\n\nAt the start of 2024, the House will have 220 sitting Republicans and 213 Democrats, with two vacancies.\n\nA 218 majority is needed to pass legislation, meaning the GOP can only afford to lose two votes to pass a bill.

Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., orchestrated the rare vote on the obscure \"motion to vacate.\" Though McCarthy maintained support from most Republicans in the House, eight GOP detractors ultimately ushered in his ouster in October, mainly taking issue with McCarthy for choosing to work with Democrats to temporarily delay a federal government shutdown.\n\nAt the start of this year, Republicans held only a fragile margin in the chamber after a predicted \"red wave\" failed to materialize in the 2022 elections.\n\nMcCarthy endured a dayslong floor fight in January that eventually resulted in his ascension to the House's top job at a time when deep divisions within the GOP raised serious questions about the party's ability to govern following former President Donald Trump leaving office.\n\nCLICK TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIt took a record 15 votes over four days for McCarthy to line up the support he needed to win the post he had long coveted, finally prevailing on a 216-212 vote with Democrats backing leader Hakeem Jeffries and six Republican holdouts voting present.

      "text": "'Broke The Democrats': McCarthy Says Democrats' Downfall Gives GOP Opportunity To Court Key Voting Blocs\n\nFormer Republican House Speaker Kevin McCarthy said Monday on Fox News that the Democrat Party's downfall could give Republicans an opportunity to court key voting blocs for the upcoming elections, including younger voters and Hispanics.\n\nPost-election polls from November 2024 show President Donald Trump gained support among once-reliable Democrat strongholds, such as black and Hispanic men. On \"Jesse Watters Primetime,\" Watters asked McCarthy what opportunity he believes Republicans have as the Democrat Party struggles to find a unifying message and leader ahead of the midterm elections.\n\n\"Well, what you see is not just President Trump win the election. He actually broke the Democrats. Think about this. The Democrats are now protesting electric vehicles. They're at the lowest favorability. They're a minority view in the Supreme Court. They can't stop any legislation, but this is the key part,\" McCarthy said.\n\n\"Gen Z, the young population, is not only probably one of the most conservative generations since the 80s, they're pro-Trump, but they're also anti-Democrat. The Hispanic population, trending Republican. Then look to the future,\" McCarthy added. \"There's only three Republicans sitting in seats in the House that Harris carried. Eight years ago, there was 23. It's a bad Senate map for the Democrats.\"\n\nWATCH:\n\nPrior to the 2024 election, New York Times/Siena College polls showed Trump leading former Vice President Kamala Harris among Gen Z men by 58% to 37%, with Harris falling behind with younger male voters despite her lead among the generation's women.\n\nMcCarthy went on to say that not only could it be \"impossible\" for Democrats to potentially win the 2028 general election, but they have not \"woken up\" to the fact that their policies are the issue for voters.\n\n\"Then the Electoral College, their liberal policies are making people move out of these blue states. You said it. It's almost gonna be impossible for the Democrats to win the presidency. They can win Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, and they would still lose,\" McCarthy said. \"They still haven't woken up. They don't realize their policies are what's driving people crazy.\"\n\nA recent CNN/SSRS poll released on March 12 said that Democrats have sunk to their lowest favorability rating of 29%, dropping 20 points since January 2021. While some Democrats have attempted to warn the party about their policies, others, like Democratic National Committee Chairman Ken Martin, have said that the party's issue isn't the policies themselves but rather a \"messaging\" and \"brand problem.\"\n\n(Featured Image Media Credit: Screenshot/Fox News/\"Jesse Watters Primetime\")\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

And I'll give you the truth about why I'm not speaker,\" he responded.\n\nThe former speaker went on:\n\n\"It's because one person, a member of Congress, wanted me to stop an ethics complaint because he slept with a 17-year-old. An ethics complaint that started before I ever became speaker. And that's illegal and I'm not going to get in the middle. Did he do it or not? I don't know. But Ethics is looking at it. There's other people in jail because of it.\"\n\nHis comment appears to be a reference to investigation by the House Ethics Committee into Gaetz involving allegations of sex crimes.\n\nPolitico notes , \"Its probe comes after the Justice Department last year closed its investigation into the Florida representative without filing charges.

In the wake of remarks by President Donald Trump that he would accept compromising information about a political opponent from a foreign power, McCarthy said that he would support legislation proposed by Democrats that would require people to report to the FBI if they are approached with offers of that information. (Photo by Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images)\n\nHouse Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy made it clear. The California congressman wants to be elevated to speaker of the House if the Republicans get majority control of the U.S House of Representatives once the 2022 midterm elections are finalized.\n\nIt could be goodbye, Nancy Pelosi .\n\nHowever, McCarthy should not be measuring the drapes for his new office just yet.\n\nThe final outcomes of many House races were still pending on Friday morning, although Republicans seem on track to get more than the 218 members needed for a majority. But as far as the speakership goes, not everyone shares McCarthy's opinion that McCarthy is the guy for the job.\n\nPolitico Playbook reported Thursday that McCarthy's support issues is a case of déjà vu. Speaker John Boehner retired in 2015. McCarthy wanted the position then but saw his plans derailed by the House Freedom Caucus.\n\nIn the years since, McCarthy has tried to ingratiate himself with more conservative House members, such as Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan , but doubts about his leadership remain.\n\n\"We know there are a number of members who feel as we do, that Kevin McCarthy has not earned the right to lead, has not earned our vote,\" Virginia Rep. Bob Good, a member of the Freedom Caucus, told Politico.\n\nSpeaking Monday on Fox News , Arizona Rep. Andy Biggs, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, addressed the question of electing McCarthy as speaker.\n\n\"I would say maybe not so fast,\" Biggs said. \"Maybe we should have a good discussion within the confines of our internal body.\"\n\nBiggs expressed concerns McCarthy was not the leader needed to confront the excesses of the Biden administration.\n\n\"He's backpedaled on things like impeachment, and, in some ways, that indicates a willingness to be weakening the oversight authority that we need to have and the leverage points we need to have in order to deal with a Democrat president,\" the congressman said.\n\nRuss Vought, president of the Center for Renewing America, explained McCarthy's difficult position Thursday on Twitter.\n\nWith the narrow majority Republicans are likely to wind up with, it would not take many defectors to block McCarthy from winning the election for speaker, he said.\n\nKevin McCarthy is in serious trouble as a candidate for Speaker. Let me explain. ? 1/x\n\n- Russ Vought (@russvought) November 10, 2022\n\nHouse conservatives will not need a majority to prevail. They merely need to block & veto until they get an acceptable candidate.

Earlier today the chairman and ranking member of the House Oversight and Accountability Committee attended a briefing with the FBI to review documents pertaining to U.S. President Joe Biden's alleged acceptance of a bribe as vice president, from a foreign national. (Photo by Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images)\n\nSpeaker of the House Kevin McCarthy is facing stiff opposition to the latest spending bill and might have to risk his speakership by compromising with Democrats to get it passed, according to reports.\n\nThe California Republican had a rocky road to confirmation as speaker when he suffered 14 failed votes before finally winning a majority of his caucus to take the speaker's gavel in January.\n\nMcCarthy also has faced many calls to step down during his short time heading the lower chamber of Congress.\n\nBut the fight over the coming vote on the budget bill is shaping up as a particularly perilous time for the speaker, according to CNN .\n\nOne issue that has put McCarthy's position in jeopardy was the \"move to vacate\" provision he accepted to become the speaker. That rule allows a single Republican to bring a move to remove him from the speaker's chair, making him far less safe in the role than any previous occupant of the seat.\n\nNow, the conservatives in the House GOP caucus are saying the provision is very much on the table if McCarthy compromises too much with Democrats on the budget, according to CNN's Manu Raju and Melanie Zanona.\n\nRep. Mike Simpson of Idaho told the outlet that if McCarthy gives the Democrats and President Joe Biden too much in budget negotiations, the conservatives will bring the vacate motion to the floor.\n\n\"The challenge for McCarthy, and I'll be real honest with you, is that if he works with the Democrats, obviously, the Democrats are not going to do it for free,\" Simpson said. \"They want something. So, it's going to be a compromise - one of those really bad words in Washington for some reason. Then you're going to find a resolution introduced on the floor to vacate the chair.\"\n\nThe Associated Press also noted that McCarthy is facing stiff headwinds.\n\n\"The conservative opposition means McCarthy will almost certainly have to win significant Democratic support to pass a funding bill - but such an approach risks a new round of conflict with the same conservatives who in the past have threatened to oust him from the speakership,\" it reported Tuesday.\n\nMcCarthy urged the GOP caucus to back a short-term budget deal to avoid an Oct. 1 shutdown of the government so that he had more time to work out a long-term deal. He argued that voting for the short-term bill would give his caucus time to work out greater cuts in the three-year spending bill that will be prepared next.\n\nCNN reported the speaker, who has played the part of a budget hawk , told his members that the short-term bill would end up being a boon later, saying, \"It's a great place to have a very strong fight and to hold our ground.\"\n\nBut compounding the budget fight is McCarthy's reluctance to launch impeachment proceedings against President Joe Biden, an issue that some conservative members are very hot to push.\n\nThe speaker told Breitbart News on Friday that he won't start any such proceedings unless he knows he has a strong enough coalition to sustain it all.\n\n\"To open an impeachment inquiry is a serious matter, and House Republicans would not take it lightly or use it for political purposes,\" McCarthy said. \"The American people deserve to be heard on this matter through their elected representatives.\n\n\"That's why, if we move forward with an impeachment inquiry, it would occur through a vote on the floor of the People's House and not through a declaration by one person.\"\n\nA floor vote would require 218 votes to allow an impeachment inquiry to go forward. With 222 Republicans versus 212 Democrats , the GOP has a 10-member majority in the House.\n\nHowever, with around 20 \"moderate\" Republicans - some of whom were elected to districts that Biden won in 2020 - it seems McCarthy does not feel that he has a lock on the votes for impeachment, even though he has raised the issue himself several times.\n\nThe impeachment stalling and the budget fight are shaping up to be some tall hurdles for the speaker to jump.\n\nIf he succeeds in pushing through a budget bill with too many conservative measures, it is likely the Democrat-controlled Senate will reject it. McCarthy will then have a government shutdown on his hands.\n\nHowever, if he compromises too much with the Democrats on the budget, he'll face a revolt from conservatives and the \"move to vacate\" vote that could imperil his position as speaker.\n\nThis article appeared originally on The Western Journal .\n\nJoin Over 6M Subscribers\n\nWe're organizing an online community to elevate trusted voices on all sides so that you can be fully informed.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR\n\nLogin to your account below\n\nRemember Me\n\nPlease enter your username or email address to reset your password.\n\nCopyright © 2024 IJR"

The CEC is hiring lobbyists who formerly worked for President Donald Trump, House Speaker Mike Johnson and former Speaker Kevin McCarthy, and it will have a seven-figure budget at its disposal to try to convince Republicans to back policies long favored by greens and liberals.\n\n\"We need an approach that starts with promoting U.S. competitiveness. That has to be the central component to any U.S. climate policy,\" Greg Bertelsen, who will lead CEC, told Axios. \"We're leaving huge economic points on the board today, and we are risking ceding enormous economic opportunity in the future.\"\n\n\"Right now, we are focused on getting in front of the administration and members of Congress on both sides of the aisle,\" Bertelsen told the outlet. The CEC will get its funding from corporate contributors and other mission-aligned entities.\n\nTrump campaigned aggressively on rescinding the IRA, Biden's signature climate bill that some analysts project will cost approximately $4.7 trillion by 2050 if left in its current form.\n\nNotably, more than 20 House Republicans are lining up to try to save certain provisions of the law because their districts are poised to benefit from Biden's climate largesse.\n\nCEC will also push for \"trade penalties against high-CO2 imports,\" according to Axios, meaning that the group will be looking to get Republicans in the White House and on Capitol Hill to support de facto carbon tariffs.\n\nSome Republicans have previously supported the PROVE IT Act , a bill that commissions the federal government to study the carbon intensities of certain American products and competing products from other countries as a potential first step toward implementing a European-style carbon tariff. Proponents of the bill on the right side of the aisle have characterized it as a protectionist and tough-on-China measure, but its many critics fear that the federal government will eventually use any metric for assessing carbon intensity of American products inward in the form of carbon taxes once that metric is brought into existence.\n\nCEC did not respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "text": "McCarthy and Biden set to complete debt ceiling agreement on Sunday\n\nOAN's Brooke Mallory 10:48 AM - Sunday, May 28, 2023\n\nPresident Joe Biden and Speaker Kevin McCarthy will meet this afternoon on May 28 th to finalize the debt ceiling agreement, and then Republicans will release the legislative bill, according to House Democrat Leader Hakeem Jeffries who had informed his caucus of the news in a letter on Sunday.\n\nIn order to raise the debt ceiling and prevent a disastrous default, negotiators came to a preliminary deal on Saturday night. According to Jeffries (D-N.Y.), in his letter to Democrats, the legislative text of the plan will be drafted by Republicans and vetted by the Biden administration before it is finished.\n\nThe legislative bill verbiage will be disclosed by House Republicans and made available to the House, Senate, and American people immediately after Biden and McCarthy (R-Calif.) speak, Jeffries says. He also noted that the House Democratic Caucus would receive a briefing on the arrangement at around 5 p.m. from senior officials in the White House.\n\n\"It is my expectation that over the next several days, there will be multiple opportunities to review and discuss the legislation with the Biden administration in advance of any midweek vote scheduled by House Republicans,\" Jeffries wrote.\n\nMcCarthy had stated at a press conference on Sunday morning that he and Biden will discuss the bill's language to \"make sure both sides agree.\"\n\nAdditionally, he stated that the legislative text of the bill will be reportedly 150 pages or fewer, that the arrangement has the support of the majority of congressional leaders, and that 95% of GOP lawmakers are \"overwhelmingly excited\" about it.\n\n\"This is going to be transformational, where Congress is literally going to vote to spend less money this year than we spent last year,\" McCarthy maintained.\n\nThe tentative agreement was reached following weeks of negotiations led by Biden and McCarthy, and it is anticipated to increase the country's borrowing ability in exchange for spending reductions. Once the legislative text is complete, it must be approved by both the Democrat-run Senate and the GOP-led House.\n\nAccording to an insider source, it involves a two-year pact on appropriations and a two-year extension of the debt ceiling, effectively addressing the matter until after the 2024 election. The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) will have job requirements for recipients up to the age of 54, with the exception of homeless individuals and veterans. However, there will be \"no changes to Medicaid,\" the source insisted.\n\nWhen questioned about whether he has spoken with Senate leaders, McCarthy said during a press conference on Sunday that he has not yet spoken with Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), but that he did speak with Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) on Saturday night to \"walk him through\" the whole plan.\n\nIn a later conference call on Sunday, McCarthy said he intends to discuss the arrangement with Senate Republicans as well.\n\nOn Saturday night, the House Republican Conference started distributing an information sheet about the accord to its members and their offices under the name \"The Fiscal Responsibility Act.\"\n\n\"Republicans will restore fiscal sanity and hold Washington accountable,\" the memo said.\n\nThe deadline to act or risk exceeding the debt ceiling was extended last week to June 5 th by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Previously, she had been less explicit, stating that the United States might run out of money \"potentially as early as June 1 st .\"\n\nIn order to pay the nation's debts, the department has been reportedly resorting to \"extraordinary measures\" since January, when it had reached the statutory borrowing cap.\n\nA month ago @HouseGop passed a bill to rein in spending and responsibly raise the debt ceiling. Tonight, it's clear that @SpeakerMcCarthy has delivered on our promise to the American people and reached an agreement in principle to get America back to fiscal responsibility.\n\nStay informed!

Matt Gaetz Wins Primary Against Kevin McCarthy-Backed Challenger\n\nOAN Staff Blake Wolf 2:17 PM - Wednesday, August 21, 2024\n\nFlorida Representative Matt Gaetz  won his primary on Tuesday against challenger Aaron Dimmock, who garnered over $3 million dollars in support from a super PAC backed by former House Speaker, Kevin McCarthy.\n\nEight House Republicans voted to oust McCarthy (R-Calif.) from his position of House Speaker, in a move that McCarthy and his allies are still holding on to as they have financially supported the opposition candidates of the defectors.\n\nThose that voted with Democrats to oust McCarthy cited budget and spending disagreements, as well as accountability concerns, which they felt McCarthy was not holding the Biden administration accountable for.\n\nThe Florida Patriots PAC, a McCarthy ally, spent $3.5 million on advertisements against Gaetz (R-Fla.), but to no avail. The ads called Gaetz's character into question by focusing on an ongoing Ethics Committee investigation regarding allegations of sexual misconduct and drug usage.\n\nFiring back, Gaetz attacked Dimmock (R-Fla.), stating, \"Aaron Dimmock is a BLM supporting DEI instructor who qualified for office with a Missouri Drivers License and still works for Missouri Government. Even Kevin McCarthy's $3 million couldn't put enough lipstick on this pig.\"\n\nDespite the millions of dollars spent against Gaetz, he was still able to garner 72% of the votes in the race, steamrolling the challenger.\n\nAdditionally, Gaetz enjoyed a boost from a Donald Trump endorsement, which he took advantage of in an ad where the former president said that Gaetz is \"a very good person, and he's a very capable man. You ever watch this guy on television? Like a machine. He's great. He loves Florida, and he loves the country.\"\n\nFollowing the news of Gaetz's victory, Gaetz took to X (Twitter) to share a screenshot of Donald Trump congratulating his victory.\n\nThank you, President Trump! pic.twitter.com/4m50suM9QH\n\nIn a victory lap speech following the victory, Gaetz also antagonized McCarthy's vindictive advertising  spending tactics, even though it did not negatively affect Gaetz.\n\n\"It's traditional in moments like these, with margins of victory like this that you hear from your opponents and I have not yet heard from Aaron Dimmock or Kevin McCarthy this evening. Kevin McCarthy spent $3 million dollars in this race, not attacking my votes or my work on your behalf, but just simply trying to attack my character, $3 million dollars,\" Gaetz boasted. \"Two years ago, I got 70 percent of the vote, and tonight it looks like we're getting 73 percent of the vote. So Kevin if you're watching, spend a little more next time and we'll get to 80 [percent].\"\n\npic.twitter.com/0CTfKbHH99\n\nStay informed!

Matt Gaetz, who spearheaded the effort to oust former Speaker Kevin McCarthy from the top leadership position last week, said it would be \"absolutely\" worth it for him to lose his own seat in Congress.\n\n\"Absolutely,\" Gaetz (R-Fla.) said when NBC 's Kristen Welker asked him if the effort to oust McCarthy (R-Calif.) was worth it. \"Look, I am here to fight for my constituents. And I'm here to ensure that America is not on a path to financial ruin.\"\n\nGaetz played a key role in McCarthy's removal from the Speaker's position last week. However, some GOP representatives like Don Bacon (R-Neb.) have now called for his removal.\n\nGaetz had been threatening McCarthy for months, citing his arrangement with Democrats to prevent a government shutdown and due to McCarthy's advocacy of continuous funding for Ukraine.\n\n\"The reason Kevin McCarthy went down today is because nobody trusts Kevin McCarthy,\" said Gaetz after the vote.\n\nMcCarthy was the first Speaker in American history to be removed when eight Republicans, combined with the majority of Democrats, voted him out. Now, a House GOP meeting is reportedly scheduled to elect a new speaker this week.\n\nDespite the fact that McCarthy won the Speakership election in January after 15 rounds of voting over five days, Gaetz projected that the selection process would not take a week this time.\n\nHe also said that the idea suggested by some Republicans to have him removed from Congress was \"crazy,\" adding that he had received roughly 70% of the vote in his area to be elected.\n\n\"Not only do we have a clear replacement, we have two. We have two men who are incredibly respected,\" Gaetz responded, possibly referring to GOP Reps. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) and Steve Scalise (R-La.)\n\nHowever, Gaetz refrained from specifically naming or endorsing any candidate on Sunday.\n\nSince then, Jordan and Scalise have both expressed a willingness to take over as Speaker of the House, while McCarthy has insisted that he will no longer compete for the role.\n\nRep. Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.), who was appointed by McCarthy himself, is currently serving as the temporary Speaker of the House until a new speaker is named.\n\nThe fight is not over. Now we must elect a Speaker.\n\nStay informed! Receive breaking news blasts directly to your inbox for free.

Hardliners shuttered the House floor in days over the spending agreement but have since said they would accept it.\n\nMcCarthy was the first U.S. House speaker to be ejected from the chair. But he will become the third Republican speaker, after John Boehner and Paul Ryan, to leave Congress following repeated clashes with the Republican hard right.\n\nHe launched an impeachment inquiry into President Joe Biden, focused on Biden's son Hunter Biden's business dealings, which Democrats have denounced as politically motivated and unsubstantiated by evidence.\n\nMcCarthy won reelection in 2022 by a 35-point margin and his California district is not seen as competitive by the three main non-partisan election forecasters.\n\n(Reporting by David Morgan; editing by Scott Malone and Alistair Bell)\n\nPublished under: Kevin McCarthy\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "Renegade House Republicans Aren't Sorry Congress Has Ground to a Halt Amid Israeli War. Kevin McCarthy Has Words for Them.\n\nThe Republicans who voted to oust former House speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) have not expressed remorse for their actions, which have left Congress powerless to help Israel in its war against Hamas.\n\nNone of the eight Republican members of Congress who voted with Democrats last week to vacate the speakership responded to a Washington Free Beacon request for comment about whether they regret grinding the House of Representatives to a halt.\n\nThe ringleader of the effort, Rep. Matt Gaetz (R., Fla.) dodged questions in an interview on Sunday morning's Meet the Press, arguing that Israel has a \"qualitative military edge over everyone in the region\" and citing Secretary of State Antony Blinken's statement that the Biden Administration has assured Israel it will get the military aid it needs.\n\nThe House of Representatives has never voted to oust a speaker, leaving the body in uncharted territory. It is unclear whether a member, in particular Speaker Pro Tempore Patrick McHenry (R., N.C.), has the power to preside over the House for matters other than electing a permanent speaker.\n\nMcCarthy, however, is clear on what he would be doing were he still leading the House. In an interview with the Free Beacon , McCarthy said it's important that Congress speak with one voice right now-something it cannot do-and ensure Israel gets the military aid and munitions it needs. \"We'd do not just a resolution, but if there are resources needed, make sure anything is free flowing,\" McCarthy said.\n\nThe former speaker also defended his successful effort to keep the government open, arguing that the crisis in Congress would be compounded had the government shut down. \" You can't do anything. And not only stalled, it makes Republicans look weak. Remember, I turned something around in one day and kept government open. Think for one moment if government was closed today. You've got 30,000 American troops in the Middle East not knowing if they're going to get paid,\" he said.\n\nSources close to the House Republican Conference expressed concerns that even simple motions to bring legislation to the floor or condemn the attacks could result in legal challenges or be reversed with a simple majority vote.\n\nLawmakers are even struggling to determine how to brief lawmakers on the ongoing Hamas assault on Israel, which began early Saturday and has left at least 700 Israelis dead, and thousands more injured. The bloodshed in Israel is the worst since the Jewish state's founding 75 years ago. Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday declared that the nation is at war with Hamas, an Iran-backed Islamic terrorist group that operates out of Gaza. There is no evidence the conflict will subside anytime soon, as the Israeli military mobilizes in the face of ongoing Hamas attacks.\n\nFor the time being, Israel may largely have to mount its counter offensive without full U.S. support. McCarthy told Fox News on Saturday that \"there is nothing the House can do until they elect a speaker, and I don't know if that happens quickly.\"\n\nDemocrats, who went along with Gaetz's scheme to sow chaos in Congress, are in an awkward position as well. Appearing on CNN Sunday, House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.) said \"there will likely be a need for some additional appropriations\" to help Israel bolster its defense system. Jeffries, who instructed House Democrats to vote to remove McCarthy, was not asked about his role in preventing Congress from taking action.\n\nGaetz, who is said to be considering a run for governor in 2026, could see his electoral prospects plummet as Congress stalls on sending aid to Israel. Florida's Jewish population is the third highest in the country and a critical voting bloc in both Republican primaries and general elections. Gaetz said Saturday he is \"closely monitoring the terrorist attack by Hamas.\"\n\nRep. Mike Lawler (R., N.Y.), whose district includes a large Jewish population, slammed Gaetz and his allies on Sunday for their \"idiotic\" plot and called on the House to \"immediately reinstate McCarthy and stop screwing around.\"\n\nPublished under: Hakeem Jeffries , Hamas , House Democrats , Israel , Kevin McCarthy\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

Jared Moskowitz (D., Fla.) responded to Jones, \"I doubt your choice of religion to highlight here was coincidental.\"\n\nJones, who is running for a Republican-held seat that Democrats view as a major potential pickup, deleted his post and denied that it was intended as an attack on religious Jews.\n\n\"My point was to communicate that Kevin McCarthy, and by extension Mike Lawler, cannot possibly deliver for communities in Rockland because he's no longer speaker,\" he wrote .\n\n\"Regrettably, I did not make this point clear enough, and so I have deleted the tweet. I am proud of my record of combating antisemitism in Congress,\" he added.\n\nIn response, Gottheimer and Moskowitz also deleted their criticism of Jones.\n\nJones, who was first elected to Congress in 2021, left office last year after his district lines were redrawn. He is currently running for a seat which is now held by Republican representative Mike Lawler.\n\nDuring his career, Jones built a reputation as a far-left politician, backing the \"defund the police\" movement and allying with \"squad\" members such as Rep.

No clear successor has emerged.\n\nThe rebellion was led by Rep. Matt Gaetz, a hardline Republican from Florida and McCarthy antagonist who accused the party leader of not doing enough to cut federal spending.\n\nMcCarthy 's party controls the chamber by a narrow 221-212 majority, meaning that it can afford to lose no more than five votes if Democrats unite in opposition.\n\nThat happened on Tuesday, as eight Republicans voted with 208 Democrats to remove McCarthy from his post.\n\nIn debate on the House floor, Gaetz and a handful of allies criticized McCarthy for relying on Democratic votes to pass temporary funding that headed off a partial government shutdown.\n\n\"We need a speaker who will fight for something-anything-other than staying on as speaker,\" said Republican representative Bob Good.\n\nMcCarthy 's supporters, including some of the chamber's most vocal conservatives, said he had successfully limited spending and advanced other conservative priorities even though Democrats control the White House and the Senate. They warned their gains would be at risk if they removed their leader.\n\n\"Think long and hard before you plunge us into chaos, because that's where we're headed,\" said Republican representative Tom Cole.\n\nDemocrats said they would not help Republicans resolve their own problems. They broadly view McCarthy as untrustworthy after he broke an agreement on spending with President Joe Biden, and are angered by his decision to green-light an impeachment investigation of the president.\n\n\"Let them wallow in their pigsty of incompetence,\" Democratic representative Pramila Jayapal told reporters before the vote.\n\nGaetz was one of more than a dozen Republicans who repeatedly voted against McCarthy 's bid for speaker in January. McCarthy ultimately secured the gavel after 15 rounds of voting. In order to win the job, McCarthy agreed to rules that made it easier to challenge his leadership.\n\nMcCarthy supporters have said Gaetz was motivated by a hunger for publicity, a chance to win higher office, or resentment over an ongoing ethics probe into possible sexual misconduct and illicit drug use. Representative Garret Graves pointed out that he has been fundraising off his effort to oust McCarthy . \"It's disgusting,\" he said.\n\nGaetz has denied wrongdoing and said he is not motivated by a dislike of McCarthy .\n\n\"This isn't a critique of the individual-it's a critique of the job. The job hasn't been done,\" Gaetz said.\n\n(Reporting by Makini Brice, David Morgan, Richard Cowan, Nandita Bose, Moira Warburton, Susan Heavey, and Doina Chiacu; writing by Andy Sullivan; editing by Jonathan Oatis, Alistair Bell, and Howard Goller)\n\nPublished under: House of Representatives , Kevin McCarthy , Matt Gaetz\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "EXCLUSIVE: McCarthy Blocks Rashida Tlaib's Anti-Semitic Congressional Event\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy moved on Tuesday evening to block Michigan's Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib from hosting an anti-Semitic congressional event planned for Wednesday, the speaker's office confirmed to the Washington Free Beacon.\n\nMcCarthy told the Free Beacon that he intervened late Tuesday to reserve the Capitol Visitor Center space where Tlaib was set to host a Wednesday event to mourn Israel's founding as a \"catastrophe.'  In its place, the speaker will lead a bipartisan briefing celebrating the 75th anniversary of the U.S.-Israel relationship.\n\n\"It's wrong for members of Congress to traffic in anti-Semitic tropes about Israel,\" McCarthy told the Free Beacon . \"As long as I'm Speaker, we are going to support Israel's right to self-determination and self-defense, unequivocally and in a bipartisan fashion.\"\n\nThe anti-Semitic 'Squad' member came under fire this week after the Free Beacon reported that she would host the event alongside an array of anti-Israel groups, including some that have defended terrorism. Tlaib's event was meant to celebrate the \"Nakba,\" a Palestinian term for the creation of Israel that loosely translates as \"catastrophe.\"\n\nIt is unclear how Tlaib and her supporters will move forward with the event now that McCarthy has occupied their meeting space. Tlaib, or another member, could potentially attempt to reschedule the event for a later date.\n\nMcCarthy's intervention comes on the heels of a letter sent Tuesday evening by a rabbinical group asking leaders in the House and Senate to condemn Tlaib's event.\n\n\"It is unsurprising but appalling that the featured speaker at this event will be a Member of Congress who describes the only Middle Eastern country to give equality and voting rights to both Jews and Arabs as 'apartheid,'\" the Coalition for Jewish Values, a pro-Israel advocacy organization comprised of more than 2,000 rabbis, wrote in the letter, a copy of which was obtained by the Free Beacon. \"We hope that our request will meet with your favorable response, and that you will condemn this event in the strongest terms as soon as possible.\"\n\nTlaib was scheduled to headline the anti-Israel event with several organizations that support the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement, an anti-Semitic effort to wage economic war on Israel. They include Jewish Voice for Peace, a \"radical anti-Israel activist group \" that pushes the anti-Semitic Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement and has come under fire for glorifying Palestinian terrorism. Other organizers include Emgage Action, another BDS supporter that claims Israel is an \"apartheid state,\" and Americans for Justice in Palestine Action, an advocacy group that claims Jewish money is infecting politics.\n\nThe invitation for Wednesday's event accuses \"Zionist militias\" of violently expelling Palestinians from the region when Israel was created in 1948, and maintains that Israel continues to brutalize Palestinians.\n\n\"May 15th marks 75 years since the beginning of the Nakba, which means 'catastrophe,'\" the invitation reads. \"Seventy-five years ago, Zionist militias and the new Israeli military violently expelled approximately three-quarters of all Palestinians from their homes and homeland in what became the state of Israel.\"\n\nSpeakers aimed to \"uplift the experiences of Palestinians who underwent the Nakba, and educate members of Congress and their staff about this history and the ongoing Nakba to which Israel continues to subject Palestinians,\" according to the invitation.\n\nNakba ceremonies have long promoted anti-Israel attitudes and descended \"into expressions of support for terror groups or attacks against Israelis,\" according to the Anti-Defamation League.\n\nSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the letter. Tlaib's office did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nLiora Rez, executive director of the pro-Israel watchdog StopAntiSemitism, praised McCarthy's action, saying he prevented Tlaib's \"ongoing vilification campaigns against the world's only Jewish nation.\"\n\n\"Congresswoman Tlaib,\" Rez said, \"appears to forget she was elected to represent Michigan's 12th district, not Gaza or Ramallah.\"\n\nPublished under: Anti-Semitism , BDS , Israel , Kevin McCarthy , Rashida Tlaib , The Squad\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "The Secret to McCarthy's Success\n\nHouse Speaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) notched a victory for himself and for Republicans with Wednesday's passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Act of 2023 . The bill will raise the debt ceiling through 2025, claw back pandemic and IRS spending, improve welfare programs, speed up permitting, reinstate student loan payments, and cut non-defense discretionary spending. The bill also has an enforcement mechanism: If Congress fails to pass the required appropriations bills by January 1, overall discretionary spending will be cut by 1 percent.\n\nThe legislation doesn't restore fiscal sanity to the federal budget-only changes to Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid would do that-but it is a step in the right direction. Since becoming speaker in January, McCarthy has faced a test: Could he strike a fiscal bargain with President Biden that would earn Republican support and avoid a breach of the debt ceiling and a government shutdown? Well, the grade is in. He aced the exam.\n\nConsider where the parties started. Biden spent much of this year demanding that Congress raise the debt ceiling without preconditions. He refused to negotiate with McCarthy. At one point the White House floated the idea of tax increases. The speaker, by contrast, said that he was willing to work with the president to raise the debt ceiling in exchange for cuts.\n\nNow look at where the two sides ended up: The Fiscal Responsibility Act is much closer to McCarthy's original position than it is to Biden's. It doesn't hike taxes. It reduces spending. It contains measures the Left can't stand. The public supports the deal by a two-to-one margin . Most Republicans and Democrats voted for it.\n\nThe media, as usual, highlight McCarthy's internal critics. They are a distraction. The press is so obsessed with Republican infighting that it overlooks the real story: Kevin McCarthy is shaping up to be the most effective House GOP leader in decades. Biden, the Democrats, and the liberal culture have been unable to transform him into a bogeyman. To the contrary: His net approval rating has risen by double digits since January . Biden's numbers have dropped . Nor is McCarthy's favorability the result of playing to the media crowd and appeasing the Left. The Fiscal Responsibility Act is the latest piece of significant center-right legislation that the House has passed this year.\n\nWhat, then, is McCarthy's secret? He succeeds because it pays to be underestimated . He's not the first Republican to surprise a Beltway media that holds him in low regard. The rap on McCarthy has long been that he's an amiable politician with no ideological core. This lack of substance was exposed, according to conventional wisdom, by the disappointing outcome of last year's midterm election. The same conventional wisdom took as a sign of weakness the unprecedented concessions McCarthy made to the House Freedom Caucus to end the agonizing, 4-day, 15-ballot vote for speaker in January .\n\nAll these assumptions were wrong. McCarthy's amiability and flexibility are not liabilities but assets. The narrow Republican majority hasn't stopped the House from moving bills on the floor. Nor have McCarthy's concessions to the Freedom Caucus hindered him. Putting Freedom Caucus members on the important Rules Committee gave figures such as Rep. Thomas Massie (R., Ky.) a stake in the legislative process. And the lowered threshold to remove the speaker is meaningless if a substitute is not waiting offstage.\n\nMcCarthy's superpower is his desire to be speaker. He likes and wants his job-a rarity for the GOP. He's the first public-facing Republican speaker since 1994 to be in sync with both his office and his conference. The talents that aided Newt Gingrich in his quest to build the first GOP House majority in 40 years did not necessarily translate to the speaker's office. Gingrich is a revolutionary, not an institutionalist. He's more interested in figuring out how America can ride the Third Wave into a technological utopia than in legislative detail and intra-party bargaining. His record of welfare reform and balanced budgets was impressive, but his tenure was chaotic.\n\nGingrich's successor, the disgraced Denny Hastert, avoided the limelight. President George W. Bush's compassionate conservatism and Freedom Agenda overshadowed Hastert, who delegated most of his authority to Tom \"the Hammer\" DeLay. By the time DeLay resigned over scandal in 2006, the Republican House majority was on the verge of collapse. Democrats took over Congress soon after. It fell to John Boehner to pick up the pieces.\n\nBoehner became speaker in 2010, thanks in part to McCarthy's recruiting skills. The problem was that Boehner belonged to a different political era. He was a product of the 1990s and the early 2000s whose party was increasingly shaped by the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis, bank and auto bailouts, and Barack Obama's \"New Foundation\" for America. Boehner hated living in \" Crazytown ,\" and it showed. The Tea Party Republicans didn't care for him either. The mismatch made Boehner miserable. As soon as he brought Pope Francis to Capitol Hill, he left .\n\nThe next Republican speaker, Paul Ryan, had the title forced on him. Ryan is a supply-sider and wonk. He understands dollars and cents. He's a protégé of Jack Kemp who felt out of place in Donald Trump's Washington. His main priority was the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act . Once it had Trump's signature, Ryan was ready to leave. Democrats won the House the following year. Ryan was out.\n\nMcCarthy, unlike his predecessors, has no earth-shattering plans. Holding the speaker's gavel is enough. He doesn't shy away from the camera. He doesn't represent a faction of the GOP; he tries to enact the party consensus. He isn't at war with Tea Party (now MAGA) conservatives. He wants to be on the rostrum. He alone commands majority support.\n\nMaybe McCarthy will lose his touch in upcoming fights over assistance to Ukraine. Maybe one day an alternative to McCarthy will emerge, someone who can unify the Freedom Caucus along with the rest of the GOP conference. Maybe Democrats will take back the House next year. For the moment, at least, Kevin McCarthy is the rare Republican who both understands and is satisfied by the role he's been given and the responsibilities it entails. He wants nothing more nor less. And he's winning.\n\nPublished under: Congress , Debt Ceiling , Feature , House of Representatives , Joe Biden , John Boehner , Kevin McCarthy , Newt Gingrich , Paul Ryan , Republican Party , Republicans\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "The Underestimated Kevin McCarthy\n\nSpeaker Kevin McCarthy (R., Calif.) wasn't going to let the moment go unnoticed. It was April 26, and the House of Representatives had just passed, by a vote of 217 to 215, the Limit, Save, Grow Act of 2023. The bill would raise the debt ceiling, return discretionary spending to fiscal year 2022 levels, repeal much of last year's Inflation Reduction Act, speed up infrastructure permitting, cancel President Joe Biden's student loan amnesty, and apply work requirements to Medicaid and food stamps. The legislation is dead on arrival in the Democratic-controlled Senate. Yet plenty of Washingtonians doubted that it would ever leave the House.\n\nMcCarthy had beaten expectations. Again. And he wanted to let the world know it. \"Every question you continue to raise,\" he told the media, \"you guys have been wrong. You've underestimated us.\"\n\nMany people have. Conventional wisdom is set against McCarthy, who presides over a 222-213 Republican majority and can afford to lose only four votes on a given bill or resolution. His bid for speaker appeared doomed right up until the moment that he won the office on the 15th ballot . Press coverage focuses almost entirely on divisions within the GOP conference, leading to a sense of surprise in the Beltway whenever the House comes together to rescind funding for additional IRS agents , incentivize oil and gas exploration and production , repeal onerous environmental and financial regulations, broaden parental rights in education , and hike the debt limit .\n\nMeanwhile, the Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party is off to a strong and bipartisan start. Rep. Jim Jordan's (R., Ohio) Judiciary Committee won its fight with Manhattan district attorney Alvin Bragg. Rep. James Comer's (R., Ky.) Oversight Committee is building its case against Biden family influence peddling. Compared with past Congresses, the legislative and investigative process under McCarthy may be slow and unpredictable. But they are working.\n\nIndeed, on two occasions Speaker McCarthy has outplayed Biden and the Democrats. In February the House voted 250-173 to overturn D.C.'s incorrigible criminal justice reform. The next month, the resolution passed the Senate and Biden signed it into law. Also in February, the House voted 229-197 to end the national COVID emergency. And again, the next month, the resolution passed the Senate and Biden signed it into law. House Democrats were outraged that Biden ultimately sided with these House Republican initiatives. But the politics were on McCarthy's side. And the same was the case last year, when then-minority leader McCarthy forced an end to the military's COVID vaccine mandate .\n\nThe Limit, Save, Grow Act may not become law, but it holds symbolic value for the speaker. For months, McCarthy has wanted to enter negotiations with Biden on raising the debt ceiling. The president has refused. McCarthy wants to follow the precedent of earlier GOP Houses and leverage a debt ceiling raise for spending cuts and budget reforms. Biden doesn't want to play that game. The standoff persists. Default on U.S. government obligations draws near.\n\nMcCarthy understands that his negotiating position will improve if House Republicans appear to be doing what they can to avoid default. He wants Biden, not his conference, to look obdurate and uninterested in the potential economic fallout. Two weeks ago, McCarthy traveled to the New York Stock Exchange and pledged that the House would vote on a bill that raised the debt limit while reducing spending. It did. By demonstrating unity and seriousness of purpose, House Republicans have put the ball in Biden's court. And congressional Democrats from swing districts and battleground states-who are given to low-level political anxiety on the best of days-will tell the White House that talks with McCarthy may well be in order.\n\nThe situation could have been much worse for Republicans. If the Limit, Save, Grow Act had failed, then the GOP would have been in disarray, McCarthy would have looked hapless, Biden would have been able to tell Democrats that his strategy is working, and pressure would build on Senate leaders Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.) and Mitch McConnell (R., Ky.) to figure out a compromise. McCarthy avoided that scenario. How? By following the method that won him the speakership.\n\nCall it \"concede to lead.\" To become speaker, McCarthy gave the House Freedom Caucus enormous influence over committees, floor activity, and the legislative calendar. By drawing the Freedom Caucus into the inner circle-and by giving its members seats on the prestigious Rules Committee-McCarthy turned outsiders into insiders. His conservative outreach delivered results when outside groups normally opposed to GOP leadership, such as Heritage Action and the Center for Renewing America, came onboard the Limit, Save, Grow Act.\n\nSimilarly, when Republican members from corn states demanded that ethanol subsidies remain untouched in the debt ceiling bill, McCarthy agreed with them. And when conservatives wanted more stringent work requirements, he said yes again. McCarthy knows that the bill won't become law. There's little cost in such concessions. He's willing to accommodate practically everyone, so long as it helps him attain his desired end. In January, his goal was becoming speaker. This week, it was passing Limit, Save, Grow. McCarthy is practicing a Republican form of diversity, equity, and inclusion that encompasses the moderates in the New York delegation, conservatives from Texas, and Marjorie Taylor Greene (R., Ga.).\n\nSuccess is far from assured. The Limit, Save, Grow Act is an opening gambit, not part of the endgame. No number of concessions may be enough to persuade 218 Republicans to back a deal this summer that lifts the debt ceiling for a few budget victories but not much else. Some in the GOP may want to see just how much a default would really hurt.\n\nRight now, though, Speaker McCarthy can enjoy another win. Don't underestimate him again.\n\nPublished under: Debt Ceiling , Feature , House of Representatives , Kevin McCarthy , Republicans\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"

      "text": "McCarthy Threatens Impeachment of Biden's Homeland Security Chief\n\nBy Gram Slattery and Ted Hesson\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters)-The top Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, Kevin McCarthy, on Tuesday called on Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas to step down, warning that the House may try to impeach him when Republicans take the majority next year.\n\nMcCarthy, who hopes to be elected as House Speaker when the new Congress is sworn in in January, added that his colleagues will hold congressional hearings at the U.S.-Mexico border after taking control of the chamber, in what he described as an effort to force Democrats to see conditions there first-hand.\n\nRepublicans have criticized President Joe Biden for record numbers of migrants caught crossing the U.S.-Mexico border during his presidency, saying Biden's more lenient policies have encouraged more crossers.\n\n\"Our country may never recover from Secretary Mayorkas' dereliction of duty,\" McCarthy told reporters in El Paso, Texas, on Tuesday after speaking with border officials. \"This is why today, I am calling on the secretary to resign.\"\n\n\"If Secretary Mayorkas does not resign, House Republicans will investigate every order, every action and every failure (to) determine whether we can begin (an) impeachment inquiry,\" he said.\n\nDHS spokesperson Marsha Espinosa rejected McCarthy's call.\n\n\"Secretary Mayorkas is proud to advance the noble mission of this Department, support its extraordinary workforce, and serve the American people,\" Espinosa said. \"He has no plans to resign.\"\n\nSince winning a narrow House majority in this month's midterm elections, Republicans have held a series of news conferences to lay out their priorities for the next two years. Last week they warned that Biden, a Democrat, and his son, Hunter, will also be top targets.\n\nDemocrats will continue to hold a majority in the Senate for the next two years. While the House has the power to launch impeachment inquiries, only the Senate can convict an impeachment target, and it is unlikely that senators from Biden's party would join in ousting a member of his administration from office.\n\nRepublicans on the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee sent Mayorkas a letter last week, notifying him that the panel expects to call for testimony from 11 employees of the Department of Homeland Security including Mayorkas himself.\n\nAs Biden's top border official, Mayorkas, 62, has been a frequent target of Republican lawmakers, including some who have previously called for his resignation and impeachment.\n\nHe became the first Latino and foreign-born Homeland Security chief when he was confirmed to the role in February 2021. He previously served as deputy secretary of the department during the administration of former President Barack Obama.\n\nBiden officials say increased migration is a hemispheric phenomenon that stretches beyond the U.S.-Mexico border and that they are trying to create a more orderly immigration system.\n\nA U.S. federal judge ruled last week that a pandemic-era order blocking migrants at the border was unlawful while delaying its termination until Dec. 21. However, a group of states with Republican attorneys general moved late on Monday to intervene in the case and overturn the ruling.\n\nChris Magnus, former commissioner of U.S. Customs and Border Protection, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security, resigned earlier this month after saying he was pressured by Mayorkas to resign or be fired.\n\n(Reporting by Gram Slattery and Ted Hesson in Washington; Additional reporting by David Morgan in Washington; Editing by Scott Malone and Matthew Lewis)\n\n2025 All Rights Reserved"
